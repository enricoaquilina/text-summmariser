<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="10"> For Cathy Rigby, it took a lot of growing up to play the boy who wouldn't grow up.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="11"> The 5-foot, 90-odd-pound blond marvel on the balance beam, whom America fell in love with during the 1968 and '72 Olympics, spent nearly 12 years battling bulimia -- an eating disorder in which she binged on food, then used laxatives or self-induced vomiting to keep her weight down.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="12"> She also weathered a divorce from former professional football player Tommy Mason, father of her two oldest children, Buck, 13, and Ryan, 9.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="13"> Rigby never won an Olympic medal, but she won a dozen in international competitions between the Mexico City and Munich Games.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="14"> At 36, and a still-tiny 100 pounds after recovering from bulimia, Rigby is married to Tom McCoy, president of their joint production company, with whom she also has two children: Theresa, 6, and Kaitlin, 3.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="15"> Today, Rigby lectures about eating disorders.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="16"> She also throws the same passion into theater that she once gave to gymnastics.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="17"> When she makes her San Diego debut in Starlight Musical Theatre's "Peter Pan" at the Civic Theatre tonight through June 4, it will mark 15 years since she first tackled the part for NBC Entertainment in Sacramento.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="18"> Rigby soared there, but only physically.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="19"> The production used voice-overs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="20"> Intent on a stage career, Rigby took singing lessons during those 15 years, and was rewarded with another shot at "Peter Pan" at the Long Beach Civic Light Opera Assn. in 1986.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="21"> Robert Koehler of The Times compared her favorably with the most famous actresses in the role, Mary Martin and Sandy Duncan.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="22"> Rigby has also played in "Meet Me in Saint Louis" and "Paint Your Wagon" and was lavishly reviewed for her work as Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz" two years ago at the Terrace Theatre in Los Angeles.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="23"> But Peter Pan is Rigby's favorite role, and she and her husband plan to take the show on a 29-city tour.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="24"> They are booked at the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles next May and they have their "fingers crossed for Broadway," Rigby said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="25"> "It's one of those shows that is perfect for me," Rigby said on a rehearsal break in Balboa Park.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="26"> "The singing is perfect for the kind of voice I have.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="27"> Having the athletic and gymnastic background makes it easier for me.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="28"> And, because I'm so small, I look like one of the lost boys".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="29"> Still, though her athletic background is definitely a plus in a role she equates with "running a 440 and singing with a vise around you" (the vise refers to the flying harness she wears for the part), she does not want to be known as the Olympic Peter Pan.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="30"> "It's tough being an athlete walking in, even though I have done it for the last 15 years," she said.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="31"> "I do a handstand here and there if it comes naturally.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="32"> But I don't want people to think, 'This is Cathy Rigby, so we'll all have some gymnastics now'. "</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="33"> What Rigby likes best about Peter Pan is his confidence -- a quality that took her years to develop.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="34"> One of the most telling connections between her athletic and dramatic careers is the way each has cracked and finally released her from the timid shell she had as a child.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="35"> "I was one of the shyest people in high school," Rigby recalled.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="36"> "If anyone had asked me to sing, I would have turned away and cried, I would have been so embarrassed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="37"> "But I did have confidence in gymnastics.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="38">. . . I learned that you might fall on your backside, but then you</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="39"> get up.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="40"> You make a commitment and you go through with it.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="41"> You may not be great at first, but you get through it, and then you get better".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="42"> But confidence in gymnastics did not always carry over to the rest of her life.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="43"> One thing Rigby said she had to learn was that, although striving for perfection in gymnastics might lead to success, striving for perfection in life was more likely to lead to disaster.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="44"> "I was still very shy until I made a life change and met my current husband," Rigby said.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="45"> "I thought that (with) every bad move I made in life, people might be taking points off of me, just like in gymnastics.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="46"> I never learned to express feelings and didn't even know what my feelings were.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="47"> I was the image of Cathy Rigby who never had an opinion of her own, just what was given to her.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="48"> "Then my husband said (that) as an actress you will never grow if you never take chances.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="49"> He said it's OK to be human and to make mistakes.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="50"> That's the only way you will build strength".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="51"> She smiled.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="52"> "It only took me 10 years to understand that.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="53"> I was fortunate".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="54"> Does she miss athletic competition?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="55"> She shook her head vigorously.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="56"> "This is a lot more fun than the Olympics," she said.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="57"> "When you get an opportunity once every four years to prove yourself, and you have to do what you can on this 4-inch piece of apparatus, it is pressured, it's exciting, it's anxious and there's a sigh of relief when it's over, especially if you've done well.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="58"> "I try to make the show as perfect as I can, but here it's not about being perfect as gymnastics is.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="59"> It's about reaching out to the audience and holding them in the palm of your hand.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="60"> You're trying to have a good time with it.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="61"> "The closest parallel to the Olympics is opening night, because you have the critics there and you're self-critical instead of just letting go".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="62"> Still, she said, she is not worried about this particular opening night.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="63"> "I feel confident now.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="64"> I've done this too many times not to feel confident.</s>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="65"> I know that sounds like Peter Pan saying, 'I'm pleased with myself,' but I've just gotten to that point where I know what the reaction will be".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="66"> Rigby hesitated for just a moment, her brown eyes blinking as if unsure whether she should apologize for being so pleased with herself.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA052589-0150" num="67"> "I love that feeling," she said, breaking into a grin, and looking like Peter Pan.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="8"> Hands-off parenting at the dinner table is currently being promoted by some dietitians.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="9"> The thinking is that restrictive diets, or those that pressure youngsters into eating healthy foods, can interfere with a child's innate capacity to regulate calorie consumption.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="10"> Later in life, this usually results in a preference for high-fat foods, which have been linked to diseases such as heart disease and cancer.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="11"> But there are plenty of experts who still believe hands-on parental intervention is vital.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="12"> "I think it's the parents' responsibility to put the child on the correct eating track," says Gail Frank, a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Assn. and a Cal State University professor of nutrition.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="13"> "This (early direction) forms the basis for the child's taste buds and the child's perception of what an OK or non-OK eating behavior is".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="14"> After all, as Frank points out, kids don't live in an isolated environment in which only nutritious foods will be offered, and they aren't always going to be under a parent's guidance.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="15"> But others feel that parental pressure to eat certain kinds of food can do more nutritional harm than good.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="16"> "Rewarding kids for cleaning their plates or pressuring them into eating foods parents believe are nutritionally vital can be a problem," says Leann Lipps Birch, Ph.D, a University of Illinois professor of human development and nutrition sciences.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="17"> "When you focus the child on cleaning his or her plate, you limit the child's ability to use hunger and satiety to control eating, (and inadvertently) contribute to the development of eating disorders and obesity later in life".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="18"> Ellyn Satter, a registered dietitian specializing in children's feeding and eating, agrees.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="19"> Force feeding of foods with a perceived benefit, she says, can lead to finickiness, poor growth and battles about food in the short term, and more serious health problems in adulthood.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="20"> "Children are capable of regulating their food intake," Satter says.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="21"> "They have a wisdom greater than ours about what is good for them and what they need to grow properly.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="22"> If you present them with a variety of food, they are cabable of picking and choosing and learning to like a nutritionally adequate diet".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="23"> Satter and Birch base their hands-off philosophy on infant research done in the '20s and '30s by a pediatrician named Clara Davis.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="24"> She found that kids, up to about age 4 1/2, will eat the right food combinations for good health and sufficient growth -- if left to follow their own cravings.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="25"> She did admit, though, that her data was based on an "artificial environment".</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="26"> Getting kids to choose a nutritionally adequate diet was dependent upon the parent offering only foods of high nutrient value.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="27"> Adding sweets would change the results.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="28"> Although there's been no research with older children, Birch believes that the mechanism could be retained as the child ages if parents wouldn't interfere with the process.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="29"> "Given the chance to select from among an array of healthful foods," Birch says, "children can naturally choose the combinations of foods in amounts consistent with adequate nutrition.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="30"> (Of course), first they must have access to those foods".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="31"> However, Dr. Ronald Kleinman, associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Nutrition, questions the existence of this inherent knack to control caloric intake.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="32"> "I honestly don't know if (children) have an innate ability to chose healthy food or not," Kleinman says.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="33"> "And, I'm not sure that it's terribly important to know.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="34"> There are so many other influences on what a youngster eats that an innate ability may not be able to exercise itself".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="35"> Both Kleinman and the ADA's Frank point to advertisements and peer pressure from siblings and friends that strongly affect what kids eat.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="36"> Unlike infants, who eat whatever they are given, older children choose what they eat according to the outside cues around them.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="37"> "There is enough evidence that the ability is there early on," Birch insists.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="38"> "It just gets socialized out.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="39"> Parents basically teach kids to ignore internal cues".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="40"> She and Satter believe that overambitious parental intervention -- usually in the form of pressure to eat fewer foods with fat and cholesterol and more foods with a perceived health benefit, attaches a negative quality to the good-for-you foods.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="41"> Food in the "bad-for-you" category, typically are sweet items, serve as pacifiers and treats.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="42"> This, Birch says, sets up an uncontrollable preference for forbidden food, and a dislike for "health" food.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="43"> Eventually the sweet is associated with satisfaction in the child's mind.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="44"> He or she grows up trying to avoid the prohibited food and adulthood binging and other eating disorders are the result.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="45"> "You want kids to eat things that are good for them so you say, 'OK, eat your broccoli, Johnny, and then I'll give you some chocolate ice cream'.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="46"> It works really well," Birch says, "but kids learn to like ice cream even more than they did before.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="47"> "Yes, kids like sweets," Birch admits, "but there are some other things that are going on that I think tend to potentiate our liking to sweetness.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="48"> They are desserts -- they come as rewards for having eaten the other things on your plate.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="49"> And they tend to be associated within a holiday context".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="50"> Rather than an emphasis on "good" and "bad" food, Satter and Birch suggest that parents offer children a wide assortment of wholesome foods selected from among the Four Food Groups: low-fat dairy products, meat and meat alternatives, fruits and vegetables and whole grain breads and cereals.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="51"> Satter recommends a division of responsibility between children and parents when it comes to mealtime.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="52"> The parent should be responsible for what the child is offered to eat and the child for whether and how much of it they eat.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="53"> Kleinman tends to agree with Satter and Birch that overly strict early diet rules aren't necessary, and that providing a balanced diet from a variety of wholesome sources is valid.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="54"> But, he says, simply supplying these wholesome sources is not the best approach to eliminating eating disorders and chronic disease in adults.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="55"> "The notion that you have to stay within a range (of foods) isn't one worth promoting," he says.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="56"> It doesn't teach the child to interact in a realistic environment.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="57"> "These ('bad') foods are out there," he says, "and there's no reason why they shouldn't be in the home".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="58"> "What is important is that there is a wide tolerance for food in terms of what will permit a youngster to grow and what won't," he says.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="59"> "Some have diets, for example, that are exceedingly rich in protein, more than 15%, or (on the other hand) less than 7%, and in both cases youngsters may grow reasonably well".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="60"> Kleinman's advice is to expose children to both high- and low-fat foods -- especially sweets -- within a balanced diet.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="61"> "It's hard to find any convincing evidence that anyone eating a candy bar is doing themselves any harm, provided they have vitamins, iron and protein in the diet," he says.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="62"> Gail Frank suggests that parents serve as role models -- not supervisors.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="63"> Adults should avoid giving mixed signals and practice moderation too.</s>

<s docid="LA062890-0066" num="64"> They should not provide a negative impression for the child.</s>

<s docid="LA082189-0039" num="9"> An addiction to opiates produced by the brain while dieting may be the cause of anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder in which patients starve themselves, sometimes to death, Michigan researchers said last week.</s>

<s docid="LA082189-0039" num="10"> The scientists say their research, presented at the 40th annual meeting of the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, suggested anorexics may have "abnormal biological responses" to diet-triggered opiates.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082189-0039" num="11"> Typically these opiates, called endorphins, produce a "high" and an increased appetite.</s>

<s docid="LA082189-0039" num="12"> But in anorexia patients, those effects may be out of balance, so hunger is overridden by the euphoria, said Wayne State University pharmacologist Mary Ann Marrazzi.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082189-0039" num="13"> In their study, the researchers discovered that some mice demonstrated decreased appetite and increased activity when given morphine, an opiate.</s>

<s docid="LA082189-0039" num="14"> If a person responded similarly to their own opiates, released during dieting, it would mimic the behavior of anorexia nervosa patients, she said.</s>

<s docid="LA101189-0084" num="14"> She suffered from bulimia, an eating disorder found primarily in younger women who see themselves as overweight, or likely to become overweight.</s>

<s docid="LA101189-0084" num="15"> Those so afflicted commonly ingest large quantities of food, then make themselves vomit in order to remain thin.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101189-0084" num="16"> Johnson said her problems stemmed from the perception she had of herself while growing up.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101189-0084" num="17"> "She wanted to be Miss America at one time but she was too short," said Pomona Coach Brian Wiesner, who wrote the thesis for his master's degree on eating disorders in female athletes.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101189-0084" num="18"> For as long as she could remember, Johnson said, she had been concerned about her weight, although it was not until after graduating from Corona High School that signs of the disorder first surfaced.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA101189-0084" num="19"> "It was probably between my senior year in high school and my freshman year in college, but I wouldn't really call it bulimia," she said.</s>

<s docid="LA101189-0084" num="21"> In my fall semester and freshman season, I didn't really start throwing up.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA101189-0084" num="25"> "I would just try to please my friends by eating a meal and then I would go to the nearest bathroom and purge it all after I ate," she said.</s>

<s docid="LA101189-0084" num="37"> It was toward the end of the spring quarter that Wiesner and school trainers finally confronted Johnson with the evidence.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA101189-0084" num="38"> Shortly afterward, Johnson agreed to meet with Gayle Ashabraner, then a nutritional counselor at the school's health center, who put Johnson on a diet.</s>

<s docid="LA101189-0084" num="46"> "I would have a chart and I'd have to write it down with an asterisk if I purged," she said.</s>

<s docid="LA120589-0013" num="9"> Question: When it comes to eating disorders, I don't see why the patients are almost always women and seldom men.</s>

<s docid="LA120589-0013" num="10"> What can there possibly be about food that would make women more likely to have a problem with it than men?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120589-0013" num="11"> Answer: A number of men may undergo strenuous dieting for sports-related reasons, but this unusual concern does not bring them to the attention of a physician in the same fashion that women would be if they also were extremely concerned about their weight.</s>

<s docid="LA120589-0013" num="12"> For example, young men who participate in wrestling often show a yo-yo pattern of dieting, alternating weight loss with weight gain.</s>

<s docid="LA120589-0013" num="13"> This can have harmful effects, but the individual involved does not seek medical attention.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA120589-0013" num="14"> Another reason for the apparent disparity in the incidence of eating disorders between men and women is that symptoms that may identify women as having an eating disorder do not apply to men.</s>

<s docid="LA120589-0013" num="15"> For example, cessation of menstruation, which helps diagnose an eating disorder in women, cannot be used to diagnose an eating disorder in men.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="15"> "Too often the emphasis is on the pocketbook not the paunch," she told a subcommittee of the House Committee on Small Business.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="16"> Because the $33 billion-a-year weight-loss industry is largely unregulated, it has operated like an untamed, runaway horse for decades and accountability, the critics believe, is long overdue.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="17"> "The issue with quick weight-loss diet programs is that they are acting on response to market demand," said Marsha Hudnall, a registered dietitian interviewed at an American Dietetic Assn. conference in Los Angeles recently.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="18"> "There is a professional responsibility to design (diet) strategies based on scientific evidence.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="19"> According to the guidelines of the American Dietetic Assn., ideal weight is based on 10 calories per pound of current weight, which means that a person weighing 150 pounds should consume a total of 1,500 calories a day.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="20"> Many of these programs are much lower than that with calorie levels anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 calories and some popular liquid diets are even lower, with 400 to 800 calories a day," Hudnall said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="21"> Wellman thinks that very low calorie diets are not for people with medical conditions such as active cancer, insulin-dependent diabetes, renal failure, cardiac dysfunction or severe psychological disturbances.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="22"> "These diets should not be used by infants, teen-agers, pregnant and breast-feeding women, or older Americans," she added.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="23"> Nutri/Systems, a portioned meal plan, Optifast, a liquid formula diet program and Slim Fast, a partial liquid diet program (the program involves two glasses of liquid formula and one meal a day) are among those being criticized for making use of low calorie intakes during weight loss.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="24"> Dr. Stuart Shapiro, former Philadelphia commissioner of health and current national director of Nutri/Systems, insists that the program is medically safe.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="26"> "We provide a nutritionally balanced meal plan that meets safe calorie levels recommended by major health organizations.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="27"> "Medical literature is clear that weight loss programs should be tailored to individuals, and for many individuals 1,000 calories a day may be appropriate while for others 1,500 may be.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="28"> Nutri/Systems is a 'comprehensive' weight loss and management program tailored to individual needs.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="29"> "Weight loss of 1 1/2 to 2 pounds per week (about 1% of body weight per week) until ideal weight is achieved is followed by a maintenance program using portioned meals twice a week and continual access to nutrition classes," Shapiro said.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="30"> William Bush, senior vice president of Sandoz Nutrition/Optifast, pointed out that Optifast is a 15-year-old program originally developed for hospital treatment of the grossly obese.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="31"> The program is now available primarily through hospital outpatient clinics and is intended for patients who are 30% overweight.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="32"> (Obesity is categorized as being 20% above ideal weight).</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="33"> Bush contends that Optifast has been unfairly "lumped in with storefront operations that do not offer the medical supervision or the comprehensive program to teach people how to keep weight off.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="34"> Our average patient loses 45 pounds in 26 weeks, and at the end of 18 months they have maintained (loss of) two-thirds of that weight".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="35"> The data, Bush said, comes from "large multicenter trials, one involving 1,500 patients and the other 500".</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="36"> The Optifast program can cost a patient from $2,500 to $3,000.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="37"> The first 12-week phase of the three-phase program begins with a 420 to 800 calorie formula diet followed by gradual introduction of "normal" foods.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="38"> Behavior modification, exercise, lab tests and supervision by credentialed professionals and physicians also are provided.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="39"> Some low-calorie diets have been useful as short-term methods for reducing weight in the dangerously obese and in persons with hypertension, diabetes or high blood levels, Callaway pointed out.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="40"> The congressional hearing in late March was just the beginning.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="41"> According to Callaway, the "warning has been sounded" and there are stirrings within the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration for further investigations.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="43"> The hullabaloo started three months ago when 18 Florida women filed suits against Nutri/Systems, claiming that rapid weight loss affects bile in the gallbladder and contributes to the formation of gallstones.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="44"> According to Callaway, gallbladder problems occur with "extremely high frequency" when people go on low calorie diets.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="45"> "A study. . . published in the Archives of Internal Medicine showed that in eight weeks of dieting on a 500 calorie diet 25% of dieters developed gallstones.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="47"> Callaway also pointed out that many diet program promoters blame obesity and not the diet for obese persons' gallbladder problems.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="48"> According to Shapiro of Nutri/Systems, there "is no evidence linking gallbladder disease to weight-loss programs like Nutri/Systems".</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="49"> "We will defend against (the suit) and we will prevail," said Tim Hermeling, public affairs director for Nutri/Systems.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="50"> The comprehensive weight-loss program provides a $49 to $64 weekly food and beverage package for an initial 1,000 to 1,500 calorie intake per day, followed by a yearlong maintenance diet, adding behavior modification and education to the program.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="51"> A Nutri/Systems nutrition specialist (not all of them registered dietitians or licensed practitioners) meets with the client once a week to monitor weight loss.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="52"> Some low-calorie commercial diet plans call for 500 to 1,000 calorie daily diets, which is considered lower than is safe for supplying all the nutrients needed for good health, according to the Recommended Daily Allowances, which set standards for nutrient intake.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="53"> A position paper published in the May issue of the Journal of American Dietetic Assn. states that rapid weight-loss programs are recommended only for dieters who are at least 30% to 40% overweight.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="54"> Wellman stressed that rapid weight loss should be undertaken only with the supervision of a qualified health team.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="55"> "The most significant drawback to an unsupervised very low calorie diet is the potential for life-threatening side effects," she said.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="56"> "Loss of body protein may affect cardiac function and could be related to heart failure.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="57">. . . Eventually all dieters need to learn to be realistic about their food choices," Wellman said .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="58"> Callaway, who practices internal medicine, endocrinology and metabolism in Washington, where he is also associate clinical professor of medicine at George Washington University Medical Center, expressed similar concerns to the committee: "If you are going to engage in something potentially hazardous you need to have people who know how to intervene".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="59"> Callaway cited the case of some 60 people who had died in the mid-1970s shortly after discontinuing their liquid protein diets.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="60"> Sudden deaths, he said, still occur.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="61"> "The fact that we have not heard about them until recently reflects our lack of any type of tracking mechanism.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="62"> We have no way of knowing how common these occurances are," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="63"> Some of the diets out there, Callaway asserts, are ineffective.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="64"> "Most of the evidence suggests that the more you lose the more quickly you gain," Callaway told The Times.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="65"> Oprah Winfrey, who lost 67 pounds on a liquid diet plan and regained some of it back, is often cited as a victim of the yo-yo syndrome common to fast-loss weight programs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="66"> The phenomenon of losing and regaining has been scientifically established since the early 20th Century, Callaway said.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="67"> But little of the knowledge has been incorporated into the currently available commercial loss programs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="68"> Low calorie diets, Callaway explained, start out with loss of water, which then is retained as the body adapts to starvation.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="69"> The metabolic rate slows down (nature's way of preserving fat in the face of starvation or famine).</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="70"> "Unfortunately, it is accompanied by symptoms that severely compromise one's quality of life," Callaway said.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="71"> Symptoms include fatigue, depression, dry skin, sleeplessness, constipation, a fall in blood pressure, dizziness, bloating and even loss of consciousness.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="72"> Some studies indicate that with each subsequent attempt at dieting weight loss is slower and rebound weight gain occurs more rapidly.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="73"> Starving also leads to stuffing and binge eating, as found among bulimia victims.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="74"> Callaway called for qualified supervision of weight-loss plans.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="75"> At the congressional hearing Callaway said that many people successfully diet on their own if they also increase physical activity or cut back on snacks and fats.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="76"> A second alternative is to see a registered dietitian.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="77"> "There are more than 50,000 registered dietitians who are qualified to provide dietary advice," Callaway said.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="78"> Furthermore, rapid weight-loss plans should be restricted to individuals who truly need to lose weight for health reasons and who have some medically justifiable indication for losing weight rapidly, he said.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="79"> "In all cases it is imperative that there be medical supervision and that the medical supervision be competent to monitor the types of complications that are known to occur.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="80"> "A number of commercial programs in which physicians are not involved refer to their staff as 'certified' nutrition counselors, behavioral therapists or whatever.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="81"> In most cases, the only certification comes from the company offering the program.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="82">. . . (Consumers) have no existing effective mechanism for tracing the incidence and severity of complications due to unsupervised and poorly supervised weight loss programs.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="83"> At present, our main recourse is through the media.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="84"> For the victim, the only recourse is through civil suits.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="85"> Surely we can improve upon this situation," Callaway told the subcommittee .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="86"> Among his other recommendations to the subcommittee:</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="87"> -- Hold weight-loss programs accountable for their diets' outcomes by documenting dietary complications of clients and stop blaming the dieter for their failure.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="88"> -- Establish a registry or clearinghouse for collecting data of adverse effects on clients of commercial diet plans and make the information available to the scientific community for evaluation.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="89"> In his recent book, "The Callaway Diet: Successful Permanent Weight Control for Starvers, Stuffers and Skippers," (Bantam Books: $17.95) Callaway gives reasons why starving, stuffing and skipping are counterproductive methods for losing weight.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="90"> He also provides a four-step personal dieting profile that determines the dieters' specific weight loss challenge.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="91"> The book first guides the dieter through a new formula for determining healthiest weight range and body fat distribution.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="92"> Secondly, it helps define which diet approach will be most effective.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="93"> Diet history, current metabolic score and eating and activity patterns are determinants.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="94"> The menus developed are for diet levels of 1,400 calories, 1,600 calories, 1,800 calories and 2,000 calories per day, with exercise recommended.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="95"> Callaway considers the program a sensible approach to dieting because the calories provide the necessary RDA's for a balanced diet while allowing overweight individuals to eventually lose weight because they are eating less and exercising more.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="96"> Callaway's rules for eating:</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="97"> 1 -- Eat three regularly scheduled meals a day and no snacks.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="98"> 2 -- Don't skip meals.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="99"> 3 -- Balance meals throughout the day, allowing 25% of the calories for breakfast, 30% to 35% for lunch and the remainder for dinner.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="100"> 4 -- Drink no alcohol during the first six weeks, as alcohol is known to trigger bingeing.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="101"> 5 -- Up to two cups of caffeinated coffee a day are allowed.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="102"> Drink tea or coffee without sugar or artificial sweeteners as they can set off bingeing.</s>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="103"> Replace diet sodas with mineral water or unsweetened seltzer.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="104"> According to Wellman, all dieters need to learn to deal with food in a balanced manner with variety and moderation as the keys.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041990-0068" num="105"> "Changing eating habits is a gradual process that requires individualization, ongoing monitoring and reinforcement," she said.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="16"> And in 1983 -- after a brief, failed marriage -- Karen died at 32 of complications from anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder which had plagued her since the mid '70s.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="17"> With her death, the "lost Karen tapes" became even more of a source of mystery among fans.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="18"> But they remained unavailable -- until now.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="19"> Four songs from that shelved 1979 album are featured -- along with eight previously unreleased Carpenters recordings -- on a just-released Carpenters album, "Love-lines".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="20"> The recordings -- released to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the Carpenters' signing with A&M Records -- suggest that Karen could work effectively outside the Carpenters' mellow pop sound and could have gone on to a thriving solo career.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="21"> The big question: Why was the solo album put in limbo?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="22"> The bigger question: If the album had been released and been successful, would things have turned out differently for Karen?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="23"> The suspicion in some music industry quarters has been that Karen shelved the solo album out of loyalty to Richard, who was anxious to get back to work in 1979 after recovering from a Quaalude dependency.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="24"> (Richard's dependency was revealed in CBS-TV's "The Karen Carpenter Story," the highest-rated TV movie of the 1988-89 season).</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="25"> In an interview tied to the release of the new album, Richard Carpenter, 43, was candid about the conflicts within the Carpenters in the late '70s.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="26"> "Karen would mention every now and again that it would be nice to receive some accolades as a solo singer," he said in an A&M office in Hollywood.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="27"> "Of course, that made me feel badly, because we were a duo.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="28"> Lord knows, she was the star of the duo, but that's not quite the same".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="29"> Richard said that he had a less-than-supportive reaction to Karen's announcement -- just after he had begun a six-week drug rehabilitation program -- that she was planning to record an album without him.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="30"> "I probably said something like, 'You're just abandoning ship, just taking off and doing what you want to do'.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="31"> I was feeling sorry for myself," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="32"> "It was a combination of feeling I was being abandoned -- which was anything but the case looking back on it -- and thinking this was a perfect time for her to get some treatment for her disorder.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="33"> So I was not happy, and I told her as much".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="34"> Richard, who produced and arranged the Carpenters' long string of hits, also acknowledged that he felt threatened by Karen's teaming up with another producer.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="35"> "I'm human and it did cross my mind that something could come out of this and just explode at which time I would be going through a number of emotions.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="36"> I'd be happy for Karen because I always felt that she should have been in the Top 5.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="37"> On the other hand, being sensitive and feeling I'd done a good job for the Carpenters I would have been a little bit upset".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="38"> In a separate interview from his New York office, producer Phil Ramone discussed his and Karen's objective on the album.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="39"> "We were thinking two things: How do we make a record that doesn't sound like the Carpenters, and what could we say lyrically in these songs that has a more mature attitude"?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="40"> The solo album included a spare, intimate reading of the sexually direct "Make Believe It's Your First Time" and a bluesy version of Paul Simon's "Still Crazy After All These Years" -- though Karen, mindful of her prim image -- had Simon change the line, "4 in the morning / crapped out / yawning" to the more demure "crashed out".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="41"> "Karen was frustrated by the Goody Two-Shoes image, but she was torn," Ramone said.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="42"> "She wanted to do try new things, but then she'd turn around and say, 'We're going to do another Carpenters Christmas special'.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="43"> I kept saying, 'The (Andy) Williams family even got past that one'. "</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="44"> Ramone still remembers the day in early 1980 when he and Karen played the album for Richard and A&M founders Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="45"> "The silence was deafening," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="46"> "Richard didn't say much and still hasn't.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="47"> He's accepted these songs kind of like stepchildren.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="48"> Karen was always the sweetheart of A&M, and Herb and Jerry reacted almost like it was their teen-age daughter I was messing with".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="49"> Alpert, who wrote the liner notes to the Carpenters' debut album and found the team's breakthrough hit, "Close to You," declined to be interviewed for this story.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="50"> Richard Carpenter remembers giving Karen a mixed, but essentially lukewarm, review of the solo project.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="51"> "I probably said it was very nice," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="52"> "It certainly is well-produced and well-assembled.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="53"> But some of it was disco, and I'm not a disco fan, and I thought she was singing a little bit too high on some of the songs".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="54"> And Carpenter applied some not-so-subtle pressure on Karen by telling her how eager he was to begin work on the next Carpenters album.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="55"> "I was much better by then and was kicking myself for what I had done to my life," he said.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="56"> "So I mentioned that whenever she was ready, I was ready.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="57"> I had all the tunes set to go".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="58"> The deciding factor came when A&M executives asked Karen and Ramone to go back into the studio to record a few more songs for the solo project.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="59"> "It was up to Karen to decide if she wanted to spend more time on it or not," Richard said.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="60"> "She didn't and that was that.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="61"> I've gotten a lot of letters through the years since Karen passed on kind of accusing me of not releasing the solo album.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="62"> It's not my doing at all.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="63"> It's Karen's wishes I'm honoring".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="64"> In a 1981 interview, Karen said that Richard's desire to get back to work took precedence over completing the solo project.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="65"> But Karen added that she valued the solo experience.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="66"> "It was fun cutting it and seeing that I could do all that -- sing a different type of tune and work with different people.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="67"> I was scared to death beforehand.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="68"> I basically knew one producer, one arranger, one studio, one record company and that was it.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="69">. . . I'm used to being part of a duo.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="70"> Richard's like a third arm to me" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="71"> Stung by the cool reception at the playback session, Ramone and Karen went to Mexico for a vacation.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="72"> "I watched this girl disintegrate in front of me," Ramone said.</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="73"> "It was hard for her to express anger, but sometimes she'd be sitting there and she'd say, 'Why is this happening?</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="74"> What did I do wrong?</s>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="75"> Should we listen to the tape?</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA110789-0040" num="78"> "I truly believe that if she had made it through this she could have gone on to have a long career," Ramone said.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="10"> A private psychiatric hospital in Thousand Oaks has opened the county's first ward exclusively for women, a controversial new wing staffed primarily by women and designed to tackle gender-related problems.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="11"> Although Charter Hospital administrators describe the third-floor unit as a haven for rape victims and women who suffer from depression or eating disorders, the hospital's critics and competitors dismiss it as little more than a clever marketing gimmick.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="12"> Moreover, some psychiatric experts emphasize that women, even those brutalized by members of the opposite sex, should be hospitalized with men.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="13"> To isolate women, they argue, only makes it more difficult for them to re-enter a society filled with men.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="14"> Charter's directors agree that mixed groups may be helpful during the latter stages of therapy; however, they stress that initially some women need to move slowly in a secure environment.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="15"> Eighty percent of the patients in the unit, which has operated for less than three months, have been victims of physical or sexual abuse.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="16"> "There are a lot of women out there suffering and I want to provide a safe place for them where they can come together and work together," said Dr.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="17"> Uzma Khalid, the unit's founder.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="18"> Located near Westlake High School, Charter is one of four private psychiatric hospitals in Ventura County.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="19"> The nine-month-old hospital reserves 21 of its 80 beds for women.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="20"> Treatment costs about $825 a day.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="21"> Since the unit opened in early October, about 30 women have been counseled there.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="22"> A usual course of treatment lasts about four weeks, with patients attending group therapy sessions that include psychodrama role-playing and other techniques.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="23"> On a recent autumn afternoon, patients gathered in one of the day rooms for a therapy session aimed at encouraging them to talk about painful experiences.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="24"> Eleven women sat stiffly in a circle, some shaking their feet in nervous tension.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="25"> "When I was a child I was very lonely," one woman began.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="26"> In soft, soothing tones, the therapist pried, pushing the woman to recall being molested by her brother.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="27"> Eventually the woman grew angry and started to cry.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="28"> Someone passed her a box of tissues.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="29"> "I thought if I told anyone they'd think I was dirty," she said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="30"> "So did I," another woman agreed softly.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="31"> "I can relate," added a third.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="32"> Although the patients' conditions range from depression to bulimia, the experiences that lead to problems are often similar because the women are struggling in a male-dominated society, said Pary R.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="33"> Banki, a Westlake Village therapist who conducted the session that afternoon.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="34"> Banki supports conducting group therapy sessions exclusively with women to allow patients to share their common experiences.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="35"> For example, when Joanne, 41, entered Charter after she lost a baby in her sixth month of pregnancy, she said that talking with other women who had lost children gave her great comfort.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="36"> The miscarriage, Joanne's second, catapulted her into a severe depression and eventually into Charter Hospital in October, where she became one of the first patients at the women's unit.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="37"> "Men aren't always the right people to be discussing these things with," said Joanne, who asked that her real name not be used.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="38"> "A man doesn't know what it's like to be pregnant and having a baby growing inside of you".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="39"> The unit's critics, including other private psychiatric hospitals in the county, contend that in the real world women and men must interact and should be forced to do so in therapy.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="40"> That is the approach used at Vista Del Mar Hospital in Ventura.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="41"> "We haven't seen enough of a need to develop a special program all around" women, said Lynn Matthews, the hospital's director of marketing.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="42"> Fran Rogoff, clinical program coordinator at Pacific Shores Hospital in Oxnard, echoed those sentiments.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="43"> She said most women's issues, such as sexual abuse or domestic violence, also involve men and should be dealt with among men who may not pose the same threat.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="44"> Charter's administrators do not dispute the need for its patients to have therapy in groups that include men later in their recovery.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="45"> But some women, particularly those who have been victims of male aggression, want or even need to be in an all-female environment.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="46"> "There's a need for women on a daily basis not to have to confront men and reawaken the hurts and pains that will make it difficult," said Susan Anderson, the unit's nurse manager.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="47"> Some women, she said, are simply not comfortable discussing their experiences in front of men.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="48"> Khalid referred to national studies to underscore the need for a women-only unit.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="49"> Statistics show that one in four women suffer from depression compared to one in 10 men.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="50"> Furthermore, women are more often the victims of rape and incest, she said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="51"> But Dr. Ron Thurston, president-elect of the Southern California Psychiatric Assn., fails to see the need for a women-only unit.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="52"> "I hope people go to hospitals for better reasons than for being women," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="53"> Specialized units of this type are often little more than marketing tools, he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="54"> Although Thurston stressed that he was not referring specifically to Charter, he pointed out that public psychiatric clinics never need to advertise because they are overpopulated.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="55"> "The distortion is that we have mentally ill people sleeping under bridges while certain sectors of health care are advertising for services for women's needs," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="56"> Five years ago, Ventura County had no private psychiatric hospital.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="57"> Today, at least four are competing for people's insurance dollars, Thurston said.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="58"> That competition forces private hospitals to tailor programs to interest specific types of people.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="59"> "The commercial hospitals do direct advertising on the radio to people with insurance money to spend," Thurston said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="60"> Pine Grove Hospital in Canoga Park opened the San Fernando Valley's first women's unit almost two years ago.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="61"> The 14-bed unit charges about $1,000 a day and offers programs similar to those provided by Charter.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="62"> Pine Grove patients "get exactly what we're marketing," said Donna Burns, program director and founder of the hospital's women's program.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="63"> "It was my goal to develop a women's program for women who would never come into a hospital environment because of the stigma".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="64"> Like Charter, the unit employs an all-female nursing staff with male therapists available for those patients who request them.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="65"> "We believe that there should be a healthy balance, but we want to make sure that the nursing staff is female so they can come out at night in their pajamas and feel OK," Burns said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="66"> Governmental and private agencies that monitor psychiatry do not keep data on the number of women's units throughout the country, but those in the profession believe that hospitals began specializing care toward women about five years ago.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="67"> The trend seems to parallel the evolution of women's roles, which now include careers as well as primary responsibility for children and aging parents.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="68"> It also comes at a time when medicine in general has become more specialized, often focusing on individual areas of study.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="69"> "Part of the advantage of grouping patients at all is having patients with common problems together," said Dr.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="70"> Nada Logan, chairwoman of the American Psychiatric Assn.'s committee on women and director of psychiatric education at the University of Chicago.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="71"> "There are certain kinds of symptoms, disorders and stresses that are much more common in one gender than in another," Logan said.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="72"> "Depression is very common in women.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="73"> Eating disorders are much more common in women than men.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="74"> Women still bear the vast majority of responsibility for care of dependent persons in families, be they children or be they elderly.</s>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="75"> That's an enormous life demand".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="76"> If specialized programs can make psychiatry more "user friendly," more people may feel comfortable asking for help, said Joel Yager, a professor in the department of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA's School of Medicine.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122490-0020" num="77"> "If, in fact, it attracts and provides good service to people who need it. . . then that's a benefit," Yager said.</s>

<s docid="LA042590-0171" num="17"> What makes Prozac so popular is its side-effect profile.</s>

<s docid="LA042590-0171" num="19"> It is far less likely to cause constipation, dry mouth or weight gain.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="9"> With "Eating" (only at the Park Theater in San Diego) the ever-idiosyncratic independent filmmaker Henry Jaglom continues his intimate, spontaneous, witty but always compassionate observations of compulsive, neurotic human behavior -- and reveals his ongoing fascination with women.</s>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="10"> He clearly has always inspired great trust in actresses, and in this instance his all-female cast rewards him with some shining portrayals.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="11"> Mary Crosby reveals depths heretofore unsuspected, and from Gwen Welles, one of his regulars, he elicits her most harrowing, complex performance yet.</s>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="12"> But if "Eating" had accomplished nothing else, it would have been remarkable for the performance of Frances Bergen, one of Hollywood's enduring, elegant beauties, in what is surely the best part of her career.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="13"> In essence, "Eating" is "The Women" of the '90s.</s>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="14"> The Norma Shearer role of the perfect wife goes to capable Lisa Blake Richards as an attractive Hancock Park matron who decides to throw a party to mark her 40th birthday, then expands it to celebrate the impending birthdays of two of her best friends: Crosby, a happily married housewife who is about to turn 30; and Marlena Giovi, a Hollywood agent who is fast approaching 50.</s>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="15"> By the time the party and the film are over, no less than 38 actresses (and no actors) will have appeared on the screen.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="16"> When one of the women remarks, "Twenty-five years ago the secret subject of women was sex. . . today, it's food!," she's hit upon the heart of the matter.</s>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="17"> Except for Bergen, who plays Richards' serene mother, virtually every woman present is obsessed with dieting, in at least one instance to the point of bulimia .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="18"> In this group, thinness has become the absolute measure of desirability and self-worth, even for the women who know better intellectually, but remain vulnerable emotionally to this rigid standard.</s>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="19"> Who can deny that the anxiety of these by-and-large sophisticated, highly attractive women mirrors our society's distorted values, reinforced so intensively by messages in the media?</s>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="20"> This is scarcely news, but what is new is the way Jaglom makes this phenomenon so personal; serious, yet occasionally so funny.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="21"> Around the issue of food, the usual storylines start unreeling, involving acts of infidelity and betrayal as well as gestures of loving support.</s>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="22"> In order to thoroughly -- one might well say exhaustively -- explore women's attitudes toward eating and dieting, Jaglom has given Richards a house guest, a French documentarian (Nelly Alard) who questions Richards and her guests on those very subjects under the guise of making a study of what she calls "Southern California behavior".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="23"> Ironically, this voluptuous beauty herself finally reveals a terrible, wildly distorted self-image.</s>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="24"> However, as the film's various storylines take hold, the constant cuts to the documentarian's question-and-answer sessions become intrusive, repetitive -- how many things can you say about eating and dieting? -- and tend to make the film seem long and drawn out.</s>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="25"> Yet, on balance, amid so many glancing insights and so many radiant presences, this is not a serious flaw.</s>

<s docid="LA111690-0131" num="26"> Resolutely chic and contemporary, "Eating" (Times-rated Mature for adult themes) really isn't, in its grasp of human foibles, so different from "The Women" after all.</s>
