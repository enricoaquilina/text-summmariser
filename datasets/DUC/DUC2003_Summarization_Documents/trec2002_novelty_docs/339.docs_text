<s docid="FT933-3956" num="7"> THE US Food and Drug Administration announced yesterday it had given Warner-Lambert, the US pharmaceuticals concern, final clearance to market Cognex, the first drug specifically approved in the US for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</s>

<s docid="FT933-3956" num="8"> The drug, which was developed by the company's Parke-Davis division, could generate annual revenues of between Dollars 400m and Dollars 500m within a few years, according to an estimate by Oppenheimer, the New York brokerage house.</s>

<s docid="FT933-3956" num="9"> Warner-Lambert declined to comment on projected sales, but said Cognex treatments would cost patients about Dollars 3.50 a day.</s>

<s docid="FT933-3956" num="10"> Government approval had been expected as Cognex received a favourable recommendation from an FDA advisory committee in March, after being turned down twice by the panel in 1991.</s>

<s docid="FT933-3956" num="11"> Even so, Warner-Lambert shares rose sharply yesterday afternoon, closing Dollars 1 7/8 higher at Dollars 69 1/8. The drug was found to be effective in easing the symptoms of patients in the mild-to-moderate stages of Alzheimer's, an illness characterised by progressive decline of memory, judgment and ability to reason.</s>

<s docid="FT933-3956" num="12"> There is no evidence that Cognex alters the course of the underlying dementia process.</s>

<s docid="FT933-3956" num="13"> An estimated 4m Americans are afflicted with the disease, and the company estimates that 50 to 70 per cent could benefit from Cognex treatment.</s>

<s docid="FT933-3956" num="15"> The UK pharmaceuticals group was hoping to receive approval to sell its best-selling product over the counter in the US as a treatment for heartburn, writes Peter John in London.</s>

<s docid="FT933-3956" num="16"> If the drug were approved the potential boost to the company's sales was estimated at between Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m a year .</s>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="6"> The pharmaceutical industry has an abysmal record in treating disorders of the brain and nervous system.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="7"> While new drugs have transformed the outlook for people suffering from infectious illnesses, heart disease, and gastro-intestinal problems, most psychiatric patients depend on medicines discovered several decades ago.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="8"> Current treatments for mental conditions, from mild anxiety to severe psychosis, emerged during the 'black box' era of drug discovery.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="9"> Doctors observed that they relieved symptoms - often poorly and unpredictably - but pharmacologists had no idea how they worked.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="10"> For the most serious problems - degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's - there is still nothing that really works.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="11"> The outlook, however, is much brighter, as scientific discoveries about the chemistry and biology of the brain find their way into new drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="12"> The ones being introduced during the 1990s are based on an understanding of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers which send signals between cells) and receptors (protein molecules on the cell which receive the signals and initiate specific biological responses).</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="13"> After the year 2000, there is the prospect of far superior treatments based on the genetic processes involved in mental disorders.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="14"> The best known neurotransmitter is 5-HT, also called 5-hyroxytryptamine or serotonin, which is active not only in the brain but also in other parts of the body.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="15"> It is associated with several types of receptor, each giving a different biological response.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="16"> The pharmaceutical industry is developing drugs to interact with each specific type, as an agonist to stimulate the receptor or as an antagonist to block it.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="17"> Glaxo of the UK has been investigating 5-HT systems for almost 20 years and expects a spectacular payback from two drugs: sumatriptan and ondansetron.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="18"> Sumatriptan (trade name Imigran) is the first effective treatment for migraine, the intense recurrent headache suffered by at least one adult in 12.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="19"> It was launched last year as an injection and is being introduced in the UK this month in more convenient form as pills.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="20"> With sumatriptan ahead of competition, its potential sales are huge - more than Pounds 1bn a year - if it can overcome doctors' fear of side effects.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="21"> Sumatriptan is an agonist for the 5-HT1 category of receptor, stimulating the uptake of 5-HT in the cranial blood vessels.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="22"> That reverses the swelling which triggers a migraine attack.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="23"> Glaxo had hoped sumatriptan would have no effect elsewhere in the body but experience shows that some patients feel tightness in the chest after injections.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="24"> That is presumably because blood vessels elsewhere in the body contain a few of the same 5-HT1 receptors.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="25"> Glaxo says sumatriptan's side effects are insignificant for healthy people but they show how difficult it is to make a selective receptor-based drug.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="26"> Ondansetron (Zofran) is an antagonist for a different receptor type, the 5-HT3.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="27"> It was launched two years ago as an anti-emetic to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by cancer therapy, but Glaxo is now carrying out clinical trials with ondansetron for a range of psychiatric conditions including anxiety, schizophrenia, addiction and age-associated memory impairment.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="28"> Glaxo researchers are understandably cautious about proclaiming ondansetron to be a psychiatric wonder-drug.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="29"> They blanch when outsiders talk of it as a potential 'smart drug' which could improve everyone's memory.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="30"> Mike Tyers, pharmacology director for Glaxo Group Research, says the 5-HT3 receptors on neurones (nerve cells in the brain) 'seem to be there to control things when they go wrong'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="31"> When everything is working properly, 'they are fairly silent'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="32"> If so, a 5-HT3 antagonist such as ondansetron may help to restore the balance in several disorders, without side-effects.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="33"> Another group of new drugs based on the 5-HT system is leading to improved treatments for depression.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="34"> The specific serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as they are known, increase the low 5-HT levels in the brain which are associated with many forms of depression.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="35"> Eli Lilley of the US is already selling more than Dollars 1bn a year of its pioneering SSRI, fluoxetine (Prozac) launched in 1988.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="36"> In hot pursuit is a second generation of SSRIs led by paroxetine (Seroxat), which was developed jointly by Novo Nordisk of Denmark and SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American group.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="37"> SSRIs have fewer side effects than the 'tricyclic' drugs which have dominated antidepressant treatment for 30 years.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="38"> Yet SSRIs still leave much to be desired: they take at least two weeks to relieve depression and they fail to work in about one third of patients.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="39"> That may reflect partly the poor quality of clinical diagnosis in depression and other non-acute mental disorders.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="40"> Some scientists believe that all forms of depression ultimately work through a common biochemical pathway.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="41"> If they are right - and not everyone agrees with the theory - it may eventually be possible to find a fast-acting drug that will help anyone who is clinically depressed.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="42"> The greatest neurological challenge for pharmaceutical research is to find a cure for the degenerative brain diseases which lead inexorably to dementia and death.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="43"> The most prevalent is Alzheimer's, which affects as many as 20 per cent of people over 70.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="44"> The search for an Alzheimer's treatment has led to a new class of drugs, the nootropics, developed to enhance memory and other cognitive functions.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="45"> The first generation of nootropics aims to increase the amount of acetylcholine in the brain.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="46"> Alzheimer's patients have a marked deficit of this neurotransmitter.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="47"> Most of the Alzheimer's drugs developed recently work indirectly by inhibiting an enzyme called cholinesterase which breaks down acetylcholine.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="48"> They include piracetam from UCB of Belgium; oxiracetam from SmithKline Beecham; tacrine from Warner-Lambert of the US; and physostigmine from Forest Laboratories of the US.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="49"> Although they have shown promise in clinical trials, the manufacturers have not yet produced evidence strong enough to convince the US Food and Administration to licence any of the drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="50"> Du Pont Merck, the pharmaceutical joint venture between Du Pont and Merck of the US, has a promising anti-dementia drug now in late clinical trials which works in a different way.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="51"> It acts directly to stimulate the release of acetylcholine and other neurotransmitters in the brain.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="52"> The drug (chemical name linopirdine) is noteworthy too for its unusually vivid and appealing trade name - Aviva.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="53"> However none of these memory enhancing drugs, even Aviva, can do more than temporarily reverse or slow down the mental degeneration that is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="54"> None prevents the build-up of tangled plaques of amyloid protein, which progressively destroy patients' brains.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="55"> The best long-term hope for curing progressive dementias is to identify the genetic mechanism responsible and then develop drugs to block its effect.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="56"> In the case of Alzheimer's, a fault in a gene coding for amyloid precursor protein (APP) seems to be responsible.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="57"> In a few families, this is inherited but it is more often caused by environmental factors.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="58"> Many pharmaceutical researchers are now working on long-range projects to block APP, though they are hampered by the fact that there is not yet a good animal model for Alzheimer's.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="59"> Athena Neurosciences of California is one of the biotechnology companies furthest advanced in this area.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="60"> More futuristic still are ideas for repairing brain damage by growing new nerve cells.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="61"> That does not normally occur in an adult brain but scientists are accumulating evidence that selective regeneration could be achieved by removing some of the genetic factors that inhibit the process.</s>

<s docid="FT922-715" num="62"> The series will continue next month by looking at asthma drugs.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="9"> SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposes to disapprove a new drug application (NDA) for Deprenyl (deprenyl citrate or deprenyl), submitted by Discovery Experimental and Development, Inc., 29949 S.R. 54 West, Wesley Chapel, FL 33543 (Discovery).</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="10"> FDA is also providing Discovery notice of an opportunity for a hearing on the proposal.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="21"> Background Discovery has submitted an NDA for deprenyl citrate with proposed labeling for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="22"> Throughout most of this document, the drug product is referred to as deprenyl citrate or deprenyl.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="23"> Occasionally, especially when referring to the active drug substance, the term selegiline is used to be consistent with terms and claims made in the NDA.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="24"> An NDA for another deprenyl product, selegiline hydrochloride (Eldepryl ® ) held by Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="25"> (Somerset), was approved on June 5, 1989, for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="26"> The Somerset product, l-deprenyl, is the levorotatory acetylenic derivative of phenethylamine.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="27"> Discovery claims that there are: ``four distinct functions of deprenyl in helping curb or delay the effects of Alzheimer's disease, and could very well delay the onset of disease, if taken as a preventative.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="28"> Function 1.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="29"> Deprenyl causes the body to naturally produce more dopamine, which normally depletes with age, which, in turn, assists in maintaining healthy brain cells.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="30"> Function 2.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="31"> Deprenyl blocks toxic free radicals from breaking down dopamine, which causes further degeneration of brain cells.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="32"> Function 3.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="33"> Deprenyl revives malfunctioning and dormant brain cells, bringing back lost body functions.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="34"> Function 4.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="35"> Deprenyl increases the body's hormone content, which improves the body's motorability and the immune system * * *''.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="36"> On November 29, 1991, Discovery submitted NDA 20-242 with data and information intended to demonstrate deprenyl citrate's safety and effectiveness in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and proposed that the product be marketed without prescription.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="37"> Discovery submitted a minor amendment on December 6, 1991, providing an updated table of contents and some revised pages in the NDA.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="38"> On January 17, 1992, FDA notified Discovery by letter that the NDA was not acceptable for filing under 21 CFR 314.101 because the NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="39"> FDA described numerous deficiencies in an attachment to the letter.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="40"> In response to FDA's refusal to file, Discovery requested an informal conference with FDA, and this was held on November 16, 1992.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="41"> In a letter to Discovery dated November 24, 1992, FDA notified Discovery of its option to amend its application under 21 CFR 314.101(a)(3) and file it over protest, and Discovery did this on December 7, 1992.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="42"> In a letter dated December 31, 1992, FDA acknowledged Discovery's request to file over protest and stated that the application would be reviewed as filed.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="43"> (In a letter dated February 9, 1993, Discovery objected to the advice given in FDA's letters of November 24, and December 31, 1992, that an NDA filed over protest may not be amended once filed).</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="44"> In a letter to Discovery dated August 20, 1993, FDA concluded that the information presented by Discovery was inadequate and that the application was not approvable (21 CFR 314.120).</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="45"> Discovery responded with a letter dated September 1, 1993, requesting a time extension of 180 days, under 21 CFR 314.120(a)(5), to consider its options regarding its application.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="46"> FDA granted this request.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="47"> In a letter dated March 1, 1994, and received by FDA March 7, 1994, Discovery requested the opportunity for a hearing under 21 CFR 314.120(a)(3) on the question of whether there are grounds for denying approval of NDA 20-242.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="48"> II. The Deficiencies in NDA 20-242 Discovery is required to submit, among other things, ``full reports of investigations which have been made to show whether or not such drug is safe for use and whether such drug is effective in use,'' under section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 355(b)(1)), as well as all information required under 21 CFR 314.50.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="49"> Discovery's NDA 20-242 provides insufficient information to determine whether Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid are safe, and fails to include adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid are safe; the NDA lacks substantial evidence that Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid will have the effect they are represented to have; and the methods used in, and facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid are inadequate to preserve their identity, strength, quality, and purity (section 505(d) of the act).</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="50"> In addition, Discovery's NDA 20-242 fails to include an adequate environmental assessment, fails to include proper labeling and bioavailability data, and fails to demonstrate compliance with current good manufacturing practice regulations.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="51"> A detailed description of these deficiencies follows.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="52"> A. The Safety of Deprenyl Under section 505(d) of the act and 21 CFR 314.125(b)(2) and (b)(4), Discovery fails to include in NDA 20-242 adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid are safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling, and sufficient information about Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid to determine whether they are safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="53"> 1. Preclinical Data Discovery fails to include either reports of the complete range of studies necessary to assess the pharmacological and toxicological profile of the drug (21 CFR 314.50(d)) or clinical data to obviate the need for such studies.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="54"> Discovery fails to include any of the required toxicology studies such as: (1) Acute and subacute studies in rodents and nonrodents, (2) chronic studies consisting of a 6-month rodent and a 12-month nonrodent study, (3) a genotoxicity screen, (4) studies that examine the effects of the drug on reproduction, and (5) carcinogenicity studies (21 CFR 314.50(d)(2)).</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="55"> Examples of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for the Format and Content of the Nonclinical/ Pharmacology/Toxicology Section of an Application''.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="56"> 2. Clinical Data As noted above, selegiline hydrochloride (l-deprenyl) is currently being marketed as Eldepryl ® by Somerset for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="57"> The exclusivity period for this application expires on June 6, 1994.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="58"> FDA could only review NDA 20-242 as an application submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the act because until the exclusivity period of Eldepryl ® expires, no application submitted under section 505(b)(2) or section 505(j) of the act which refers to Eldepryl ® can be approved.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="59"> In NDA 20-242, Discovery attempts to use the previous approval of Somerset's selegiline hydrochloride product as evidence of the safety of its deprenyl citrate product.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="60"> The mere fact of approval may not, however, be used in this way.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="61"> Section 505(b)(1) of the act requires that Discovery submit full reports of investigations that have been made to show its product is safe.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="62"> Safety studies of Eldepryl ® are not available to Discovery for use in satisfying this requirement.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="63"> Moreover, if Discovery's claims that Deprenyl is ``purer, more potent and more effective'' than Eldepryl ® are true, such differences could reflect, among other things, increased absorption or rate of absorption, with increased concentration in, or rate of transmission of the drug into the brain, and a greater potential for adverse events.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="64"> In NDA 20-242, no safety study was performed using Discovery's product and there was no study comparing the bioavailability of Discovery's product to Eldepryl ®. Accordingly, FDA cannot assess its safety.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="65"> B. The Effectiveness of Deprenyl Under section 505(d) of the act and 21 CFR 314.125(b)(5), Discovery has failed to provide in NDA 20-242 substantial evidence, consisting of adequate and well-controlled studies, that Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid will have the effect they are represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in their proposed labeling.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="66"> The proposed labeling in Discovery's application claims that deprenyl citrate demonstrates a ``quantitative and qualitative improvement in cognitive functions of Alzheimer's patients as a result of the inhibition of MAO-B activity''.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="67"> To support this claim, Discovery includes reprints from 171 articles in the medical and scientific literature.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="68"> Although some of these articles pertain to deprenyl, not one study used Discovery's product or a product with a known bioavailability relationship to Discovery's product.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="69"> Discovery identified 12 of these 171 articles as evidence of the effectiveness of deprenyl citrate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="70"> This notice discusses the first of these articles in greater detail than the others because it has many characteristics of a well-controlled study and, if the report submitted were supplemented with additional information, it might qualify as an adequate and well-controlled study supporting the effectiveness of a deprenyl drug product in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="71"> The remaining 11 studies are inherently incapable of being regarded as substantial evidence of the effectiveness of deprenyl citrate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease; these are therefore summarized only briefly below.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="73"> i. Design . One hundred thirty-six patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer-type disorders were enrolled in a 3-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="74"> They were evaluated at baseline and months 1, 2, and 3.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="75"> Of the enrolled patients, 17 dropped out following randomization and before the first effectiveness assessment (the article does not report the number from each group, but if original randomization created two groups of approximately equal size, i.e., 68 in each group, then, based on the number remaining in each group at the end of the study, virtually all 17 drop-outs would seem to have been from the placebo group).</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="76"> Seven more (three on deprenyl and four on placebo) did not complete 3 months of therapy.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="77"> No explanation is given for the 17 early drop-outs or for the apparent imbalance in them.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="78"> The seven later patients were discontinued for poor efficacy (two deprenyl patients, four placebo patients) or poor compliance (one deprenyl patient).</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="79"> There was thus an imbalance in the number of patients treated and analyzed: 65 L-deprenyl (10 milligrams per day) and 47 placebo patients were included in the final analysis of effectiveness.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="80"> Effectiveness measurements were conducted in the following prefixed sequence: (1) Blessed's Dementia Scale, (2) digit span (Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS)), (3) Raskin and Crook's Inventory of Psychic and Somatic Complaints for the Elderly, (4) short story (WMS)_immediate recall, (5) simple copy of drawings, (6) Toulouse-Pieron attention test, (7) facilitated copy of drawings, (8) short story (WMS)_delayed recall, and (9) word fluency.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="81"> Measurements were taken at baseline, and at the end of the first second, and third months.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="82"> ii. Results . Based on an analysis of variance between treatments including all four test occasions, statistically significant differences are reported favoring L-deprenyl over placebo on all measurements except one portion of the Toulouse-Pieron attention test.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="83"> iii. Discussion . Taken at face value, the results in this published study suggest a positive effect of L-deprenyl in patients with Alzheimer's disease.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="84"> However, the published report lacks many of the details needed to assess a study.</s>

<s docid="FR940719-2-00089" num="85"> Thus, this study, as published and without additional information, cannot contribute to fulfilling the statutory requirement for substantial evidence of effectiveness: (a) Discovery has failed to provide data from a bioequivalence study demonstrating that the rate and extent of absorption of its product is essentially identical to the product manufactured by Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A.</s>

<SUMMARY>

<s docid="FR940816-2-00070" num="6"> SUMMARY: This is notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of an exclusive world-wide licenses to practice the inventions embodied in U.S.</s>

<s docid="FR940816-2-00070" num="7"> Patent 5,171,750, entitled ``Substituted Phenserines as Specific Inhibitors of Acetylcholinesterase'' and U.S.</s>

<s docid="FR940816-2-00070" num="8"> Patent Applications SN 07/861,329 and 08/096,207, both entitled ``Phenylcarbamates of (-)-Eseroline, (-)-N1-Noreseroline and (-)-N1-Benzylnoreseroline: Selective Inhibitors of Acetyl and/or Butyrylcholinesterase,'' 07/765,766, entitled ``Thiapysovenine and Carbamate Analogs, Pharmaceutical Compositions and Method for Inhibiting Cholinesterases,'' 07/845,081 and 08/182,301, both entitled ``Carbamate Analogs of Thiaphysovenine, Pharmaceutical Compositions, and Method for Inhibiting Cholinesterases,'' and 07/980,399, entitled ``Method for Treating Cognitive Disorders With Phenserine'' to CURE, Inc. of Baltimore, Maryland.</s>

<s docid="FR940816-2-00070" num="9"> The patent rights in these inventions have been assigned to the United States of America.</s>

<s docid="FR940816-2-00070" num="10"> The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.</s>

<s docid="FR940816-2-00070" num="11"> The prospective exclusive licenses may be granted unless within 60 days from the date of this published notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the license would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.</s>

<s docid="FR940816-2-00070" num="12"> The patent and patent applications disclose several novel, potent and long-acting anti-cholinesterase agents that enhance cognition and are highly promising drug candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders as well as methods for treating these conditions.</s>

<s docid="FR940816-2-00070" num="13"> The two series of drugs are based loosely on the first-generation cholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine.</s>

<s docid="FR940816-2-00070" num="14"> Physostigmine has produced demonstrable but small clinical improvements in patient's with Alzheimer's disease, but these are severely limited by (i) its short half-life (approximately 30 minutes) and (ii) its high incidence of toxic side-effects at doses that produce only modest enzyme inhibition.</s>

<s docid="FR940816-2-00070" num="15"> It is widely accepted that the narrow therapeutic index of physostigmine and some other first generation acetylcholinesterase inhibitors limits the administration of these at adequate doses to affect cognition.</s>

<s docid="FR940816-2-00070" num="16"> The present drug candidates are long-acting and highly selective for acetyl- (AChE) as opposed to butyrylcholinesterase (BChE).</s>

<s docid="FR940816-2-00070" num="17"> Whereas AChE is involved in the metabolism of ACh, and inhibiting AChE augments the action of ACh and thereby cholinergic function and memory in Alzheimer's disease, BChE has been proposed to be involved in lipid and phospholipid metabolism, in permeability control and transport of ions across membranes, and in slow nerve conduction.</s>

<s docid="FR940816-2-00070" num="18"> Co-inhibition of BChE in Alzheimer's patients, as a consequence of anticholinesterase therapy, probably is not of clinical value, and may be deleterious.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="6"> Last week, Dr Richard Sykes, Glaxo's chief executive, spent most of his Tuesday afternoon in the Sorcerer's Room of the elegant Thameside hotel, the Savoy.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="7"> His object was to explain to the media, for the first time in nearly two years, the progress of the pipeline of new products with which Glaxo will conjure its future.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="8"> The company, Europe's largest drugs group and challenger for the world's top position currently held by Merck of the US, also offered a round-up of the commercial environment and the prospects for its drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="9"> The presentation's emphasis on research and development was significant, however.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="10"> The group was not going to be seduced by diversification, said Dr Sykes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="11"> He has rejected strategies adopted by other groups such as worldwide rationalisation, mergers, and joint ventures and mergers for generic and over-the-counter non-prescription businesses.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="12"> Instead, Glaxo has adopted a strategy of concentrating on patented prescription medicines in spite of an increasingly difficult environment for drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="13"> The group's strategy was to focus rather than dissipate its energies, said Dr Sykes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="14"> It planned to maximise sales of established drugs such as Zantac, the anti-ulcer treatment; bring new and innovative drugs to market; bring these products to market fast on a global basis; and invest in developing markets.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="15"> The radical strategic departure adopted by Merck of vertical integration through the Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) acquisition of Medco Containment, a mail order company, was also dismissed by Dr Sykes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="16"> 'The concept is good, it's doubtful whether it was worth what Merck paid for it.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="17"> There are other ways of achieving the same ends with less expense,' he claimed.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="18"> Meanwhile, Glaxo is adopting a flexible approach to change.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="19"> Dr Sykes stressed the importance of reacting to local conditions.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="20"> This commitment to local autonomy within a framework of central strategic direction was also stressed in the group's annual report this year, and was in sharp contrast to the managerial style of Dr Ernest Mario, Dr Sykes's predecessor, who was sacked last March.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="21"> Dr Mario had an extremely detailed grasp of local conditions and is understood to have meddled in the activities of certain subsidiaries.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="22"> Key to the group's ability to maximise revenues remains its ability to increase revenues from Zantac, the best-selling medicine of all time with sales last financial year of Pounds 2.2bn.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="23"> Dr Sykes was dismissive of the threat posed to the drug through the eradication of a bacterium, helicobacter pylori, associated with ulcers.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="24"> Most patients were effectively treated with Zantac maintenance therapy said Dr Sykes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="25"> A few patients taking the drug relapsed, and for these it was a good idea to use a combination of drugs to eradicate HP, he agreed.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="26"> 'But if you eradicate HP in everybody who comes into the surgery with ulcers, it will work in anything between 10 per cent and 70 per cent of patients.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="27"> That's playing Russian roulette because half of those people are going to relapse and 10 per cent will perforate, and of those 5 per cent will die.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="28"> You can't gamble like that,' he argued.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="29"> The main threat to Zantac remained generic competition.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="30"> The US patents of Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham's drug and one of Zantac's main competitors, expire next year, but Dr Sykes did not expect it to have a big impact.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="31"> 'There's no direct relationship between price and usage.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="32"> Service, volume discounts and what other drugs you offer are equally important,' said Dr Sykes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="33"> Meanwhile, Glaxo plans to drive growth through its new products, Imigran, the migraine treatment, Zofran, an anti-nausea drug, and Serevent, an asthma medicine.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="34"> Glaxo's increasing management flexibility has been demonstrated by its decision to launch low-dose versions of Imigran, following criticisms of the high price of the 100mg version.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="35"> Dr Sykes said the move to launch 25mg and 50mg doses would help expand the market for those with mild migraines and, although not particularly driven by criticisms of price, the decision would help reduce them.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="36"> Meanwhile, analysts believe the development pipeline looks rich, with few 'me-too' products.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="37"> There are more compounds in exploratory development - 16 -than ever before.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="38"> Zofran, also known as ondansetron, was as effective as Warner-Lambert's Cognex for the treatment of Alzheimer's symptoms and was far safer, said Dr Sykes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="39"> He hoped it would be filed by early 1995.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="40"> Also highlighted by Dr Sykes was GR92132X, a treatment for non-insulin dependent diabetics.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="41"> Glaxo's HIV-treatment, 3TC, also known as lamivudine, looks effective in hepatitis B, a huge killer in the developing world, he said.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="42"> Ranitidine bismuth citrate could become important for HP eradication when used with antibiotics.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="43"> Remifentanil, an injectable anaesthetic, was a sleeper, capable of becoming an important drug, he quipped.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="44"> Given the company's full pipeline, and its clear strategy based on patented prescription medicines, Dr Sykes, Glaxo's sorcerer-in-chief, has staked the group's future on its ability to create and market new drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT934-3850" num="45"> Glaxo's shareholders must now hope the sorcerer's strategy does not turn out to be hocus-pocus.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="16"> [Text] Havana--To become or remain one of the "first class" nations, says Konrad Seitz, director of the Strategic Planning Department of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there is only one route: to master one of the five key technologies of the future world market: computers, biotechnology, space technology, new forms of energy, and new materials.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="17"> Of these technologies, the most important, says Noam Chomsky, is biotechnology.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="18"> To this opinion of the German strategist should be added a second condition for admission or permanent membership in the First World: being an independent state with sufficient autonomy and political determination, in dealing with the major world power centers, to defend a development project based on national interests.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="19"> In light of both of these parameters, the future of the Latin American countries appears dismal.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="20"> With the exception of Costa Rica -- which is not representative of Latin America -- Cuba is the only country that meets these two requisites, and, therefore, the only one with a good probability of leaving underdevelopment behind.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="21"> The real independence of the Cuban state requires no further demonstration.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="22"> And of these five technologies of the future, Cuba is now one of the world leaders (with the United States) in the one that is most important: biotechnology and genetic engineering.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="23"> By the year 2000 this market will have a volume of $200 billion, and Cuba will dominate a large part of it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="24"> The following report presents a summary of numerous interviews with directors of Cuban biomedical and biotechnology institutions, and provides the most extensive account that has yet been published abroad on the spectacular advances made by the Cuban Biotechnology School.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="25"> This lack of information is not due to any Cuban clamping down on the flow of information, but instead to the virtual censorship of reports of any success of the Cuban process, a censorship that prevails in almost all of the Western communications media.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="27"> As in other laboratories all over the world, Cuba is also doing intensive work on the scourge of AIDS that, according to WHO [World Health Organization] estimates, has to date afflicted 12 million people.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="28"> In many countries, it is now one of the leading causes of death.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="29"> (In Mexico it was in fourth place in 1991).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="30"> The Cuban Biotechnology School's battle against AIDS is being waged on three fronts: the development of a vaccine against the virus; the design of accurate and inexpensive diagnostic systems for massive use in blood banks and with the population; and developing medications to treat "opportunistic" infections, that is, diseases that occur because of the AIDS-induced weakening of the immune system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="31"> The CIGB [Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Center] is one of the most important centers working to develop an AIDS vaccine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="32"> In a 62,000-square meter facility near Havana, over 600 scientists, most of whom are young, produce 160 different products, 30 of them developed through genetic engineering.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="33"> Its scientific staff has expertise in all of the modern methodology necessary, including genetic engineering, molecular biology and immunology, and advanced biochemistry, and it has the most advanced research and production hardware in the world, as revealed by an inspection tour of its labs and industrial facilities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="34"> Dr. Manuel Limonta, the director of the institution and of its scientific board, states: "Cuba will have an AIDS vaccine by 2000 or earlier".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="35"> He says they have "a working group that is developing a vaccine against AIDS using genetic engineering technology to prevent the disease".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="36"> This is a "strong group" which has already been working on this program for "a long period of time, and the group has produced significant results".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="37"> Limonta did not describe these "significant results," but from other sources we deduced that they have managed to isolate and characterize the specific viral strains responsible for HIV, and that they are now in the laboratory testing phase.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="38"> The CIGB director expresses confidence that they will manage to "bring AIDS under control" immunologically, and states categorically: "We are going to develop a vaccine".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="39"> [Dieterich Steffan] Before the French or Americans do?</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="40"> [Limonta] I do not know if it will happen before, but I believe it may be before 2000.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="41"> That is my personal belief.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="42"> I think it may be earlier than that, or it may be around that time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="43"> That is my view of the matter.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="44"> If it were not Dr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="45"> Limonta making this pronouncement, it might appear somewhat rash.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="46"> But Limonta is a "heavyweight" in this field, and his personal achievements and those of the institute he directs lend authority to his assertion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="47"> In support of this, the director of the CNIC [National Center for Scientific Research], Dr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="48"> Carlos Gutierrez, says that Limonta and his team "practically live in their labs when they are trying to solve something"; they are "extraordinarily dedicated to the work they are doing, and if they make such a statement, they are capable of doing it".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="49"> He recalled their achievement with interferon as an example.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="50"> When Limonta, working with a small team of young researchers, proposed producing interferon in Cuba, "people were talking of a minimum time frame of three to four years; they did it in 42 days--a truly record time, as everyone recognizes".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="51"> On the lengthy list of the successes of the CIGB and its director--many achieved in close collaboration with other Cuban scientific institutions--there are nearly 160 different products that have been developed by the CIGB, including about 30 produced through genetic engineering "from start to finish"; these are "recombinant products".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="52"> To convey an idea of what this means, Dr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="53"> Limonta explains that "in what is known as the Third World, Cuba is the only country that has developed -- from start to finish -- products through the use of genetic engineering, which are known and registered products, and which are exported.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="54"> Such products have not been developed in any of the other countries, even in countries that are much larger than Cuba, like China or India".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="55"> Just in 1993 the U.S.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="56"> Patent and Trademark Office in Washington registered three patents for the CIGB; by so doing, it recognized the originality of the products, and that Cuba is the only country with the technology and the methodology to produce them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="57"> It also recognized that the quality of these products meets the Food and Drug Administration standards, the most stringent in the world, and granted Cuba the exclusive right to produce and sell these products in U.S. territory for 17 years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="58"> These products include a preventive medication for myocardial infarction called "Estreptoquinasa" (registered as No. 07/703,778), the first vaccine for meningitis BC developed anywhere in the world (07/754,918) and the invertase sucrose enzyme which converts sugar into fructose.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="59"> For "Estreptoquinasa," Cuba -- with the exception of one U.S. firm -- is the only country that has produced this medication, says Limonta.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="60"> He explains that this product can dissolve clots in coronary arteries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="61"> "This medicine is capable of eliminating clots in a high percentage of patients when it is administered immediately after the infarction, and it prevents the infarction from progressing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="62"> So it acts as a preventive for myocardial infarction".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="63"> The patent registration for this product has already been applied for in over 40 countries; "They are going to grant it, for we know that we are the only ones who have developed an original process to make this medication.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="64"> Getting a patent of this type reflects the high technological capability of our institution; in this case, the technology is genetic engineering".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="65"> Studies of the drug produced in the United States have demonstrated that its biological effect is similar to that of the Cuban product; however, the Cuban medication is much cheaper than the U.S. drug.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="66"> "`Estreptoquinasa' was also developed in record time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="67"> From the time when the idea was first conceived until the product was registered as a medication, only four years elapsed".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="68"> On the average, in Cuba products are developed in less time than in U.S. and Japanese companies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="69"> "We have a study, done by U.S. and Japanese scientists, that says that we are 1.3 times more productive than they are, in terms of the time required to complete a product and put it to use, while complying with all the legal requirements".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="70"> In practice, this higher productivity coefficient may mean, for example, that a U.S. or Japanese product which requires 10 years for research and production, may be developed in seven years in Cuba.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="71"> The explanation offered by the Cuban scientists for such a surprising phenomenon is complex, but they all agree that the educational and scientific philosophy of the revolution, of which these young people are the result, is the key factor.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="72"> Another spectacular success of the CIGB is what is known as "nerve growth factor" which "is still not known elsewhere in the world," says Limonta, "because nobody else has been able to develop it".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="73"> This medication (a protein) is used to regenerate nervous system damage, and it "could also be useful in a disease like Alzheimer's".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="74"> The product has now entered the industrial production phase, which will enable it to be used in clinical trials.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="75"> Genetically Altered Animals and Plants</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="76"> Another line of research the CIGB is pursuing is the genetic modification of animals and plants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="77"> To date they have produced transgenic mice, rabbits, and fish.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="78"> Their goal is now to produce a genetically altered cow.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="79"> Limonta explains that in these animals a new trait or genetic information is introduced in the fertilized ovum, which the animal assimilates as its own and transmits hereditarily.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="80"> In this way, genetic changes can be produced, and new species can even be created.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="81"> The specific objective is to make mammals' milk -- in this case, cow's milk -- also produce medications.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="82"> "The cow is an excellent milk-producing laboratory.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="83"> If we can introduce in this laboratory the intelligence enabling it, in addition to milk, to also produce specific proteins, then we could have, for example, interferon production in cows.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="84"> It all seems quite simple".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="85"> "We would not need a complex and costly industrial interferon production process, which requires the use of fermentation equipment, close monitoring, etc. the entire process would be done solely in the animal.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="86"> We would extract the product from the milk and the milk would then be used normally".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="87"> [Dieterich Steffan] That sounds like science fiction.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="88"> [Limonta] Yes, but it is going to happen.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="89"> I am absolutely sure of it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="90"> We have already done it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="91"> We have obtained medications in rabbit milk.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="92"> [Dieterich Steffan] Do international specialists know this?</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="93"> [Limonta] The ones who read international publications do.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="94"> First we did this with mice to test the methodology.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="95"> Then we used rabbits to improve the methodology and produce medications.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="96"> That was again successful.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="97"> And now we are working to produce medications in larger animals, in cows.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="98"> We have not done that yet, but we are going to.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="99"> Growth Hormones</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="100"> Manuel Limonta also discussed the CIGB's progress in the control and use of growth hormones.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="101"> "We have worked on fish, and in this area we really have one of the most advanced groups in the world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="102"> We introduced the genetic information contained in the growth hormone in fish.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="103"> This causes the fish to grow very rapidly; they do not reach a larger size than normal, but they do so more quickly, because they incorporate their food better".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="104"> The time saved can be half or an even larger percentage compared with the normal growth period.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="105"> The fish -- in this case tilapia, a carp -- are still not reproducing in large quantities, but the fundamental step has been taken.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="106"> In the field of animal health they have created, for the first time anywhere in the world, a vaccine against cattle ticks, for which the patent is now being registered in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and other countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="107"> The development of a vaccine against porcine colibacillosis, a disease whose mortality rate among newborn pigs is 100 percent, is another notable scientific achievement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="108"> At the present time a more advanced version of this vaccine is being developed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="109"> In the area of plant health, the use of biotechnology has resulted in the increase of plants' resistance to specific pests.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="110"> A transgenic tobacco has been produced which resists the Manduca septa moth, an insect that destroys the tobacco leaf.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="111"> With this genetic modification, the moth is killed without damaging the leaf; this is accomplished without altering the plant's characteristics.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="112"> A potato that is resistant to one of the three types of virus that affects its seeds is another CIGB achievement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="113"> They are now working to develop resistance against the other two.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="114"> They have also produced a genetically altered cabbage with a moth-resistant gene.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="115"> They have also developed a transgenic sugarcane -- the first time in the world that a genetically altered sugarcane has been developed -- to have a sugarcane that is "more resistant to some pests".</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="116"> Other Achievements</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="117"> One of the CIGB's big achievements is the recombinant vaccine against hepatitis B, which is now used in over 20 countries; in Cuba it is given to all newborns as part of a nationwide program.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="118"> Another completely new product, now registered in Cuba and some other countries, but which is still not available on the market, is "skin growth factor," which is used to treat burns.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="119"> Some other important products include humanized monoclinal antibodies for treatment and, in the industrial area, new enzymes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="120"> One of these enzymes is "invertase sucrose" which transforms sugar into fructose; when fructose is used to sweeten or to improve flavor, the amount of sugar needed is reduced by 20 to 30 percent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="121"> The method and technology used for its industrial application are exclusively Cuban.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="122"> Against AIDS</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="123"> On the second front against AIDS, its diagnosis, Cuba has three different techniques.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="124"> The first was developed by the AIDS Research Laboratory, the second by the CIGB, and the third by the CIE [Immunoassay Center].</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="125"> In discussing the CIGB technique, Dr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="126"> Limonta commented that "unique diagnostic methods have been developed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="127"> For example, we have the `Aubio' system in which a drop of blood deposited on a plastic strip reacts with a series of genetically engineered components.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="128"> We deposit on the plastic strip structures similar to the proteins of the components of the virus membrane, plus a gold-based dye.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="129"> When the drop of blood comes into contact with the plastic strip, a change in coloration is produced, which indicates, simply by sight, whether the person has been infected".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="130"> This system has also been developed for use in diagnosing toxoplasmosis, hepatitis C, etc., and its use is now being expanded to other illnesses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="131"> It offers the advantage of not requiring special equipment to mix the blood and read the results, and does not even require a technician or electrical current, as the result is visible in ordinary natural light.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="132"> A different method has been developed by the CIE; it has substantially improved the classic method of immunodiagnosis by reducing the amounts of the blood samples and reagents by 10 percent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="133"> The efficacy of this diagnostic method (Ultra Micro Elisa-HIV) has been demonstrated in many countries, as well as in international evaluations by the AIDS Reference Centers affiliated with the World Health Organization and PAHO [Pan American Health Organization], for example in Brazil, Canada, and also in Cuba itself.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="134"> Now the CIE is marketing an AIDS diagnostic kit in many countries, which anyone can buy in drugstores.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="135"> The kit contains a paper filter, a pipette to extract a blood sample from the finger, and a form.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="136"> The blood sample is allowed to dry on the filter.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="137"> The person selects an anonymous personal code and lists it on the form (for example, ABC 345), and then sends the dried blood sample to a laboratory.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="138"> An automated reader, like the Cuban SUMA, reads the test and determines with a margin of accuracy of virtually 100 percent whether that person is HIV-positive.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="139"> The person later calls the laboratory, gives his anonymous personal code, and receives the results with absolute confidentiality and privacy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="140"> This system is now used in many countries, including Spain, where its use has been approved by the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="141"> The market price is on the average between 20 and 30 percent less than the price of other products, and the CIE provides technical personnel and technical, analytic, or instrumental assistance as needed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="142"> This is very convenient, says the CIE's director of quality control, Dr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="143"> Rene Robaina, because "when an institution -- like a blood bank -- needs assistance, we are there.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="144"> We provide complete attention that includes everything from the lab setup, personnel training, and later assistance".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="145"> Another advantage of this personalized AIDS diagnosis -- registered internationally under the name of HIPERTEST -- is that the paper filter containing the blood sample can be sent by mail or messenger, as it is highly stable.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="146"> Once it is dry, it will last for months without the accuracy of the diagnosis being altered.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="147"> The HIPERTEST is not sold in Mexico, but "this could be done perfectly well; we simply have to find a transfer mechanism," says Robaina, "similar, for example, to what we have in the form of joint capital ventures in Russia, Brazil, Colombia, Spain, China, Ghana, etc".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="148"> The test is produced exclusively in the Immunoassay Center; the filter paper, which must have an extremely homogenous quality, is imported from Germany; the chemical reagents also come from the world market, while the biological reagents are mostly produced in Cuba.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="149"> The technology is exclusively Cuban.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="150"> At the CNIC, medicines are being developed against diseases that occur because of the weakening of immunological defenses caused by AIDS.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="151"> "We are working on medications to alleviate AIDS; we still cannot cure it," says Dr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="152"> Carlos Gutierrez, "but we can try to get rid of the other diseases.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="153"> We know there are medications that have slightly lengthened the lives of patients, and we are trying to do that.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="154"> We are investigating the possibility of a combination of those medications, and we are now at a more advanced level than laboratory testing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="155"> From the laboratory we then go to bench testing, then to the pilot plant, and finally to the industrial plant.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="156"> We are now at the bench testing stage.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="157"> If we can produce this medication, we could extend patients' lives".</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="158"> More Vaccines</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="159"> The Finlay Institute, with an area of 23,000 square meters--unequalled in Latin America, and one of the most modern in the world--has 650 employees.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="160"> It developed the world's first vaccine against meningitis, and in 1990 it was awarded a Gold Model by the United Nations' World Intellectual Property Organization for this achievement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="161"> This vaccine was developed in barely five years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="162"> The researchers had to work with live microorganisms, creating a high risk of infection, as there is no other vaccine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="163"> "We took all possible hygienic precautions," explains Dr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="164"> Concepcion Carma, director of the institute and coordinator of the research group that developed the vaccine, "but we had to work with large volumes of bacteria: we are talking of kilograms of live bacteria -- that were grown in large 300-liter fermentation vats -- and that was a real risk".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="165"> The first volunteers who used the vaccine were the researchers themselves, because "as a matter of ethical policy, we believed that what we could not put in ourselves we could not ask anyone else to try.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="166"> And when we tested the vaccine in children, we applied the same ethical standard.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="167"> Our own children were the first ones who used the vaccine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="168"> Only later did we go to field testing," explains the doctor.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="169"> This vaccine is now being used in a number of Latin American countries (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, etc).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="170"> where meningitis is prevalent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="171"> In Brazil over 20 million doses have been administered without any severe adverse reactions being reported.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="172"> In the Cuban trials, the vaccine demonstrated an efficacy of 83 to 98 percent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="173"> Another important line of research is the anticholera vaccine, which has already undergone laboratory testing with "important results".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="174"> When the animal testing is completed, the three phases of trials with human beings will begin, followed by field testing, which will have to be done in some Latin American country, as Cuba is the only country in the hemisphere where cholera does not exist.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="176"> At the entry to the CNIC in Havana, the visitor can read a statement by Fidel Castro: "The future of our nation necessarily belongs to men of science".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="177"> In this institution which is the leader and promoter of Cuban biotechnology, that quotation has become a reality, as its major achievements attest.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="178"> Among them is PPG [Policosanol] which combats one of the principal risk factors for infarction: high cholesterol levels.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="179"> PPG, which began to be marketed in August 1991, was developed from components found in sugarcane, whose solutions have properties that reduce certain types of cholesterol.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="180"> At this time 200,000 Cubans are using PPG regularly, and the results are positive in terms of the patients' physical, psychological, and even sexual reactions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="181"> The medication has now been approved for use in 12 countries, and its patent application is pending in 22 more countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="182"> Each pill costs $1, and the minimum recommended dosage is one tablet a day.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="183"> Other products whose action is similar to that of PPG (the "estatinas" [meaning unknown]) are from 1.5 to two times more expensive.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="184"> They are also trying to extract from sugarcane the raw material to produce phytosteroids, in order to manufacture steroidal hormones, the basic element of anticontraceptive pills.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="185"> The CNIC has developed the new product beyond the laboratory stage, which includes testing with animals, and it is now in the pilot plant level.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="186"> Another of the island's natural resources that is being used in biomedicine and biotechnology is Cuba's coral reefs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="187"> Since the Cuban revolution has been careful with the nation's ecology, the corals are practically free from pollution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="188"> Dr. Gutierrez feels that the corals, in human medicine, are "better than synthetic materials," because synthetic materials introduce molecules that may be detrimental to the human organism; so at least in secondary aspects, natural materials outperform artificial materials.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="189"> Scientific studies have revealed that certain species of coral are materials that can be used for transplants or grafts, due to their great biocompatibility with human bone tissue, both because of their ideal architecture (a porous structure that is tridimensionally interconnected) and because of their physico-mechanical and biochemical properties (calcium phosphates).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="191"> A treatment developed by the CNIC that is unique in the world is the use of ozone therapy in treating retinitis pigmentosa which, if left untreated, leads to blindness.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="192"> With the use of ozone therapy the advance of the disease has been halted, and patients' sight has been improved: "We have been seeing patients for two years," says Dr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="193"> Gutierrez, "and they have not gotten worse, but improved.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="194"> This has not been done anywhere else in the world".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="195"> Originally the equipment that converts oxygen into ozone was imported, and Cubans then developed innovative applications for ozone for both therapeutic and industrial uses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="196"> At the CIMEQ [Medical and Surgical Research Center] ozone therapy is being used to dissolve components of blood clots.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="197"> After five years of animal experiments, the treatment was applied to human beings.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="198"> For coronary and cerebral disease, the technique is still in an experimental stage, but it is now being used for arterial obstructions in the lower extremities, as an alternative to dilation or laser treatment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="199"> The results have been presented at international conferences in Vienna, Paris, Brazil, and Uruguay.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="200"> Another important line of research that the CNIC is pursuing is the use of monoclinal antibodies for diagnosing plant diseases; for example, there is a product that diagnoses the "tristeza" [babesia] virus which attacks citrus crops.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="201"> This disease does not exist in Cuba, but purchasers of citrus fruit require proof that the fruit does not have this disease; by using this diagnostic tool, this is easy to demonstrate.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="202"> Medical Equipment</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="203"> For diagnoses in clinical neurophysiology (of the central nervous system), computerized equipment has been developed, like the "Neuronica" or "Medicid".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="204"> The "Neuronica" is used to measure visual and auditory perception and brain waves during sleep.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="205"> The "Medicid" is very useful in analyzing the nervous system and cerebral functions (cerebral mapping); for example, it provides a computerized readout of electroencephalograms [EEG's] and displays the results on a monitor.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="206"> Due to the U.S. embargo, Cubans have produced all the computer programs for this equipment, which is now in use in Mexico.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="207"> The "Diramic" is another computerized device that provides a rapid microbiological diagnosis; in four hours it determines with reliability the type of infection and its pattern of sensitivity to antibiotics (antibiogram), a diagnosis that requires 72 hours when conventional methods are used.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="208"> By indicating the most effective antibiotics for a specific infection, it avoids the development of bacterial resistance, the ineffective use of antibiotics, and fatal outcomes in serious infections.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="209"> Because of the short analysis time, the small volume that it requires, and its low cost, it is possible to corroborate the results as often as may be desirable.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="210"> Another advantage of the system is that it can be used not only for samples of isolated and purified strains of bacteria, but also for direct specimens from blood or urine cultures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="211"> In First World countries equipment with similar functions does exist, but it is four to five times more expensive.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="212"> The "Diramic" is faster and cheaper, and Cuba is now able to export it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="213"> The CIE has developed the SUMA ultramocroanalytic system for the low-cost analysis of laboratory samples.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="214"> This is primarily useful in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, in blood banks, in epidemiology, and for various health programs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="215"> The SUMA is the result of 18 years of research, and the CIE in Havana, the producer of the equipment, has SUMA laboratories in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="216"> The equipment is used to detect AIDS, hepatitis B, meningococcus, alphafetoproteins, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="217"> In Cuba the SUMA is used for the prenatal diagnosis of virtually all pregnant women to detect congenital malformations like neural tube defects and hypothyroidism.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="218"> Dengue and Cholera</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="219"> The Pedro Kouri Tropical Medicine Institute, which is responsible for protecting the Cuban population from epidemics of infectious diseases, has kept any infectious disease from Africa from spreading in Cuba, despite the return home of tens of thousands of Cuban soldiers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="220"> To do so, highly efficient diagnostic tools have been developed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="221"> There is a diagnostic system for dengue fever, which is now in use in many Latin American countries, reports Dr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="222"> Alina Llop.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="223"> This rapid detection diagnostic kit for antibodies is sold commercially as a kit, and this is unique on the international market.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="224"> Similar kits have been developed to detect streptococcus group B, which provides results in three hours.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="225"> In addition, analyses of meningitis infections and cholera, which with conventional methods take no less than four days, can be obtained in eight hours with the new Cuban molecular biology diagnostic systems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="226"> Cuba is probably the only country in Latin America that has these systems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="227"> Another system of great importance for the Third World is a new diagnostic tool for amebiasis which, based on molecular biology, has a 100 percent accuracy rate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="228"> This obviously eliminates the uncertainties inherent in conventional methods.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="229"> There are also other biomedical and bioscientific areas, for example, the development of computers for medical imaging in which Cuba is one of the world leaders.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="230"> Young Scientists</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="231"> The key factor that explains -- in the widely held opinion of the directors interviewed -- the spectacular advances of the Cuban Biotechnology School is the priority that has been given since 1959 to education and public health, thanks to which they now have a "critical mass" of young scientists of high quality, creativity, and discipline.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="232"> The human factor is actually the only element that differentiates the Cuban Biotechnology School from advanced laboratories in the United States, Europe, and Japan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="233"> All high-tech laboratories use the same technological equipment, which explains why a visitor who enters the technological facilities of the Cuban research and production centers will find the same type of Swiss bioreactors, huge Japanese electron microscopes, German tomographic equipment, and French mass spectrometers that their First World counterparts have.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="234"> And the same thing is true for the chemical and biological raw materials that are not produced in Cuba.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="235"> The political determination of the Cuban state, the efficient network of cooperation between research and production institutions, the unusual combination of basic and applied research, as well as the strong insistence that the products must meet international standards of quality, are all factors that have contributed to this success.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="236"> Because of the U.S. embargo, Cuban scientific institutions have necessarily had to work with European and Japanese multinationals, with U.S. corporations remaining outside the commercial development of this enormous Cuban potential.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="237"> However, it is probable that the U.S. business elite will not tolerate this exclusion for much longer; instead, it will probably opt -- as it did with Vietnam -- to cooperate with Cuban biotechnology, and that will be the raison d'etre for putting an end to the embargo.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="238"> Cuba's continuing emergence from isolation throughout Latin America and Europe, the reconciliation with the Miami exiles, and the extraordinary internal reforms are all leading in the same direction.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="239"> So if the cohesion of the Cuban model can resist for the next two or three years, Cuba will become -- with the exception of Costa Rica -- the only Latin American national project with solid foundations enabling it to leave underdevelopment behind and emerge from the "backyard" of the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="240"> (For reviewing the medical aspects of this report, I wish to thank Dr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-33295" num="241"> Luis Felipe Bojalil J., distinguished professor at the Metropolitan-Xochimilco Autonomous University, and a recipient of the Science Award from the Academy of Scientific Research).</s>
