<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="11"> Ever since Congress passed the Clean Air Act in 1970, the nation has marshaled its political, economic and technological forces to rid the skies of health-threatening air pollution.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="12"> Billions of dollars have been spent to control emissions from motor vehicles, factories, refineries and power plants.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="13"> Still stricter standards are planned.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="14"> Yet, for all the efforts to restore blue skies to the nation's smoggiest cities, a growing body of scientific evidence suggests that when it comes to human health, indoor contaminants may pose the most pervasive air pollution threat of all.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="15"> Concentrations of some toxic, cancer-causing and mutagenic pollutants found indoors are up to 100 times greater indoors than they are outdoors.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="16"> They far exceed limits placed on the same pollutants in outdoor air by the federal Clean Air Act.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="17"> From tobacco smoke and radioactive radon gas to molds, fungi, combustion products and everyday household products like air fresheners and pesticides, humans are being exposed in their homes, offices and vehicles to thousands of chemical and biological agents.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="18"> Couple these concentrations with the fact that most people spend between 80% to 90% of their time in increasingly tight energy-efficient buildings, and indoor pollution becomes especially worrisome.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="19"> How worrisome remains an open question.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="20"> Aside from the severe effects of indoor pollutants like asbestos, lead and carbon monoxide, little is known about the health threat posed by other pollutants commonly found in homes and offices.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="21"> Still, scientists say that it is reasonable to conclude that as exposures increase indoors, so do the risks.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="22"> "Sufficient evidence exists to conclude that indoor air pollution represents a major portion of the public's exposure to air pollution and may pose serious acute and chronic health risks," the U.S.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="23"> Environmental Protection Agency said in a report to Congress earlier this year.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="24"> Estimates by some individual researchers indicate that indoor pollution could rank among the top 10 causes of death in the United States.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="25"> Scientists for years have appealed to the EPA for greater attention to indoor pollution issues.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="26"> Their pleas have met with little success.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="27"> During the Reagan Administration, EPA requests for research funds were repeatedly reduced, and the Bush Administration has allowed only modest increases.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="28"> While the EPA staff has estimated that $20 million a year would be needed for indoor air pollution research -- the figure now proposed in legislation by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me).</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="29"> and Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass).</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="30"> -- the Bush Administration this year is spending only $2.68 million.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="31"> The Bush Administration opposes the Mitchell and Kennedy bills, which are scheduled for votes next year.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="32"> Still, even with limited funds, the EPA is calling for studies to pin down the health effects of indoor pollution.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="33"> It is also seeking ways to reduce indoor contaminants as well as a joint effort by government and industry to develop a voluntary program to upgrade building ventilation standards as well as building design, and improved operation and maintenance of heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="34"> In a report made public earlier this month, the EPA compared risks of 20 different environmental problems.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="35"> Radon, indoor air pollution and pesticide residues on foods pose the greatest health risk but received the least amount of federal spending on those problems, the report said.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="36"> Toxic dumps and leaking underground gasoline storage tanks pose far less risk but receive the lion's share of money and attention from the EPA, the study said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="37"> "We concentrate on the big visible sources, chemical plants and oil refineries and outdoor air but the true exposures are the little things under your nose," said Lance Wallace, a leading authority on indoor pollution.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="38"> Wallace, an EPA scientist, has pioneered studies aimed at determining the "total exposure" to pollutants from all sources, both outdoor and indoor.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="39"> The EPA has estimated that indoor pollution may cost "tens of billions" of dollars annually when medical spending and lost productivity are added up.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="40"> The Consumer Federation of America has placed the costs as high as $100 billion a year.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="41"> List of Dangers</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="42"> A bewildering array of organic compounds from household products form the catalogue of indoor pollution threats:</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="43"> * Asbestos, found in cement and insulation, can lead to lung cancer or asbestosis, a chronic lung ailment.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="44"> Numerous asbestos-abatement programs are under way in schools and public buildings.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="45"> In July, the EPA banned most remaining uses of asbestos.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="46"> * Lead, which retards intellectual and emotional development in children, can be found in older plumbing and in household dust as old paint deteriorates or is chipped away during remodeling.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="47"> * Radon, a radioactive gas, invades homes through cracks in the foundation and is the nation's second leading cause of lung cancer.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="48"> It may be present at levels the EPA considers unsafe in as many as 12 million U.S. homes; levels have been found to be generally below EPA guidelines in Southern California.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="49"> * Formaldehyde, a probable human cancer-causing agent, wafts from foam insulation, plywood and particle board.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="50"> * Benzene, a known human carcinogen, is found in cigarette smoke and gasoline.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="51"> * Nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and fine particulates that can cause respiratory illnesses spew from kerosene heaters and unvented or poorly maintained gas appliances.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="52"> * Chemicals that are known animal carcinogens or toxics are frequently found at very low levels in air fresheners, shoe polish, paints, printed materials, household cleaners, solvents, moth balls and dry-cleaned clothes.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="53"> * An estimated 84% of U.S. households use home pesticides, many of which have never been tested to determine their health effects.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="54"> The World Health Organization has estimated that up to 30% of new and remodeled buildings may be plagued by indoor air quality problems -- an estimate borne out by widespread reports of "sick building" illnesses, including government workers at the EPA's own headquarters in Washington.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="55"> In California alone, there are 700 sick building reports a year.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="56"> EPA researchers have theorized that -- based on available data -- indoor pollution, including second-hand tobacco smoke, may account for up to 11,400 deaths each year.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="57"> Radon exposures may result in anywhere from 3,000 to 20,000 additional deaths.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="58"> Up to an estimated 30,000 additional deaths annually have been attributed by one scientist, Harriet Burge of the University of Michigan, to legionella bacteria that thrive in poorly maintained hospital systems for hot water, heating, air conditioning and ventilation.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="59"> But even if far fewer cancers are caused by indoor pollutants than EPA estimates suggest, there remains cause for concern.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="60"> Many researchers believe that the greatest and most costly problem posed by indoor pollution may well be the chronic, non-cancerous but debilitating health effects that result in higher medical costs, absenteeism and reduced productivity in the workplace.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="61"> Few today say that efforts to control outdoor air pollution are unimportant or that they must stop.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="62"> But a growing number of scientists say the threat to human health from indoor pollution can no longer be ignored.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="63"> "If we measured outdoors what we are measuring indoors, there would be a tremendous hue and cry to clean up outdoor air," Wallace said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="64"> The embryonic indoor air pollution programs of both the state and federal governments pale in significance when compared to spending on other environmental health problems.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="65"> In California, while radon tied with worker exposure to hazardous chemicals as the No. 1 cancer risk, it ranked last in state spending on 25 environmental problems as recently as two years ago.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="66"> Likewise, all other indoor air pollution ranked fourth on the list of cancer risks, but 11th in spending among the 25 environmental problems.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="67"> As early as 1981, the National Academy of Sciences described indoor air pollution as a potentially significant human health problem.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="68"> It called for a wide-ranging research effort.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="69"> But it wasn't until 1985 that the magnitude of the indoor pollution threat became readily apparent.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="70"> A five-year EPA study surveyed 600 individuals in six cities to find out what their exposure was to 20 different chemicals, some of which have been linked with cancer and birth defects.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="71"> Researchers were startled by the findings.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="72"> It did not matter whether the study participants lived in the Los Angeles area next to an oil refinery or in a pristine rural setting.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="73"> Indoor concentrations of the 20 chemical compounds studied were almost always higher, often by as much as 10 times or more, than they were outdoors.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="74"> Peak concentrations in some homes were 200 to 500 times higher than outdoors.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="75"> Indoor Sources</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="76"> Blood samples and breath tests revealed that participants from rural areas were burdened with as much chemical contaminants in their systems as urban dwellers -- a fact that researchers said could only point to indoor sources of pollution common in every household.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="77"> The study's findings left questions that must still be resolved:</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="78"> Are higher exposures indoors necessarily dangerous?</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="79"> What are the cumulative and synergistic effects, if any, of simultaneous exposures to more than 600 compounds from building materials and household products found in homes?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="80"> Are health risks too high or are they comparable to everyday risks that most people take for granted, like driving on a freeway?</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="81"> Will serious health effects take years to show up, as proved to be the case with asbestos?</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="82"> Can it be reasonably assumed that because high doses of some pollutants produce unquestionable adverse health effects in animals that the low-level exposures that most humans experience indoors are also harmful?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="83"> What is clear is that the elderly, young children and those who suffer from respiratory problems or are chemically sensitive are particularly vulnerable to indoor contaminants.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="84"> Studies in the United States and Britain have found, for example, that children who are exposed to elevated levels of nitrogen dioxide, a combustion product emitted by kerosene heaters and gas appliances, had more than twice the incidence of respiratory illness as children who were not exposed.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="85"> Their symptoms included fever, chest pain, productive cough, wheeze, chest cold, physician-diagnosed bronchitis, physician-diagnosed pneumonia and asthma.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="86"> Benzene, a known human carcinogen, has been found in far higher concentrations indoors than outdoors.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="87"> In Los Angeles, the EPA found that 71.2% of exposure to benzene occurred indoors.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="88"> Benzene is emitted by synthetic fibers, plastics and some cleaning solutions.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="89"> It is also present in gasoline fumes and cigarette smoke.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="90"> Wallace said that 37 participants in the air pollution exposure studies who filled their own gasoline tanks at self-service pumps had twice as much benzene in their breath two to five hours after filling up the gas tank as 300 other participants who did not fill their own tanks.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="91"> But Wallace added that "the most important exposure to benzene is cigarettes".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="92"> Cigarette Smoke</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="93"> Benzene levels in homes with smokers were 30% to 50% higher than in nonsmoking households.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="94"> Smokers and those around them are exposed to an estimated 4,600 chemical constituents in cigarette smoke, a number of them cancer-causing.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="95"> Various studies have estimated that environmental tobacco smoke may account for upwards of 5,000 deaths a year among nonsmokers.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="96"> Indeed, EPA scientist James L.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="97"> Repace has said that the risks of indoor air pollution from tobacco smoke to nonsmokers are almost twice as great as from radon gas, and more than a hundred times as great as the total death rate from all cancer-causing hazardous outdoor air pollutants regulated by the EPA under the Clean Air Act.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="98"> Scientists have noted that a 1985 study published by the American Journal of Public Health showed "significant increases" in deaths due to leukemia and lymphomas among people who were exposed as children to parental smoking.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="99"> Each year, there are 200,000 emergency room admissions due to allergies and a third of them are believed to be caused by microbiologicals contaminants found indoors, according to Burge, the director of the University of Michigan's allergy research laboratories at Ann Arbor.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="100"> "We know that microbial contamination exists.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="101"> We know that it causes disease and without a doubt it causes a significant number of lost work days at a cost to society," said Burge.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="104"> They can also proliferate in hot water systems if the water is not kept at temperatures of at least 113 degrees Fahrenheit.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="105"> Porous insulation and filters combined with excessive humidity make for an ideal growing medium for microbiologicals.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="106"> Formaldehyde, which is widely used in building materials and furnishings, can cause eye, nose and throat irritation, coughing, skin rashes, headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and nosebleeds.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="107"> It also causes nasal cancer in rats and is thus a suspected human carcinogen.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="108"> Generally, the newer the building material or furnishings, the higher the formaldehyde gas emissions.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="109"> High temperatures and humidity can compound the problem.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="110"> Today, most pressed-wood product manufacturers have taken steps to lower concentrations of formaldehyde to acceptable levels, even in mobile homes where the problem was once greatest.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="111"> But researchers continue to find a 10-fold difference in emission from identical products produced by different manufacturers.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="112"> Carpet makers stopped using formaldehyde in 1981.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="113"> Also of special concern is methylene chloride, which can produce cancer in animals and is widely used in paint removers and as a propellant in aerosol spray paint and can affect oxygen uptake in the blood like carbon monoxide.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="114"> Some half billion pounds are produced annually, and half of that goes into consumer products.</s>

<s docid="LA122689-0070" num="119"> A good deal of scientific uncertainity exists over what, if any, the effects of long-term exposure to p-Dichlorobenzene may be, but the EPA said it would be "prudent" to avoid non-essential consumer products containing the chemical.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="9"> Coroner's officials said Friday that 12 people who died during a nightlong religious ceremony in a closed, four-room house asphyxiated from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a butane-gas lantern used for light.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="10"> Victor Vazquez, a deputy district attorney here, said the windows and doors of the small house in Colonia Mariano Matamoros on the southeastern edge of the city were shut tight, keeping fresh air from getting inside.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="11"> There apparently were no vents in the house that would have allowed the gas to escape.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="12"> "It was definitely an accident," Vazquez said of the Thursday-morning incident.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="13"> As the lantern continued to burn, people began falling asleep, a symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning, officials said.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="14"> Not everyone in the house died; five victims were found unconscious and hospitalized.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="15"> A sixth survivor -- who was said to have escaped sometime during the ceremony -- was taken to the hospital later Thursday and was in serious condition.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="16"> Three remained comatose Friday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="17"> Many of the dead and injured are related.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="18"> Among the dead were two mothers, each of whom perished along with her two children.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="19"> Also killed were a husband and wife.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="20"> Mexican authorities have now ruled out a fruit punch found at the house as a source of the deaths.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="21"> The group drank the fruit punch, which one survivor said led to screaming, and officials at first believed the beverage was contaminated with an industrial solvent or alcohol.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="22"> The all-night religious ritual apparently played a role in the deaths.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="23"> On several occasions Wednesday night, people tried to enter the house but were turned away by the group's spiritual leader, Federico Padres Mexia, or others who were participating in the religious ceremony that included chanting and standing or sitting inside a circle delineated by a rope with 13 knots that was laid on the floor.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="24"> Mexia, 61, is now in a coma.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="25"> A survivor, Alfredo Osuna Hernandez, 22, said the group was engaged in a "cleansing" ritual that began early Wednesday night.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="26"> Asked why no one left to seek help, Osuna said, "It is very damaging to leave the circle".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="27"> The daughter of one of the victims, Ana Faviola Miranda Juarez, 19, who entered the house early Thursday morning, said it smelled strongly of gas.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="28"> She didn't disturb the apparently slumbering occupants, who included her mother, because she felt the ritual was still under way, and said some of the people were snoring.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="29"> Her mother, Gloria Miranda Juarez, 45, owned the home and lived there with Mexia.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="30"> She was among the dead.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="31"> News of the deaths continued to consume Tijuana and its media on Friday.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="32"> Some relatives of the victims were furious over Mexican newspaper reports characterizing the deaths as a result of some satanic rite.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="33"> Several family members who gathered outside a public hospital, awaiting word on their loved ones, said that their relatives were staunch Roman Catholics, and that some had gone to Mass on Wednesday to celebrate the religious holiday of Our Lady of Guadalupe.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="34"> Jesus Moreno, 23, whose sister died and whose mother is comatose, said his mother recited the rosary every night and blessed her children.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="35"> "The man who ran the tortilla shop told my mother our whole family was under a spell of bad luck," Moreno said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="36"> His mother thought that perhaps he was right, because of the family's lack of jobs and money.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="37"> Out of curiosity, Moreno said, his mother went to the house.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="38"> On Friday, a picture of Mexia began to emerge, painted by those who live in the Colonia Mariano Matamoros shantytown, home to many migrants from the interior of Mexico, and by those in the Riverside County town of Sun City, where Mexia had a home.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="39"> He also lived briefly in Encinitas.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="40"> Mexia, a husky, 5-foot-8, 180-pound man, moved in with Gloria Miranda in July, according to neighbors.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="41"> She had first moved into the house a few months before.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="42"> The home, with its brown stucco walls, pitched roof, glass windows and beach-ball-size satellite dish bolted above the front door, stood out from the others in the dusty, teeming hillside community, where most houses are little more than shacks with tar-paper walls and corrugated metal roofs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="43"> Soon after Mexia moved in, word spread that he was a spiritual leader who, often through mediums, conducted religious cleansing rituals at the house, where he was building a chapel in the yard because God was coming, a neighbor said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="44"> "He said God was coming down because he (Mexia) had asked him to," said Isabel Mendez, 30, who lives nearby.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="45"> "He said it was going to make this community very famous, and lots of reporters were going to arrive, and lots of hotels would be built".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="46"> Another neighbor, Daria Machado, 26, a mother of two, said there always seemed to be a lot of people at Mexia's house, and the religious ceremonies took place often, though not necessarily late into the night.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="47"> It was common to see cars with California licenses parked around the house, she said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="48"> "They would go inside, and you wouldn't see them anymore," Machado said.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="49"> "The house is very closed up with curtains on the windows so you couldn't see much".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="50"> Mexia became friendly with Rafael Corchado Meraz, 37, who operated La Costena, a neighborhood tortilla shop.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="51"> Corchado, an American citizen who lived in Tijuana, became one of Mexia's strongest supporters, sometimes urging his customers and his workers to attend the rituals, which several of them did.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="52"> After finishing his tortilla deliveries, Corchado would frequently go to Mexia's house and spend the rest of the day there.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="53"> He told people in the neighborhood that the prayer meetings with Mexia would cure them of their bad luck, which kept them unemployed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="54"> That message resounded loud and clear in a barrio where people are poor and many had traveled a long distance from the interior of Mexico to look for jobs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="55"> Corchado went to the house Wednesday night.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="56"> He was among those found dead.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="57"> "He would ask me if I wanted to go," said Jorge Reyes Castro, 18, who worked at the tortilla factory.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="58"> "He said they would cure people there, and that they were going to see God.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="59"> He said everyone would sit in a chair and close their eyes, and then their body would be like asleep.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="60"> And that they would sleep three to four hours and talk to God".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="61"> Rosa Oralia Valenzuela, 18, was among those waiting Friday outside the intensive care unit at the hospital to learn the condition of their brothers, sisters or parents.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="62"> Oralia, whose two sisters-in-law died and whose father-in-law was in a coma, said she had attended a few of Mexia's sessions.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="63"> At the first meeting, she said, she was introduced to a woman named Conchita who Mexia said was a medium through whom God would speak.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="64"> Oralia said Conchita sat in an armchair and stood up as each person went up to her.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="65"> Conchita would have the people lift their arms, turn over their palms and describe their problems.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="66"> Oralia said she was reluctant to tell the medium anything.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="67"> "So she looked at me and said, 'Here is the key to luck'.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="68"> I looked down, and I saw she had pressed nothing into my hand," Conchita said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="69"> On Wednesday night, when the deadly carbon monoxide episode began, Mexia had told people that a particularly powerful medium from nearby Rosarito Beach would be coming to the session.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="70"> It's not known whether the medium arrived.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="71"> Neighbors of Mexia's in Sun City, a community of about 11,000 east of Lake Elsinore, said Mexia moved into a beige, Spanish-style stucco house in a new subdivision about two years ago from Encinitas.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="72"> The house in the 28000 block of Calle Gaviota has been for sale for a year.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="73"> It was first offered at $120,000, but is now on the market at $93,500.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="74"> They knew him to be a concrete mason who did some work on his driveway and who at times also helped other neighbors with their concrete work.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="75"> One neighbor, who declined to be identified, said Mexia told him that his wife had moved to Mexico City and that he was now living in Tijuana with another woman at a house he had built for about $8,000.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="76"> Shirley Hosking, who lives next door to Mexia's house in Sun City, described him as a quiet person, who told her landlord that "he had died and went to heaven twice, and that God gave him a book".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="77"> She said he was living in the house with a woman named Martha who she thought was his wife, but she apparently moved out last summer with the help of family members.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="78"> "He was kind of weird in odd ways," Hosking said.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="79"> "He had a car with a dead battery, and every day he jumped it".</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="80"> She said she had loaned him a battery charger and he had it for three to four months.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="81"> He used it only to start his car, and not to charge the battery.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="82"> Mexia also once lived in Encinitas.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="83"> A former neighbor in the 700 block of Snapdragon Street recalled that Mexia had a heart condition and was retired.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="84"> He didn't seem particularly religious, at least compared to his wife, Martha, said Berta Smith.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="85"> "Martha was a good friend of mine.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="86"> She come up every day for coffee.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="87"> She did (housecleaning) work in Solana Beach and Del Mar," Smith said.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="88"> "They moved to Sun City, and we were sorry to see them go".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="89"> Found inside the house in Tijuana were three psalmbooks, said Jaime Sam Fierro, a commander of the Baja California judicial police.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="90"> Two of the books showed they were from El Templo de Mediodia -- the Midday Church -- and were dated 1980.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="91"> The third book was entitled "Oraciones Dadas al Sexto Sello" -- Prayers Given to the Sixth Seal -- which refers to apocalyptic visions of God's judgment in the Book of Revelation.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="92"> Dr. Gustavo Salazar, head pathologist in the Tijuana coroner's office, said the conclusion of carbon monoxide poisoning was based on preliminary results of six autopsies conducted Friday.</s>

<s docid="LA121590-0131" num="93"> Internal organs and tissues of the dead, including livers, stomachs, lungs and intestines, are being turned over to the San Diego County medical examiner's office for more detailed toxicology tests, Vazquez said.</s>

<s docid="LA010489-0041" num="8"> The New Year's weekend deaths of four members of a San Joaquin Valley family who apparently succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning while awaiting entry into the United States resulted from a freak accident that is apparently unprecedented along the U.S.-Mexico border, authorities said Tuesday.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010489-0041" num="9"> The four were discovered unconscious shortly after midnight Monday in the back of a pickup truck, equipped with a camper shell, that had waited more than three hours to enter the United States via the crossing at Calexico, 100 miles east of San Diego.</s>

<s docid="LA010489-0041" num="10"> The camper's windows were shut but there were rust holes in the pickup's bed, said authorities, who theorized that the deadly gas -- a byproduct of gasoline combustion -- may have entered through the holes or via a malfunctioning exhaust system.</s>

<s docid="LA010489-0041" num="24"> "Maybe instead of a 3-hour wait, there would have been a 2-hour wait," Kelliher said, noting that Calexico can only accommodate 8 lanes of traffic, most of which were open all of the time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="16"> [Text] Watch out for those stoves and cooking ranges.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="17"> While the heat is warming our bodies, our bronchi are battling with nitrogen dioxide.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="18"> According to research on nitrogen dioxide density conducted by the Paedal Environmental Federation, upon the request of SISA JOURNAL, higher rates were shown in office buildings, offices with gas stoves, and areas closer to stoves than those shown in streets, offices without gas stoves, and areas further away from stoves.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="19"> On 25 March, the nitrogen dioxide density of an office near Socho high school in Socho-tong was 79.2 ppb [parts per billion].</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="20"> This is the second highest reading among over 400 areas inspected.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="21"> The reading on streets and a subway station near the same area on the same day was 32 and 64 ppb, respectively, lower than the one in the office.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="22"> During the first inspection, a heating system was on in the office.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="23"> In order to measure the effect of heaters, we took a reading a second time on 14 April.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="24"> A stove was on that day and the nitrogen dioxide density reached 110.7 ppb.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="25"> The density of nitrogen dioxide was higher when the stove was on because the flame produces more pollutants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="26"> The stove in the office was using liquefied petroleum gas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="27"> The density was 96 ppb beside the stove, 67 ppb a little further from the stove, 110.7 ppb and 99.8 near the windows, and 38.4 ppb at the entrance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="28"> It was understandable that the density reading next to the stove was high, but it was unexpected that the highest reading was next to the window.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="29"> It is believed that the pollutant produced by the flame expanded in the form of nitrogen monoxide and later it combined with the oxygen near the window to become nitrogen dioxide.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="30"> Nitrogen monoxide is an unstable material.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="31"> On the other hand, the nitrogen dioxide density was the lowest at the entrance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="32"> This was because the entrance was far from the stove and the air circulated whenever the door was opened.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="33"> Contrary to this example, three points distant to each other in one office without any stove showed a much lower and even density at 43, 51, and 52 ppb, respectively.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="34"> This was because there was no particular pollutant source such as a stove.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="35"> However, the office still showed an equal or higher density than the ones in the streets nearby.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="36"> This means that nitrogen dioxide pollution is more serious indoors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="37"> The research illustrates the importance of air circulation in order to keep indoor air clean.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="38"> However, this is meaningless when the air outdoors is polluted.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="39"> Air has no bounderies and indoor air is eventually affected by air pollution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="40"> Therefore, the alternative is to widen exhaust ports and use fans to circulate indoor air.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="41"> Using an air cleaner to filter pollutants from outdoor air is also a good idea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="42"> However, there is a limit to air cleaners.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="43"> When not properly managed and watched, they may have reverse effects by accumulating dust or pollutants full of bacteria in the outlets or in filters.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="44"> This is the same reason why the nitrogen dioxide density in subway stations are twice as high as the streets above.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="45"> The research focused on nitrogen dioxide but there are various pollutant and pollution sources of indoor air.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="46"> There are countless sources and pollutants around us: gas ranges and gas stoves which produce nitrogen dioxide, oil burners which produce sulfurous acid gas and cancer-causing (?forum) aldehyde, briquet holes and briquet heaters which produce carbon monoxide, radon and asbestos from construction materials, and (?forum) aldehyde from furniture and clothes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="47"> Nevertheless, studies or measures on this are far from sufficient.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="48"> Advanced countries have been aware of indoor pollution since the early seventies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="49"> Studies and regulation of such pollutants are active.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="50"> In some countries, there are even departments fully in charge of indoor environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67486" num="51"> According to Professor Kim Yun-sin, head of the Environmental and Industrial Medical Science Center of Hanyang University, in the United States, Congressman Joseph Kennedy submitted a bill on indoor air last year strengthening various regulations on indoor pollutants and detailing preventive and substitute measures.</s>

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="5"> MANCHESTER City Council was yesterday fined the maximum of Pounds 25,000 following the death of an elderly tenant after hundreds of gas heaters were wrongly installed by its workers.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="6"> Mr Paul Blackburn of the Health and Safety Executive told Mr Derrick Fairclough, Manchester stipendiary magistrate, that 800 of 1,840 gas warm-air heaters installed on 19 council estates in a replacement programme had had to be switched off to ensure the tenants' safety.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="7"> Mr Albert Mason, 75, died after a metal plate that should have been screwed in was fixed with adhesive tape and another plate had become detached, letting carbon monoxide circulate around his flat.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="8"> Mr Blackburn said 'few if any' of the workers who fitted the heaters had experience of such systems.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="9"> In spite of the large scale of the scheme the council 'did not give proper instructions to their employees specifying methods of installation or quality checks'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="10"> There were no arrangements to check safety, methods of installation were improvised and the acting supervisor in charge of the replacement on Mr Mason's estate had received no training or instructions on his responsibilities.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="11"> Mr Blackburn added: 'The consequences of so many heaters wrongly installed could have been far more serious.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="12"> It is suggested this arose from attitudes in the council leading to complacency'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="13"> The council, which pleaded guilty, was fined the maximum of Pounds 5,000 under gas safety regulations for Mr Mason's death and the maximum Pounds 20,000 under the Health and Safety at Work Act for failing to carry out checks on the other heaters.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="14"> It was ordered to pay Pounds 500 costs.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="15"> Mr Fairclough said: 'The maximum fine within my power is really insufficient punishment for what happened'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="16"> Mr Charles Garside QC, for the council, expressed its sincere regret to Mr Mason's family.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="17"> He said Miss Penny Badcoe, the chief officer of the direct works department, had resigned and no effort was being spared to identify those responsible for the deficient installations.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="18"> Mr Garside added: 'There are going to be no scapegoats but on the other hand nobody is going to be protected from proper action being taken against them.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="19"> This is not the place where it is sought to identify some low-level employee and put all the blame on them'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-9825" num="20"> It is understood the council is facing more than a dozen civil actions from tenants who claim their health was affected by fumes from the wrongly installed heaters.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="4"> Health and Welfare Effects of HC Emissions The focus of today's action is reduction of HC emission as a part of the solution to the ozone nonattainment problem.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="5"> However, direct health effects are also a reason for concern due to direct human exposure to emissions from small SI engines during operation of equipment using such engines.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="6"> Of specific concern is the emission of air toxics.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="7"> In some applications, the operator must be adjacent to the exhaust outlet and is in the direct path of the exhaust as it leaves the engine.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="8"> Today's regulations should be effective in reducing air toxics such as benzene and 1,3-butadiene.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="9"> Based on data from the Nonroad Study, the exhaust and crankcase emissions from a 2.9 kW lawnmower with a 4-stroke engine contain 3.5 grams of benzene per hour.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="10"> Exhaust emission of a 2.9 kW, 2-stroke lawnmower contains 17 grams of benzene per hour.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="11"> A small, 2.2 kW chainsaw emits 28.2 grams of benzene per hour, compared to a large, 4.5 kW chainsaw that emits 40.8 grams per hour.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="12"> Also, according to data from the Nonroad Study, 1,3- butadiene content in exhaust and crankcase emissions from a 2.9 kW, 4-stroke lawnmower is approximately 1.5 grams per hour.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="13"> For a 2.9 kW, 2-stroke lawnmower, 1,3-butadiene content in exhaust is 7.0 grams per hour.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="14"> Butadiene emitted from a small, 2.2 kW chainsaw is approximately 12.2 grams per hour, and is 17.7 grams per hour from a large 4.5 kW chainsaw.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="15"> Benzene is a clear, colorless aromatic hydrocarbon which is both volatile and flammable.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="16"> Benzene is present in both exhaust and evaporative emissions.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="17"> Health effects caused by benzene emissions differ based on concentration and duration of exposure.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="18"> 1,3-butadiene is a colorless, flammable gas at room temperature.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="19"> This suspected human carcinogen is insoluble in water and its two conjugated double bonds make it highly reactive.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="20"> 1,3-Butadiene is formed in internal combustion engine exhaust by the incomplete combustion of the fuel and is assumed not present in evaporative and refueling emissions.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="21"> Since air toxic levels generally decrease in proportion to overall emissions once emission control technology is applied, the amount of benzene and 1,3-butadiene produced by new small SI engines should diminish after this rule becomes effective.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="22"> Consequently, exposure to air toxics from new small SI engines will be reduced, as will associated health effects.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="23"> There is little data on direct health effects of small SI engine emissions.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="24"> No study has been conducted involving the health effects of air toxic emissions specifically from small SI engines.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="25"> The Agency requests additional information on this topic.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="26"> C. Health and Welfare Effects of CO Emissions Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas which can be emitted into ambient air as a result of both natural processes and human activity.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="27"> Although CO exists as a trace element in the troposphere, much of human exposure resulting in elevated levels of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) in the blood is due to incomplete fossil fuel combustion, as occurs in small SI engines.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="28"> The concentration and direct health effect of CO exposure are especially important in small SI engines because the operator of a small SI engine application is typically near the equipment as it functions.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="29"> In some applications, the operator must be adjacent to the exhaust outlet and is in the direct path of the exhaust as it leaves the engine.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="30"> According to numbers published in the Nonroad Study, a 4-stroke, 2.9 kW lawnmower engine emits 1051.1 g/hr CO, while a 2-stroke, 2.9 kW engine emits 1188.4 g/hr CO.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="31"> Although no studies measuring the human health effects of CO emanating from small SI engine exhaust have been conducted, ample research results are available concerning general health effects of exposure to CO.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="32"> The toxicity of CO effects on blood and tissues, and how these effects manifest themselves as organ function changes have been topics of substantial research efforts.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="33"> However, most of these involved higher, more constant exposure concentration levels of CO than are likely to be produced under normal operations of these small SI engines.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="34"> Such studies provided information for establishing the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for CO.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="35"> The current primary and secondary NAAQS for CO are 9 parts per million for the one-hour average and 35 parts per million for the eight-hour average.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="36"> D. Roles of HC and NO X in Ozone Formation Both HC and NO X contribute to the formation of tropospheric ozone through a complex series of reactions.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="37"> In general, the ratio between the ambient concentrations of HC and NO X in a localized area is an indicator of the likely effectiveness of HC and/or NO X reductions as ozone control measures.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="38"> If the level of HC is high relative to the level of NO X (that is, in a ratio of 20 to one), ozone formation is limited by the amount of NO X present, making reduction of NO X emission an effective strategy for reducing ozone levels.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="39"> Alternatively, if the level of HC is low relative to the level of NO X (that is, in a ratio of eight to one), efforts to control HC would be expected to be a more effective means of reducing ozone concentration.</s>

<s docid="FR940516-1-00119" num="40"> In a recent report, researchers emphasize that both HC and NO X controls are needed in most areas of the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="17"> and the Health of a Nation: Millions Face Air of Despair"] [Text] The threat to the nation's health from increasing air pollution has prompted charities, research scientists, doctors and MPs to launch a concerted campaign for tighter controls on air quality.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="18"> They estimate that 10 million Britons, almost one in five of the population, are at risk from polluted air, including the elderly, pregnant women, children under two and those with respiratory illnesses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="19"> Asthma is increasing at an alarming rate: there are three million recorded sufferers and it is estimated that one in seven children is affected.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="20"> It is the only treatable chronic illness that is becoming more prevalent in the western world, and 2,000 Britons die from it every year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="21"> Four in five deaths are avoidable.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="22"> A total of 7 million working days are lost because of asthma, at an annual cost of \|[pound ]\|400 million to commerce and industry,\|[pound ]\|70 million in sickness benefit and almost \|[pound ]\|500 million to the NHS.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="23"> Research, much of it funded by charities, has yet to establish that air pollution is a primary cause of asthma but, as Professor Robert Davies, consultant physician and reader in respiratory medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, central London, told The Times: "The current position which would be agreed by most people is that episodes of air pollution are a trigger to asthma".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="24"> Government research has shown that 19 million Britons a year are exposed to air pollution levels in excess of international guidelines.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="25"> The pollutants include:</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="26"> --Carbon monoxide, which deprives the body of oxygen by reacting with haemoglobin, causing drowsiness and headaches, slowing thought and reflexes and increasing pressure on the heart.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="27"> --Nitrogen oxides, which increase susceptibility to viral illnesses, irritate lung tissue and increase the risk of bronchitis and pneumonia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="28"> --Ozone, which aggravates asthma and bronchitis but also affects normally healthy adults, causing coughing, eye, nose and throat irritation and headaches.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="29"> Figures gathered by Friends of the Earth show that in 1992, ozone levels exceeded World Health Organisation guidelines on 269 days at 21 monitoring sites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="30"> These disturbing statistics have been gathered despite Britain's poor record in monitoring air pollution, with only seven sites designed in compliance with European directives to measure nitrogen dioxide, compared with 200 in Germany.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="31"> The call for better monitoring of air pollution is one of the main themes of the new campaign because it would show where tighter controls need to be applied and alert those most at risk to the danger areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="32"> There are also widespread demands for greater research into the causes of respiratory illnesses so that doctors can be better informed about how to treat them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="33"> Dr Martyn Partridge, chief medical adviser to the National Asthma Campaign, said: "As far as asthma is concerned, the obsession is with preventing attacks, but what is much more exciting is the possibility through genetic research of identifying children, even a foetus, at risk.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="34"> We could then plan what to do to alter that child's environment to prevent the disease developing".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="35"> The newly formed all-party asthma group of MPs is also campaigning for a greater awareness in Government of the scale of the disease and for it to be included in the next progress report on the Health of the Nation initiative.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="36"> More far-reaching reforms are demanded by organisations such as the British Lung Foundation, Friends of the Earth and the National Asthma Campaign.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22133" num="37"> They want a transport strategy that takes account of health issues and greater encouragement for people to buy fuel-efficient vehicles.</s>
