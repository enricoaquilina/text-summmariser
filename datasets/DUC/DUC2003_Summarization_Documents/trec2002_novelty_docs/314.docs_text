<TEXT>

<s docid="FT941-12089" num="6"> An oil slick in a jam jar was yesterday used to demonstrate plans by Titaghur, the owner of six jute mills in Calcutta, to move into biotechnology.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12089" num="7"> The crowded annual meeting approved the delayed accounts showing that Titaghur had incurred a loss on ordinary activities of Pounds 4.3m on turnover of Pounds 29m in the year to end-March 1993, taking the accumulated deficit to Pounds 61m.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12089" num="8"> Mr Reg Brealey, chairman, attributed the latest loss to inconsistent supplies of raw jute.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12089" num="9"> He apologised to shareholders at London's Charing Cross Hotel for the delay in presenting the accounts, blaming problems in Calcutta.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12089" num="10"> Accounting there was not computerised, but was all done by hand, he explained.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12089" num="11"> Since last March the group has made two acquisitions - West Midlands Surfacing, a road maintenance company, and Knoydart Peninsula, a Scottish estate to be used for youth training.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12089" num="12"> Mr Joseph Lowe, head of the new Titaghur Environmental offshoot, said the group was planning two areas of development in biotechnology.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12089" num="13"> The first involves organic material that soaks up oil but rejects water.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12089" num="14"> It will be put into jute bags and held in place over oil and other spillages by jute booms.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12089" num="15"> The absorbed pollutant can then be disposed of safely.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12089" num="16"> The second involves the commercial production of spirulina platensis, a blue-green algae which has existed for 3 1/2 bn years and contains three times the protein in soya.</s>

<s docid="FT941-12089" num="17"> The algae, which in its dried form smells like seaweed and sells at Pounds 186 a kilo, can be grown in open ponds, but Titaghur claims to be the first company to produce it in a closed circuit system, guaranteeing purity.</s>

<s docid="LA122589-0091" num="8"> While Mendocino County's seaweed farmers wrung $73,000 in sales from the ocean in 1989, San Diego-based Kelco was harvesting millions of dollars in giant kelp.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122589-0091" num="9"> Kelco, a division of pharmaceuticals giant Merck & Co., is the largest company of its kind in the world.</s>

<s docid="LA122589-0091" num="10"> It has three 140- to 180-foot ships, kelp cutters that mow the tops off the fastest-growing and tallest plants in the ocean.</s>

<s docid="LA122589-0091" num="11"> This seaweed, however, isn't harvested to be eaten.</s>

<s docid="LA122589-0091" num="12"> It is used in 70 different products, including textiles, cosmetics, dental impression compounds and wound packings for hospitals.</s>

<s docid="LA122589-0091" num="13"> It also makes for longer-lasting foam in beer.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122589-0091" num="14"> The biggest application of the algin -- the gelatinous substance extracted from kelp -- is in the textile industry's printing paste.</s>

<s docid="LA122589-0091" num="15"> The algin thickens the paste and provides sharp and well-defined prints.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122589-0091" num="16"> It is also used to change flow characteristics in such foods as salad dressing, to thicken or make them smoother.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122589-0091" num="17"> Kelco does not reveal annual production or sales figures, but one official said the largest annual harvest the 60-year-old company ever made was 170,000 tons of seaweed in the 1970s off the California coast.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122589-0091" num="18"> Its ships trim the surface canopy of giant kelp, usually within a mile of shore up and down the coast, from the Mexican border to Monterey, where giant forests of the huge plant exist.</s>

<s docid="LA122589-0091" num="19"> The kelp forests are leased from the state of California.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0024" num="9"> Merck & Co., the giant pharmaceutical firm, will spend $29 million to expand plants in San Diego and Oklahoma that produce biogums, materials used as thickening and suspending agents by the food-processing, oil-drilling and chemical industries.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0024" num="10"> Less than half of the $29 million is earmarked for Merck's Kelco Division plant in San Diego.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0024" num="11"> The lion's share will be used to expand a large Kelco facility in Okmulgee, Okla.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0024" num="12"> , said Steve Zapoticzny, Kelco's San Diego-based public affairs manager.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA122090-0024" num="13"> Kelco has 600 employees in San Diego.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0024" num="14"> The planned expansion will generate a "modest" number of new jobs, Zapoticzny said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0024" num="15"> Biogums, which are produced through fermentation processes, end up in a wide variety of consumer products.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0024" num="16"> Kelco produces the materials at fermentation plants in San Diego, Oklahoma and England.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA122090-0024" num="17"> Merck linked the expansion to increased demand from existing customers, along with new applications that are being made possible by new production techniques.</s>

<s docid="LA122090-0024" num="18"> Merck has, for example, received federal Food & Drug Administration approval to sell biogums to bakeries, which will use the substances to improve the texture of pastry fillings and cake icings.</s>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="9"> Recent advances in technology have inundated the seafood industry with new and different fishery products.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="10"> The changes were evident at Seafare '89, a trade show held last week at the Long Beach Convention Center.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="11"> Much of the progress is resulting from aquaculture, or fish farming, now well established in more than a dozen countries.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="12"> Underscoring the success of these ventures, industry observers said, was the announcement at the conference that Norwegian salmon farms will produce 100,000 metric tons of the prized fish in 1990, or 25% above this year's level.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="13"> The increase comes at the same time that the Norwegian government indicated it plans no direct subsidies for the fish farmers, a development, along with the production increases, that's likely to reduce the cost of their high-quality product on the world market.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="14"> The Norwegians are far and away the leaders in salmon ranching, with more than half the world's total.</s>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="15"> But other nations are expected to increase their production of the fish as well, particularly those firms in the Canadian province of British Columbia.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="16"> The cumulative effect of these efforts, including those that simply release hatched salmon into the sea, has pushed total tonnage of aquacultured salmon to equal that of the ocean- and river-harvested, or wild, varieties.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="17"> In fact, the number of farmed salmon has proliferated to such an extent that Seafood Leader magazine, the convention sponsor, held an official tasting of product from nine countries.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="18"> These and other changes in the seafood industry brought 12,000 people to the three-day trade show, which featured seminars and 600 exhibits.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="19"> Other highlights of the event included the debut of an edible, tropical seaweed, giant Australian farmed crayfish and the reintroduction of hoki, an exotic-sounding New Zealand whitefish.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="20"> Somewhat afield of fish farming, but still compatible with those firms racing to cultivate foodstuffs from the ocean, is a Honolulu-based company that is raising a popular seaweed variety used by Hawaiians and other South Pacific islanders.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="21"> Richard Spencer, of Hawaiian Marine Enterprise, said he began cultivating the intricate bunches of red, sphere-like clusters six years ago as the natural supplies were depleted by over-harvesting.</s>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="22"> "Most people view seaweed as soft, slimy and heavy in flavor," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="23"> Sea vegetable, as Spencer's product is labeled, is crisp in texture, flavored somewhere between celery, cabbage and green onion, with a salty aftertaste.</s>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="24"> However, the salty taste, a condition of seawater, can be removed by rinsing, he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="25"> In Hawaii the seaweed, or gracilaria in Latin, is quite common.</s>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="26"> It is used as a pickled vegetable, in salads, as a garnish or in a traditional Hawaiian dish called poki, which is a mixture of raw fish, such as tuna, and other seasonings.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="27"> Spencer said the seaweed, available in red or green colors, is very popular among chefs but is also being sold in Honolulu-area supermarkets for about $3.50 a pound.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="28"> As is the case with the fish farmers, Spencer realized there would be a market for sea vegetables as local supplies of the weed dwindled.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="29"> "For many years, the Hawaiians used to pick off bunches of the seaweed, but still leave a little clinging to rocks and tide pools so it would continue growing.</s>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="30"> But in the last 30 years, other Pacific Islanders (such as Samoans) realized the plant's commercial value, over-harvested and denuded the whole sides of some (Hawaiian) islands.</s>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="31"> We saw that happening six years ago and began cultivating it," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="32"> Fish farming is by no means limited to ocean species.</s>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="33"> One promising aquaculture product is the recent work of the Australian Crayfish Industries.</s>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="34"> The firm exhibited, for the first time, its version of this fresh-water shellfish.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="35"> Those expecting tiny, finger-sized crustaceans were surprised to see the product measure several inches in length and actually resemble jumbo shrimp or small lobsters in meat content.</s>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="36"> And to emphasize the point, the Denver-based firm that will market the Australian crayfish in this country adopted Freshwater Lobsters as its corporate name.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="37"> Sixteen tons of the crayfish will be marketed in 1989 in both fresh and frozen forms.</s>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="38"> The company hopes to more than double the total next year, but is already claiming that "demand greatly exceeds supply".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="39"> Apart from the farmed fish, the number of exotic species is also expanding.</s>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="40"> New Zealand interests are now heavily promoting hoki.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="41"> Importers, namely Fletcher Seafoods in Seattle, hope to position hoki with other popular white fish, such as haddock and cod, but at a lower price.</s>

<s docid="LA022389-0086" num="42"> The firm-textured fish is the latest in a series from the South Pacific, the most recent success having been orange roughy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42467" num="11"> Article Type:CSO [Text] A team of American scientists from Livermore National Laboratory (California) under the leadership of R.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42467" num="12"> Morrison have invented the new porous material Seagel with such a low density that the scientists' say it would float away if it were not weighed down by the air trapped in its microscopic pores.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42467" num="13"> Seagel, which is biodegradable, was obtained by processing agar, a component of brown algae [kelp] that is widely used as a thickener during the preparation of food items such as ice cream.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42467" num="14"> Its developers say that Seagel is also suitable for food and only carbon dioxide and water are formed during its combustion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42467" num="15"> To obtain Seagel, agar is first dissolved in water and then an organic solvent and an emulsifying agent are added to the mixture which disperses the agar evenly throughout the liquid as tiny droplets.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42467" num="16"> The liquid then sets into a gel and is freeze-dried to obtain the final product.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42467" num="17"> Depending on the conditions of the process and the concentration of the initial products, you can obtain a material with different properties depending on the individual application: from packaging materials to slow-release capsules for medicines.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42467" num="18"> Seagel should find the greatest application with a density of 40-50 mg/cm[.sup]3[/].</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42467" num="19"> This compares with the 60 mg/cm[.sup]3[/] density of balsa wood, which is widely used as an insulating material in supertankers and as a noise-absorbing material in high-speed trains.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42467" num="20"> Seagel can also replace polyurethane and polystyrene styrofoam, however, you need to take into account that the material must be hermetically sealed because it dissolves in water at a temperature of approximately 50ÎC.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42467" num="21"> However, even this property can be useful if Seagel is used as a mold for casting because it permits it to be easily washed away to reveal the finished product.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="16"> Environment"] [Text] There is no shortage of examples of the contribution biotechnology has made to solving environmental problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="17"> New markets are opening up to these technologies which have already been used in the treatment of water, waste or, contaminated land.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="18"> However, organisms converted by genetic engineering require vigilance and reflection by both researchers and manufacturers in terms of their security and ecological impact.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="19"> A balance must be found between economic competitiveness and respect for the environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="20"> Biotechnologies are taking an increasingly important part in solving environmental problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="21"> The fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, for instance, secretes enzymes which can damage lignin.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="22"> The phenomenon is well known, but less well known are the results of recent research which show that this fungus can also degrade certain herbicides, heavy oils, or toxic products.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="23"> It is also thought it may be used to treat hydrocarbons which have accumulated in the ground.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="24"> This could enable the rehabilitation of certain contaminated sites, a crucial problem today.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="25"> These hopes have captured the interest of many companies, notably in the United States, and have resulted in a race to select hyperproductive lines with a view to optimization.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="26"> The use of fungi seems promising for the future because these organisms can colonize vast regions while bacteria develop in more limited zones.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="27"> There is also increasing talk about biomass combustion and the use of biofuels.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="28"> Although wood combustion is used relatively little in France, other countries have no hesitation about using it regularly and, in Denmark, new incinerators burn hay.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="29"> Despite its critics, biofuels continue to be tested and the comparative eco- audit between rapeseed and diesel does not condemn vegetable diester.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="30"> Other options exist such as wheat and beetroot for the production of ethanol and oxygenated components for lead-free gas or wood for the production of methanol, for example.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="31"> Not forgetting the latest developments by English researchers who are experimenting on power supply for diesel engine generating units using an algae which feeds on the liquids used for reprocessing sewage water.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="32"> This green monocell algae, chlorella, has an extremely rapid growth rate and the carbonic gas resulting from combustion is recycled to improve the output of photosynthesis even further.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="33"> New Markets</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="34"> Biology opens up whole new technological areas for processes and products.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="35"> Because they are young these have the specific characteristic that they can benefit from studies on risks parallel to their development.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="36"> This has been a rare occurrence throughout history.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="37"> It was remarked that this was a growing problem during discussions on the presentation of the bill on genetically modified organisms (GMO's) at the National Assembly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="38"> In economic terms, a recent American report "Biomarkers 93: Forecast for High Growth Markets" puts forward several interesting figures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="39"> The use of ground bacteria (indigenous or exogenous) to treat contamination should grow to the tune of 20 to 30 percent per year between now and the end of the decade.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="40"> It is estimated that the market for microorganisms capable of desulphurizing carbon will rise to several billion dollars a year around the year 2000.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="41"> For the recuperation of metals in waste using biological processes, this estimate rises to nearly two billion dollars in 1998.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="42"> Living Mechanisms</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="43"> We are entering the age of "worker microbes".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="44"> True, sauerkraut or Roquefort cheese were already made with their help.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="45"> The use of microorganisms for industrial production is, when all is said and done, ecologically satisfactory.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="46"> As living beings, they require more "natural" or "softer" working conditions than traditional industrial processes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="47"> Factories using them will essentially be more hospitable than those using machines.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="48"> Temperature, pressure, acidity, etc., will not create areas of danger as threatening as those in chemical or nuclear environments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="49"> However, some regulations on their production and utilization need to be enforced.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="50"> The Environment Ministry is very concerned by the industrial use of microorganisms and prior research.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="51"> There will be extraordinary progress in their utilization at the beginning of the next century and this will lead to drastic changes in life-styles.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="52"> This is one of the reasons why it is so important to initiate an in-depth deliberation on the effects of this progress, on the impact of genetic engineering, and to lay the foundations of a policy centred on precaution and ethics while encouraging innovation and research and providing guarantees for a controlled evolution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="53"> Progress is fast moving in this field.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="54"> There are many patents and production authorizations in the world and France does not always take the lead on these issues.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="55"> Water and Biotechnology</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="56"> The biotechnology-environment twosome have already come along way together.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="57"> Important research programs have enabled processes to be developed and some of these are operational today.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="58"> In terms of water, whether for the production of drinking water or the purification of waste water, the use of microorganisms in an aerobic or anaerobic environment is inevitable.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="59"> For drinking water, the excess of dissolved biodegradable organic carbon undergoes biological treatment using the properties of bacteria fixed on active carbon and biological nitrification or denitrification is often used.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="60"> The treatment of waste water frequently requires a biological process which includes lagooning, and, if a higher level of purification needs to be achieved, treatment on bacterial beds or the use of activated muds.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="61"> Today, however, in order to overcome certain difficulties linked to mechanical procedures, the development of biofilters, which lead to increasing the biomass activated by the use of cultures of microorganisms fixed on a fine granulated environment, is indispensable.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="62"> For the treatment of residual industrial waters, the use of membrane bioreactors could be advantageous.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="63"> Similarly, the biological dephosphatization of water is an interesting option.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="64"> The diversity of usable biotechnologies today and the capacity to discover new approaches for the future will enable current techniques to be improved considerably.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="65"> Waste Too</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="66"> The outlook is the same for the treatment of waste.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="67"> We know about the methanization of silage, slaughter house residue, brewery dregs, etc., but also of household waste.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="68"> We know how to develop rudimentary mechanisms, perfectly adapted to developing countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="69"> In this respect, the remarkable experience of the treatment of residue from the Thies slaughterhouse in Senegal should be mentioned.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="70"> This process enabled the elimination of solid and liquid residue through methanization and lagooning with water hyacinths which supplied the energy required to operate the slaughterhouse.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="71"> Furthermore, it transformed the substrate and yielded a protein-rich material capable of increasing the production of marsh cultures for a lower than usual cost.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="72"> In other respects, bioleaching and biofixing are subject to increasing research for the treatment of waste which is rich in heavy metals.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="73"> Cleaning Up Contaminated Land</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="74"> Rehabilitation treatment for contaminated land is another field of investigation undergoing rapid development.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="75"> The problems this poses for the substrata and in relation to ground water or future exploitation are such that it is absolutely necessary to clean up these lands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="76"> But the cost of doing so can reach excessive levels if the most suitable process is not chosen.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="77"> The biological solution is often the most acceptable.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="78"> This question is central to many programs around the world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="79"> Some EUREKA projects were recently launched focusing on the different possibilities and certain results look promising.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="80"> From Air to Biosensors</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="81"> Another important area of biological cleaning covers the reduction of atmospheric pollution, the desulphurization and denitrification of smoke, the elimination of toxic products such as organochlorinates and deodorization.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="82"> Biological sensors provide one example of the usefulness of microorganisms for the development of new instruments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="83"> In environment-related applications, systems using fluorescent bacteria or bacteria which are sensitive to certain types of pollutants in measuring sensors enable the quality of waterways to be controlled or alerts to be raised.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="84"> Biotechnologies have not yet ceased surprising us in the fight against pollution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="85"> Who would have thought we would be able to use these technologies to recuperate precious metals in minerals in which traces of these are present and for which traditional processes generated pollution?</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="86"> Agriculture and the Environment</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="87"> Genetic engineering is now also at the service agriculture and again relations with the environment are far from negligible.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="88"> There are currently many joint programs between the National Agronomic Research Institute [INRA] and the Environment Ministry.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="89"> Obtaining plants capable of resisting insects and fungi could liberate farmers from the overuse of chemical products which would greatly benefit both the land and animal life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="90"> Entomophagous insects could also be used which would have the effect of limiting the use of pesticides.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="91"> Once again, the limits of these applications would have to be studied and in-depth work undertaken on the biological resistance phenomenon.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="92"> We should keep in mind the proliferation of insects in Venice or the case of crickets in Africa.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="93"> Other inventions, such as plants with protein reserves, salt resistant plants... could be a godsend to developing countries.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="94"> Genetically Modified Organisms</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="95"> Opinions vary on the subject of genetically modified organisms (GMO's) introduced into the environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="96"> Some say they are monsters created in laboratories which stand no chance of survival and which will be ruthlessly eliminated by natural selection processes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="97"> For others, they will invade the environment, all environments indiscriminately, and will therefore drive out other microorganisms and create other problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="98"> It is indeed possible that they possess different properties than those planned by their inventors and, most of the time, we ignore their capacity to adapt to different environments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="99"> We should remember that undesirable species easily invade whole continents while man often has difficulties introducing species he would like to propagate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="100"> The debate is vast.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="101"> It seems obvious that the necessary and adequate conditions for the survival or the rapid multiplication of GMO's are the responsibility of ecology specialists because information resulting from in vitro culture alone will not provide the responses required.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="102"> This is why the use of these organisms should be accompanied by research on their ecological impact.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="103"> The effects of the introduction, whether deliberate or accidental, of various organisms (the problems of myxomatosis, killer bees, elm disease) are well known.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="104"> Transgenic plants also merit further reflection.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="105"> Introducing a foreign gene into a plant, with ulterior exploitation motives, requires reflection on the possible consequences before the choice of the different elements which constitute the construction chain--the plasmid vector, the transformation system and the plant to be transformed--are even made.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="106"> This is not about being alarmist but being equipped with the best possible knowledge of the genetic content of the material about to be developed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="107"> This could avoid difficulties at the time of field testing or during homologation processes.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="108"> Biodiversity</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="109"> In some respects, biotechnology can aggravate genetic harmonization--and the reduction of genetic diversity is a fundamental problem today.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="110"> Paradoxically, it can also help provide solutions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="111"> Genetic erosion can be combatted by constituting stocks of genes through developing tissue cultures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="112"> In Mali, for example, peasants imported potato tissues from Belgium.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="113"> They succeeded in importing a more disease-resistant vegetable material while economizing on the transportation cost for plants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="114"> Ecological research must be strengthened to test the evolution that blind development in genetic engineering could bring about, and particularly in the plant world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="115"> Nature is being increasingly moulded by man, but biodiversity is certainly an indispensable advantage for its survival, notably if we are entering a period of galloping demography.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="116"> This is why an approach where the use of biotechnologies is controlled and regulated is needed.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="117"> Necessary Scientific Vigilance</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="118"> Biotechnologies are no less abstract than other modern industrial processes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="119"> Escherichia coli, a famous bacteria, despite its presence in our intestines, is no more familiar than carbon 14 or any other isolated molecule, although its use is growing, and under many different guises.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="120"> So are we not dealing with them regularly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="121"> So "artificial" bacteria need not be experimented more commonly than plutonium or dioxin.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="122"> Creating it, watching over it and using it will be the task of specialists for a long time to come and not that of ordinary mortals, other than exceptionally.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="123"> This is why scientific vigilance is capital, as it is important to evaluate the ecotoxicological consequences on different environments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="124"> At the beginning, techniques calling on microorganisms, which some people said had been used since antiquity, did not seem to be at the source of any particularly great risk.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="125"> But the appearance and utilization of genetic engineering techniques have completely changed this conviction.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="126"> These techniques, which enable the potential of microorganisms to be transformed, and even new capabilities to be brought about by modifying the genome, have given rise over the past decades to questions based on both ethics and security.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="127"> The experience we have to date of their utilization and industrial application is not yet sufficiently advanced in a certain number of sectors to enable all the doubts we have encountered to be removed completely.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="128"> Reconciling Contradictions</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="129"> The approach is directed, like for a number of other activities, by a search for an indispensable balance between two levels which can, in certain cases, seem contradictory, namely, economic competitive activities and the lives of people.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="130"> So if preventive and regulatory activities must be introduced, scientific research must bring light to bear on potential risks, and researchers must adopt a practically simultaneous attitude of vigilance in relation to the future impact of their results on the environment from the very launch of a project.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60378" num="131"> This is a golden opportunity, for once, to develop new techniques having taken their consequences into consideration from the very beginning</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="6"> As the new year gets underway anyone without the willpower of a Trappist monk may be feeling a touch under par.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="7"> The long days of feasting, combined with lack of sleep and exercise, result in what the French call une crise de foie - in other words, an overloaded liver exacerbated by dehydration.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="8"> This sluggishness is also primarily responsible for the January blues, according to Dr Susan Horsewood-Lee, a London general practitioner who is particularly interested in nutrition.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="9"> The answer, she says, is a programme of detoxification, rehydration and relaxation.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="10"> If that conjures visions of pills, potions and deprivations, take heart.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="11"> Of course, you can go the whole way and opt for a lemon and water fast - under medical supervision only - but there are gentler and positively agreeable ways of tackling this lethargy.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="12"> First, let us suppose you want to detox at home.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="13"> Undoubtedly the best way to start the day is with pure water, warm or cool, not ice-cold, or herbal tea.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="14"> Peppermint has been used to aid digestion since Roman times.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="15"> Add a dribble of cold-pressed honey if you wish.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="16"> Next, try a brisk skin brushing to get your circulation moving and speed the loss of toxins.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="17"> Use a fairly stiff brush, (the Body Shop version at Pounds 4.95 is perfect) on dry skin, always working up legs and arms towards the heart.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="18"> Follow with a hot shower, perhaps using a herbal hair and body shampoo such as Aveda's aromatic Futurity Relax, oozing with camomile, comfrey and witch hazel.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="19"> Finish with a cold, or cool, splash from head to toe.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="20"> It is gasp-inducing at first, but makes you feel sparkling throughout the day.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="21"> The bottom line with detox eating and drinking is to do it gently.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="22"> If you can manage one or two days without caffeine and alcohol, largely eating fruit and vegetables, you will feel great benefits.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="23"> Although beware, expelling toxins from an overloaded system can temporarily induce headaches or other aches and pains, dizziness and a degree of lassitude.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="24"> The best way to combat this is to drink as much cool, pure water as possible, two to five pints daily, submerge yourself in warm baths and rest.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="25"> Dr Horsewood-Lee also recommends taking a multivitamin and mineral supplement.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="26"> The Japanese would add Chlorella, emerald green algae which is stuffed with nutrients and Japan's best selling supplement.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="27"> It is available in tablet or powder form and, like a wide range of other supplements, a positive library of books and some health foods, is stocked by the Nutricentre, which also has a very efficient mail order service.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="31"> Massage of all kinds is excellent for releasing toxins, used in combination with diet and gentle exercise such as walking and swimming.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="32"> Aromatherapy massage, with essential oils such as juniper, rosemary and grapefruit, is a powerful detoxifier, working on the lymphatic system, boosting the vital organs, and helping the digestion.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="43"> She began to feel better when her body was exfoliated with a mallow and ivy scrub.</s>

<s docid="FT941-16616" num="44"> Plunged into a large tub, laced with seaweed extract, our tester felt a rapid improvement as high-pressure jets of water pummelled her from neck to sole for about half an hour.</s>

</F>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="16"> Seaweed"] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Finally, Fabrizio De Poli's project for a system to manufacture paper from seaweed predominated in the "Environmental Technology" thematic section.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="17"> This system is already being used at the Favini paper-mill in Rossano Veneto.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="18"> The technology of this process, which has gone into its first production stage, is completely Italian.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="19"> Favini Managing Director Clemente Nicolucci added that the seaweed paper project has also been approved as part of the EC's LIFE [expansion unknown] program for the so-called clean technologies, and that there are plans for further joint studies to be made by ENEA [National Agency for New Technologies, Energy, and the Environment], the Lisbon Institute of Agronomy, and the Favini paper mill.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="20"> About 50,000 tonnes of excess seaweed come out of Venice's lagoon each year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="21"> This has been systematically collected by the Venezia Nuova consortium since 1989.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="22"> As well as avoiding unpleasant smells and ecological unbalances, it means saving about 30,000 tonnes of trees.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="23"> It has a positive energy balance: The energy required to convert trees into cellulose is approximately double that required to transform fresh seaweed into flour to make paper mixture.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="24"> "The possible industrial use of this abundant raw material, that perishes rapidly and has a modest commercial value, is being approached along three lines; the production of biogas, animal foodstuffs, and paper.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="25"> The latter is a winner.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="26"> After the ulva seaweed from the lagoon has been dried, using the traditional technique for alfalfa, it is transformed into a flour that, blandly pretreated using a process know-how that has been perfected by the paper mill, is incorporated in the paper mixture in its integral form".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="27"> The technicians say that the material obtained has better characteristics than normal paper produced from virgin cellulose; it is 30-43 percent stiffer, 35-80 percent more tear resistant, and 42-47 percent more energy is required to tear it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="28"> The testing history of this "sea lettuce" has the flavor of the old crafts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="29"> It is a rediscovery of the ancestral logic of the conservation of the grape and its transformation into currants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="30"> Nicolucci says that, "If the ulva seaweed flour is not very swollen, it behaves as an organic filler when it is put into water and improves the biodegradability of the paper.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="31"> It acts as a binder with physical-mechanical characteristics that can be compared with those obtained using cationic starch if it is made to swell a lot".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="32"> The production costs, compared with a paper of analogous characteristics, have also been notably reduced; from the increase of 300 percent for the first industrial test in which 700 kilograms of paper were obtained, there has been a reduction to 15 percent for 400 tonnes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="33"> Successive steps to optimize the harvest, the drying, the grinding, and the relative treatments have led to estimate costs that are five percent lower than the traditional ones.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="34"> Of the 24,000 tonnes of paper produced annually by Favini, eight percent are already made from seaweed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="35"> This already represents the utilization of one third of the excess production of the lagoon that would not be used otherwise.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="36"> There are many uses: from waste disposal to writing paper, paper for photocopiers, laser printers, and for packing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="37"> They are already looking at recycling the small amount of residual organic and mineral sludge from the production, originating from various materials, to make backing-block cardboards.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-45709" num="38"> Thanks to innovation an environmental problem is becoming a development factor, in which Japan has already shown its interest.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="7"> Like most people on an ocean cruise, I enjoy starting the day with a peaceful and leisurely breakfast.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="8"> I did not mind leaving the Lady Ruth as it off-loaded cargo at the port of Jolo, and wandering into town to find something to eat.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="9"> I was only too happy to escape for a while.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="10"> I did not mind, either, that there were no eggs and bacon for breakfast.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="11"> In this militantly Moslem part of the Philippines, bacon goes against the grain.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="12"> I am as happy with cassava cakes as the next man.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="13"> Nor, when four young soldiers sat beside me, did I object to their company, but I do mind when fellow diners put their M-16 assault rifles on the table.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="14"> When military street patrols feel the need to post one man at the restaurant door while the others are eating, I get twitchy.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="15"> Twelve hundred miles away, in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, representatives of the Philippine government were that very morning sitting down to peace negotiations with the Moro National Liberation Front, the Moslem rebel group that has kept the southern Philippines in a state of low-level war for more than 20 years.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="16"> But here, in the Sulu archipelago, a stronghold of the MNLF, no one seemed to know or care.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="17"> Perhaps it was because locals become a bit cynical when ideas of peace and order are mentioned: for more than four centuries, the Sulus have been the most lawless islands in the eastern seas.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="18"> The Spanish, who colonised and Christianised the Philippines in the 1500s, were unable to impose their rule on the Moslem pirates who terrorised the Sulu Sea between Mindanao island and Borneo.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="19"> Not even the Americans, who took over the colony from the Spanish at the turn of this century, could gain a foothold on this 200-mile-long string of islands.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="20"> Until now, efforts to bring stability and order had failed and, ever since boarding the Lady Ruth, my fellow passengers - between noisy bouts of snacking on cold, boiled crab - had provided endless chronicles of violence for my entertainment.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="21"> 'Was that June or July the government platoon was ambushed and beheaded near Jolo'? one passenger would ask to my left, cracking a crab leg between his teeth.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="22"> 'And what about that Spanish priest kidnapped on Basilan?</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="23"> Didn't he escape'? another would say to my right, spitting shell on to the deck.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="24"> On and on it went: attacks on foolhardy missionaries trying to peddle bibles; rampages by 'lost commands' - troops in remote areas who have turned and taken the law in their own hands; entire villages held up by bandit gangs; depredations by another rebel group, the communist New People's Army; on-going vendettas between neighbouring islands; piracy and pillage on the high seas.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="25"> The MNLF was the least of it.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="26"> Even the Lady Ruth, it seemed, merited protection.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="27"> Aboard was a military escort who strolled about cradling their weapons.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="28"> There were also hard-looking young men in mufti and dark glasses who wore.38s stuck in their belts.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="29"> God knows who they were; I was not about to ask.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="30"> Far more disconcerting than all these guns, though, was the Lady Ruth itself.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="31"> It was precisely as the song has it - no lady, but a tramp.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="32"> I could make out from the painted-over lettering on its stern that, in a previous life, it had been the Kashima Maru, out of Nagasaki.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="33"> Worn out and abandoned by the Japanese, renamed, its bows crumpled by a collision, its engines weary, today it limps around the Sulus with 500 passengers, 37 crew and 200 tonnes of cargo.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="34"> It would not satisfy more discerning cruise enthusiasts.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="35"> It has no cabins, just long rows of canvas cots 5ft long and 18in wide.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="36"> My feet stuck out over the ship's railing and my arms flopped over the cots touching my own on either side.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="37"> The fluorescent lights that burned all night on the roof overhead were one obstacle to sleep; worse was the rooster tethered to the railing three cots away.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="38"> Like all roosters he woke early and, by 4.30 on the second morning, I was ready to make my own contribution to murder and mayhem in the Sulus.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="39"> But when there is no sleep, there is always conversation.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="40"> The pair of middle-aged women sleeping to one side of me looked like two dears on a shopping spree and, in a way, they were.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="41"> They were professional smugglers, they proudly told me.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="42"> They were going to Sitangkai, the last port in the Sulu chain; from there it was just a four-hour ride by speed-boat to Sabah, in Borneo, where they would buy gold to bring back and sell.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="43"> Were they not afraid of being caught, I asked.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="44"> 'Not at all,' one smiled, comfortingly.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="45"> 'Naval and customs patrols are all paid off'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="46"> What about pirates?</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="47"> 'Yes, they are a little more trouble,' said the other.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="48"> It was as if we were discussing nothing more sinister than avoiding bores at cocktail parties.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="49"> 'You just have to choose a boat fast enough to out-run them'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="50"> The hours passed.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="51"> One steamy port of call followed another through odd hours of darkness and light.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="52"> Like the rest of the passengers on the Lady Ruth, I fell into a tropical heat-induced stupor.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="53"> When we arrived at Sitangkai, I did not even realise it.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="54"> I thought we were still far out at sea.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="55"> Much to my confusion, so we were.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="56"> Sitangkai is not an island at all but a town of 10,000 people perched on stilts 8ft over the water of a giant coral reef.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="57"> The Lady Ruth had to dock two miles away in deep water at a concrete wharf attached to nothing; with brightly-coloured parasols held up against the sun, we buzzed over the turquoise sea towards the town in motorised dug-out canoes.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="58"> Sitangkai's central thoroughfare might be 6ft deep in water but it gets as congested as any main street ashore.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="59"> Canoes, sail-boats, outriggers, outboards - everything cruises the channels of downtown Sitangkai, from naked little boys in 4ft punts to mean-looking, forward-raked smuggling boats that can out-run anything.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="60"> I was slightly nervous as I wandered around on the raised wooden walkways linking shops and houses, schools and mosques.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="61"> With long hair, tank-tops and bandannas tied Rambo-style, some of these smugglers looked as mean as their boats.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="62"> I was fast attracting a crowd.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="63"> 'Milikan] Milikan]' children shouted, pointing.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="64"> To them, every white face was American.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="65"> Presumably, every white face was also rich.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="66"> Was Sitangkai as rough and unruly as the other towns of the Sulu Sea?</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="67"> Was I an easy picking that had drifted in on the current? I was not.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="68"> Within an hour, I was sitting comfortably on a split-bamboo platform eating sea mantis and seaweed salad while warm salt water slopped gently below.</s>

<s docid="FT941-11108" num="69"> Like many inhabitants of Sitangkai, my host, Hadji Yusef Malabong, is a Badjao - a sea gipsy.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6171" num="6"> THE OCEANS hold the key to supplying the world with energy during the next century, the meeting heard.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6171" num="7"> Mr Ian Fells, professor of energy conversion at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, pointed out that the energy potential of the oceans 'has hardly been tapped and represents an invaluable resource'.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6171" num="8"> He suggested the contributions that the oceans could make include: Temperature differences between the warm surface of the tropical seas and the cold waters beneath can drive heat engines in ocean thermal energy conversion (Otec) plants.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6171" num="9"> Floating Otec units weighing several thousand tonnes and generating 20MW of power have been designed to 'graze' over the oceans, Prof Fells said, identifying high thermal gradients to operate their fluid turbines.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6171" num="10"> The energy of the winds blowing across the oceans can be tapped directly through coastal wind turbines - or indirectly through the waves they whip up.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6171" num="11"> Tidal power could make a large contribution.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6171" num="12"> The proposed Severn Barrage, with a cost estimated at Pounds 9bn, could produce 6 per cent of the UK's electricity.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6171" num="13"> But as Prof Fells pointed out, it 'would not be economic at the high rates of return demanded by the City' without a special environmental subsidy.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6171" num="14"> A related but more speculative proposal is to harness the energy of ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6171" num="15"> Huge biomass farms could be established at coastal sites to grow algae for energy.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6171" num="16"> Experimental algae farms already exist in California.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6171" num="17"> The oceans contain large quantities of uranium which could be extracted to fuel nuclear power stations if supplies from conventional uranium mines become scarce.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6171" num="18"> 'If tidal power stations are built, a uranium extraction plant could be incorporated in the design,' Prof Fells said.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6171" num="19"> Mr John Collier, chairman of Nuclear Electric, the state-owned operator of nuclear stations in England and Wales, said nuclear power 'clearly has an essential role to play' in meeting future electricity demand while holding down the emissions of carbon dioxide.</s>

<s docid="FT923-6171" num="20"> He proposed a 50:50 split between new nuclear and renewable energy sources over the next few decades.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="15"> [Text] Our country's seas have a rich and varied nature.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="16"> For generations, the ocean has supplied our people with valuable items.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="17"> "Golden forests and silver oceans" is an old saying of our people and a generalization about the rich nature of our country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="18"> Ocean resources in general and marine products in particular have always played an important role in the national economy and been viewed as one of Vietnam's leading economic sectors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="19"> Thus, exploiting, protecting, and developing our marine resources in conjunction with defending our national sovereignty at sea is extremely important both economically and politically and with respect to national defense and security.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="20"> This is a large and complex problem.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="21"> It is the task of the entire country, which includes the marine products sector.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="22"> In this article, we will mention only a number of problems so that readers can study them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="23"> 1. A number of natural characteristics and the marine products potential of Vietnam.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="24"> Vietnam's coastline runs for 3,260 km, passing though 13 latitudes from north to south.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="25"> The ratio of the mainland coastline to the mainland area is rather high: 1 km:100 square km.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="26"> The world average is only 1:600.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="27"> Our country's various coastal areas differ greatly in terms of climate, weather, and hydrologic and crop systems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="28"> Our string of islands consists of approximately 4,000 large and small islands, which includes two large archipelagoes, the Hoang Sa and Truong Sa [Spratly] islands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="29"> There are many coral reef areas and many bays and inlets that provide good conditions for many types of marine products to live, grow, and reproduce.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="30"> The monsoons and the geography of the East Sea have formed a special ocean current system that reverses direction in accord with the two monsoon winds, that is, the northeasterly monsoon in the cold season and the southwesterly monsoon in the hot season.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="31"> The coastal tides are very complex, because they are controlled by both the terrain and the ocean bottom.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="32"> The area near the shore of the Gulf of Tonkin has a typical solar tidal system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="33"> The Thuan An (Hue) seaport area has an irregular semi-solar tidal system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="34"> Other areas have mixed tidal systems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="35"> The amplitude of the tides differs from one area to the next.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="36"> The depths of the coastal areas vary greatly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="37"> Every year, there is an average of 9-12 typhoons in the East Sea and approximately 30-35 northeasterly monsoon winds that influence mainly the northern and central provinces.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="38"> The above characteristics exert an important influence on the distribution of the marine products and on the harvesting and protection seasons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="39"> On marine products: Based on many survey and research projects, Vietnam's marine products reserves have been estimated at approximately 3-3.5 million tons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="40"> Approximately 1.2-1.4 millions tons a year can be harvested.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="41"> Our country's marine products are rich and varied, and to date we have identified only about 2,000 species of fish belonging to many different families and orders.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="42"> There are 1,600 species of crustacea, which includes about 70 species of shrimp.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="43"> There are about 2,500 species of molluscs and more than 600 species of seaweed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="44"> Besides this, Vietnam's seas also have many types of marine products of high economic value such as sea slugs, hydrophiidae, abalone, clams, rays, sea turtles, sea animals, and oysters.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="45"> Based on the different geological, climatic, and hydrologic conditions and different biological systems, our seas can be divided into four main zones: the Gulf of Tonkin, the central sea, the eastern Nam Bo sea, and the western Nam Bo sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="46"> 2. The situation in exploiting marine products and security in Vietnamese waters.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="47"> As for the situation in exploiting marine products in Vietnamese sea areas, our country's fishing industry is a people's industry that is presently carried on mainly near the shore.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="48"> We have approximately 68,000 ships and boats, about 80 percent of which have been equipped with motors with a total capacity of almost 1 million horsepower.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="49"> Of these, about 80-90 percent are of small size of 40 CV or less.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="50"> The harvesting industry is composed of 6 groups with more than 40 types, with the most widespread being dragnet fishing, encirclement, draw fishing, hook fishing, and seabed basket fishing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="51"> There are more than 300,000 fishermen and more than 500,000 people engaged in processing and rear service activities to support the fishing industry.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="52"> During the 10-year period 1982-1992, the country's gross production of marine products increased every year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="53"> In 1992 production reached 721,681 tons, and in 1993 production is expected to reach 793,324 tons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="54"> In general, production has increased every year, but the new requirement is that quantities must increase constantly and, at the same time, the sources must be protected so that we can exploit these sources long into the future.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="55"> Fishing activities today are concentrated mainly in coastal areas from a depth of 35 meters or less and to the maximum depth permitted (with bottom and surface fish).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="56"> Approximately 80-90 percent of the fishing activities are carried on in this area.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="57"> Thus, activities aimed at increasing fishing yields are being carried on mainly in depths of 50 meters or more, particularly in deep-sea areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="58"> Catches of surface fish can increase to 160,000 tons a year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="59"> Today, the fishing industry is confronted by the reality that a high percentage of the marine products caught are not yet fully mature when caught.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="60"> This is particularly true for shrimp, a number of species of fish, and mollusca having export value.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="61"> This is a danger that must be dealt with promptly; otherwise, a number of valuable species such as groupers, lobsters, and "diep" face the threat of extinction.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="62"> Along with this, there is the use of inefficient fishing techniques and tools.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="63"> In particular, explosives are used to extract and kill many species of marine products, which destroys the ecological conditions and changes the growth and reproduction environments of the various species of marine products.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="64"> In just 1992 and 1993, more than 600 cases were tried involving more than 700 boats that used explosives to catch marine products, and [officials] seized 7,685 kg of explosives, 544 mines, 14,884 detonators, and 1,046 meters of slow-burning fuses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="65"> Environmental pollution is increasing because of industrial waste, waste matter emitted by ships at sea, and waste matter released by the oil and gas drilling platforms.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="66"> Together with the destruction of the headwater forests, mangrove swamps, underground reefs, coral zones, and so on, this has had a great effect on the sources of marine products.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="67"> Thus, the important and pressing problem today is to tie exploiting the marine products with protecting the marine product sources and protecting the environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="68"> This is the only way to ensure an increase in productivity and yields and keep from exhausting our country's valuable marine products and ocean environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="69"> Concerning security at sea, to date, it can be said that few of our country's sea areas, particularly areas in our territorial waters and special economic zones, have been fully exploited.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="70"> In recent years, disputes over sea areas and islands have been very complex, and this will continue to be the cause in the future.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="71"> This is the case in two main areas, the northeastern sea and the southwestern sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="72"> In the Gulf of Tonkin, the Truong Sa [Spratly] Islands, and the Bai Tu Chinh area, many boats and ships of various types (fishing boats, warships, seismology ships, ocean survey ships, and so on) from various countries have regularly operated illegally, with the average being 20-80 ships a day.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="73"> The situation in the southwestern coastal area is also very complex.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="74"> Foreign ships entering our territorial waters, illegally extracting marine products, and engaging in various activities for a variety of reasons is a very serious situation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="75"> Each year, foreign fishing boats illegally catch more than 1 million tons of fish in our waters, which is more than we catch.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="76"> Also, many foreign ships illegally survey our sea areas, cause provocations, and threaten the safety of our oil and gas exploration and extraction activities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="77"> They also seize Vietnamese ships operating and fishing in Vietnamese waters.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="78"> In 1993 alone, foreign ships seized 152 Vietnamese boats and 249 fishermen and 29 ships belonging to the Ministry of Communications and transportation and the Ministry of Marine Products.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="79"> The above situation is posing a serious threat to the peaceful working life of our people, threatening our security, and encroaching on our national sovereignty at sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="80"> 3. Exploiting the marine products in conjunction with maintaining the security and sovereignty of the state in the East Sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="81"> From the actual activities of the marine products sector, we can see that the presence of Vietnamese fishing boats at sea, particularly on the open seas and at remote islands, has contributed to discovering, expelling, and seizing foreign ships, blocking their illegal activities in our territorial waters, and protecting the sovereignty and manifesting our ownership in the fatherland's sea areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="82"> In past years, many local and central fishing units that have worked together in catching marine products have participated in discovering and expelling foreign fishing boats and a number of foreign boats conducting seismological surveys in the East Sea by "throwing nets" fore and aft or surrounding the foreign ship, which has had the effect of blocking or slowing the speed of the enemy and enabling border defense forces and naval forces to deal with the situation promptly and force them to withdraw.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="83"> Naval groups and fishing fleets of the Kien Giang and Minh Hai provincial marine products sectors have carried on fishing activities and dealt directly with threats by enemy ships.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="84"> They have also expelled and seized foreign boats that have encroached on our territorial waters.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="85"> They have closely coordinated carrying on production activities with protecting production and maintaining security and national sovereignty at sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="86"> The policy of having people go to live and work on the islands having the necessary conditions is a good way to tie the work of catching and processing marine products to the task of protecting our sovereignty and security at sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="87"> On the Chau island in Kien Giang Province, the policy is to provide help so that every fishing household can borrow money and to allocate 20 million dong to build houses on the islands and buy boats.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="88"> The fishermen there have responded positively to this policy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="89"> On the other hand, the infantry forces on the islands have implemented many positive measures to help the people build schools and medical aid stations and enable them to carry on production with peace of mind and become masters on the islands and at sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="90"> Haiphong has a policy of encouraging fishermen to establish enterprises on a number of islands in the Gulf of Tonkin in order to carry on fishing activities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="91"> The Ministry of Marine Products has plans to invest in the material and technical base in conjunction with taking credit loans and borrowing money from abroad at a low or favorable rate of interest in order to build marine products processing installations and repair installations and to buy boats, ships, and other means (approximately 100-120 boats a year of 100CV or more).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="92"> In 1993, on a number of islands, there were programs concerning investment capital.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="93"> Based on the plans to expand the fishing industry in conjunction with the program to move people to key areas and islands, along with building marine products production installations, attention must be given to developing the cultural, social, communications, and information bases in order to stabilize the lives of the people, enable them to produce with their minds at ease, and protect our national sovereignty at sea and on the islands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="94"> In conjunction with naval and other forces, the Ministry of Marine Products must organize things to bring fishing fleets to a number of important sea areas (such as the Truong Sa Islands) in order to protect the fishing grounds and ocean resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="95"> What is even more important is that we must constantly have fishing forces in those places that are ready to coordinate with the Ministry of Marine Products in order to manifest our sovereignty and protect our national sovereignty at sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="96"> In order to maintain large fishing forces on the open seas and in remote ocean areas, the Ministry of Marine Products and the coastal localities must regularly organize things to enable the fishermen to take long-term loans (10 years), medium-term loans (5 years), and short-term loans (1-2 years) at a low rate of interest to build large boats and purchase fishing gear and have high productivity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="97"> At the same time, rear services and other services and product storage must be organized well so that the fishermen can carry on production in remote sea areas for longer periods.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="98"> In 1993, fishermen on Phu Quy Island in Binh Thuan assembled a 55-boat fishing fleet, caught marine products in the Truong Sa area, and earned revenues of more than 3 billion dong.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="99"> This is a good example from which other localities can gain experience.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="100"> To ensure that the people stick close to the remote fishing grounds, particularly those in important sea areas, besides the investments by the state and marine products sector in materials and techniques, naval and border defense forces must guide things closely, organize things efficiently, provide support, and provide protection so that fishermen can produce with their minds at ease.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="101"> The naval forces must also organize flotillas to make patrols and provide protection and also to catch marine products and provide services far out at sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="102"> They must coordinate things with the fishing forces of the localities and marine products sector and create a broad fishing line on the open seas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="103"> Only in this way will results be achieved in protecting and exploiting our sea resources and defending our national sovereignty at sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="104"> The ocean fishing forces require centralized and unified guidance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="105"> There must be plans to organize and protect production.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="106"> Every fishing group must carry out the fishing tasks and also help defend and manifest Vietnam's sovereignty in remote sea areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="107"> Attention must be given to applying the experiences of the fishermen in order to formulate production plans and protect production.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="108"> Plans must be formulated to coordinate things closely between the armed forces and the production forces at sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="109"> The ocean lines of defense and the all-people's national defense and people's security front at sea must be solidified.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="110"> Stability and safety must be maintained for economic activities at sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="111"> International laws of the sea must be obeyed strictly, our national sovereignty at sea must be defended resolutely, and peace and stability in the East Sea must be maintained.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="112"> In order to carry out the tasks of exploiting, protecting, and developing the marine product resources along with defending the sovereignty of our state in the East Sea firmly, we would like to make a number of proposals: 1.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="113"> Intensive propaganda and education activities must be strengthened for all strata of people, particularly for leading and managerial cadres, so that they clearly understand both international and domestic laws on the sea and have a deep understanding concerning national sovereignty at sea, on the islands, and on the continental shelf.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="114"> Within this is the problem of exploiting and protecting our sources of marine products along with defending Vietnam's sovereignty in the East Sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="115"> 2. The state should soon formulate a policy giving priority to investing in ocean marine products research programs in order to have a basis for making forecasts, guiding fishing activities, and effectively protecting the sources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="116"> Investments in technical means and equipment and information must be increased for the forces engaged in protecting our sources of marine products in order to coordinate things with the naval and border defense forces in controlling the activities of the ships at sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="117"> 4. Procedures and policies must be implemented to encourage fishermen to exploit the open seas and settle and work on the islands (give priority to them in making loans, give initial tax exemptions, build bridges and ports, and formulate cultural and social policies and procedures).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-54035" num="118"> 5. We should expand international cooperation, particularly with other countries in the region, concerning fishing on the open seas and cooperate in surveying ocean marine product sources and in obtaining and storing products.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="3"> Response: The regulation of fishing is not authorized by the Designation Document.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="4"> NOAA has determined that existing fishery management authorities are adequate to address fishery resource issues.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="5"> As with all other fisheries that occur within the Sanctuary, crab fishing and razor clam digging remain under the regulatory authority of existing Federal, state, tribal and regional fishery authorities.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="6"> NOAA does not view fishing as contrary to the goals of the Sanctuary.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="7"> The sanctuary program is by law mandated ``to facilitate to the extent compatible with the primary objective of resource protection, all public and private uses of the resources * * * ''.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="8"> (including fishing) (16 U.S.C. 1431(b)(5)).</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="9"> Existing fishery management agencies are primarily concerned with the regulation and management of fish stocks for a healthy fishery.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="10"> In contrast, the National Marine Sanctuary Program has a different and broader mandate under the MPRSA to protect all Sanctuary resources on an ecosystem-wide basis.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="11"> Thus, while fishery agencies may be concerned about certain fishing efforts and techniques in relation to fish stock abundance and distribution, the Marine Sanctuary Program is also concerned about the potential incidental impacts of specific fishery techniques on all Sanctuary resources including benthic habitats or marine mammals as well as the role the target species plays in the health of the ecosystem.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="12"> In the case of the Olympic Coast, fish resources are already extensively managed by existing authorities and NOAA does not envision a fishery management role for the Sanctuary Program.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="13"> Accordingly, fishing activities have not been included in the list of activities in the Designation Document subject to regulation as part of the Sanctuary regime.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="14"> However, the Sanctuary Program will provide research results and recommendations to existing fishery management agencies in order to enhance the protection of fishery and other resources within the Sanctuary.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="15"> Comment: No additional fisheries management or regulation is needed in the Sanctuary.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="16"> Commercial, recreation, and subsistence fishing can be compatible with sanctuary designation, and the existing regulatory framework is adequate at this time.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="17"> Response: See response to previous comment.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="18"> The Designation Document places kelp harvesting within the scope of future regulation since there is no existing management plan for kelp harvesting.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="19"> Comment: Clarify the language associated with commercial fishing practices near sunken vessels, rocks and reefs in the proposed sanctuary to insure continuance of historical and customary fishing practices.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="20"> Existing Federal and state regulations adequately protect archeological treasures, man-made reefs, and natural rock and reef formations.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="21"> The FEIS should acknowledge and permit prevailing practices.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="22"> Response: Commercial fishing vis-a-vis historical resources is an exempted activity under the prohibition against disturbance of historical resources.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="23"> However, the exemption is only for incidental disturbance and therefore does not allow deliberate disturbance.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="24"> Comment: Fishing should either be regulated, or placed in the scope of regulation, because there may be a time in the future when fishing needs to be regulated by the Sanctuary.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="25"> Response: NOAA believes that existing authorities are adequate to regulate fishing.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="26"> Should the need arise to regulate fishing as part of the Sanctuary management regime, the Designation Document could be amended.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="27"> Comment: Proposed regulations should result in the gradual reduction of fishing, aquaculture, kelp harvesting and waterfowl hunting to insure that no commercial activity threatens the integrity of any resources in the proposed Sanctuary.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="28"> Some commenters believed that the Sanctuary should ban all commercial fishing activities except Native American fishing activities.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="29"> Response: A blanket reduction of resource-use activities across the Sanctuary could not be imposed without credible evidence that each resource affected is threatened by a population decrease or stock failure.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="30"> Absent such evidence, the Act requires that existing uses be facilitated to the extent compatible with the primary objective of resource protection.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="31"> Comment: True refugia should be established where all consumptive uses are prohibited for a period of time.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="32"> Response: The determination of whether refugia are established in the Sanctuary will be done in coordination with the NMFS, PFMC, Washington Department of Fisheries (WDF), the tribes, environmental groups, and industry.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="33"> The Sanctuary Advisory Committee (SAC) will be an important forum to address this issue.</s>

<s docid="FR940511-0-00053" num="34"> If, in coordination with other governmental agencies, it is determined that establishment of refugia is a desirable alternative, NOAA will analyze the alternative through the preparation of an environmental impact statement/management plan and solicitation of public input pursuant to the NEPA and the APA.</s>
