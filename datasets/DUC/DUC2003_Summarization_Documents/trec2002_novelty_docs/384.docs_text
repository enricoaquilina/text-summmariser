<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="10"> Utah State University researchers Frank Salisbury and Bruce Bugbee see beyond hybrid wheat thriving in hydroponic gardens to a day when their experiments will help feed human colonies on the moon and Mars.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="11"> It is that vision -- of mankind planted safely beyond the pale of earthly limitations -- that has kept the two plant scientists firm in their commitment to space agriculture despite tight funding and the knowledge that they may not live to see their research implemented.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="12"> "It's long-range research that really has to be done now to be used later," said Bugbee, 38, the principal researcher for the university's controlled ecological life-support system project.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="13"> "And it's just plain interesting," he added.</s>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="14"> "Something as complex as a closed life-support system is just fascinating.</s>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="15"> We're trying to duplicate all the functions of planet Earth in a relatively small capsule".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="16"> Bugbee and Salisbury, 62, who serves on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's aerospace medical advisory committee, say it could be 30 years or more before a permanent human colony is established on the moon and another decade beyond that before Mars is settled.</s>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="17"> Nonetheless, they believe that their work will survive them.</s>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="19"> Plants raised under hydroponics are grown in nutrient-rich solutions rather than soil.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="20"> Although funding for the hydroponic project -- about $130,000 a year since it was approved by NASA in 1981 -- is minuscule compared with the billions spent on the nation's manned space flight program, Salisbury and Bugbee point with pride to its accomplishments.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="21"> Simulating as closely as possible the conditions of a lunar or Martian colonial farm through variations in lighting and atmosphere, the project has grown a Mexican dwarf variety of wheat with yields of 60 grams of edible wheat per square yard per day.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="22"> That is five times the estimated world record of 12 to 14 grams, Salisbury said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="23"> Salisbury and Bugbee, believing that they are near the theoretical production limits for wheat in an extraterrestrial colony setting, say they will next turn their attention to wheat's performance in zero gravity -- a crucial consideration for the day when mankind embarks on space voyages too long to be sustained by stored food.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="24"> To that end, they are preparing an experiment for a future space shuttle mission.</s>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="25"> NASA has approved the project, but it has yet to be scheduled for flight, the two said in telephone interviews from the school's campus in Logan, 60 miles north of Salt Lake City.</s>

</P>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="27"> Salisbury and Bugbee say a space farm could feed the Mars mission's crew and purify air and water supplies.</s>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="28"> For example, a 13-square-yard space farm could feed one person indefinitely.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="29"> Looking beyond exploration to colonization of the moon and Mars, the researchers believe that a farm about the size of a football field could provide the food and oxygen needs of 100 or more people.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="30"> A hydroponic space farm, unlike those on Earth, would not be maintained as one huge unit but would be made up of a number of self-contained compartments to guard against the spread of plant diseases.</s>

<s docid="LA040289-0050" num="31"> Further, it probably would produce far more food than needed, ranging from 20% to 100% more, as a hedge against unexpected losses.</s>

<s docid="LA102289-0040" num="49"> That means that the principal space-faring nations will have devised an agency to operate space ways and to guard them from space litter, of which, believe it or not, there already is a dismally large accumulation.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="24"> Q. How long have we thought seriously about going to Mars?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="25"> A. It's always been within the aspirations of the United States space program that someday we would go on to Mars.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="26"> But we've taken a steppingstone approach with early exploration on the moon, the shuttle, the development of the space station, and finally plans leading to Mars.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="27"> If you take our space station efforts as the first steppingstone, we started as early as 1960.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="28"> We've been working on it more intensively within the past year since President Bush's speech.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="29"> Q. So President Bush's speech was a motivating force behind renewed efforts to go to Mars?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="30"> A. I think the President wanted to provide a new and inspiring goal for the nation.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="31"> He decided we should have a long-range space program with many facets to it.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="32"> He said we should first complete the building of Space Station Freedom, which is already under way.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="33"> We would then go from that base back to the moon and build a base for scientific research, then go to Mars and explore it, because it is the planet in our solar system most like the Earth.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="34"> It was in part a response to criticism that we didn't have a long-term goal for a long time.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="35"> Q. What was the time frame?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="36"> A. There wasn't any at first, but the President said in May that by the year 2019 we would be on Mars.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="37"> That makes it much more credible.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="38"> Q. What are the technical challenges of a trip to Mars that make it such a long-range mission?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="39"> A. We've already conquered the idea of going to space.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="40"> But we're dealing with a much longer period of time.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="41"> A shuttle flight lasts seven days, a flight to the moon was about three days, and a flight to Mars would be six months to a year, one way.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="42"> So one of the big problems is the length of time man would have to spend in space.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="43"> That exposes him to things we don't fully understand yet, such as cosmic radiation and zero-gravity environment.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="44"> There may be psychological effects.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="45"> With the space station, we will learn how to address some of those questions, such as having people in space for longer periods of time.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="46"> A second challenge is simply to build the life-support systems for maintaining life for extended periods of time.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="47"> That will require new technological advances such as a life-support system that recycles (either food or waste).</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="48"> We'll also need better propulsion systems.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="49"> We have shown so far that we can do a Mars mission with some of the types of chemical propulsion systems we have today, but some of the things we're looking at are reducing the amounts of propellants required and increasing the speed of the spaceship.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="50"> There is a possibility of using nuclear propulsion.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="51"> Other challenges are building infrastructure on the moon for a permanent presence.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="52"> We'd want to use materials on the moon to do that.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="53"> That would be an altogether new way of doing things.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="54"> Q. Do you have to have a base or space station to get to Mars?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="55"> A. That has been a subject for debate.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="56"> Some people argue that we should go straight to Mars and save money that way.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="57"> But the President's position appears to be it's a more prudent approach to go to build the moon base first and learn along the way.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="58"> It would probably be easier to build the Mars ship in space or on the moon base.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="59"> Q. Is it settled that the spaceship will be manned?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="60"> A. Nothing has been settled.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="61"> We believe so far that this will involve a combination of manned and unmanned missions.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="62"> It's generally felt robotic missions should go first because you can afford to learn how to proceed.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="63"> It is also felt that ultimately we want to send humans because no matter how much you try, you cannot replace the intellect or dexterity of man.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="64"> He can adapt to his own senses on the site.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="65"> Plus it's also more exciting to the American people.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="66"> It was exciting to me to watch the first Viking probe land on Mars.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="67"> But it was far more exciting to watch man put his foot on the moon 20 years ago.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="68"> Man is an important part of this mission for lots of reasons that touch the soul of humankind.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="69"> Q. Will that mean it will take a lot longer to get there?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="70"> A. Some problems are unique to man and that could mean more time.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="71"> But man has always been a very basic part of our space program, from Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, the shuttle, the space station.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="72"> This is just the next step.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="73"> A lot of what we talk about here is a long-term perspective of where we as a world are going.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="74"> Q. Estimates of the cost are $300 billion to $500 billion, right?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="75"> A. It's very difficult for me to assess costs.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="76"> We have made our own assessments, based on a particular architecture and plan.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="77"> The government has made some estimates in the range you mentioned.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="78"> It's an expensive program, but it's also a great investment in the future.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="79"> And though the number is large, when you spread it over 30 years, you're getting a better perspective.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="80"> It adds up to less than 1% of what government spends in a year.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="81"> You have to put that in the context of what we spend each year on defense.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="82"> Q. Will this be a hard sell for the American people?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="83"> A. I don't think so.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="84"> Polls I've seen show there is a great deal of support for the program.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="85"> It's very important we have a certain investment in the future.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="86"> Q. What are the benefits?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="87"> A. It's difficult to quantify.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="88"> One has to think in terms of things that have been achieved so far in the space program.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="89"> For instance, it has benefits for our education system.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="90"> We hear about a lot of problems in science and math, where we are in a competitive battle with other nations.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="91"> Programs such as a trip to Mars have a way of inspiring people to go into these fields.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="92"> Whether they ever work in the space business is incidental.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="93"> When kids are in the fifth or sixth grades and they see things happen with this program, they will want to learn more.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="94"> That's only one benefit for the education system.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="95"> You have to invest, and it usually pays off with something entirely different from what you expected.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="96"> You can tell that story many times.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="97"> In the medical area, you can point to CAT scans as benefits from the space program.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="98"> This moves technology forward.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="99"> There are other reasons.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="100"> There is an imperative to explore, like with Columbus moving to the New World.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="101"> The pursuit of new knowledge.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="102"> We make progress as a nation because we learn new things.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="103"> If you look at the geology of Mars, the experts tell us it used to be very much like Earth a long time ago.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="104"> Today, Mars is very unlike Earth.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="105"> Once it had liquids flowing in channels.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="106"> Why did Mars evolve so differently?</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="107"> Maybe there is a clue to ensure the well-being of our own planet.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="108"> We don't know for sure, but we can try to find out.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="109"> Q. With the conversion of the defense industry, more aerospace companies are going to have to build something besides weapons.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="110"> Is that a selling point for Mars?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="111"> A. I think so, especially with the political conditions in the world today.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="112"> Most people believe conversion (of the defense industry) will happen.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="113"> There will be a fair amount of distortion in the economic impact of that.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="114"> The nation needs a certain amount of this kind of investment in defense, and it's important we not do too much to change the amount of work going into defense research.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="115"> I believe that Mars is a good investment, a source where you can put the funds during the transition.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="116"> That's a fairly potent argument for the program.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="117"> Q. Can you outline an example of current thinking for a mission to Mars?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="118"> A. The main example we've looked at is building a large rocket that can deliver several hundred thousand pounds of payload into low Earth orbit, which is well above the 50,000 pounds the shuttle could carry.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="119"> Since it would be too heavy to launch from Earth, we would carry the parts up and assemble a spaceship at the space station.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="120"> It would have a crew compartment for about four people.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="121"> A large amount of the weight would be propellant.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="122"> Once it was assembled with robots, it would take off on a trajectory to Mars.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="123"> When it neared Mars, it would enter into Mars orbit.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="124"> A portion of the ship would land on the planet itself.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="125"> The first mission might stay on the surface for 30 days.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="126"> It would use aerobrake technology, which is a device that works like a parachute, to assist in slowing down the vehicle for the landing.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="127"> That would be more efficient than carrying fuel for reverse rockets to slow the ship down.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="128"> Overall, it would not be unlike the exploration of the moon.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="129"> The astronauts could use space suits and rovers and explore.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="130"> Once having completed the mission, they would have to take off from the surface.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="131"> Here we could use several scenarios, with one lander (that would be) used going down (to Mars) and another to take off.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="132"> The return vehicle would dock with the ship, and then it would take six months to a year to get back to the space station.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="133"> Once we neared Earth, we could either land at the space station and catch a ride down in the shuttle or enter the Earth's atmosphere directly.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="134"> Aside from the time, space and propulsion capability, it's not different from going to the moon.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="135"> But it's a long reach and a lot of new technology is required.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="136"> Q. What are some of the projects your people are working on?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="137"> A. Some of us are working on specific research and development projects, trying to develop life-support systems that recycle energy, making propellants out of lunar soil or thinking about how to make a ship that could use solar energy.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="138"> Some of our people are looking at solar sails as an exotic way of powering a spaceship.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="139"> This would be a large device like a sail that would absorb rays from the sun and use the solar photons as fuel so you could reduce the weight of the spaceship and save on costs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="140"> Altogether, there are more than 60 projects under way.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="141"> Q. Earlier you mentioned nuclear propulsion.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="142"> A. I'm no expert, but nuclear propulsion could cut the flight time at least in half and maybe more.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="143"> We did have some nuclear propulsion programs 20 years ago, but nothing since.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="144"> One difficulty here would be testing.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="145"> You have to test these propulsion systems.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="146"> Twenty years ago, you could do it.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="147"> Part of it is just going out and picking up where we left off.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="148"> Q. Among Mars enthusiasts, what's the level of satisfaction about how fast things are moving?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="149"> A. I would be happy if things went faster.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="150"> But I'm thrilled we are going as fast as we are because the President is a great leader on this issue.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="151"> We would be moving a lot slower without him.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="152"> I understand the constraints and priorities that limit how fast we can do it.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="153"> But there should be no limits on the resolve to do it.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="154"> Sure, I would have been happier if we picked up after Apollo and progressed like (pioneer rocket scientist) Wernher von Braun wanted to so that we would have been on Mars in the 1980s.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="155"> In the meantime, we have a working shuttle program and the space station is being built.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="156"> Q. So it's a combination of gathering political support and building the technology you need to go to Mars?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="157"> A. Right.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="158"> There needs to be more time put into some of the issues.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="159"> They have to be discussed with the American people, policy makers in Washington and the rest of the world.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="160"> It will take some time to get people into it.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="161"> Q. Is it more difficult in this age of big deficits?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="162"> A. Sure.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="163"> But during the Apollo program, we spent 4% of our national budget on our space program.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="164"> Today we spend about 1%, and we're talking about spending another 1%.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="165"> Our priorities are different now.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="166"> During Apollo, we were competing with the Russians, and that gave it a high priority.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="167"> Q. How much has been budgeted so far?</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="168"> A. In January, President Bush submitted a budget for $188 million in 1991, a reasonable amount of money to begin the project planning for a Mars mission.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="169"> His intent was to have government find the right plan.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="170"> To move it forward, it's important we appropriate the funds in the 1991 budget.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="171"> Without it, we could see a reduction in resolve in the short term.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="172"> With it, more companies could be brought in and we are more likely to find some solutions.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="174"> A. Full-scale design and development would have to start around 1995 to meet the President's expectations.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="175"> We are counting on this project as a major source of revenue in the late 1990s and after.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="181"> Major portions of the space station are being built in Europe, Japan and Canada.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="182"> It has become a learning experience for us as we think toward a mission to Mars.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="186"> I suspect the parties would make an agreement on this issue.</s>

<s docid="LA070290-0143" num="187"> The United Nations treaties that have been put in place regarding the moon would probably be extended.</s>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="11"> Cordell, a physicist who studies advanced space systems planning for General Dynamics' San Diego-based Space Systems Division, President Bush's call this week for a manned mission to Mars was heavy on rhetoric and light on substance.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="12"> "You could argue that this was the most minimal statement that a president could make" and still support a manned Mars mission, Cordell said Friday.</s>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="13"> "But it would be unfair to characterize (Bush's initiative) as being totally devoid of leadership".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="14"> Several Democratic congressmen have done just that: One lambasted Bush for a proposal that contained "no money, no timetable and no plan".</s>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="15"> Another legislator, mindful of the program's multibillion-dollar price tag, quipped that "there is no such thing as a free launch".</s>

</P>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="17"> Cordell on Friday speculated that Bush "was faced with the 20th anniversary of the lunar landing, and he wanted to make a public statement".</s>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="18"> Unfortunately, "NASA is simply not ready to unveil its detailed plan" for a Mars trip, according to Cordell.</s>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="19"> That detailed space plan won't be available until the early 1990s, said Cordell, a former physics professor who joined General Dynamics five years ago.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="20"> Bush on Thursday used the 20th anniversary of Neil Armstrong's moonwalk to propose a three-pronged space program that includes an Earth-orbiting space station, a moon-based scientific station and a manned mission to Mars.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="21"> Yet Bush's speech marked a milestone, despite its "bare-bones approach," Cordell said.</s>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="22"> "For the first time ever, an American president has publicly endorsed a manned Mars mission," he said.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="27"> Cordell believes that Americans will look past the enormous -- but as yet, undetermined cost -- and embrace what Bush described as a "journey into tomorrow".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="28"> "I find tremendous interest in the prospect of humans exploring the solar system, particularly in Mars colonization," said Cordell, who regularly talks about space missions "before all types of groups -- from kids in school to military groups and Rotary clubs".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="29"> Although opponents will balk at the cost, Cordell argued that "a Mars program is not a budget-busting program. . . it's not something that will bankrupt the U.</s>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="32"> The proposed Mars mission offers "important new scientific knowledge, a compelling stimulus for technological growth, potentially great economic return. . . a chance for improved international relations, and a profound opportunity for the evolution of human civilization and consciousness into the cosmos," Cordell said during that speech .</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="35"> To limit risk, Cordell cautioned against turning the Mars mission into a "space race" between the United States and Russia.</s>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="36"> That warning echoed former astronaut Sally Ride's 1987 statement that a space race to Mars could compromise astronaut safety.</s>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="37"> Ride in the fall will become director of the of the California Space Institute on the UC San Diego campus.</s>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="38"> Ride has repeatedly urged national policy planners to establish a permanent lunar research outpost and to develop a coordinated, long-term space exploration plan.</s>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="39"> "If it's not developed, the space program will be fragmented," Ride said in a recent interview.</s>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="40"> Cordell suggested that "a 'moon-first' philosophy. . . (would be) more consistent with the incremental increases in mission difficulty and risk that were evident during the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="41"> If the United States does mount a Mars mission, he said, there would be several challenges:</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="42"> * Medical experts must deal with the effects of "microgravity" upon astronauts' bones, muscles and cell tissue during the two-to-four-year Mars mission.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="43"> * Waste recycling would be critical during a Mars mission because space limitations would prohibit astronauts from stocking and maintaining an adequate supply of air, water and food.</s>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="44"> * Doctors are studying the effects of radiation, which will be 100 times heavier than levels encountered during Apollo lunar missions.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="45"> * During the years-long adventure, astronauts will face all of the leading causes of death -- cancer, heart attack, suicide, trauma, etc. -- facing their fellow earthlings.</s>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="46"> * Social scientists also are studying how a highly trained group would react to an "isolated and confined" space ship.</s>

<s docid="LA072289-0042" num="47"> They also are studying "the slightly touchy subject of sex in space" because there is a "high likelihood of mixed-gender crews," Cordell said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28821" num="14"> BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- A government panel has drafted an ambitious space development blueprint that foresees manned outposts on the Moon within three decades and calls for sending artists and intellectuals as well as space specialists into space, panel sources said Tuesday [14 June].</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28821" num="15"> The new grand design for Japan's space program will be included in a report to be announced as early as July by the Space Activities Commission's task force responsible for drawing up the nation's long-term space policy outline, the sources said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28821" num="16"> The report will illustrate Japan's emboldened posture in space development after the February success in launching the H-2 rocket, the first large rocket built solely with domestic technology, they said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28821" num="17"> The proposals will be incorporated into the government's space development platform which is expected to be revised for the first time in five years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28821" num="18"> The report stipulates two groups of targets for space development projects, to be achieved in 15 years and in 30 years, respectively.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28821" num="19"> The commission has fashioned a 15-year plan for bringing back rocks and ice from Mercury and other small planets and also for geological research on Mars and the Moon using surface rovers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28821" num="20"> After 30 years, Japan should have completed, with international cooperation if possible, a manned station and an astronomical observatory on the Moon, the report says.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28821" num="21"> For fostering the necessary technology for such a grandiose project, the report proposes active participation in the U.S.-inspired international space station program, expected to be completed in early 21st century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28821" num="22"> It also stresses the importance of sending nonexperts like intellectuals and artists to the planned space station to make space activities more familiar to the public.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28821" num="23"> The report cites probes on the Moon and the use of solar energy in space as principal new space ventures that Japan should embark on.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28821" num="24"> For the lunar probes, observations of the Moon surface by satellites and the bringing of Moon soil back to the earth are envisaged as goals to be achieved within 15 years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28821" num="25"> Japan should play an active part in any international projects for building Moon stations, it says.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28821" num="26"> As for the transportation technology demanded by the project, the report calls for development of a spruced-up version of the H-2 rocket that is twice as powerful as the current model within 10 years as a means to launch Japan's own unmanned space shuttles.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-28821" num="27"> The space shuttles (Hope, or H-2 orbiting plane) should be augmented for manned missions within 30 years, the report says.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42535" num="17"> During the U.S. visit that was wrapped up at the end of last week -- a visit by the Russian Space Agency (RSA) delegation, which was headed by the agency's director, Yuriy Koptev -- a detailed plan was coordinated for the creation of an international space station, which for now is being called Alpha.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42535" num="20"> At the same time, the RSA and the American National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will conclude a similar agreement, as well as a basic contract worth $350-370 million.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42535" num="21"> The new plan will replace two projects that existed independent of each other -- the American Freedom project, which in fact was closed down because of financial difficulties, and the Russian Mir-2, which Russia, too, lacks the money to complete by itself.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42535" num="22"> Mr. Koptev noted that the participation in the creation of the Alpha station will be 2- to 2.5-fold cheaper for Russia than would the Mir-2 project.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42535" num="23"> The first stage alone of the creation of Alpha (in which the Russian Protons and the American Shuttles will deliver to the Mir station additional equipment, and in which joint flights of Russians and Americans will take place) will enable Russian enterprises of the military-industrial complex to receive contracts worth $400 million.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42535" num="24"> The U.S. administration has promised to allocate that money to pay for the services of Russian firms in 1995-1997.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42535" num="25"> In the second and third stages (the station is to be completed by the year 2001), the RSA head estimated that the figure may grow to $900 million.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42535" num="26"> The plan, signed by the heads of the RSA and NASA in Washington, has already been sent for review to Congress and to the Russian government.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42535" num="27"> Mr. Koptev brushed aside the fears that the Americans would be the proprietors of the station.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42535" num="28"> Russia is contributing to the project its own technologies and services, and, in his opinion, the overall balance will be in favor of Russia.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42535" num="29"> In addition, the head of the RSA is convinced that the project itself is impossible without the equal participation of Russia in the creation of the station.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42535" num="31"> The European governments, as recently as October, were reviewing the question of the equal participation of Russia -- a final decision is to be issued in early December, and it is expected to be positive.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="15"> CSO [Text] The success of the launch of the H-2 marked a page in the history of space development in this country and can be called the first step toward the moon and Mars observation missions or toward the launch of the Japanese version of the space shuttle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="16"> It has been 39 years since the University of Tokyo succeeded in launching the "Pencil Rocket" as this country's first attempt at rocketry.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="17"> Until now, Japan had been largely depending on technology licensed from the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="18"> Now Japan is capable of participating in the international space development race with its own technology, which is on a par with that of the United States, Europe, Russia and China.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="19"> The H-2 launch-vehicle project got under way in 1984 when its development project was authorized by the Space Activities Commission of the Prime Minister's Office.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="20"> The development itself actually started in 1986, and the first launch was slated for 1991 in the beginning.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="21"> The object of the project was to develop a rocket that would be comparable to the U.S.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="22"> Titan rocket and the European Ariane rocket based on Japan's own technology.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="23"> At that time, Japan had just succeeded in launching the N-2 launch vehicle and was developing the H-1 launch vehicle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="24"> No consensus had been reached yet as to the specification of the vehicle that was to be the successor of the H-1, and 800 kg, 1 ton and 1.5 tons were discussed as the possible payloads.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="25"> NTT proposed an idea for increasing the weight of a satellite to be launched to geostationary orbit to 2 metric tons from 550 kg (H-1).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="26"> They told the National Aerospace Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) that future satellites had to be much larger, as they saw increasing needs for larger communication satellites, and that was indeed the start of the H-2 project.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="27"> The H-2 launch vehicle thus developed is 49 meters in total length and weighs 260 metric tons before launch.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="28"> The main propulsion system consists of two stage rockets, both using liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as propellants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="29"> The two stage combustion principle used in the H-2's first stage engine is similar to that of the U.S.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="30"> Space Shuttle and the Russian Energiya.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="31"> That was the key to the overall success of the project.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="32"> The first stage engine, dubbed the LE-7, is a highly efficient engine capable of converting every gram of propellant carried in the tank into a thrust force.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="33"> Of course, it is not the first Japanese engine to use liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as the propellants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="34"> The LE-5 engine, which was used as the second stage engine of the H-1 was based on the same principle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="35"> With the LE-5, a portion of the liquid propellants was vaporized to use its expansion energy to drive the turbopump, and the propellant used for driving the turbopump was discarded after that, resulting in poor engine efficiency.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="36"> In the two stage combustion system, which was the key development item of the entire project, the gas produced in the first stage combustion is used for driving the turbopump.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="37"> Then the propellant remaining after the first stage combustion and the propellent pumped directly from the tank into the combustion room are mixed and caused to react.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="38"> As the propellant is burned in two stages, it is called the two stage combustion system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="39"> Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries developed that turbopump, whereas Mitsubishi Heavy Industries developed the main body of the engine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="40"> The engine generates 86 metric tons (110 tons in the vacuum) of thrust at sea level, which exceeds the average sea level thrust of 77 tons generated by the MB-3 engine used on N-type or H-1 rockets.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="41"> The engine was the most difficult part of the entire project; an explosion during the development of the turbine resulted in a loss of human life, and yet another explosion during a combustion test caused the disintegration of the engine, thus forcing the launch schedule to be put off for two years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="42"> The development of a launch vehicle is often said to be built on the number of engines destroyed during the development; the fact that they had only two years of delay from the original schedule is commendable.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="43"> The first stage rocket engine is attached to a pair of solid-propellant rockets, each of which is packed with a solid polybutadiene propellant and measures 1.8 meters in diameter and 23 meters in length; they provide an additional total thrust of about 300 metric tons (159 tons each).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="44"> This auxiliary rocket was developed by Nissan Motor, which is considered quite dependable because its long history of rocket development dates back to the good old days of the Pencil Rocket.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="45"> That same rocket will be used as the main engine of the next-generation J-1 small launch vehicle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="46"> J-1 is a small, economical launch vehicle that is scheduled to lift the prototype of HOPE, the Japanese version of the space shuttle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="47"> The second-stage engine of the H-2 is the LE-5A, a modified model of the LE-5, which has proved itself as H-1's second-stage engine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="48"> The engine was modified from the gas-generator system to the hydrogen breed-cycle system; it produces 12 metric tons of thrust in a vacuum.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="49"> The fairing, for enclosing a payload such as a satellite, was also developed with domestic technology this time, although it had been imported from the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="50"> A huge fairing having a total length of 4 meters was developed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which joined in the rocket manufacturing business for the first time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="51"> With the success of the H-2 launch vehicle, Japan is entering its large-rocket era.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="52"> The H-2 can place a 2-metric-ton satellite into geostationary orbit (altitude: 36,000 km), a cargo weighing about 10 metric tons into low earth orbit (such as a cargo to a space station), a satellite weighing about 5 metric tons into a sun-synchronous orbit (altitude: about 700 km), or a satellite weighing about 6 metric tons into an orbit with an altitude of 1,000 km.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="53"> It will also be able to haul a surveyor weighing 2 metric tons to the moon or Mars, fulfilling many space development dreams.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="57"> Various versions are also possible.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="58"> Its capacity is comparable to the launch capability of the Ariane IV, which was developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) in 1988 and is currently operated by Arianespace (2.3 metric tons to geostationary orbit), or the capability of the U.S.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="59"> Titan 3 (2.2 metric tons to geostationary orbit); the upgraded version of the H-2 will have a capability equivalent to the Ariane V (4.5 metric tons to geostationary orbit), to be tested by ESA in 1995, or the Titan 4 (same capacity), which is already in service.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="60"> Of course, everything is not rosy in the Japanese space era being ushered in by the H-2.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="61"> The manufacture of each H-2 costs about \|[yen ]\|16 billion; when added to the launch cost, which is estimated to be about \|[yen ]\|3 billion, the total cost becomes \|[yen ]\|19 billion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="62"> That is high by comparison with overseas competitors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="63"> The yen, which was valued at \|[yen ]\|240 to the U.S. dollar when the project started, is now \|[yen ]\|120 to the U.S. dollar.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="64"> There is no way to compete with the vehicles of other countries that are launched at a cost of about \|[yen ]\|10 billion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44900" num="67"> Also, the operational issues that had been postponed until the success of the launch are now beginning to be reviewed, so that it is certain that our international competitiveness will be re-evaluated soon.</s>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="23"> Like a number of other scientists across the country, Murray has been pushing for years for a manned expedition to Mars.</s>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="24"> He has consistently criticized plans to build a manned, orbiting space station, claiming that the $30-billion project -- which faces stiff opposition in Congress -- is just another piece of equipment, not a goal.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="25"> That criticism softened considerably Thursday on the heels of the President's speech because the space station, like so many other projects in the space program, could play a role in any effort to send astronauts to Mars.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="26"> Louis Friedman, executive director of the Pasadena-based Planetary Society and another outspoken critic of the space station, also eased his position after hearing Bush's speech.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="27"> The strongest criticism of Bush's statement stemmed from the fact that he did not outline the role that other nations would have in a manned expedition to Mars, and many believe that only an international program is likely to succeed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="28"> "International really means the Soviet Union," noted Murray, because the Soviets have the best information about the effects of long-term exposure to space.</s>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="29"> The record -- one year -- is held by a Soviet cosmonaut.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="30"> A manned expedition to Mars would be costly, "probably hundreds of billions of dollars over a long period of time," but it's "not going to cost much extra over the next five years," Logsdon said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="31"> What is needed now, Friedman said, is to work out the details on how such a mission should be approached.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="32"> Many of the projects that would be precursors to a Mars mission are already on the drawing boards.</s>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="33"> The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is already developing plans for robotic, unmanned missions to Mars that would collect the information needed long before a manned expedition could be launched.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="34"> The Freedom Space Station would serve as the beginning step toward a permanent manned presence in space.</s>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="35"> It would be followed by an "international spaceport" where large vehicles could be assembled in space so that they could be launched toward Mars without having to burn the fuel necessary to overcome Earth's gravity.</s>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="36"> Knowledge of Mining</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="37"> A manned laboratory on the moon would allow astronauts to learn how to mine materials for permanent facilities, and possibly even extract oxygen and hydrogen from the lunar surface to fuel their rocket ships.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="38"> Even if all of that could be carried out successfully over the next couple of decades, the actual trip to Mars would be filled with such profound challenges that it may be beyond human endurance.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="39"> Throughout the years-long trip, the astronauts would be faced with the possibility of a meteoroid ripping through their spacecraft, causing rapid decompression that would kill them within seconds.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="40"> A violent storm on the surface of the sun could blast the spacecraft with deadly radiation.</s>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="41"> So the craft would require some sort of storm shelter.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="42"> Throughout much of the trip, the craft would be so far from Earth that the astronauts would be pretty much on their own.</s>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="43"> It would take about 30 minutes for messages to travel back and forth between the craft and Earth by the time the astronauts reached the vicinity of Mars.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="44"> The astronauts would probably have to spend a year there, waiting for Mars to reach the right point in its orbit for them to launch themselves back toward Earth.</s>

<s docid="LA072189-0108" num="45"> And it would take about a year to get back.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="20"> German Astronautics Must Not Jeopardize Its Great Potential"] [Text] Thursday, 11 Nov 93 (HANDELSBLATT)--"As long as our competitors are being government-supported in a world of international competition, this has to be possible in Germany too.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="21"> As with all high technologies, with space too the government has to not only set the general framework, but also provide positive support for further development".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="22"> The new director general of DARA (German Agency for Space Affairs), Jan-Baldem Mennicken, made this statement in a conversation with HANDELSBLATT.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="23"> In Mennicken's opinion, German astronautics is contributing to the solution of terrestrial problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="24"> This refers first and foremost to problems of telecommunications, earth observation, navigation and detection and ranging.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="25"> It is making use of fixed positions beyond the earth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="26"> Besides direct practical application, DARA is interested also in the (indirect) economic effect of space projects, in improvement of the industrial structure.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="27"> It is precisely small and medium-sized companies too that must be included in the programs here: On the one hand, large companies must let themselves be supplied by small and medium-sized ones.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="28"> Mennicken: "We want to bring about transparency in the market as regards national funds and those of the European Space Agency (ESA) as well.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="29"> We are trying to get the large system companies to deliberately award a part of their contracts to small and medium-sized companies".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="30"> On the other hand, DARA is trying to make small and medium-sized companies fit for such industrial cooperation, including for development, as regards reliability and quality standards, for example.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="31"> DARA has worked out a strategic plan for this purpose.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="32"> There have definitely been successes in the endeavor of the "commercialization" of German astronautics--meaning economic activities independently of government support.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="33"> According to the German industry's data, space's share in 1992 already reached a volume of business of 430 million German marks [DM], primarily in the area of telecommunications and through contracts associated with the production of ESA's Ariane-4 rocket.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="34"> DM1.248 billion of government support funds were received in the same time period, it is stated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="35"> The one-to-three ratio between both sources of income is viewed as relatively satisfactory.</s>

</H3>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="37"> Ever since its founding DARA has endeavored to interest in space projects other departments too, besides the Federal Ministry for Research and Technology (BMFT) as the main financier of German aerospace.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="38"> There have already been successes here too.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="39"> For instance, a decision has been made at the Federal Ministry of Transport to appropriate funds for the second generation of Meteosat weather observation satellites that will be operational around the year 2000.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="40"> The time lead versus purely terrestrial weather observation already today amounts to two days.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="41"> Cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture is desired in a special application for monitoring the use of agricultural areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="42"> The observation of seismic areas is very valuable to the insurance business, for example.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="43"> The German Rosat x-ray satellite has provided spectacular results in space-station-based astronomy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="44"> It is essential for full utilization of the potential for the exploitation of space to develop certain additional instruments or to find a new use for instruments at hand.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="45"> According to Mennicken, the Europeans' participation within ESA-- essentially cofinanced by the Germans--in the international but American-dominated Freedom space station has to be redefined.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="46"> For, after the turn of events in the East and for budget reasons, the Americans decided on close cooperation with the Russians.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="47"> A flight of the US Space Shuttle to the Russian Mir space station, where the Americans want to dock, is planned at present.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="48"> In addition, a "core station" is to be built from American and Russian components in 1997-98.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="49"> The large Freedom space station is still the ultimate goal.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="50"> By the way, the Japanese have decided on a stay in this ambitious project.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="51"> Furthermore, the Canadians too are one of the party with their robotic arm that they designed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="52"> The Europeans have had to order substantial economizing in their Columbus contribution--likewise for budget reasons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="53"> For instance, the MTFF (Man Tended Free Flyer), i.e., a docked laboratory module, has been shelved.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="54"> Using the new Ariane-5 rocket as a transporter for cargo and later for people is being discussed now, instead of the canceled Hermes space transporter.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="55"> On the other hand the Polar Platform scheduled for orbiting over both poles of the earth will come about.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="56"> It is planned as a carrier for the new large Envisat satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="57"> The Europeans (ESA) demanded active participation in the (to be reconfigured) Russian-American space station.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="58"> They would like to provide a data management system or a special antenna for communication between satellites, for example.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="59"> After the two space shuttle missions under German scientific leadership--D1 and D2--there will be no D3.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="60"> This is an obvious political decision, says Mennicken.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="61"> Just whether there will be a Europe-1 mission within ESA is still being debated at present.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="62"> The hypersonic transporter project, along the lines of the Sanger (Germany) or Hotol (Great Britain) proposals, at the interface of aeronautics and astronautics, also had to be revised in its basic formulation nationally or within ESA, "in order to be able to decide in 10 or 20 years on the development of prototypes".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="63"> Mennicken joins with the call of the Federal Association of the German Aerospace and Armaments Industry (BDLI) to absolutely maintain a certain industrial base in order to be able to still take part at all as a partner country in international projects.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="64"> There is a threshold that, if fallen below, has to result in a loss of know-how and of valuable staff members.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="65"> This holds true all the more so when the USA together with the Russians has definitely decided to further pursue manned space flights too.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="66"> Lunar Station Is Being Debated As Ever</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="67"> The Japanese are going all out in space today after years of a certain reservedness.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="68"> The (unmanned) Russian Mars mission is pending in 1994 and 1996.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="69"> Three US shuttles have also come of age up to the Challenger replacement, the Endeavour.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="70"> According to NASA's account, plans for a successor transport system cannot be financed at present.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="71"> According to the head of DARA, a lunar station--which was previously one of the visions of the German rocket pioneer and father of the Saturn-5 lunar rocket, Wernher von Braun--is for the time being not topical.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="72"> However, ESA is forming a strategy group of space specialists, bankers and industrialists that is to examine this aspect.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="73"> Mennicken also mentions visions of space experts at Deutsche Aerospace AG [German Stock Corporation].</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="74"> According to them, in cooperation with the Russians sometime in the future, helium-3, which occurs in practically unlimited quantities on the moon, could be "surface-mined," transported to the earth and be used here to produce energy in "clean," i.e., non-radiating, fusion reactors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="75"> A second vision boils down to the solution of the ozone hole problem.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="76"> The use of laser beams in order to form ozone is one of the possibilities to be investigated here.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="77"> Whether these visions can ever be realized cannot be answered at present.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="78"> But the head of DARA considers it important to inspire young people toward new ideas henceforth also.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="79"> At any rate part of the impetus of the last 30 years owes itself to this enthusiasm.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="80"> DM1.737 billion have been appropriated as the total sum for space for fiscal year 1993 (German contribution to ESA, funds for the national space program including the bilateral project, as well as funds for the German Research Institute for Aerospace (DLR)).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="81"> The head of DARA considers this amount "still considerable considering the problems in this country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="82"> Our job will be to focus on priorities the funds available".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="83"> Additional potential for the exploitation of space must always to be paid attention to.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="84"> We have to investigate, for example, "whether we should proceed via satellite technology in the further development of telecommunications".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21021" num="85"> There are particularly very good capabilities for astronautics in Germany with its industrial infrastructure and with DLR's research and testing centers, he says.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA121190-0089" num="36"> -- Major emphasis on basic scientific research, including missions to take environmental measurements, a longer-range mission to put astronauts on Mars and the development of a modified space station to serve as a life-science laboratory and a base for planetary travel.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA121190-0089" num="37"> -- Development of a heavy-lift launch vehicle that could take over much of the cargo delivery work now scheduled to be done by the space shuttle when work starts on the space station in 1995.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="17"> Preface</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="18"> Given their relatively short history, science and technology have been responsible for social and economic progress, and for advances in the standard of living for mankind.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="19"> However, while we have been enjoying this progress, these advances have imposed burdens on the Earth, particularly in the degradation of the environment and in the depletion of energy and resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="20"> Two decades ago, the Club of Rome proposed, in ``the Limit to Growth,'' that there should be an overall zero growth to avoid the mankind's crisis anticipated in the middle of the 21st century and to prevent continued environmental degradation of the Earth due to industrial activities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="21"> Although its predictions about the Earth may be valid, we have been enjoying an affluent life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="22"> We have thus come to realize, given the aspiration of people toward a more affluent life and the orientation of developing nation toward modernization, that zero economic growth is not practical.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="23"> At the present, the world population stands at about 5.5 billion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="24"> According to the United Nations' White Paper, this population will exceed 10 billion by the year 2050 and will continue even further.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="25"> Should human activities continue to expand, accompanying such population increase and economic growth, the support system provided by the Earth, such an supply of food, resources and restoration of nature, may be destroyed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="26"> It is thus important to control the increase of population, to reduce consumption, and to recycle resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="27"> However, I think that we are approaching to the point where we cannot overcome the foreseen crisis by such passive measures alone.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="28"> Since the Earth is finite, we must look beyond the Earth to the infinity of space, the ``New Frontier,'' with every effective means for developing space in order to overcome such obstacles and problems and achieve a sustainable development for mankind.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="29"> In the past, Columbus, in his endeavor to locate ``the Golden Country'' (Japan), discovered a new continent by coincidence.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="30"> Five hundred years later, we, with a firm perception of expanding a frontier for human activities, are at the dawn of ``the Second Age of the Great Voyage''.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="31"> The imminent challenge of the present space development in the ``Mission to Planet Earth,'' which is also the major topic of International Space Year (ISY) 1992.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="32"> I think that in the 21st century we will enter the era of ``Mission from Planet Earth''.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="33"> When we are going to expand our living sphere beyond the confines of the Earth and to pursue new discoveries, it is inevitable and natural for space to become our theater.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="34"> Ever since the launch of Sputnik, space development worldwide has undergone major advances: varieties of satellite use for communication, broadcasting, and Earth observation; man on the Moon; planet explorations; manned space activities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="35"> With those tremendous advances, dreams of mankind have been realized one after another.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="36"> Based on our accomplishment in space hitherto, the concept to expand the human frontiers into space might never be ``castle in the air''.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="37"> In order to explore a new frontier in space for mankind, the global scale cooperation is essential.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="38"> Under reconciliation between East and West, we will need to organize a new comprehensive mechanism in the 21st century in order to achieve our common targets of mankind.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="39"> We will also need to establish a more harmonious system of rule and law.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="40"> What is most essential, however, is to achieve the understanding of people, to raise national will, and to establish an international consensus.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="41"> Therefore, it is to say that the key is the resolution of mankind to what extent he is willing to make the crucial effort.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="42"> Hereafter, I will focus on what are technical challenges and to what extent they are feasible in order to expand the new frontier for human activities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="43"> I will not touch upon the topics of a new, comprehensive mechanism, or ideas for a system of rule and law.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="44"> Speaking about the future space activities in the 21st century, the content and substance differ depending on the time horizon.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="45"> I will define the year 2030, when the current space activities will be terminated, as the time horizon that I am speaking about.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="46"> Man in ``Near Space''</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="47"> If we expected the frontier of human activities in the middle of the 21st century, the theater will be limited, at most, to our solar system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="48"> Furthermore, I don't think that Mercury or Venus will become the frontier for mankind by the middle of the 21st century because their temperatures exceed 400C.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="49"> It would also be impossible to include the planets beyond Jupiter in this frontier because it takes more than a thousand days to reach from the Earth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="50"> Meanwhile, Mars is somewhat under the similar environment to that of the Earth--a gravity of 0.38G, surface temperature from -140C to 20C, a thin layer of atmosphere--and it only takes about 240 days to reach.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="51"> Therefore, Mars can be considered as one frontier for mankind in the middle of the 21st century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="52"> In the Middle of the 21st century, it is conceivable that the artificial celestial bodies near the Earth--Space Station, spaceport--the Moon and Mars would be the frontier, the area in which mankind would be conducting their activities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="53"> I will call the frontier, encompassing these bodies, ``Near Space''.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="54"> Technological Challenge and Response</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="55"> What technological challenge must be met for mankind to advance into ``Near Space''?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="56"> What responses are needed to overcome such technological challenges?</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="57"> 1.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="58"> Environment for life in space</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="59"> In ``Near Space,'' the gravity, radiation and thermal environments are remarkably different from those on the Earth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="60"> Men have stayed in space aboard Mir station for up to one year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="61"> We have learned that man can return to daily life with rehabilitation after staying in space for several days.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="62"> However, such experience does not enable us to fully understand the impact that long stays in space will have upon the human body.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="63"> We must, hereafter, demonstrate how long mankind can stay in space; assess long-term physical responses to low/micro gravity, establish the methods to maintain health in space.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="64"> The method may include providing artificial gravity, physical training and rehabilitation after returning to the Earth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="65"> If these challenges could be resolved through various experiments and tests on space stations, humans can stay about one year under microgravity on an artificial celestial body, and several years under low gravity on the Moon (0.17G) and Mars (0.38G).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="66"> Theoretically, it's possible to make 1G gravity by rotating an artificial celestial body.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="67"> However, this is economically infeasible because its structure and weight become too enormous.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="68"> As for the radiation environment, man can protect himself by the sufficient heavy blocking insulator of water, metals or other materials.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="69"> Thus, the challenge is to develop methods of blocking radiation at minimum cost.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="70"> The thermal environment on an artificial celestial body can be easily controlled by the current technology which has been applied to most artificial satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="71"> Control would also be feasible if residential areas were constructed underground on the Moon and Mars.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="72"> 2.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="73"> Oxygen, Water and Food</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="74"> Oxygen, water and food are indispensable commodities for man's survival.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="75"> There are two ways to provide these in ``Near Space'': transport from the ground or produce them in space.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="76"> It is simple to transport them from the Earth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="77"> However, transportation cost becomes too much to support many people living in space for long period, it will be imperative to obtain materials as much as possible in ``Near Space'' and to recycle what is used.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="78"> Oxygen can be reproduced from exhaled carbon dioxide (CO[.sup]2[/].</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="79"> On an artificial celestial body, oxygen could be obtained through the two processes: hydrogen reduction of CO[.sup]2[/] to H[.sub]2[/]0, and then electrolysis of H[.sup]2[/]0.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="80"> This technology of oxygen plants has already been established on the ground.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="81"> The future challenges are to improve efficiency through improving catalysts, to reduce size, and to develop easily maintained systems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="82"> In addition, oxygen could be produced from the oxidized metals which constitute 42% of the soil of the surface on the Moon and by using carbon dioxide (CO[.sup]2[/]) which constitutes 95% of the atmosphere on Mars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="83"> Research and development of producing oxygen with similar compound on the ground has been initiated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="84"> This technology will almost certainly be of practical use in the middle of the 21st century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="85"> Water can be reproduced by recycling waste hygiene water and urine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="86"> The technology to recycle water by means of film filter and distillation has been under development for Space Station ``Freedom''.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="87"> An advanced system could be utilized by the middle 21st century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="88"> Water can also be produced from lunar soil and from the atmosphere or permafrost of Mars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="89"> The production technology could be of practical use for supplying water in the middle of the 21st century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="90"> Food is basically supplied by a comprehensive organic recycling system which produces and decomposes organic matter.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="91"> A part of this recycling system, with plants only, has already been verified on the ground.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="92"> The challenge is to improve this system for use in space.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="93"> Advanced comprehensive organic recycling systems including animals are exceedingly difficult to control, so this system will not be realized by the middle of the 21st century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="94"> Thus astronauts could not enjoy beef, but might eat vegetables and artificial meats produced in ``Near Space''.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="95"> 3. Transportation</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="96"> For the transportation to the Moon or Mars, two-phase-method will be probably employed rather than the direct transporting method like Apollo program.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="97"> In this two-phase-method, two different types of space vehicles will be developed and used: one from ground to the spaceport in low Earth orbit, and from spaceport to the Moon or Mars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="98"> The advantage of this method is that varieties of space transportation systems can be flexibly assembled at the spaceport.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="99"> And thus it is not necessary to develop and launch a huge space transportation system from the Earth to low Earth orbit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="100"> The existing largest launch vehicle has payload capability of 100 ton into low Earth orbit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="101"> Development of larger scale launch vehicle for the first phase, whose payload capability is 200 to 300 ton, may be considered economical in the long run because we can reduce the amount of launch.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="102"> For the second phase of the transportation from Earth orbit to the Moon, Mars, mission-oriented systems will be assembled at the spaceport.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="103"> If the existing chemical propulsion is to be used, the propellant, in particular oxygen, will occupy most of the mass.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="104"> The net mass transported will amount to only one sixth of the total mass for the Moon, and only one tenth for Mars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="105"> It will, therefore, become necessary to produce propellant from resources on the Moon and Mars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="106"> Higher performance systems such as nuclear power must also be sought.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="107"> The technological challenges for the future transport system are summarized in four thrusts: --Developing a large, economical rocket with 200 to 300 ton capability to low Earth orbit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="108"> --Establishing the technology to assemble large structures in Earth orbit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="109"> --Producing propellant on the Moon and Mars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="110"> --Pursuing Nuclear propellant system with safety consideration.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="111"> By the middle of the 21st century, I suppose most of these tasks will have been definitely achieved.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="112"> Robotics</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="113"> When man advances into ``Near Space,'' robots will play important roles.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="114"> Since robots do not require the same safety and life support systems as much as man and they are economically advantageous, it is indeed natural to use robots as much as possible.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="115"> Therefore, the extent of activities a man can do will depend upon how robots can be developed and used for human activities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="116"> Robotics will probably have made remarkable progress by the middle of the 21st century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="117"> Robots will be able to receive verbal commands in the language we use in daily life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="118"> On receiving such commands, robots will be able to think of the procedure, to choose the tools and to implement the tasks.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="119"> When a man on the Earth orders a robot on Mars, ``The module has something wrong, please repair it,'' the robot will do it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="120"> The challenge in robotics is to develop advanced elements and components: electronics, precision machinery, information processing, control systems, and communication systems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="121"> Natural language comprehension, image recognition, understanding of the surrounding environment, selection of the solution and operations planning will also be the challenge for robotics.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="122"> These elements and key technologies for robotics are now tremendously progressing and will be likely to make the greatest progress in the 21st century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="123"> After realization of these technical challenges hitherto mentioned, mankind will be able to stay for limited periods in ``Near Space'' by the middle of the 21st century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="124"> Regarding man's permanent stay in ``Near Space,'' we need further efforts to study the long-term effects of gravity and radiation on the human body before we can determine whether mankind will be able to live in ``Near Space'' permanently.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="125"> Therefore, I see that the permanent stay in ``Near Space'' will still be the big challenge for mankind even in the middle of the 21st century.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="126"> Space Activities in the 21st Century</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="127"> Based on the precious observations, I would like to show you my concepts for space activities around the middle of the 21st century.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="128"> 1.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="129"> On Artificial Celestial Bodies</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="130"> Artificial celestial bodies, such as a spaceport, a space factory, solar power satellites, space experiment/observation laboratories, will be orbiting around the Earth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="131"> For regular maintenance of these bodies, service robots will be operating around them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="132"> A spaceport will be a transfer station for the Moon and Mars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="133"> Propellants, supplies and foods will be brought to the spaceport from Earth to the Moon.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="134"> There they will be loaded on a vehicle to be transported to the Moon, to Mars or to other artificial celestial bodies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="135"> The spacecraft is to dock at the spaceport and will be maintained and checked there.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="136"> In the space factory, materials and pharmaceuticals with the highest utility value will have to be produced based upon selection of various microgravity experiments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="137"> These factories will have to be maintained by as few people as possible, and so will be highly automated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="138"> Energy required for manufacturing and living is to be transmitted either by microwave from the solar power satellites or from the solar power plants constructed at each space factory.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="139"> Several experiments will be conducted in the space laboratory to investigate the long-term effects of low gravity upon animals and plants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="140"> Short-term living in ``Near Space'' will become easier, and eventually tourists will visit for space sight-seeing.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="141"> 2.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="142"> On the Moon</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="143"> On the Moon there will be habitation areas, lunarports, mining sites, factories, experiment laboratories, and observatories.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="144"> The lunarport, in addition to launching and landing facilities of vehicles, will have a mass driver using a catapult for cargo transport.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="145"> After the initial phase of resource exploration, industrial mining of resources will have started by this time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="146"> A few people will be regularly stationed at each mining site.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="147"> If nuclear fusion power plant is operated on the Earth, then mining of helium 3 on the lunar surface is probably on a large scale.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="148"> Some lunar factories, which will be installed after the verification of the pilot plant stage, will be operating.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="149"> A limited number of workers and a lot of robots will be working there.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="150"> Products made on the Moon will include oxygen and water, structural materials such as bricks, glass, cement, steels, aluminum, and other metals.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="151"> Comprehensive organic recycling systems plants will produce bread, vegetables and artificial meats.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="152"> It may be possible by this time to raise chickens and fish.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="153"> There is no atmosphere on the Moon to cause flickering which degrades observations from the Earth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="154"> The Moon is thus very suitable for installation of optical and electrical observatory stations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="155"> Tourists from the Earth may eventually have vacation on the Moon.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="156"> 3.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="157"> On Mars</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="158"> An outpost base will be established on Mars in the middle of the 21st century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="159"> As it takes 240 days to reach Mars, and the flight opportunity is once every two years, the whole itinerary of one person would take 3 to 5 years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="160"> Therefore the personnel at this outpost must include doctors, civil engineers, architects, experts on the heat environmental control and the life support system, and so forth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21244" num="161"> Over ten people comprising various experts and specialists as well as appropriate facilities will be required to support the outpost on Mars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="20"> They also are predicting a shift from single-shot launches to a systematic utilization of the entire space environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="21"> In order for space to be a place of industrial activity that complements the work being done on earth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="22"> What is needed first is a comprehensive system called a space infrastructure.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="23"> What this entails specifically is building, maintaining, and supporting permanent bases in space such as space stations, space platforms, and lunar bases.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="24"> A good example of that is the ISS (international space station) project being conducted jointly between the United States, Europe, Japan, and Canada, but it is the space shuttle (STS) that has given new meaning to the STS for the first time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="25"> The space shuttle, in addition to being reusable and being manned by astronauts, has two other notable features that make it different from conventional satellites in terms of orbital functions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="26"> The first of these has to do with the fact that the space shuttle has a rendezvous-docking function (RVD) that enables it to move freely in space and rendezvous with and link up with a given target.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="27"> The second difference is a space manipulator arm called the Canada arm.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="28"> These RVD and space robot technologies have made it possible for the first time to build, maintain, and support the ISS.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="29"> In this paper, we provide an overview of the RVD and space robot technologies and describe the technical problems encountered in each, and then outline where we at Mitsubishi Electric are at in terms of R\|[amp ]\|D being done in these areas.</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="32"> (1) Overview of Rendezvous-Docking Technology Rendezvous-docking (RVD) technology is a general term used to describe the overall technology for launching a spacecraft called a ``chaser'' from the earth or a holding orbit toward another orbiting satellite or spacecraft called a ``target,'' and having the chaser spacecraft rendezvous with and link up with that target spacecraft.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="33"> The process in which the chaser approaches the target is called the ``rendezvous,'' and the process of linking up is called ``docking''.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="34"> RVD technology also includes a series of processes in which after separating from the target the chaser either leaves the target and returns to earth or to a fixed orbital position, or is jettisoned, that is, allowed to enter the earth's atmosphere and burn up.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="35"> Hence, RVD technology could be called a type of complex technology or system technology that spans a wide range of activities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="36"> (2) Trends in Rendezvous-Docking Technology There are only two countries in the world today, the United States and Russia, that have made practical use of RVD technology.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="37"> However, since RVD is one of the basic technologies for future space activities, there is vigorous research being done by other countries as well including Japan, France, and Germany.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="38"> Since the late 1970s, Japan has been doing research on RVD technology at the National Aerospace Laboratory run by the Science and Technology Agency, the National Space Development Agency, and the Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science operated by the Ministry of Education.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="39"> In the fall of 1992, the National Space Development Agency installed a computer graphics driven simulator at the Tsukuba Space Center to do research and testing on RVD systems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="40"> The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Institute for Unmanned Space Experiment Free Flyer), the Ministry of Education (Institute of Space and Aeronautical Science), and the Science and Technology Agency (National Space Development Agency) are also jointly involved in developing a space experiment and observation free flyer called the Space Flyer Unit (SFU) which is targeted for launch a year and a half from now.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="41"> The Space Flyer Unit will be Japan's first reusable satellite.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="42"> After being launched by a Japanese H-II rocket, the satellite will be recovered by a U.S. space shuttle and sent back to Japan to be reused (cf.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="43"> Figure 1).[.sup](1)[/] The SFU will be equipped with a navigational guidance and control system that can control the spacecraft for up to 44 hours, and will be used to take it from an operational orbit to the space shuttle recovery point under its own power.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="44"> In that sense, the SFU is expected to be the first Japanese satellite to perform a rendezvous.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="45"> Another project being planned is the ETS-VII (8th engineering test satellite).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="46"> The National Space Development Agency is currently working on the preliminary design and schedule for launching the ETS-VII in 1997.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="47"> It will be the first time that Japan will perform a major RVD experiment in orbit which includes docking.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="48"> As far as future projects, we are looking into other uses for RVD technology in the HOPE space shuttle that will be launched by an H-II rocket, and will be used to supply the international space station (ISS).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="49"> In Figure 2 [figure not reproduced], we show a conceptual drawing of the HOPE rendezvous with the ISS.[.sup](1)[/] In conventional rendezvous-docking as performed by the United States, a pilot from a manned spacecraft performs the rendezvous and docking while maneuvering the spacecraft.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="50"> The former Soviet Union used to use a similar technology but later switched to an automated RVD system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="51"> The type of docking done by both the United States and former Soviet Union is called impact docking because of the fast relative speeds during docking (about 0.2-0.5 m/s).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="52"> Compared with that, Japan is considering an automated type RVD technology in an unmanned spacecraft (remotely controlled from the ground).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="53"> It will be a low-impact type (2-3 cm/s) so that docking speed will have little effect on the equipment carried aboard the spacecraft.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="54"> This new type of RVD technology has proven to be quite a challenge so far in the R\|[amp ]\|D being done by the United States and Europe, but Japan hopes that with the ETS-VII that it will become the first country in the world to test this new technology.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40520" num="76"> After a chaser spacecraft has rendezvoused and linked up with the target spacecraft it is to service using the rendezvous technology described in the foregoing sections of this report, the remote-controlled space robot is used to perform tasks such as replacing orbital replacement units (ORU), assembling structural elements such as trusses, assisting with other structural work, assisting with space experiments, and making repairs, all done by remote-control instructions received from the ground.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="27"> The investigation of such phenomena was, however, made on the Earth because there was no need to consider a different environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="28"> Today, however, the progress made in scientific technology points to the need for more essential research and the utilization of various phenomena.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="29"> An environment without gravity is certain to enable man to look for new materials that cannot be produced on the Earth and to investigate life and other basic phenomena, bringing much new knowledge.</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="36"> A Japanese astronaut boarded the space shuttle in September 1992 for the first time and a full-fledged space test was carried out jointly by Japan and the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="37"> This is the FMPT.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="38"> During the eight-day flight of space shuttle Endeavor, 22 themes of Japanese material tests, 12 themes of Japanese life science tests and nine themes of U.S. tests, or a total of 43 theme tests were conducted.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="39"> Japan was able to complete all tests on 34 themes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="40"> The FMPT suffered a ten year setback due to a delay in the U.S. space shuttle project and the 1986 Challenger explosion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="41"> However, this enabled Japan to make full preparations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="42"> Problems that occurred during the FMPT were solved by the efforts of related people and good luck, providing Japan with a precious experience.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="43"> The FMPT was a manned space experiment carried out by Japanese payload specialist Mamoru Mohri which gave Japan valuable data on manned space technology.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="44"> The TV screening of Dr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="45"> Mohri working aboard the shuttle gave many Japanese young people a keen interest in scientific technology and provided a chance to prevent them from avoiding scientific study courses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="53"> It is an international mission for institutes of Japan, the United States, Europe and Canada to carry out various kinds of space experiments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="54"> Japan joined in the IML-1 held in January 1992 and conducted two tests on crystal growth of organic superconducting metal and on the detection and analysis of high-energy space radiation using biological samples.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="55"> In the experiment into the crystallizing of organic superconducting metal, well-formed crystals able to endure structure analysis were obtained in a short period of time and the prospect of tests on the growth of crystals in space was improved.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="64"> The current conclusion seems to be that that which can be done without the need of human supervision should be done by machine and that which needs human supervision should be done manned.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="65"> After the second world war, there was remarkable progress in robot technology and this led to heated discussion on whether human supervision was necessary or whether robots should be used as far as possible.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="66"> The search for coordination between man and robots may last forever.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="67"> The good points of both man and robots must be fully utilized in space development.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="68"> For example, earth observation satellites and communications, which operate constantly and do not need to make timely changes in their functions, can remain unmanned.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="69"> In the field of space environment utilization, many space tests require timely handling by man.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="70"> A manned space test has the merit of on-the-spot observation and the timely handling of trouble, while an unmanned space test can be conducted in microgravity environment better and at a relatively lower cost.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="71"> The robots to be used must master professional human skills, but they are yet in the learning process.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="72"> Various kinds of data should perhaps be collected by manned activities for the time being, and technology for unmanned activities should be developed, using the accumulated data.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="73"> The FMPT proved that human activities in space can raise people's consciousness toward scientific technology.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="74"> The TV screening of astronaut Mohri's space activities revived people's interest in scientific technology.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="75"> The source of the evolution of living things born on the Earth has been the curiosity toward and the search of the unknown.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="77"> Among the trainees, Koichi Wakata completed his training at NASA and was recognized as a mission specialist (MS), and a qualified astronaut by NASA.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="78"> Wakata is expected to participate in high-level system operation training in readiness for the opportunity of space flight.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="79"> Astronaut Takao Doi was employed by NASDA together with Mohri and Mukai as staff for the FMPT and offered ground support of the FMPT tests in orbit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="98"> It is not something that can be done quickly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="99"> Therefore, it is necessary to dig out the latent needs of the researchers who wish to conduct space tests but are unable to do so.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="100"> While taking a practical approach, it is required to make systematic, well-planned promotion of ground researches, preliminary testing and space experiments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="101"> To meet this end, Japan is studying how to conduct space experiments on the basis of cooperative research structure that makes the utmost use of brains, technology and knowledge held by the industrial, academic and governmental circles pertaining to hopeful research themes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21237" num="102"> After the end of the Cold War, space development competition between the United States and the Soviet Union ended and various countries are presently studying plans to utilize the space environment in many fields.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-29781" num="15"> The remodeling will aim to cut costs and reinforce the H-2's launch capability to assist various related projects, such as construction of the Japanese space shuttle "Hope" and exploration of the moon and other planets.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-29781" num="16"> Armed with funds totalling approximately 11 billion yen in the draft budget for fiscal 1994, NASDA plans to first change the design of the engine and airframe.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-29781" num="17"> As the H-2 rocket is capable of launching a 2-ton-class satellite into geostationary orbit, projects have already been worked out to use it to launch meteorological satellites and other satellites capable of monitoring the global environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-29781" num="18"> NASDA has also started to develop a prototype of an unmanned space shuttle to be called Hope, which is scheduled to be launched by H-2.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-29781" num="19"> Without modification, however, the H-2 will be used in only a few, specialized areas and launch costs would be nearly double those of other countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-29781" num="20"> NASDA will, therefore, first try to cut manufacturing costs and modify the design to simplify the pipe arrangements and welding parts of the engine and airframe.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-29781" num="21"> It aims, reportedly, to cut launch costs by 30 percent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-29781" num="22"> There are three different methods of reinforcing the rocket's launch capability: Increasing to six the two sets of solid fuel rocket boosters (SRB) which add driving force; installing two sets of a new type of booster which is composed of two units of the LE-7 main engine; and installing two sets of boosters composed of four units of the modified LE-7 engine, which uses hydrocarbon as its fuel.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-29781" num="23"> The capability of the H-2 rocket, which is capable only of launching 10-ton-class satellites into a low-altitude orbit at present, will be increased so that it can launch satellites of 15 tons, 17 tons, and 27 tons respectively.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-29781" num="24"> The government's Space Activities Committee is now studying a long-term space development program.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-29781" num="25"> Projects connected with future space activities in the 21st century are under discussion now.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-29781" num="26"> Suggestions include, for example, carrying out various space experiments on the HOPE, and also retrieving surface soil from the Mars using exploration spacecraft.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="18"> Either it will be Alpha the first letter of the Greek alphabet -- to mark the first step in that direction, or it will be Sigma, a symbol of integration, or it will be something else.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="19"> God only knows what will happen and what the name will be.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="20"> What is much more important is that the project opens new prospects for the development of a world space program.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="21"> It was several years ago that Academician Boris Raushenbakh, one of the participants in the founding of the our space program, observed that the romantic period of its development, when every new step in near-Earth space was taken with enthusiasm and with not always well-founded hope, has ended.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="22"> The time has come when any and all of the multitude of space projects are assessed soberly and in a businesslike manner.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="23"> And recently, the current director of the Russian Space Agency, Yuriy Koptev, sighed heavily about that same period of "romantic dreams": "Do you know the most horrible sin that a space firm could have committed back then?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="24"> To not use up by the end of the year all the monies allocated to it".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="25"> Koptev's sighs are understandable to any Russian.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="26"> What is more surprising is that sighs no less heavy are emanating from across the ocean.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="27"> America's NASA, after calculating the prospects of the operation of long-duration orbital stations -- and that includes on the basis of our Mir -- clearly couldn't manage the development of its own Freedom station within the time and monetary constraints set by Congress.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="28"> Then the Alpha project appeared.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="29"> What does it consist of?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="30"> Briefly put, in the conditions that exist today, it is best to design and build a permanently inhabited international space station with an inclination of 51.6, i.e., with the same inclination at which Mir is now flying.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="31"> The same stock of completed research gathered in our country for the Mir-2 will be used for the station, as well as the American, European, and Japanese modules.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="32"> The first stage of this grandiose program calls for the joint work of crews from Russia and the United States on the Mir station and the Space Shuttle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="33"> Missions of the American shuttles to the Russian station will begin in 1995 and will be used for outfitting Mir with equipment that will include solar arrays that are more productive.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="34"> The Russian party will supplement the station with the Spektr and Priroda modules, which will house, in addition to our equipment, two and a half tons of American instruments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="35"> Some $370 million have already been allocated for that, and the financing will begin this coming year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="36"> Thus, in addition to expanding the research possibilities of the station, valuable experience will be garnered for creating and using the new international space facility.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="37"> The second stage, which begins in mid-1997, will involve the startup of the assembly of the station out of individual units, including the American living module and our towcraft, which will be put into orbit by the Shuttles and the Protons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="38"> And finally, in 1998, the complex will grow with a European and a Japanese module and three more Russian modules.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="39"> The station will function for 10-15 years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="40"> "And what will the average taxpayer get out of all that"? our journalists love to ask, following the Western example.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="41"> Let's discuss it the way they do in the West.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="42"> For a start, our space firms, which have absorbed the intellectual and technical flowering of Russia, will get guaranteed contracts, and that means that jobs and "brains" will be kept.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="43"> Just what the intellectual wealth is, is indicated directly by the example of the birth of the international space station project.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="44"> The Russian experience in the operation of long-duration orbital facilities in this case have made it possible, in the estimates of specialists, to shorten building the station by three to three and a half years and cut expenses considerably.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="45"> Consequently, even if they wanted to (and that desire exists among some of our rivals), they couldn't get along without Russia on the world space market.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="46"> Generally, we need to give proper due, it seems to me, to the skillful commercial policy of the Russian Space Agency.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="47"> Step by step, systematically, it is getting around the obstacles that --both officially by the COCOM ban and, so to speak, quietly -- are being placed in the path of getting our hardware to the market.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="48"> One after another, individual agreements are being arranged for the use of the Protons to launch a number of satellites and for the creation in Papua New Guinea of a launch facility for commercial launches.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="49"> And now the project for the international space station, more than anything else, is providing for the conclusion of such a political agreement with Russia (most likely during the forthcoming visit of U.S.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="50"> Vice President Gore), which will open the road to Russia to a full-fledged partnership.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="51"> That is especially needed now, when the space program is, more and more, turning to us not its "celestial" [illegible], but its "early" [illegible].</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="52"> It's no secret to anyone that the Earth is ill.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="53"> It's ill with civilization, as a child is with chickenpox.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="54"> The abscesses of the industrial megalopolises are spread across the body of the planet, poisoning it with industrial waste, polluting its water and air, reducing its forests and making its soil barren, thinning the ozone layer, and changing the gene pool.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="55"> All those attacks can be seen best from space.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="56"> And in space, the antidotes to them can be made.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="57"> Already planned is the production there of biomedical preparations, the growth of especially pure semiconductors, and the conversion of solar energy into electrical energy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42544" num="58"> Much can be found there by the researchers from the various countries gathering in orbit in the name of our common cradle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="15"> Foreword</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="16"> The first flight of the U.S. space shuttle in April, 1981, heralded the era of winged space transfer and return vehicles.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="17"> This successful flight spurred the research and development of winged transfer and return vehicles in various other countries and led to the launching of Buran by the former Soviet Union and the research and development of Hermes in Europe.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="18"> There are two conceivable types of space transfer and return vehicles--the winged type and the capsule type.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="19"> The winged type is more effective when operation flexibility is required in missions, such as conducting experiments with large-sized equipment or quickly and accurately retrieving flying objects that elude high gravity loads.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="20"> Japan started research on a winged transfer and return vehicle around 1986 and has compiled the concept of its own unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle launched by an expendable launch vehicle, commonly called HOPE: H-II Orbiting Plane.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="21"> HOPE will be unmanned, have wings and be launched with an H-II launch vehicle or an H-II derivative launch vehicle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="22"> It will repair and refuel artificial satellites in space, conduct various kinds of experiments and observations utilizing the space environment, and transport materials to and retrieve materials from the Space Station.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="23"> After carrying out various kinds of tasks, HOPE will reenter the atmosphere and land on the earth horizontally just as airplanes do.</s>
<H3>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="24"> Report of the Advisory Panel on Space Transfer and Return Systems in the Space Activities Commission</s>
</H3>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="25"> The Space Activities Commission approved on 20 July 1993, a report compiled by the Advisory Panel on Space Transfer and Return Systems (Chairman: Shigebumi Saito, Professor Emeritus at the University of Tokyo), calling for the research and development of such an unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="26"> The advisory panel was set up by the Commission in June last year to study and discuss Japan's future policy for the research and development of space transfer and return systems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="27"> The Panel comprises 25 experts not only in the field of aeronautics and space, but also in other disrelated fields, including economics and law.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="28"> The Panel has held five meetings beginning in November last year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="29"> The following are the recommendations of the advisory panel in their report:</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="30"> (1) Significance of Space Development</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="31"> The development of outer space within the range of the earth is man's exploration of future resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="32"> The scientific activities in space to uncover the truth herald a new era for civilization and will bring more richness.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="33"> It is necessary for Japan, as an economic superpower and a science and technology power, to play an active part in the tackling of space development to fully utilize outer space within the range of the earth and thus contributing to international society.</s>
<H3>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="34"> (2) Significance and Necessity of Space Transfer and Return System</s>
</H3>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="35"> The space transfer and return system is the base of space infrastructure, which is a basic system that is capable of handling a wide variety of missions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="36"> An infrastructure is necessary for efficient and flexible space development activities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="37"> The transfer and return system is necessary for the service on orbits such as the verification, repair, re-supply, replacement and retrieval of satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="38"> The system is also needed to conduct experiments and observation, utilizing the space environment, and to transport cargo to a space station.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="39"> The system is indispensable for Japan's stable implementation of space development activities in outer space within the range of the earth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="40"> The research and development of such a system will largely contribute to the maintenance and development of transport technology, which is the keystone of space activities, as well as to the promotion of science and technology.</s>
<H3>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="41"> (3) Basic Concept of Research and Development of the Japanese Space Transfer and Return System</s>
</H3>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="42"> It is important to promote the research and development of HOPE for practical purposes, this being an unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle launched by an expendable launch vehicle, in the early 21st century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="43"> The needs for the transfer and return of cargo in space are likely to increase in the early 2000s.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="44"> Today, no other country is capable of providing an unmanned transfer and return system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="45"> Japan could build its own unique status in the world's space activities by the development of the unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle HOPE.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="46"> Furthermore, the unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle technology could ensure Japan's steady development of space technology for the future as basic technology for a manned transfer and return vehicle, a fully re-usable transport system and a space plane.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="47"> (4) Concrete Policy of Research and Development</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="48"> As a basic policy, Japan should divide the plans into two phases: the first stage is for the flight experiment R\|[amp ]\|D plan; the second stage is for the development plan for practical use.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="49"> At the first stage, it should be accomplished to acquire the key technology for HOPE within this century through the flight of the space re-entry flight experiment vehicle commonly called HOPE-X: HOPE-Experiment, which would enable Japan to establish the technology in the phases of launching, re-entering and landing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="50"> At the second stage, it should be accomplished to develop HOPE by means of adding the necessary mission capabilities after the first stage.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="51"> The shift to the second stage should be strictly scrutinized by the Space Activities Commission, which should make policy judgment by fully checking technical achievement in the first stage.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="52"> The key roles in the research and development of the unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle should be played jointly by the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) and the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA).</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="53"> Outline of HOPE</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="54"> The winged transfer and return vehicle HOPE will be operated unmanned in whole processes, beginning with its launching, followed by entry into orbit, change of orbit, de-orbiting, returning and landing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="55"> NASDA plans to set the gross weight of HOPE, to be launched by an H-II derivative launch vehicle, at about 20 tons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="56"> NASDA says HOPE should be able to transfer three to five tons of cargo to and from the Space Station, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="57"> The dry weight of the HOPE vehicle, subtracting the weight of propellant and cargo from the gross weight, will be set at about ten tons and the vehicle structure weight, including heat protection materials, will be at about five tons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="58"> The length of HOPE will be about 15 meters, the width of its wings about ten meters and its fuselage will have a diameter of about three meters.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="59"> Tip fins with a height of about three meters will be installed at both ends of the main wings.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="60"> HOPE's total flight time, beginning with its launch followed by its stay in the orbit and ending with the landing, will be between four to seven days.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="61"> At the time of return, HOPE will de-orbit, using an orbit changing engine, reenter the atmosphere at an altitude of about 120 kilometers and go through the aerodynamic heating control and balanced gliding phases.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="62"> Adjusting its energy, the vehicle will finally reach the landing strip.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="63"> Two practical HOPE planes would be operated, and each would be launched once a year and would have a life of ten years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="64"> Needed to develop HOPE are the aerodynamic technology to determine a vehicle shape that is able to cope with all speeds from hyper-sonic to low speed and the heat structure technology to endure aerodynamic heating at the time of reentry into the atmosphere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="65"> Also needed are guidance control technology for the automatic navigation of HOPE in all flight processes and the technology of long-life propulsion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="66"> Finally, a system technology to balance and combine the above is needed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="67"> Therefore, as the first stage Japan is studying plans to develop critical technology and to conduct an orbital reentry experiment (OREX), automatic landing flight experiment (ALFLEX) and hyper-sonic flight experiment (HYFLEX), using small models to verify developed technology.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="68"> Following the three kinds of flight tests, a flight test using an actual sized experimental model (HOPE-X) is planned as the goal of the first stage.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="69"> Postscript</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="70"> The establishment of the space transfer and return system is, thus, indispensable for Japan's future space activities and its contribution to the international society in the space development field.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21239" num="71"> The Science and Technology Agency, on the basis of the report compiled by the Advisory Panel on Space Transfer and Return System, is to promote research and development, aiming at putting into practical use the unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle HOPE, launched by an expendable launch vehicle in the early 21st century.</s>
