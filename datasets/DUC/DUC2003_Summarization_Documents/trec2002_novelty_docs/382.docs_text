</F>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="17"> Ogihara, Toshiyuki Sugiyama, Nikkei Materials and Technology] [Text] Concept cars and elemental technologies exhibited at the 30th Tokyo Motor Show, which was meant to give some idea of automobiles of the near future, proved that the preparation of material technology required for auto manufacturing had been making steady progress.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="18"> As a result, it was clearer than ever that automobile materials would be the key technology for simultaneously solving the problems of weight reduction, fuel conservation and recycling for automobiles.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="19"> Effective solutions for the urgent issues of weight reduction and fuel conservation were shown, while steady progress was demonstrated for elemental technologies that seek long-term solutions for the recycling of auto materials, including resins for bumpers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="20"> This report concerning the Motor Show consists of two parts: material technology highlights concerning concept cars and elemental technologies shown at the Show are reported in the first part, whereas material utilization trends for future auto manufacturing are compiled in the second part on the basis of interviews with engineers in charge of the material technology departments of auto manufacturers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="21"> It appears inevitable that the 1993 production for Japanese automobile manufacturers will have negative growth for the third consecutive year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="22"> According to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, Inc., the 1992 automobile (four-wheel vehicle) production in Japan was 12.5 million, which was 5.6 percent below the 1991 production, resulting in negative growth for the second consecutive year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="23"> In 1993, the probable annual production figure is not expected to reach the 12 million level, and each automaker is struggling to make the production schedule adjustment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="24"> Under these severe sales and production conditions, the 30th Tokyo Motor Show was held for 14 days, from 23 October through 5 November 1993, at the Japan Convention Center (Makuhari Messe) in Chiba City, and auto component makers hoped that the Show would spur their sales.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="25"> Automakers, on the other hand, were concentrating on the exhibit of "actual cars" currently on the market, in an attempt to ring up more sales.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="26"> Although the focus was on the exhibit of the real cars, the Show presented many other interesting items that hinted at what kind of automobiles we could expect in the near future in terms of concept cars and technology.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="27"> These items uniquely reflected the current times when R\|[amp ]\|D outlays must be spent effectively, and many of them were still searching for the opportunity to commercialize.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="28"> Compared with the 29th Tokyo Motor Show of 1991[.sup]1[/] in which several possibilities for near-future technologies had been presented, the 1993 Show had many exhibits that clearly revealed what automaker R\|[amp ]\|D or Design departments thought to be their first choice for commercialization.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="29"> Thus, it was easy for a viewer to clearly understand the philosophy and strategy of each auto-manufacturing company.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="30"> For example, both RAUM of Toyota Motor Corp. and AQ-X of Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., were the so-called concept cars with the catch phrase of "Compact sedans of tomorrow with roomy interior space".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="31"> Nissan explained that AQ-X was created with the same overall length as that of the compact car Primera, the same interior space as that of the luxury-class car President, and the same fuel consumption rate as that of the popular model, Sunny.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="32"> Both Toyota's and Nissan's concept cars demonstrated how a city-driven, near-future sedan should be made.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="33"> In the first part of this report, the future material technologies that were incorporated in concept cars and the elemental technologies at the exhibit will be discussed under the three categories of "Auto Bodies," "Engines," and "Electric Cars".</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="36"> Components in Functional Units Mazda Motor Corp. exhibited the HR-X2, with a rotary engine using hydrogen gas as fuel.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="37"> The unique features of this concept car included a hydrogen-gas-burning, rotary engine system and a design incorporating both easy-disassembly vehicular construction and outer and inner panels made of a recyclable, "liquid crystal polymer fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) material".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="38"> Koji Tobita, section chief researcher of the Mazda Technical Research Institute, who oversaw the development of this concept car, says this: "We developed the HR-X2's body with the idea of making the entire car recyclable".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="39"> The chassis incorporates modular design, and each functional module is unitized.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="40"> The basic vehicular structure for the HR-X2 has the chassis, the power train (including the engine and the drive mechanism), and the fuel tank arranged together in the so-called under-chassis section, which can be readily separated from the resin-made "upper body," which is located above the under-chassis section.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="41"> Like the other units, the front functional unit is uniquely designed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="42"> The front functional unit consists of head lamps and wipers that are situated below the front cowl for easy removal of a wire harness in disassembly through minimization of electrical wiring, plus an instrument panel guard that incorporates the steering wheel, a shift lever, and an air-conditioner.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="43"> The rear functional unit is designed in a similar fashion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="44"> The unit incorporates a high-mount stoplight, speakers for an audio system, and an air cleaner.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="45"> In the center console unit, audio equipment and the air-conditioner are controlled by an optically transmitted remote system, and light is reflected on interior mirrors to eliminate interior lights altogether, in order to circumvent the complicated job of removing a wire harness for disassembly.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="46"> Adoption of Recyclable Liquid Crystal Polymer FRP</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="47"> Among the unique features of the recyclable, easy-to-disassemble auto body construction, perhaps the adoption of a liquid-crystal polymer FRP attracted the most attention from material engineers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="48"> The FRP is used for the outer panels, as well as inner panels, of the front hood, both front and rear fenders, the trunk lid, the cab, the doors, and the center console.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="49"> As a result, according to Mr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="50"> Tobita, Mazda expects to be able to recycle "almost 100 percent of the upper body section".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="51"> At the show, however, Mazda exhibited ordinary glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) outer and inner panels instead.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="52"> There was only one example of the liquid crystal polymer FRP exhibited among other components, in the form of a test-produced unit combining the rear fender with rear pillars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="53"> In 1992, Mazda announced that it had essentially completed the development of this particular liquid crystal FRP, in which a thermoplastic resin is reinforced with microfine liquid crystal polymer fibers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="54"> The idea was to reconstitute the reinforcement mechanism of the liquid crystal polymer microfine fibers by remelting a recycled raw material in a pulverized state in the process of injection or compression molding.[.sup]2[/] This time, a "nylon-based material (PA, or polyamide) was used as the thermoplastic resin to make the liquid crystal polymer FRP".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="55"> Mazda designed the body of the HR-X2 with a lightweight, highly rigid structure using a cross-sectional element of glue-bonded outer and inner liquid crystal polymer FRP panels.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="56"> This body construction for the HR-X2 was the only change made by Mazda from that of the AZ-1.[.sup]3[/] Another feature of the HR-X2 that drew the attention of the visitors at the Show was its excellent air resistance coefficient, C[.sub]d[/] = 0.3 -- an index of the body's aerodynamic resistance -- despite its bulky, box-like shape.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="57"> Mazda's explanation was this: "Air resistance was minimized by dividing the air flow that hits the body into the upper and lower components by means of troughs attached to the sides of the body".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="58"> The trend of reducing a car's fuel cost through the reduction of air resistance is also evident in concept compact cars of other auto companies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="59"> For example, Nissan's AQ-X also boasts C[.sub]d[/] = 0.28, and it is equipped with aerodynamic parts, including front and rear aero-bumpers, and a CAE-designed (computer-applied-engineering) underside of the floor to optimize air flow across the underside.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="60"> Nissan Solves Contact Corrosion Problem of Aluminum/Steel</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="61"> With Aluminum/Steel Cladding The unique feature of Nissan's AQ-X is the adoption of an "iron-aluminum hybrid body structure" by using an aluminum alloy for certain structural components and for the outer and inner panels for its doors, front hood, front fenders, and trunk lid.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="62"> Instead of the aluminum alloy that is not suitable for deep-drawing molding, steel sheets are used for the outer and inner panels of the rear fender which has a severely curved surface.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="63"> As a result of adopting the iron-aluminum hybrid body structure, the weight of the AQ-X is approximately 20 percent less than that of previous bodies made of steel outer panels.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="64"> This drastic weight reduction seems to indicate that the adoption of the hybrid structure is expected to meet future auto specifications, since, according to one official, no matter how much a body structure is rationalized, "the weight of the existing steel body will be reduced only by several percent at best".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="65"> Generally, whenever sheet-steel and aluminum-alloy parts are used together, the joints are attacked by corrosion that results from the contact of dissimilar metals.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="66"> The corrosion is commonly called "galvanic corrosion," and such joints have to be avoided altogether in auto body construction.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="67"> Therefore, auto body parts in which aluminum alloys can be used are limited to such parts as front hoods, trunk lids, and hinged parts that function as a lid, such as quickly detachable sun roofs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="68"> Otherwise, like the NSX sports car of Honda Motor Co., Ltd., all the body has to be made with an aluminum alloy, with only the smallest area of contact with steel.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="69"> Nissan solved the problem of contact corrosion between steel and aluminum alloy for the AQ-X by inserting steel/aluminum alloy cladding pieces in the joints.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="70"> The steel/aluminum alloy cladding pieces are inserted between an aluminum alloy outer panel and a steel inner panel when they are to be spot-welded to form a monocoque body.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="71"> The aluminum alloy layer of the cladding piece is in direct contact with the aluminum outer panel, and the steel layer of the cladding piece is in direct contact with the steel inner panel, before the entire assembly is spot-welded.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="72"> As a result, aluminum is welded to aluminum, and steel is welded to steel.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="73"> As a whole, the aluminum outer panel and the steel inner panel are bonded to each other.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="74"> Nissan is using the same cold-rolled steel panel SPCD-SPCE as that currently in use and the aluminum-magnesium-based alloy No. 5000, commonly called "30-30" (i.e.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="75"> , tensile strength of 300 MPa or 30 kgf/mm[.sup]2[/] and elongation of 30 percent), for the inner and outer panels, respectively.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="76"> Only one spot-welding voltage is required for spot-welding steel to steel, as well as aluminum to aluminum.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="77"> Yoshitaka Kurihara, chief researcher at the Vehicular Research Laboratory of Nissan's General Research Institute, says this: "We chose the ratio of the aluminum alloy to the steel in the cladding material in such a way that one voltage can do both welding jobs simultaneously".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="78"> Cladding materials have two atomic layers of dissimilar metals arranged tightly next to each other, so no air can infiltrate between the two layers; thus, neither oxidation nor reduction takes place.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="79"> As a result, no potential difference is generated between the steel and aluminum-alloy layers, and that prevents any corrosion process from taking place between the two dissimilar metals.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="80"> Nissan improved the body rigidity of the AQ-X through both design and material, and, according to Kurihara, "both bending and twisting rigidity are 20 percent higher than those of previous cars of the same class".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="81"> Nissan successfully prevented any loss of rigidity despite the incorporation of aluminum.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="82"> The gauge of the aluminum-alloy sheet, like that of previous aluminum-alloy parts, was made 1.4 times that of the sheet steel to maintain the same tensile rigidity as that of a sheet-steel body.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="83"> The separation of steel from aluminum in an auto body, the critical process in the recycling of cars to be disposed of, was made technically possible by Nissan for the AQ-X.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="84"> By heating to approximately 500ÎC, "a brittle intermetallic compound is formed at the interface of the steel and aluminum-alloy layers of the cladding material, which makes it easy to separate the two layers with light impact".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="85"> Nissan believes that the iron-aluminum hybrid body structure is a weight reduction technology with a high probability of implementation, because the advantage of weight reduction can be balanced against the added cost through the optimization of the ratio of cheap sheet-steel to lightweight aluminum alloy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="86"> According to Kurihara, as far as the cost problem is concerned, although it is difficult to make a thorough assessment at this time, "it appears that a certain cost increase is unavoidable".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="87"> Not only does the aluminum alloy cost approximately three times as much as the steel (the ratio of the materials' unit prices x the ratio of the densities), but the production cost is also high for the aluminum alloy, because the spot-welding electrode's life is shorter for the alloy than for steel.</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="89"> Germany's Audi Motor Corp. exhibited an Audi Space Frame (ASF) car with a space-frame structure assembled with aluminum-alloy outer and inner panels.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="90"> Audi plans to use this ASF model for the mass-test-production of the A8, which is to replace the currently sold luxury V8.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="91"> The A8 is scheduled to be introduced to the German market in May 1994.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="92"> Although the price of the A8 has not been announced, it has been rumored that the price will exceed the price of the V8 of \|[yen ]\|11.4 million.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="93"> It is speculated that the car could afford an all-aluminum-alloy body because of its high-priced status and the moderate production rate of approximately 2,400 vehicles per month.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="94"> Most of today's passenger cars have a monocoque body that functions as the structural material for outer and inner panels.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="95"> In contrast, the frame alone of the space-frame structure functions as the structural component for the body, and outer panels are primarily used as the exterior partition.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="96"> Therefore, the space-frame structure has the advantage of being able to maintain rigidity despite the adoption of materials less rigid than steel, such as aluminum alloys and resin, for the outer and inner panels.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="97"> Another important advantage of the space-frame structure is that it enables the use of comparatively cheaper extruded materials for the frame structural component.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="98"> Extruded materials can be made with heavier gauges for use in spots that require high rigidity, or they can be made with thinner gauges for use in spots that require low rigidity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="99"> Furthermore, even if sections with insufficient rigidity happen to be constructed in a space-frame structure made of extruded frames, the weakness can easily be compensated for with stiffening ribs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="100"> For the space-frame structure of the ASF car exhibited at the show, the lowest-cost extruded material was used in the largest quantity, the next-lowest-cost die-cast material was used in the next-to-largest quantity, and the highest-cost rolled material was used in the smallest quantity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="101"> However, based on the concept disclosed in 1991 in which extruded frame materials were to be connected with a die-cast bonding material for the ASF concept model, many observers at the show seemed to get the impression that the use rate of the extruded material was less than previously announced.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="102"> Audi used an aluminum-manganese-silicon-based alloy for the extruded material, and an aluminum-silicon-manganese-based alloy for the vacuum die-cast material.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="103"> What attracted the audience's attention is the use of a press-molded rolled sheet material in a complex shape for the part called the "C pillar" of the roof section of the ASF car body.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="104"> The chassis of the ASF car was formed by riveting the roof and panels, such as doors and fenders, that were made by press-molding of aluminum alloy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="105"> The panels were riveted, instead of spot-welded to produce bond strength that is higher by approximately 30 percent and to eliminate the anti-production environment element of sparking, which would be caused by welding.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="106"> Approximately 70 percent of the bonding was done with riveting; the rest was completed by a combination of spot-welding and clinching.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="107"> The aluminum-alloy materials for the ASF car were supplied by an ALCOA Corp.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="185"> The drastic weight reduction of 50 percent for the cylinder block was achieved through the replacement of the existing cast iron FC with the aluminum alloy ADC 12.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="186"> The block was molded with a high-pressure die-cast machine installed at Iwaki Plant, Nissan's designated state-of-the-art engine plant.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="255"> For example, because of its high operating temperature of above 300ÎC, the battery needs to be heated for charging and needs to be protected from cooling while the car is being driven.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="256"> To solve this temperature problem, it will be necessary to develop a heat-insulating vessel and a heating mechanism that does not interfere with the high energy density, i.e., the low weight, of the sodium-sulfur battery.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="257"> According to the Design Department of Suzuki, "sodium-sulfur battery development has just begun.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="258"> From the standpoint of resources, we expect more from this battery than from the nickel-based battery, and it will eventually replace the lead battery".</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="259"> Long-Life Nickel-Hydrogen Battery; ZEV-Favorite Lead Battery</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="260"> The "nickel-based battery" is the general name for a group of batteries that use nickel for the cathode.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="261"> There are four types of nickel-based battery, depending on the composition of the anode: cadmium, iron, zinc, and hydrogen-occluded alloys (including LaNi[.sub]5[/]).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="262"> Of those, automakers appear to be staying away from Niccad batteries, which used cadmium for the anode, because of the metal's toxicity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="263"> Of the remaining three, the nickel-hydrogen-occluded alloy (nickel-hydrogen) battery is currently in the position closest to commercialization, because of its excellent balance between energy density, output density, and long life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="264"> For example, Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd. mounted a nickel-hydrogen battery in its hybrid car EV Sedan, which has a maximum speed of 120 km/h and a cruising distance of 450 km.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="265"> Although details of components of the battery, including the hydrogen-occluded alloy, have not been disclosed, its performance reportedly includes an energy density of 65 Wh/kg, which is 1.5-2 times that of the lead battery, and an output density of 170 W/kg, which is 1.5 times that of the lead battery.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="266"> Most remarkable is the battery's life, which is said to be "as durable as the car itself, even with daily repetition of charging and discharging".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="267"> Honda also exhibited a nickel-hydrogen battery, which had been developed jointly with Matsushita Battery Co., Ltd.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="268"> (Moriguchi City, Osaka Prefecture), and Ovonic Battery Corp., a U.S. battery maker.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="269"> This battery's energy density and output density are approximately 60 Wh/kg and 170 W/kg, respectively, which are about the same as those for Daihatsu's battery.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="270"> According to Honda's Tochigi Research Institute, however, "the battery's life is currently good for only 500 cycles of charging and discharging, which we intend to extend to the car's life".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="271"> Tochigi Research Institute also says this: "It should take several more years before this battery can be mass-produced".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="272"> Honda needs to ensure that the excellent performance of a single cell will not deteriorate when cells are combined to form a module.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="273"> Furthermore, before the nickel-hydrogen battery can be commercialized, "the recovery and re-use technologies for hydrogen-occluded alloys must be established," according to Tokyo Development Laboratory, Yuasa, and something must be done to bring the cost down from what is now approximately 15 times that of the lead battery.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="274"> Still, many problems need to be solved for both sodium-sulfur and nickel-hydrogen batteries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="275"> Automakers, particularly Nissan and Honda, seem to have the opinion that "lead batteries are suitable for ZEVs from the standpoint of reliability, safety, ease of handling and cost, and nickel-based batteries need to be developed primarily for the post-ZEV future".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="276"> Both the EVX -- which Honda is thinking of commercializing in the future -- and the (Abeniiru) EV -- for which Nissan is planning limited sales -- carry a lead battery.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="277"> A spokesperson from the Third Development Center in Toyota says that "for the time being, our main effort will be focused on performance improvement for lead batteries, such as low-temperature performance and life" for electric vehicles.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="278"> Low-pollution vehicles, including electric and hybrid cars, that use a battery as the source of energy generally cost two to five times more than existing cars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="279"> According to Nissan's Technical Vehicle Development Laboratory, in order to reduce the cost of an electric car, "it is critical to lower the cost of its exclusive components in addition to the batteries".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="280"> At the same time, it may also be necessary to further develop the heretofore nurtured weight reduction technology, so that the battery's weight can be easily dealt with in the context of the reduced weight of the vehicle.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="281"> Hybrid Electric Car Charges Battery While in Motion</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="282"> Mitsubishi showed off its hybrid electric car, the ESR, for its low fuel consumption and low pollution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="283"> This electric car carries a compact generator operated by a gasoline engine for the purpose of charging the battery.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="284"> When the battery is sufficiently charged, the car is driven by currents from the battery.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="285"> However, when the capacity of the battery becomes low, the generator is actuated to charge the battery without the car stopping.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="286"> This is called the series hybrid method, for "hybrid-operating" the car while its battery is being charged.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="287"> The engine for driving the generator is driven at a constant revolution that is extremely efficient and generates the least emission per output.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="288"> The idea behind the development of the ESR was that, "by installing the generator as the power source, less transmission loss can be encountered than with power transmitted from a thermal power plant.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="289"> Therefore, from the overall standpoint, less fossil fuel is consumed and less carbon dioxide is generated".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="290"> Based on that idea, minimization of energy loss was stressed throughout the development of the ESR, including the design of its body and electric components.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="291"> For example, in order to increase the efficiencies of the motor and the generator, silicon steel plates that were 0.25-0.3mm thick and had only recently been placed on the market were used for their core sections.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="292"> Those plates can reduce eddy current loss, because they are 0.5mm thinner than the existing plates.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44893" num="293"> It is claimed that "the motor's efficiency improved by 2 percent merely by reducing the plate thickness from 0.5mm to 0.25mm".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="16"> BFN [Text] Daimler-Benz is looking for an alternative form of energy for the automobile.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="17"> At its research center in Ulm, the company yesterday presented a vehicle with an electric motor which gets its energy from a fuel cell.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="18"> Speaking at the company's research center in Ulm, the Chairman, Edzard Reuter, stated that Daimler-Benz AG was well in front of the international field with the car driven by a fuel cell instead of a petrol or diesel engine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="19"> The prototype vehicle has already done 2,000 km without any problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="20"> The task now is to reduce the size and weight of the fuel cell by using new materials and technology, and to develop the system at a marketable price.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="21"> Research Chief, Prof.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="22"> Hartmut Weule, is confident that this can be done within a period of 20 to 30 years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="23"> In addition, Daimler-Benz is continuing the development of electric vehicles with the Zebra battery, a high-performance battery with sodium and nickel chloride.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="24"> This is one of several possible solutions developed by the Daimler subsidiary AEG.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="25"> Daimler-Benz runs the fuel cell with methanol from which the hydrogen is obtained in the vehicle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="26"> Methanol is produced from natural gas and is a widely available chemical substance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="27"> A vehicle could fill up in the normal way from a pump at service stations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="28"> The vehicle's range with one tankful matches that of today's vehicles.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="29"> The advantage of the fuel cell is the greater efficiency of 30 percent compared with 17 to 20 percent of conventional car engines.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="30"> Hydrogen is generated in the automobile by means of an ion-permeable-polymer electrolyte membrane.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="31"> The car travels with virtually no harmful exhaust gases, since no nitrogen oxide is produced during cold combustion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="32"> The only exhaust gas is water vapor.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="33"> Consequently, the car already complies with the Californian zero emission requirement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="34"> Moreover, only half the amount of carbon monoxide is produced.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="35"> This alternative form of power is a joint achievement of Dasa and AEG, who developed the project jointly with Daimler's automotive engineering division.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="36"> Daimler is cooperating with the Canadian company Ballard Power Systems on the development of fuel cells.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="37"> According to Reuter, "We have gained an important lead with synergistic effects within the company and in international cooperation".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="38"> Daimler has invested hundreds of millions so far.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="39"> The technology costs 15,000 German marks per kilowatt of output.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="40"> Weule thinks there will be numerous potential applications for the fuel cell in the future.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="41"> It could power railways and ships, provide satellites with electricity, or provide hospitals with an emergency power supply.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="42"> At present, there are five competing technologies: -- Proton-conducting fuel cells operate at [a temperature ranging] between 20Î and 100ÎC, and require hydrogen, which Daimler obtains from methanol; -- Alkaline fuel cells have the greatest efficiency but require pure hydrogen and oxygen; -- Phosphoric acid fuel cells operate with phosphoric acid at 200ÎC and are suitable as decentralized combined heat and power plants; -- Fused carbonate fuel cells requiring temperatures of 650ÎC, are also suitable for coal gas and are likely to come on the market in a few years' time; -- Solid oxide fuel cells are particularly efficient at 1,000ÎC but the high temperatures cause problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="43"> Daimler-Benz is going for the proton-conducting system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="44"> The present unit still weighs 800 kg and fills the cargo space of a delivery van.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="45"> There will be a second version by 1996 which, at one eighth of the size and weighing only 200 kg, will also fit into a passenger car.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="46"> How Fuel Cells Work</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="47"> Fuel cells convert combustible liquids or gases directly to electricity by electrochemical means with a relatively high efficiency of up to 60 percent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="48"> The reaction takes place via hydrogen and oxygen to water.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="49"> The fuel cell is made of an anode and cathode which are separated by an electron-impermeable electrolyte or a membrane.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="50"> Pure hydrogen or a hydrogen-containing gas is passed to the anode where the hydrogen molecules are split into ions, and electrons are liberated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="51"> These flow via an external conductor to the cathode.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="52"> At the same time, oxygen from the air is supplied to the cathode.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="53"> The oxygen takes up electrons and the oxygen ions combine with the hydrogen ions to form water.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="54"> The hydrogen in the technology presented in Ulm is separated from methyl alcohol.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="55"> The fuel cells operate silently and without vibrations, and do not develop any environmental pollutants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="56"> Various types of fuel cells are being developed all over the world, and some are now undergoing practical tests.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="57"> Buses powered by phosphoric acid fuel cells are already operational in Vancouver (Canada).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="58"> Fuel cells do not only provide power for electric cars, however: If designed on a larger scale, they provide an alternative to conventional power stations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44701" num="59"> Due to their compact, modular design, their output ranges from 50 kW to several megawatts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="17"> [Text] Rome (ANSA) 7 Feb 94 -- It is absolutely the least polluting automobile engine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="18"> The exhaust emissions have been reduced by 90 percent with respect to the normal gasoline engine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="19"> We should already be able to see it in operation on delivery vans and buses in two or three years' time, and perhaps also on cars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="20"> Hydrogen is the fuel "of the next century," and the hydrogen engine continues to be one of the technological challenges being dealt with by researchers and experts from organizations and universities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="21"> In Italy, ENEA [National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and the Environment] has built a prototype of this "green" engine that is fitted with an "original" valve to mix the hydrogen with air.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="22"> It has been installed on a Fiat "Ducato" van that has been "entrusted" to the University of Pisa for fine tuning.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="23"> The system has already provided its first positive results: no carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon, or carbon dioxide emissions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="24"> The only pollutants produced are nitrous oxides and these are produced in smaller quantities than by a gasoline engine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="25"> "It is a simple internal combustion engine," explains Raffaele Vellone of the ENEA, "in which the mixing of hydrogen and air must be perfected so that the combinations that give rise to nitrous oxide emissions are limited".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="26"> According to Vellone this objective could be attained in the future.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="27"> "Within three years," he added, "in addition to this engine, we will build a prototype `hybrid' vehicle, fueled by hydrogen with `fuel cells' that will give even better results because it will have an electric engine".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="28"> Both systems could produce emissions only slightly in excess of the limits set by American regulations specifying that from 1996 buses should not emit more than 0.25 grams of nitrous oxides per kilometer.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="29"> In particular the hybrid system with fuel cells could further lower this limit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="30"> According to Vellone, this coupling of hydrogen and the electric car could result in zero emissions if the fuel were produced by renewable energy sources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="31"> In fact hydrogen can be produced not only from methane but also from methyl alcohol, and biomasses, and by electrolysis starting from clean sources of energy: Hydroelectricity, solar energy, and energy derived from the wind.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="32"> However, at the current state of the technologies, these systems are still too expensive.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="33"> The cost of producing a liter of hydrogen can vary from 600 to 1,800 lire, compared with the 400-500 lire of methane and the 1,000 lire of gasoline.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="34"> It is therefore preferable to produce hydrogen from methane or fossil energy sources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="35"> These systems cost less but are more polluting.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="36"> The cost, however, is not the only "flaw" of the hydrogen engine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="37"> In fact the limited, though not extremely low, range of the vehicles (150 kilometers for a fully-loaded Fiat Ducato) is also "worrying" the ENEA technicians.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="38"> Furthermore this fuel has a very low density (71 grams per liter compared with the 780 of gasoline) and therefore the tanks take up a lot of space.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="39"> "The first concrete applications of fuel cell vehicles," said Vellone "are planned for about the year 2000 and they will be applied to larger vehicles like delivery vans and buses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="40"> If the systems are miniaturized then they will also be installed on automobiles".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="41"> Another problem is the lack of hydrogen pipelines for the distribution of the fuel.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="42"> "The volatile nature of this fuel," added Vellone, "makes transportation feasible only if the piping is perfectly sealed".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="43"> This problem also concerns other countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="44"> A 200-kilometer experimental version has been built in Germany.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="45"> Still abroad, in the United States, the gas-hydrogen mixture (the so-called "hythane") has been tested and has given positive results in terms of emissions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="46"> Although it is not "green" like pure hydrogen, this mixture does not create refueling problems because of the high percentage of methane.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="47"> The recent results of studies conducted by the University of Pisa also confirm that, at present, this is possibly the best solution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="48"> However, it can be seen that the hydrogen engine will be most useful for urban transport.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="49"> Therefore, ENEA advises that the best solution would be a "dual fuel" internal combustion engine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44635" num="50"> In fact the gasoline would be reserved for long journeys, while the hydrogen would be used solely in the city.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="8"> So why have fuel cells - which produce electricity without serious pollution of the atmosphere - remained mostly in the laboratory and failed to make any impact on the commercial market?</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="9"> The answer lies not so much in the technology itself as in the cost of the process and the cumbersome nature of the equipment needed.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="10"> Yet this week, in its austere white research headquarters near Ulm in south Germany, Daimler-Benz demonstrated that it was well on the way to solving these problems.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="11"> Germany's largest industrial concern showed off a white van packed full of pipes, valves and cables and with a big yellow cylinder for the hydrogen used to produce energy by reacting with oxygen from the air.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="12"> Daimler-Benz's chairman, Edzard Reuter, keen to show that the industrial group's expensive diversification into electronics, aerospace and other non-motor sectors was producing results, spoke enthusiastically of a 'milestone on the road to ecological mobility'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="13"> Hartmut Weule, research and technology director, said: 'We are at the very beginning of a new phase of technology, comparable with the days when Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz were constructing their first vehicles powered by internal combustion engines'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="14"> But Weule was careful not to get carried away by this grand historical analogy.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="15"> Much work remained to be done before fuel cell vehicles could be brought to the series production stage, he said.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="16"> Daimler was also working to perfect further the internal combustion and diesel engines on which the fortunes of its Mercedes-Benz car and truck subsidiary still depend.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="17"> Weule left no doubt, however, of Daimler's determination to succeed in the technology of fuel cells, in which the group says it is ahead of automotive rivals such as General Motors of the US and Mazda of Japan.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="18"> 'We do not intend to wait until our Japanese or American competitors gain the upper hand in technology,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="19"> Already, the group - including AEG (electronics and energy generation), Dornier (aerospace and materials) and Deutsche Aerospace - has spent more than DM100m (Pounds 40m) on research into fuel cell technology.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="20"> The electric transporter van, shown off for the first time in Ulm on Wednesday, certainly does not look revolutionary.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="21"> Inside, though, it contains the elements of a technological advance which enables Daimler to claim that it is the first motor company in Europe, and probably the world, to develop a fully working vehicle powered by fuel cells.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="22"> Called Necar (new electric car), it has a more efficient propulsion system than any other type used in the industry while producing no harmful exhaust gases and far less carbon dioxide than emitted by conventional engines.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="23"> The energy conversion efficiency achieved by Daimler is up to 30 per cent compared with up to 20 per cent in internal combustion engines.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="24"> Fuel cells, which work at low temperatures and do not rely on the burning of fossil fuels, produce no oxides of nitrogen or sulphur (the causes of acid rain), need no batteries which would have to be recharged or recycled and can obtain hydrogen from such different fuels as natural gas, methanol, biomass gas, methane and other gases.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="25"> With all these advantages, it is not surprising that research into fuel cells is taken seriously in the US and Japan, both of which have costly national programmes aimed at making the technology viable for transport and power generation.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="26"> A German project group, including Daimler, Siemens, the electrical and electronics group, the chemical industry and the federal research ministry, has just been set up to keep the country in the forefront of fuel cell developments.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="27"> Weule would also like to see greater interest at European Union level - 'they should be more active in Brussels'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="28"> To develop its fuel cell-powered vehicle, Daimler went into partnership with Ballard Power Systems, a Canadian specialist in this technology.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="29"> Ballard has installed fuel cells in a bus in Vancouver and is working to extend its range and reduce its weight.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="30"> Firoz Rasul, Ballard's president, is in no doubt that Daimler has taken fuel cell technology a considerable way towards commercial viability, despite the remaining problems.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="31"> 'This demonstration shows that it's here, it's real and the trick is to get the cost down'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="32"> Cost and weight are the big hurdles still to be overcome.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="33"> Weule reckons the present cost of some DM10,000 for each kW of electricity needs to come down by a factor of at least 50, to around DM200 or less, before fuel cells can be installed in vehicles for private customers.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="34"> This could take 10 or 20 years.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="35"> Rasul, speaking from close knowledge of California's tough new pollution laws, which stipulate 10 per cent of cars should be zero-emission producing in 2003, is more optimistic.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="36"> 'I would say less than 10 years'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="37"> Rasul believes industry and governments are now waking up to fuel cells' potential.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="38"> 'The market is pushing it now and there is a new interest from the auto players'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="39"> Ballard's contribution to the Daimler vehicle was the proton exchange membrane fuel cell, a thin polymer foil coated with a catalyst material containing platinum; this encourages hydrogen to ionise and react with oxygen to produce the electricity.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="40"> Weule says Daimler's electric vehicle will in future use widely available methanol to obtain the hydrogen instead of a pressurised gas cylinder.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="41"> In a few years' time, Daimler aims to develop a fuel cell drive system far smaller than that in its Necar.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15407" num="42"> Success would be a further step towards fulfilling Weule's belief that fuel cells will be 'the propulsion technology of the next century'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15408" num="6"> Just over 10 years ago, Ballard Power Systems took a second look at an all but abandoned technology.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15408" num="7"> Now the Canadian company which is working with Daimler-Benz appears on the verge of a breakthrough in the efficient use of clean, abundant energy from fuel cells.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15408" num="8"> It has attracted attention with the improvements it has made to a proton exchange membrane fuel cell pioneered by General Electric of the US.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15408" num="9"> Paul Howard, Ballard's vice-president, says the GE system (developed for the space programme) had been seen as too heavy, finicky and expensive.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15408" num="10"> But in 1983, Ballard received a Canadian military contract for the fuel cells which produce electricity directly from oxygen and hydrogen without combustion.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15408" num="11"> They work with a polymer membrane as the electrolyte between two thin layers of platinum catalyst.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15408" num="12"> These are sandwiched between two carbon electrodes.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15408" num="13"> When hydrogen is piped next to one electrode and oxygen next to the other, a reaction occurs in the electrolyte, producing the electricity, heat and water.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15408" num="14"> Ballard improved the GE technology and by 1987 was ready to produce its first-generation 5 kW fuel cell, a series of electrodes, catalysts and plastic membranes bolted together, weighing 50 kg.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15408" num="15"> An array of 24 similar cells, linked to an electric motor, powers its first test vehicle, a bus.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15408" num="16"> This first generation of fuel cells has been sold to motor companies, including Daimler-Benz, for evaluation.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15408" num="17"> The next cells will generate more than twice as much power.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15408" num="18"> In 1998, Ballard, working with Johnson Matthey of the UK to reduce the amount of platinum catalyst, plans to market the third and commercially viable phase.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15408" num="19"> The 25 kW fuel cells will drive a large bus with a range of 560 km. A fourth generation 50 kW cell is at least 10 years away.</s>

<s docid="FT942-15408" num="21"> Today, we're probably about five or 10 times away from that,' says Howard.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="17"> 1. Introduction</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="18"> As the economic recession continues, a social re-examination seems to be taking place with regard to giving consumers the kinds of products and services that they really want.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="19"> I believe that in times such as this there is more of a demand for authentic products and technologies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="20"> What I mean here by authentic is providing a basic value for goods purchased that gives the average customer a sense of satisfaction.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="21"> To meet these needs requires mature technologies that show an understanding of the consumer and what they want.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="22"> The mature technologies referred to here are consumer technologies that essentially solve the problems that people consider important to them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="23"> For that reason, I think that we are entering a time in which research institutes that have stockpiled many different technologies will be asked to lead the way.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="24"> Therefore, in this paper, I would like to introduce the Mazda Technical Research Center, and in doing so, discuss what it is doing to address these new social trends.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="25"> 2.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="26"> Research Center Profiled</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="27"> The first technical research center that Mazda established to concentrate on new technologies was in 1985 at its headquarters in Hiroshima, and then in 1987, it added the Yokohama Technical Research Center in Yokohama.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="28"> The basic "idea" behind opening the technical research center here in Yokohama was, to use the slogan at the time, "build an automobile culture".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="29"> What this means is not treating the car simply as a means of travel, but treating it as one of the essential elements of society and culture that people need.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="30"> When the research centers initially received word of this new slogan, the research center at Mazda headquarters in Hiroshima decided to put its emphasis on new technologies that were directly related to the development of car types, whereas the research center in Yokohama decided it would focus on basic technologies in advanced fields oriented toward automobile technologies of the 21st century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="31"> At present, the two research centers are exchanging ideas and deepening ties with one another based on respective areas of expertise, and are steadily playing more important roles as the core places within Mazda for developing new technologies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="32"> Next, before we get into specific research activities, I would like to discuss my own views regarding research.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="33"> 3.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="34"> Personal Views Regarding Research</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="35"> Research institutes are at the pinnacle of research and development, and have an important mission in developing and exploring consumer technologies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="36"> For that reason, I feel that research institutes have to reflect the long-term and medium-term needs of consumers in their research.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="37"> With that in mind, I would like to take the opportunity here to state the direction I believe that consumer trends are going.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="38"> Until now, companies have stressed high value-added cars that offer more in the way of diversity, performance, and functionality.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="39"> In the future, however, there will probably be a shift from superficial "enjoyment" needs to more basic "enjoyment" needs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="40"> The need, for example, to maintain respect for human life, whether one's own or others, is growing ever more stronger in terms of both product safety and the environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="41"> For example, something has to be done about the more than 10,000 people a year that die in auto accidents, and the other problems that exist such as environmental pollution caused by carbon dioxide and nitrous oxides, and also find other energy alternatives to petroleum.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="42"> These problems are an immediate and future threat to ourselves, our families, and our children, and are cause for concern.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="43"> These are essentially problems that have to do with the car itself, so if we are to resolve these issues, we must steadily stockpile those technologies with an eye toward the future.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20567" num="44"> With that said, I would now like to introduce some areas of research to show the work we are doing in tackling some of these problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="20"> In a society with this orientation toward energy, we believe, as shown in Figure 1, that hydrogen, easily stored, transported, and converted to and from electricity, will play a crucial role as an energy medium, together with electricity produced from natural energy.</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="37"> During the oil crises of the 1970s, hydrogen engines attracted the attention of specialists as alternative energy engines, and with the recent criticality of global environmental problems, they have again drawn attention from these quarters as clean engines.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="38"> Research towards commercialization is continuing both in and out of Japan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="39"> According to the basic characteristics shown in Table 1, hydrogen has a high calorific value, and if operated with the same amount of air and theoretical air/fuel ratio as a gasoline engine, the calorific value with a hydrogen engine will be 15\|[percnt]\| higher than with gasoline, as shown in Figure 5.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="40"> However, since the minimum ignition energy is a very low one-tenth that of gasoline, engine regions not hot enough to cause a problem in gasoline engines, such as spark plugs and exhaust valves, as well as residual exhaust gas, etc. become igniters and are believed to easily cause premature ignition, backfire, and other abnormal combustion.</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="47"> 3.1 Goals In general, reducing the temperature of sources of ignition is effective in preventing abnormal combustion in a hydrogen engine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="48"> For this, the hydrogen supplied and heat produced must be reduced in order to lower combustion temperatures, even at the cost of output.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="49"> However, there are also examples in prior research on hydrogen engines of suppression of abnormal combustion without a reduction in hydrogen supply through the introduction of sodium-containing exhaust valves and a system for water injection within cylinders to cool sources of ignition.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="50"> Evaluation of hydrogen reciprocating engines (``CE'' below) predating hydrogen RE has shown a decline in output to roughly 50\|[percnt]\| that of gasoline engines used for comparison.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="51"> In hydrogen CE we evaluated, the causes thereof were shown to be restriction to a lean region with an excess air ratio (\|[lgr ]\|) of 1.8 or more in order to prevent abnormal combustion, and a reduction of intake air due to the large volume occupied by the hydrogen gas fuel; both of which resulted in a reduction of heat supplied to 54\|[percnt]\| that of a gasoline engine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="52"> Consequently, we consider these 2 factors the main causes of the low hydrogen CE output.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="53"> In contrast, the working chamber in an RE revolves as shown in Figure 6, and the location where intake, compression, expansion, and exhaust strokes occur differs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="54"> We believe that the relatively low temperature of the working chamber during intake and this unique structure free of high temperature exhaust valves and the like are beneficial in preventing backfire.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="55"> We investigated RE suitability for hydrogen based on the above theory.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="56"> This section discusses measures taken against abnormal combustion, and the next section discusses measures taken against reduction in air quantity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="57"> 3.2 Experimental Apparatus and Method A Mazda RE, model 13B (1,308 cc) and Mazda CE, model FE (1,998 cc) were used in experiments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="58"> Figure 7 shows an overview of the RE experimental apparatus used.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="59"> The air intake pipes and chamber were modified for hydrogen introduction based on mass production specifications.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="60"> Fuel supply systems studied were a premix system supplying previously mixed air and fuel, and an intake stroke injection system supplying hydrogen only during the intake stroke, reportedly effective in preventing backfire in hydrogen CE.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="61"> The premix system supplied hydrogen through throttle valve flow, and the intake stroke injection system supplied hydrogen through a dedicated hydrogen port provided in a side housing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="62"> Hydrogen was supplied to the engines from a commercial high pressure hydrogen cylinder (15.7 MPA, 7 m\|[lt ]\|sup\|[gt ]\| 3\|[lt ]\|/sup\|[gt ]\| ) after pressure reduction to 0.5 MPa by a decompression device.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="63"> As shown in Table 2, hydrogen port and air intake port timing initiated hydrogen supply slightly after intake began and terminated supply after air intake ended, 20 degrees of output shaft rotation later.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="68"> Since output declines with mixtures richer than the theoretical air/fuel ratio (\|[lgr ]\|=1), evaluation was made up to \|[lgr ]\|=1.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="69"> Under full loading and with throttle valves fully open, a premix system RE was successfully operated at up to 5,000 rpm with \|[lgr ]\|=1.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="70"> However, output became unstable at 6,500 rpm, with \|[lgr ]\|=1.4, and the excess air ratio (\|[lgr ]\|) could not be reduced at higher speeds.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="71"> In contrast, an intake stroke injection system RE was successfully operated at up to 6,500 rpm near \|[lgr ]\|=1.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="72"> We feel this is due to the production of non-uniform fuel regions with the intake stroke injection system, and a resulting weaker air/fuel ratio in mixture air near ignition sources than with premixing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="73"> The following studies were made on the intake stroke injection system, superior in output.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="74"> (2) Effect of Spark Plug Heating Value We investigated the optimum spark plug heating value for hydrogen.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="75"> Spark plugs were those used with ordinary gasoline specifications; leading side spark plugs (``L plugs'' below) had a heating value of 5 (heating values follow product numbers of NGK Spark Plug Co.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="76"> (Inc)). and trailing side spark plugs (``T plugs'' below) had a heating value of 10.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="77"> As the hydrogen quantity was increased from leanness, which inhibits abnormal combustion, premature ignition began to occur at an excess air ratio (\|[lgr ]\|) of 1.6.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="78"> Figure 9 shows indicator waves for the working chamber pressure when premature ignition occurred.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="79"> Premature ignition first occurred noncontinuously, gradually occurring sooner and continuously, and finally occurring continuously in the migrating working chamber, [beginning] immediately after spark plug exposure during compression.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="80"> From the course of this occurrence, we surmised that spark plugs become igniters, causing premature ignition which further raises spark plug temperature, increasing the frequency and quickening the occurrence of premature ignition.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="81"> To verify this theory, we investigated the relationship between premature ignition and heating values by substituting spark plugs with effectively high heating values for the low temperature spark plugs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="82"> As shown in Figure 10, the excess air ratio (\|[lgr ]\|) at which premature ignition began declined after an increase in spark plug heating values from the gasoline-specification heating value of 5.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="83"> As a result, we learned that normal operation is possible even at \|[lgr ]\|=1 when heating values are raised to 13.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="84"> Consequently, it became clear that spark plugs were the ignition source for the premature ignition in Figure 9, and that abnormal combustion can be avoided even at \|[lgr ]\|=1 through the use of spark plugs with a high heating value.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="85"> In supplementary experiments, we found that the heating value of L plugs affected the occurrence of premature ignition.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="88"> (3) Effect of Gas Escape From Plug Holes Though the use of spark plugs with a heating value of 13 and the adoption of an intake stroke injection system for fuel supply allowed operation at \|[lgr ]\|=1 over nearly all regions, instability did at times occur during maximum output at 6,500 rpm near \|[lgr ]\|=1.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="89"> Accordingly, we investigated its cause using a pressure indicator diagram.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="90"> Figure 11 shows changes in the indicator diagram when instability occurred.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="91"> Unlike Figure 9, sudden shifts from normal combustion to premature ignition are apparent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="92"> The absence of any signs of spark plug-induced premature ignition, and the passage of apex seals over L plug holes immediately prior to the occurrence of premature ignition led us to believe that mixture air uncombusted during the compression stroke passes through L plug holes, comes in contact with hot, burning gases during the expansion stroke, and is ignited.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="93"> We felt that the size and volume of L plug holes would affect the occurrence of this phenomenon and therefore investigated the effect of changing L plug hole volume by changing L plug ejection quantities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-59723" num="94"> As shown in Figure 12, we learned that the excess air ratio (\|[lgr ]\|) during the occurrence of output instability can be reduced by increasing the ejection quantity; that is, by decreasing L plug hole volume.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="12"> According to Mazda, the Wankel rotary petrol engine - which it, alone among car makers, now produces - can be adapted more easily than conventional petrol engines to run on hydrogen.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="13"> Cars fitted with it could reach the marketplace for a price about 20 per cent higher than a petrol-powered equivalent - 'in other words for about the cost of air conditioning and audio equipment', says Yamanouchi.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="14"> In contrast, he says, 'we estimate that even if electric vehicle technology really advanced, their price would be twice that of a gasolene car at minimum.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="15"> And that price ratio would be the same even if a manufacturer were to be making 10,000 units a month'.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="16"> Mazda is by no means alone in researching hydrogen-fuelled cars.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="17"> Mercedes and BMW of Germany are among those which have produced prototypes.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="18"> However, difficulties with combustion in adapted, conventional reciprocating engines and on-board fuel storage, and scepticism about the ease with which a hydrogen manufacturing and refuelling infrastructure could be set up have led most manufacturers to suggest that viable hydrogen cars are still years off.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="19"> According to Mr Yamanouchi, the design of the rotary engine eliminates the premature combustion problems normally associated with using hydrogen as a fuel in conventional engines.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="20"> Mazda has also launched a collaborative project with Nippon Steel Corporation, Japan's largest steel maker, to set up a pipeline fuelling supply system for the test programme, using as the feedstock hydrogen from one of Nippon Steel's manufacturing plants, where hydrogen is a major but mostly wasted by-product.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="21"> Yamanouchi expects the steel industry to be a future producer and marketer of hydrogen in its own right.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="22"> Chemical plants, which generate hydrogen as a by-product, could be also harnessed to localised supply networks.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="23"> In Japan there will be a network of hydrogen fuelling stations by the early 21st century, he predicts.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="24"> Mazda's vision of a fuelling infrastructure for hydrogen is based on it being in gaseous form.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="25"> BMW, in contrast, has based its prototype on the use of hydrogen in liquid form, requiring insulation of both fuelling system and the vehicle's fuel tank to allow temperatures close to absolute zero.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="26"> 'If the determination is there, we can set up hydrogen pumps and pipelines fairly easily in terms of technology and finance,' Yamanouchi says.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="27"> He is also relatively dismissive of concerns about the safety aspects of hydrogen, should it leak into a boot interior, for example.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="28"> It is undetectable by sight or smell, but Yamanouchi insists that, being lighter than air, it would disperse quickly - and it possesses a combustion point higher than gasolene.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="29"> Mazda regards the biggest problem as how to store the hydrogen in sufficient volumes in the vehicle.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="30"> Its solution, adopted also for the prototype Mercedes fleet, is a fuel tank filled with a metallic hydride capable of soaking up large quantities of gaseous hydrogen and re-releasing it when heated.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="31"> Fitting enough hydrogen into the tank is still a problem, however, as it is a much less dense fuel than gasolene.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="32"> Nevertheless, one prototype has achieved continuous running for 200km at maximum speeds of 150kph.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="33"> Yamanouchi's predicts that in 30 years, petrol or diesel-powered cars will account for just 10 per cent of the world's total car output, having been supplanted mainly by hydrogen cars but also by a much smaller proportion of battery powered urban vehicles.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="34"> As for California's forthcoming legislation, Mazda believes that the problems of limited range and performance of battery-powered cars, and even their refuelling infrastructure, will become much more apparent as its enactment draws nearer.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="35"> It believes that California's Air Resources Board and other legislative bodies involved will face a sea of difficulties in persuading Californian motorists to buy and use them.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="36"> 'Already, I have heard that the ARB is feeling itself as Hamlet in Shakespeare,' says Yamanouchi.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="37"> Mazda therefore expects the Californian authorities to welcome the proposals for a hydrogen alternative.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="38"> It is considering talking to other manufacturers that have an interest in the technology for a co-operative approach to introducing hydrogen cars to California.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="39"> Among those most likely to be interested is Mercedes, which last year updated its thinking on hydrogen vehicles in the form of the F-100 concept, shown as Mercedes' 'car of the future' at the Detroit motor show.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="40"> Even Mazda, however, acknowledges that production of hydrogen - on the huge scale required to provide significant substitution for petroleum - is a large technical challenge.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="41"> Hydrogen may be the most abundant element in the universe, and the ninth most abundant on earth, but making it from water - the most sensible route on a large scale - involves electrolysis, using a direct external energy source.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="42"> Clearly, if the energy to provide this came from fossil fuels, the whole exercise could be self-defeating from both the emissions and energy conservation points of view.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="43"> For large parts of the transport-using world - not least sunny California - solar energy could prove the answer.</s>

<s docid="FT923-14293" num="44"> One group highly active in the field, Texas Instruments, claims already to be generating solar electricity at close to the domestic tariff rate of Southern California Edison, the electric utility.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="6"> Bacteria which originated with the Vikings and 2,000-year-old water may seem an odd combination on which to build a modern export-oriented food industry.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="7"> But skyr, a thick yoghurt-like product first made by Iceland's early Viking inhabitants and bottled water from glaciers are just two elements of an ambitious effort by Icelandic companies and government to exploit the country's status as one of world's most pollution-free environments.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="8"> The strategy stems in large part from a sharp fall in recent years of the cod catch - the mainstay of Iceland's post-war economy - and the subsequent pressure on the government to develop alternative export industries.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="9"> Efforts at export diversification have also emerged from private-sector companies frustrated at the small size of Iceland's domestic market.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="10"> New ideas range from massive power generation schemes to natural food products and health spas.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="11"> The common thread is that all capitalise on Iceland's enviable environmental credentials and all are aimed at the growing international demand for products and services that are 'pure' or non-polluting.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="12"> Government efforts have concentrated on promoting Iceland's potential for generating large amounts of cheap electricity through clean and renewable means.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="13"> Only 10 per cent of Iceland's economically viable hydroelectric and geothermal potential has been tapped, according to Landsvirkjun, the national power company.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="14"> It estimates that the average cost of power from future hydro development for mainly industrial users would be lower in Iceland than elsewhere, including large projects such as Itaipu in Brazil and James Bay in Canada.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="15"> The government's priority is to lure energy-intensive industrial users, such as aluminium smelters and other metal industries.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="16"> It emphasises, however, that any developments would have to adhere to strict environmental standards, the costs of which it believes will be offset by secure access to cheap electricity.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="17"> Landsvirkjun officials believe Iceland could also be a competitive European site for the production of non-polluting hydrogen fuel for vehicles, another energy-intensive process.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="18"> Research has also been conducted into the direct export of electricity to mainland Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="19"> A detailed study of the likely performance of a proposed 500MW, 950km-long direct current submarine cable to Scotland will be completed by the end of the year.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="20"> Landsvirkjun officials believe most technical obstacles can be overcome, and that power from such a cable would be competitive in the UK electricity market, even against relatively low-cost natural gas-fired plants.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="21"> The possible imposition by the European Community of a carbon tax amounting to Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent would further enhance the competitiveness of the project, the officials say.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="22"> They concede, however, that the unusual depth (up to 1,000 metres) and length of the Pounds 1bn submarine cable, its high initial capital cost and the long lead-time needed to build additional dams, power plants and the cable itself considerably increase the risk profile of the project.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="23"> But the officials believe their greatest advantage lies in growing public opinion in western Europe favouring electricity that is generated without adding to greenhouse gases, but without having to resort to nuclear power.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="24"> Iceland is also hoping to sell its extensive experience in using geothermal energy, which accounts for a third of the country's total energy consumption and provides most of its space heating and hot water needs as well as some electricity production.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="25"> Marketing efforts have been directed mainly at eastern Europe, with particular emphasis on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, which Icelandic officials say has tremendous geothermal potential.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="26"> Private-sector attempts to capitalise on Iceland's environmental reputation are more modest but are generally closer to fruition.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="27"> The food and drink industry has been a market leader in exploiting the 'cold, clean and pure international image of Iceland,' according to Porarinn E.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="28"> Sveninsson, the director of the Akva spring water company based in the northern town of Akureyri.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="29"> It has recently begun selling bottled water in selected northeastern states of the US, even though the competition from domestic and European producers is fierce.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="30"> Sol, a Reykjavik-based food and drink producer, also sells bottled water in the US and Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="31"> But in addition it has succeeded in entering the market for 'New Age' soft drinks, which eschew the use of chemical preservatives and which place a premium on pure ingredients, especially water.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="32"> David Thornsteinsson, Sol's chairman, cites the success of the Icelandic-canned Seltzer brand of fruit-flavoured drinks in the UK.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="33"> Sales of the drinks rose from Dollars 900,000 in 1990 to an estimated Dollars 2.9m (Pounds 1.90m) this year, confirmation, Thornsteinsson says, that consumers are willing to pay a premium for assured purity of ingredients.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="34"> He rejects suggestions that competitors could emulate Seltzer's success by shipping Iceland's glacial water in bulk to bottling plants elsewhere.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="35"> 'The tanks and the need to process it at the other end would alter the taste too much', he says.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="36"> 'Besides, Iceland enjoys inexpensive back haul freight rates to the US and Europe, so the cost of shipping the finished product is minimal'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="37"> Icelanders believe there could also be potential to emphasise the natural qualities of more traditional food products, such as the country's distinctively-flavoured free range lamb.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="38"> Those raised along the coasts have a diet consisting mainly of moss and seaweed, while those reared in mountain pastures eat mainly herbs.</s>

<s docid="FT924-1825" num="39"> A study on establishing a big health centre in Reykjavik is under way, according to Markus Orn Antonsson, the city's mayor, who believes the absence of air and water pollution will appeal to European, and especially German tourists.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="3"> NHTSA believes that the same considerations that apply to alcohol dual fueled vehicles also apply to ones fueled by other liquids.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="4"> The agency is unaware of any other potentially available liquid alternative fuels that would have a significantly higher energy content than alcohol on a volume basis.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="5"> Assuming that other liquid alternative fuels do not have a significantly higher energy content, a driving range greater than 200 miles for dual fueled passenger automobiles using any liquid fuel could necessitate redesign of the vehicles to accommodate a larger fuel tank.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="6"> The agency requests comments on whether there are any potentially available liquid alternative fuels that do have a significantly higher energy content than alcohol on a volume basis, and, if so, whether a driving range higher than 200 miles should be set for such fuels.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="7"> Depending on the comments, the agency may set a higher driving range for such vehicles.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="8"> The above discussion assumes that the same fuel tank could be used for both the alternative liquid fuel and gasoline, as is the case for alcohol dual fueled vehicles.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="9"> If a separate fuel tank were required for the alternative liquid fuel, the limited available space in a passenger automobile for such an additional tank would be an even more critical reason not to set the minimum driving range above 200 miles.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="10"> Gaseous fuels always require a separate fuel tank from gasoline or diesel fuel.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="11"> In the previous rulemaking concerning minimum driving range, the agency's concerns about the limited available space in a passenger automobile for additional fuel tanks led it to establish a 100 mile minimum driving range for natural gas dual fueled vehicles.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="12"> Given the 1992 amendments to the Cost Savings Act, NHTSA has tentatively concluded that the minimum driving range for these vehicles should be increased to 200 miles.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="13"> As discussed above, the agency cannot set a lower minimum driving range for these vehicles.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="14"> Moreover, NHTSA believes that the minimum range should not be greater than 200 miles because such a range could discourage manufacturers from producing natural gas dual fueled vehicles, given the limited available space for additional fuel tanks.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="15"> The agency notes that the concerns it expressed in 1990 about a driving range greater than 100 miles for these vehicles would be of even greater significance for ranges above 200 miles.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="16"> The same considerations that apply to natural gas dual fueled vehicles also apply to dual fueled vehicles using other gaseous fuels, since all of these vehicles require a separate fuel tank from gasoline or diesel fuel.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="17"> Therefore, the agency is proposing to establish a 200 mile driving range for these vehicles as well.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="18"> B. Proposed Gallon Equivalents for Gaseous Fuels In order to carry out the special procedures for fuel economy calculations that apply to alternative fuel vehicles, it is necessary, for gaseous fuel vehicles, to have a gallons equivalent measurement.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="19"> The 1992 amendments to the Cost Savings Act specified that 100 cubic feet of natural gas is deemed to contain 0.823 gallon equivalent of gasoline.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="20"> The 1992 amendments required NHTSA to determine the appropriate gallons equivalent measurement for gaseous fuels other than natural gas, and a gallon equivalent of such gaseous fuel shall be considered to have a fuel content of 15 one-hundredths of a gallon of fuel.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="21"> As part of determining appropriate gallons equivalent measurements for gaseous fuels, NHTSA consulted with the Department of Energy (DOE) Fuels Utilization Data and Analysis Division.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="22"> NHTSA and DOE agreed that the following gaseous fuels could be potential transportation fuels by 2008: liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and hydrogen.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="23"> Pursuant to a contract with DOE, Abacus Technology Corporation prepared a report titled ``Energy Equivalent Values of Three Alternative Fuels: Liquefied Natural Gas, Liquefied Petroleum Gas, and Hydrogen''.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="24"> This report is available for review at the docket number cited in the heading of this notice.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="25"> The Abacus report develops gallons equivalent measurements for LNG, LPG, and hydrogen gaseous fuels.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="26"> After reviewing the Abacus report, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Mobile Sources recommended adding hythane fuel (a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas (principally methane)) as a gaseous fuel for which a gallon equivalent should be calculated.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="27"> EPA stated that although hythane is currently being used and evaluated on a limited basis, there is a possibility that hythane fuel may become commercially available as a gaseous fuel.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="28"> In a follow-up report, which is also available in the docket, Abacus developed an appropriate gallon equivalent measurement for hythane.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="29"> NHTSA notes that Abacus recommended using lower heating values for deriving the gallons equivalent measurements for gaseous fuels because this value represents the energy available from combustion in an engine.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="30"> 1. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) The first Abacus report noted that the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 included natural gas as an alternative fuel, but did not specify its physical state as a compressed gas or a liquefied gas.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="31"> The report assumed that the Act was referring to compressed natural gas, which was the more familiar technology when the Act was passed.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="32"> The Abacus report recommended that the same 0.823 gallon equivalent of natural gas established in the Alternative Motor Fuels Act be applied to LNG based on energy content in British Thermal Unit (BTU)/Standard Cubic Feet (SCF), because LNG composition and heat of combustion are similar to compressed natural gas.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="33"> 2. Liquefied Propane Gas (LPG) The Gas Processors Association Standard 2140-92 specifies four grades of LPG.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="34"> They are commercial propane, commercial butane, commercial butane-propane mixtures, and propane HD-5.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="35"> Propane HD-5 is recognized as the most suitable fuel for internal combustion engines operating at moderate to high engine severity.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00026" num="36"> The Abacus report concluded that one gallon of LPG, grade HD-5, is equivalent to 0.732 gallon of gasoline, using a lower heating value.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="13"> The agency is proposing a new name for this part to reflect its expanded scope.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="14"> Regulatory Impacts A.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="15"> Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures This notice has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="16"> NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action and has determined that the action is not ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="17"> In this NPRM, the agency proposes to set the minimum driving range for all dual fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles at 200 miles and to establish gallon equivalents for specified gaseous fuels.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="18"> None of the proposed changes will result in an additional burden on manufacturers.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="19"> They would not impose any mandatory requirements but would instead implement statutory incentives to encourage the manufacture of alternative fuel vehicles.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="20"> For these reasons, NHTSA believes that any impacts on manufacturers will be so minimal as not to warrant preparation of a full regulatory evaluation.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="21"> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The agency has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="22"> I certify that this proposed rule, if made final, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="23"> The rationale for this certification is that, to the extent that any passenger automobile manufacturers qualify as small entities, their number would not be substantial.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="24"> Moreover, conversion of vehicles to dual fuel status with the minimum ranges that would be established by this regulation would be voluntarily undertaken in order to achieve beneficial CAFE treatment of those vehicles.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="25"> Therefore, no significant costs would be imposed on any manufacturers or other small entities.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="26"> C. National Environmental Policy Act The agency has also analyzed this rule for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act, and determined that it would not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="27"> Increased evaporative emissions due to added fuel volume would be the most important environmental impact of this rulemaking if it induced manufacturers to enlarge the size of existing fuel tanks in order to produce dual fuel vehicles operating on alcohol or other liquid fuel.</s>

<s docid="FR941219-1-00027" num="28"> However, the proposed minimum range would not make it necessary for these dual fuel vehicles to have enlarged fuel tanks.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21146" num="14"> Article Type:CSO [Text] The Government Industrial Research Institute, Osaka, (GIRI, Osaka) of the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) has been successful in an experimental conversion of carbon dioxide (CO[.sup]2[/])into methanol using gold, which has been thought to be chemically inactive, as a catalyst.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21146" num="15"> At a temperature of 250ÎC, about 50ÎC lower than with a copper catalyst, the same degree of efficiency in methanol synthesis was possible.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21146" num="16"> Along with being useful for fixation and recovery of atmospheric CO[.sup]2[/], which is a cause of global warming, this also has applications in systems for converting hydrogen into methanol and transporting it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21146" num="17"> The gold catalyst experiment was carried out by Masaki Haruta, the head, and Hiroaki Sakurai, a researcher, of the Catalytic Chemistry Laboratory of GIRI, Osaka.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21146" num="18"> When a mixture of CO[.sup]2[/] and hydrogen gasses under a pressure of 50 atmospheres was passed through iron oxide affixed to gold, approximately 5% of the CO[.sup]2[/] combined with hydrogen to form methanol.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21146" num="19"> The gold and iron oxide exhibited the greatest activity at 250ÎC.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21146" num="20"> Copper and zinc oxide is known as a catalyst for converting CO[.sup]2[/] into methanol, and the gold catalyst has the same synthesis efficiency as this.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21146" num="21"> In addition, the copper catalyst exhibits the greatest activity at a temperature of 300ÎC, and at 250ÎC, the gold/iron oxide catalyst is more efficient.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21146" num="22"> Following this, GIRI, Osaka plans to mix in aluminum oxide, etc., and make smaller granules of gold to increase the activity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21146" num="23"> Conventionally, gold is considered to have poor chemical activity and not to be useful as a catalyst, but recently researchers have learned that it converts carbon monoxide (CO) into C0[.sup]2[/] at a temperature of -70ÎC and can separate out the odorous components of trimethylamine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21146" num="24"> Methanol is a basic chemical product that is also raw material for thermosetting resins, but recently conversion of hydrogen, which has the danger of exploding, into methanol for transportation has attracted attention.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21146" num="25"> The ``WE-NET Concept'' proposed by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) is a project for using the solar energy of overseas deserts to separate water and generate hydrogen and react the hydrogen with CO[.sup]2[/] to generate methanol for transportation, and practical research is being started this year.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="9"> Their views are plain-textured, their lives monochromatic.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="10"> They do not drive Aston Martins or collect Venetian glass or holiday in Barbados or know anything about the gold price, so how can they avoid the choking dust of dullness that settles, inevitably, upon a life without money?</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="12"> Dull they may be, but they do not go away.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="13"> The other reason I like rich people is that their stories and experiences are much livelier than poor people's stories.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="14"> Here is an example.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="15"> I found it this week in a book, Horsetrader, by Patrick Robinson, an account of Robert Sangster's exploits as a racehorse owner.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="16"> Sangster is rich, intelligent, interesting.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="17"> One night Sangster and his wife Sue and an Irish friend of Sangster's, Billy McDonald, a bloodstock agent from Ballynahinch, were on the beach outside Sangster's house in Barbados, gazing at the distant lights of Michael Smurfit's yacht.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="18"> Suddenly, McDonald announced that he was fed up with all this vodka.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="19"> 'Dat bloddy boat of Smurfit's is packed with Chateau Petrus,' he shouted, 'and I'm going out there to get a decent bottle'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="20"> Upon which he plunged into the sea and began swimming, inexpertly, towards the yacht.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="21"> Slowly, McDonald's sounds grew fainter until, on the velvety Barbadian air, came a waterlogged Irish roar: 'Oi'm bloddy drownin'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="22"> Fock it]' At once, Sangster's wife whipped off her skirt, knifed into the water and swam strongly to the Irishman's resue.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="23"> She got him on his back, grabbed his hair, told him that if he wriggled, belched or spoke she would abandon him, and dragged him 200 yards back to the beach, depositing him, poleaxed with exhaustion, upon the sand.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="24"> 'I'd say he owes you,' Sangster told his wife.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="25"> 'None of us could have done that.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="26"> Shame about the Petrus'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="27"> Nice story.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="28"> I wish that poor people had such stories to tell.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="29"> If I had three wishes, I would wish that most rich people were somewhat poorer, that many poor people were not so poor, and that some poor people were greatly richer.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="30"> I had better explain.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="31"> I am not a professor, but if you ask me we seem to be living through a period, in the western democracies, of political decadence and moribundity.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="32"> Things are badly skew-whiff.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="33"> I am not talking about humdrum recessions.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="34"> Get rid of one and along comes another.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="35"> I am talking about the distortions and inequities that disfigure our economies - specifically, the crudeness of our distribution of benefits between the haves and have-nots.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="36"> Take the US, an extremely decadent society that has lessons for us all.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="37"> According to an analysis by Neil Howe and Phillip Longman in The Atlantic magazine some time ago: 'When we add together all the tax expenditures and all the direct outlays for which we have data. . . an unambiguous picture emerges.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="38"> On average, households with incomes under Dollars 10,000 collected a total of Dollars 5,690 in benefits (in 1991).</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="40"> In terms of total fiscal cost . . . the aggregate amounts received by the non-needy in 1991 were staggering'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="41"> Whatever one's vision of the future, they said - whether it was a negative income tax or a 15 per cent flat rate; green cars running on hydrogen or mag-lev trains humming between cities - to get something new, one must give up something old.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="42"> 'A society that cannot find the resources to pay for 60-cent tuberculosis vaccinations for 10-year-olds must ask itself why it is offering subsidised health care and housing to millionaires'.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="43"> Shuffling government ministers around is low-grade sport compared with the shuffling of resources between the haves and have-nots, where progress will be slow.</s>

<s docid="FT932-6066" num="44"> To ginger things up - to provide more people with stories - I would, at random, sequester the fortunes of one deceased multi-millionaire in seven and divide the spoils between 15 poor people.</s>

<s docid="LA122489-0017" num="242"> Women want to look more feminine, prettier; less of a uniform approach, more of a personal style.</s>

<s docid="LA122489-0017" num="244"> In the most recent collections, we saw very chic jackets thrown over a kind of bicycling-jogging suit.</s>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="8"> When two scientists announced last month in Utah that they had achieved room-temperature nuclear fusion, the news shot through the halls of science like a scalded cat.</s>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="9"> "It was," one Berkeley physicist said, "like seeing your car suddenly jump on the roof".</s>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="10"> It was that unexpected and stunning.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="11"> But now that the first waves of astonishment, wonder and euphoria have passed, a few scientists, environmentalists and ecological activists have begun to have more troubling thoughts.</s>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="12"> For one thing, they say, even if desktop fusion really works -- a matter still very much up in the air -- it is unclear that the power produced will be as cheap or clean as many have suggested it might be.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="13"> And even if it were, given society's dismal record in managing technology, the prospect of cheap, inexhaustible power from fusion is "like giving a machine gun to an idiot child," Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich says.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="14"> Laments Washington-based author-activist Jeremy Rifkin, "It's the worst thing that could happen to our planet".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="15"> Inexhaustible power, he argues, only gives man an infinite ability to exhaust the planet's resources, to destroy its fragile balance and create unimaginable human and industrial waste.</s>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="16"> The Power to Pollute</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="17"> That fusion itself may be a clean energy source, especially in comparison with fossil fuels, is beside the point.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="18"> Not all pollution is caused by burning fuel; there are many other pollutants that fast-growing industrial societies throw into the atmosphere -- compounds from rubber tires, fumes from drying paint, and hundreds of other byproducts of industrial processes.</s>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="19"> And clean-burning, non-polluting, hydrogen-using bulldozers still could knock down trees or build housing developments on farmland.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="20"> A mere technological change in fuel sources also does nothing to change man's attitude toward nature -- what UC Berkeley physicist John Holdren calls the "pave the planet and paint it green" mentality.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="21"> In addition, Holdren says, despite the claims made, there is no guarantee that fusion will necessarily be a clean process; in some circumstances it can produce deadly neutron radiation and poisonous tritium.</s>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="22"> Worst of all to some observers, its cheap inexhaustible energy would let the planet support many more people than its current population of 5.2 billion.</s>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="23"> And this, they say, would be a crowded Earth, without forests, wilderness, open space or the chance for solitude.</s>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="24"> What would the planet be like without "psychological space"? asks Richard Charter, a coastal lobbyist and environmentalist who notes that many of the aberrations and turmoil of inner cities can be blamed on "just plain crowding without hope".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="25"> In the euphoria over fusion power, UC Berkeley anthropologist Laura Nader says, many people just assume that cheaper, more abundant energy will mean that mankind is better off, "and there is no evidence for that".</s>

<s docid="LA041989-0041" num="26"> Between 1950 and 1970, Nader says, there was "a doubling of energy use," while at the same time, quality of life indicators all declined.</s>
