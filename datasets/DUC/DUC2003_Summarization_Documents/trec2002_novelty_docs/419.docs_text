<TEXT>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="6"> The global pile of several billion worn-out tyres is growing day by day and is fast becoming an environmental problem of significant dimensions.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="7"> If these tyres lie around long enough, they can leech a variety of contaminants into the soil and eventually into water supplies.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="8"> Occasionally, tyre dumps catch fire.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="9"> And when they do, they can be almost impossible to put out.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="10"> One in Wales is still burning after eight years.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="11"> Dumped tyres also represent a profligate waste of natural resources, for two main reasons.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="12"> One is that, provided it has not been damaged in use, the complicated, stress-bearing carcass which forms the heart of a tyre usually remains sound even if the tread has worn away.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="13"> The other is that the oil-based nature of the various tread compounds and fabrics represents a potentially valuable energy source, or raw material for other uses.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="14"> An increasing amount of attention is thus being focused on ways to minimise this waste.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="15"> One obvious route is to make tyres last longer, resulting in fewer tyres being produced.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="16"> Thirty years ago the tyre industry virtuously shot itself in the foot by introducing radial tyres which overnight doubled the average tyre's life to around 40,000 miles.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="17"> Today, leading participants in the industry are using an 80,000-mile guarantee as a marketing tool.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="18"> But vehicle population continues to rise, so recycling in one form or another is an increasingly unavoidable necessity.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="19"> At present, around 15 per cent of car tyres are retreaded, and returned for sale in the cheapest sectors of the replacement market, although this figure can vary widely from country to country.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="20"> This figure is much lower than that for truck tyres, more than half of which are retreaded.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="21"> In Brussels, the European Commission is seeking to increase the proportion of car tyres retreaded to around 30 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="22"> Achieving this, according to industry estimates, would reduce by around 60m gallons the quantity of crude oil used in production each year.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="23"> At that level of retreading, it is likely that the leading tyre makers would become more interested in establishing more substantive 'in-house' retreading operations.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="24"> At present the big tyre makers undertake these activities on a relatively small scale.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="25"> Retreading has traditionally provided business opportunities for small, independent companies.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="26"> The perception in the minds of many consumers that retreaded tyres might be of suspect quality and performance has become outdated since strict quality standards were imposed.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="27"> Indeed, the UK's Durham-based Colway Tyres, which retreads around 1m of the 4m discarded tyres it collects each year, is actively using high performance as a promotional weapon.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="28"> It has moved into the highest speed-rated H and V tyre sectors, carved a unique niche as a rally tyre supplier and recently has been approved as a supplier for junior single-seat racing cars.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="29"> According to Mr Bob Bonomy, Colway's managing director, each retreaded tyre represents a production saving of up to four gallons of crude oil compared with a new tyre.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="30"> Colway's own output indicates the dimensions of the recycling problem.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="31"> It rejects three casings for every one remoulded, which means that 'finding new ways of recycling scrap tyres not suitable for remoulding has become part of our corporate strategy'.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="32"> One answer is the collaborative venture Colway has developed with Duralay, a subsidiary of motor components and engineering group BBA.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="33"> A tyre-shredding and storage facility next to the remoulding plant turns the rubber into 'crumb' which Duralay makes into carpet underlay.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="34"> However, since there is no prospect of carpeting much of the earth's land mass, Mr Bonomy stresses that underlay can only be a small part of the solution.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="35"> Another potential solution is to use the 'crumb' in large-scale enterprises such as road construction.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="36"> Inclusion of about 15 per cent 'crumb' in asphalt would increase the life of a road surface by 15 to 22 years.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="37"> The snag is that the cost of the asphalt rises by 50 per cent to 100 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="38"> However, the picture might improve if Europe were to follow the example in some states of the US which have legislated 'crumb' must be used to improve drainage and skid resistance.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="39"> None of these solutions, however, has as much potential as the idea of providing a power source from incineration of tyres.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="40"> Such a prospect is not as noxious as it sounds in terms of air quality, and late last year a landmark was reached when Elm Energy, a US joint venture, was granted permission to open Europe's first tyre-incineration power station in the UK.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="41"> The Wolverhampton facility burns at a temperature of 950 degrees C tyres which, on average, contain the energy equivalent of 12 cu m of natural gas.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="42"> The closed incineration system, already in use in North America, means that virtually no gaseous pollutants escape.</s>

<s docid="FT941-5694" num="43"> Elm Energy - formed by Nipsco, an Indiana utility group, and the Performance Service Corporation of Connecticut - claims it can consume around 5m of the UK's 25m tyres scrapped annually.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="6"> A collaborative venture between a subsidiary of BBA, the motor components and engineering group, and Colway Tyres, the UK's largest independent tyre remoulder, is turning 3m scrap tyres a year into carpet underlay.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="7"> The venture represents one of the latest ways of dealing with the mountains of discarded tyres now regarded as a major environmental problem.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="8"> About 25m tyres are discarded each year in the UK and about 250m a year in western Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="9"> With serious attempts at recycling only just starting to gain momentum, several hundred million tyres have collected throughout the countryside.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="10"> One large dump of tyres in Wales is still burning after eight years, all attempts to extinguish it having failed.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="11"> Even without fire, pollutants leech from the tyres, poisoning soil and endangering waterways.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="12"> The BBA-Colway venture has involved building a tyre-shredding and storage facility next to Colway's remoulding plant on the outskirts of Durham, which produces more than 1m tyres a year and employs about 250 people.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="13"> Four million discarded tyres a year are collected from distributors and retail outlets.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="14"> Only about a quarter are fit for remoulding and the remainder are shredded, with the resultant rubber 'crumb' being collected in large silos.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="15"> It is transported to Duralay, BBA's wholly owned subsidiary at Rossendale, Lancashire, where it is made into underlay.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="16"> Steel cords reclaimed from the tyres are sent for recycling separately.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="17"> Finding new ways of recycling scrap tyres not suitable for remoulding 'has become part of our corporate strategy', says Mr Bob Bonomy, managing director of Colway.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="18"> The partners stress that underlay can only be a small part of the recycling solution to the problem of scrap tyres.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="19"> Research commissioned from consultants Coopers & Lybrand has identified the inclusion of rubber crumb in asphalt as one potentially major way of dealing with the problem.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="20"> Inclusion of about 15 per cent crumb in road construction would increase the life of a road surface by 15 to 22 years, the research says.</s>

<s docid="FT941-17541" num="21"> 'But the bad news is that, as things stand, the cost of the asphalt rises by 50 per cent to 100 per cent so the actual payback is marginal,' said Mr Bonomy.</s>

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="5"> By TIM BURT</s>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="6"> Most vehicles in Britain are not just running on four wheels but on a potential energy resource - tyres - which an innovative power company has begun burning to generate electricity.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="7"> The idea of burning tyres raises images of noxious fumes and black smoke, but Elm Energy, a US joint venture, has won permission to open Europe's first power station in Britain, fuelled by Michelins, Goodyears, Pirellis and other makes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="8"> An intensive lobbying campaign by the company has convinced regulators and local authorities not only that drivers' last punctured tyres may be consigned safely to the furnace, but that a stringent recycling system will ensure they will not then inhale the by-products.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="9"> Standing outside Elm Energy's newly completed power station in Wolverhampton, which has its formal opening early in November, Anne Evans, the managing director, claims the recycling facility will out-perform other waste-to-energy schemes.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="10"> An average tyre, she says, contains the equivalent energy of 12 cu m of natural gas and is second only to oil in British Thermal Units (BTU), the common measure of heat energy produced during incineration.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="11"> Following the completion of pre-production tests at the plant, truck loads of old tyres are being fed into five giant furnaces where they will burn at up to 950`C.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="12"> Elm Energy expects to generate heat energy of 13,500 BTU per pound, compared with 12,000 BTU for coal, 2,500 BTU for household rubbish and 1,500 BTU for food waste.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="13"> Burning tyres is hot work and could easily produce the steam to drive a turbine.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="14"> Elm Energy's success has rested on citing similar operations in the US where the tyre industry can dispose of its rubbish at one end of a power station and see no harmful gases emerge at the other.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="15"> The company - formed by Nipsco, the Indiana utility group, and the Performance Service Corporation of Connecticut - has pioneered a system which it claims will consume 21 per cent of Britain's waste tyres with minimal emissions.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="16"> That claim is based on its unique power generation and recycling process.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="17"> Under the system, batches of tyres are rammed into furnaces, where all the material is expected to burn so rapidly that almost no carbon gases can form.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="18"> Split-level hearths in the furnace will, meanwhile, pulsate along a series of steps so that the ash - mostly steel wire - can be fed into hoppers for recycling to the scrap metal industry.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="19"> Before reaching the next stage, where furnace gases flow around water-filled drums to produce turbine-driving steam, any remaining organic material is incinerated in reburn tunnels fed with combustion air.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="20"> Having produced enough energy for 30MW of electricity - supplying 25,000 homes - the tyres' job is done.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="21"> If the remaining gases were pumped straight into the atmosphere, environmentalists would have justifiable complaint.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="22"> But Elm Energy says its recycling means that emissions of harmful substances will be less than one-millionth of the World Health Organisation limits.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="23"> First, the flue gases are filtered through hundreds of Gore-Tex bags to extract zinc oxide.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="24"> The company plans to sell this waste to the tyre industry for re-use in new products.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="25"> Remaining waste gases flow into a lime reactor which converts harmful sulphur dioxide into calcium sulphite.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="26"> At the final stage, the sulphite will be filtered through another series of Gore-Tex bags and the residue sold for building materials.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="27"> 'There will be no black smoke, no environmental problem,' predicts Evans.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="28"> 'If this plant isn't clean enough then you cannot build anything in the UK'.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="29"> She may be right.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="30"> But all this technology costs money and the government, determined to encourage alternatives to coal, has underwritten the scheme.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="31"> Elm Energy's initial contracts with the Non Fossil Fuel Agency, which purchases the power and resells it to Midlands Electricity company, are confidential.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="32"> Evans says these contracts would be withdrawn if she revealed their value.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="33"> All she will admit is that the government has guaranteed the company's short-term contracts, so helping the company to borrow the capital to set up the plant.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="34"> More than Pounds 48m has been invested in the Wolverhampton plant and Elm Energy is confident of a handsome return.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="35"> That income has a double bonus: on the one hand, the government wants to promote waste-to-energy schemes; on the other, the tyre industry is keener to see its tyres go into power generation than landfill sites.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="36"> Elm Energy says its operation will be cheaper than other waste-fuelled power schemes because there will not be tonnes of burnt ash to dispose of.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="37"> The company is so certain it can provide energy at the right price that it is already planning further plants in Scotland, southern England and continental Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT934-13811" num="38"> In Wolverhampton, Evans says people have the right attitude: 'They're not afraid of tyres.'</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="28"> Britain's AEA Technology has developed a cheap technology to process old automobile tires into gas, oil, and other products.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="29"> The technology is based on the separation of tire materials under the impact of high temperature.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="30"> The developers say that this technology is cleaner and more economical than scrapping tires through incineration.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="31"> A pilot plant has been tested at an AEA Technology test site near London.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="32"> Tires are heated up to 1,080ÎC in a kiln and, in the process, two fuels, gas and oil, a substance rich in high-quality carbon, and steel were separated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="33"> The kiln is equipped with a condenser to recover oils and with a gas scrubber.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="34"> AEA Technology sold the first commercial MPD (Multi-Purpose Disposer) plant to an American firm that will manufacture and sell the plant in North America.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="35"> Each plant that operates based upon the new technology can handle 1,000 kg of tires in less than nine hours.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="36"> Two hundred [as published] plants can be linked up to annually process 14,000 tonnes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="37"> Each tonne of European-produced tires produces up to 220 kg of aromatic oils, 240 kg of gas, 420 kg of carbon, and 160 kg of steel.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="38"> The carbon-containing element that is formed when the tires are scrapped is of sufficiently high quality and calorific value that it can be used either in filters or as a fuel.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="39"> The oil and gas can be pumped straight into nearby thermal electric plants using pipelines.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="40"> Its developers state that the MPD system meets all of the clean air standards that have been adopted in the countries of Europe at the present time and could be licensed in any state of the United States, except California, where clean air standards surpass world standards at the present time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="41"> The unit requires relatively simple refinements to meet those standards.</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="45"> Israeli experts from Ben-Gurion University (Beer-Sheva) have developed a fire extinguishing device, the principle of operation of which is based on the phenomenon of so-called electric wind that is capable of putting out any flame on a flat surface, for example, a rug or a pool of burning oil.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="46"> The device has a diameter of one meter and does not have a harmful impact on the environment because the use of water, foam, or Halon gas are not required for its operation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="47"> The device consists of two electrodes--a flat electrode and a sharp electrode.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="48"> When voltage is applied to them, an electrical field is formed, which is much more dense near the sharp electrode.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="49"> If the field is large enough, atoms near the sharp electrode lose electrons which are transformed into positively-charged ions and, propelled by the field, move away from the sharp electrode, in the process interacting with other, neutral atoms.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="50"> This movement of atoms and positive ions is called electric wind.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="51"> Israeli experts searched for the optimal shape and orientation of the sharp electrode to use electric wind to blow out fires.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="52"> The flat burning surface acts as the other electrode.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="53"> A meter-long wire attached to a metal frame and connected to a direct current source was utilized as the first electrode.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="54"> A flame is blown out when the wire is moved by hand over the fire at a height of less than 10 cm from the surface at a rate of approximately one meter per second.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="55"> The electric wind separates the flames from the burning material and rapidly cools the material below its ignition temperature.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="56"> The developers say that the fire extinguishing device should be very cheap because it is manufactured from simple components and has low energy consumption.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="57"> Tel-Aviv's Spectronix is developing a commercial version of the device.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42464" num="58"> It is possible that production of the new device will begin in several months.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="21"> Matyushin, candidate of technical sciences, NIID [expansion not given]; boldface as published in source text; UDC 502.7] [Text] Under the conditions of continuous intensification of production, the problem of environmental protection and rational use of natural resources is becoming increasingly socially and economically significant.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="22"> Included among the matters classified under this problem are the following: pollution of the water and air by toxic industrial wastes, toxic chemicals, and radioactive materials; prevention of harmful consequences of the use of pesticides to fight pests and diseases in agriculture and forestry; soil erosion and recultivation; further development of the legal bases of environmental protection; and economic assessment of natural resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="23"> The development of production, scientific and engineering progress, and expansion of human industrial activity must not destroy the harmony that has been established in nature or destroy natural resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="24"> There are no wastes in nature: All biological, chemical, and physical processes occur in a closed circle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="25"> All industrial enterprises affect the environment to some degree or other.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="26"> Research has shown that at least one third of all processible raw material is now transformed into finished products.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="27"> Consequently, the remaining fraction of raw materials becomes wastes that are often harmful to the environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="28"> In the past decade, the volume of industrial wastes released into the atmosphere in conjunction with the rapid increase in industrial development has increased sharply and continues to increase.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="29"> Each year, industrial enterprises, thermal electric power plants, motor vehicles, blast furnaces, aircraft engines, and other machines release hundreds of millions of tons of carbon in the form of oxides, primarily carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="30"> The carbon dioxide released by humans and the animal world is absorbed by plant life to provide a stable state of equilibrium in the atmosphere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="31"> Unfortunately, this equilibrium has now been upset, and the alarm of ecological catastrophe is sounding louder with each passing year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="32"> The continuing increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is an especially negative phenomenon.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="33"> Carbon dioxide is known to be toxic in large quantities: It causes hypoxia and debilitated respiration and cardiac activity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="34"> An increase in carbon dioxide concentration not only has a direct effect on organisms but also facilitates an increase in absorption of the earth's thermal radiation by the atmosphere, which in turn results in climate warming throughout the entire planet.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="35"> As is known, in the past 100 years, the average temperature of the earth's surface increased by 0.5-0.6Î, which has in turn accelerated glacial thawing and increased the sea's level by 1.5-2 m.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="36"> Also released along with carbon dioxide during the combustion process is carbon monoxide, which has an even more toxic effect and which may result in debilitation of many vital functions, including illness of the central nervous system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="37"> Metallurgy plants and thermal power plants release a large amount of sulfur dioxide.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="38"> Fossil fuels also contain a great deal of sulfur.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="39"> Each year, about 30 million tons of sulfurous gas are released in our country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="40"> When sulfur dioxide reacts with atmospheric moisture, sulfurous and sulfuric acids form.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="41"> When nitrogen-containing coal and oil are burned, oxides are formed that combine with atmospheric moisture to yield nitrous and nitric acids.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="42"> These acids may cause serious lung diseases.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="43"> Ecological and sanitary and hygiene estimates are formulated on the basis of data about emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="44"> In nature, everything is interconnected.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="45"> Toxic impurities that end up in the air are returned to the earth in the form of precipitation falling on pastures, meadows, fields, gardens, and vegetable gardens.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="46"> Polluted precipitation also falls into water reservoirs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="47"> The acids contained in precipitation react with metals (aluminum, cadmium, mercury, lead, etc).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="48"> in the soil, and they infect the water and thus the fish.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="49"> Precipitation is not the only source of water pollution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="50"> Industrial, transport, and household wastes are dumped into water reservoirs in quantities such that many rivers and lakes can no longer be cleaned with existing resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="51"> The natural purity of relatively shallow ground waters has been lost.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="52"> Phosphates from wastes, the nitrates that are used everywhere as fertilizers, and other toxic materials have infiltrated them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="53"> The situation regarding irrigation water is no better.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="54"> Its chemical composition largely dictates the quality of agricultural projects, in which the content of nitrates, phosphates, and metals has also risen.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="55"> Countries with a high technological discipline permit the use of relatively small amounts of fertilizer.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="56"> In countries with a lower technological discipline, the level is higher owing to an attempt to increase crop yields.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="57"> As a rule, this results in a decline in product quality.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="58"> And so, the circle has closed: People harm the environment, the environment shortens their life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="59"> The child mortality rate in many countries has stopped decreasing, and in several countries it has even begun to increase.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="60"> Studies conducted by the World Health Organization gave the sad results: An elevated lead content was discovered in the blood of 30 percent of neonates.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="61"> Where is the way out?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="62"> Reason suggests that, as soon as possible, further destruction of nature must be halted, it must be restored on a planetwide scale, and population control must be begun so as not to extend beyond the scope of the biosphere's objective capabilities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="63"> Understanding of the fact that people's lives truly depend on their effect on nature has not yet become widespread.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="64"> It must be acknowledged that more than a few measures to regulate man's relationship with nature have been developed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="65"> In the developed countries, where the economy is subject to market relationships, energy-saving technologies are being developed intensively.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="66"> This is making it possible to burn less fuel and, consequently, reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="67"> The manufacture of lead-free gasoline has begun, and exhaust gases have begun to contain far less toxic impurities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="68"> Today, the search for ways of solving ecological problems is being conducted at the international, state, and sector levels.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="69"> Many countries regularly exchange information about the current condition of the environment and are creating a common ecological data bank.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="70"> Unfortunately, our country has not yet become sufficiently actively engaged in this process.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="71"> And the situation in our country cannot be called good.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="72"> According to existing data, about 30 million of our citizens are living in ecological disaster areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="73"> Life itself is compelling us to consider the problems of restoring and protecting nature as priority problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="74"> Quality sewage treatment is not provided in 600 cities, more than two thirds of toxic sources do not meet the requirements specified in standards.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="75"> Volumes of unutilizable toxic industrial wastes are increasing, and a large portion of them are transported to household waste dumps or else to disorganized storage sites, which eventually results in toxic materials ending up in underground waters and water reservoirs and in infection of the plant and animal world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="76"> Unfortunately, the aviation industry, whose technical policy has long failed to recognize ecology as a priority directly, is a definite contributor to these negative consequences of economic activity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="77"> Each year, about 290,000 tons of toxic materials in the form of gases released from stationary sources are formed throughout the sector as a whole.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="78"> From them, dust- and gas-scrubbing units trap 136,500 tons of toxic materials (47.1 percent), and 153,700 tonnes, i.e., about 0.25 percent of the total volume of wastes throughout the country, are released into the atmosphere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="79"> Considering the fact that the sector's enterprises are located in cities with an industrially developed potential, where tough standards are in effect, and also, as a rule, in densely populated complexes of apartment buildings, the negative effect of the sector's production on the environment is not always adequately reflected by the volumes of emissions of toxic materials.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="80"> In the total mass of emissions, the greatest volume percentage of pollutants comes from boiler and other thermal power plants (36-40 percent), foundry work (15-18 percent), painting (14-15 percent), and engine ground tests (14-15 percent).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="81"> The sector's production is characterized by a long list of wastes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="82"> And although solid particles and hydrocarbons predominate in the composition of toxic materials generated (they account for 74.6 and 13 percent respectively), individual enterprises release up to 70 different toxic elements and compounds into the air medium.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="83"> Each year, about 3,800,000 tons of ash, slag, spend molding and core mixtures, sediments in cleaning equipment, and other wastes are generated at the sector's enterprises.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="84"> Of that amount, 800,000 tons is toxic.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="85"> Hundreds of thousands of tons of abrasive dust containing cobalt, niobium, molybdenum, tungsten, chromium, nickel, vanadium, and other metals that are needed for industry but are nevertheless harmful to the environment are released each year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="86"> According to data from a 1992 inventory of sector enterprises throughout Moscow, the total volume of toxic wastes generated consists of the following: 33 percent are wastes of galvanic and other types of chemical treatment; 17 percent are petroleum products (oils, cutting fluids, and storm sewer slimes); 12 percent are wastes containing highly toxic heavy metals (dusts, slags, slimes); 8 percent are spent liquid organic solvents, highly flammable liquids, and vat sediments left after regeneration of solvents; 5 percent are wastes from paint and varnish production; and 21 percent are other toxic wastes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="87"> The problems of ecological improvement of the sector's production and creation of new resource-saving low-waste technologies and equipment have not yet become basic and binding.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="88"> It should be noted, however, that the sector's institutes are definitely working in this direction.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="89"> The development and introduction into the sector of fluxless melting of magnesium alloys and mechanization of their casting by using vacuum furnaces with a gas shield have made it possible to significantly reduce protection of the air medium and reduce the toxicity of wastes (slags).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="90"> Also noteworthy from the standpoint of protection of the air medium and reduction of the toxicity of production wastes (slags) is the development of a process and equipment for vacuum preparation (degassing) of aluminum alloys instead of the process of refining them in layers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="91"> The process has been introduced on a wide scale at aviation industry enterprises and in other sectors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="92"> Work to replace graphite during the shaped casting of titanium alloys by artificial corundum by using titanium powder obtained from titanium wastes as a coating is now under way.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="93"> This will reduce the use of toxic binders (synthetic resins).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="94"> From an ecology standpoint, work to create processes and equipment for progressive automated high-precision methods of casting metals and alloys with complete regeneration, recovery, and neutralization of the wastes generated and to introduce them at sector enterprises should become a priority in foundry work.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="95"> In the past few years, the following ecologically promising low-waste processes and equipment for heat-treating components have been introduced by sector enterprises: ion nitriding of components used in basic production; vacuum nitriding of screws and cylinders made of titanium alloys; and heat treating magnesium alloy castings in ecologically pure media (in a vacuum or sulfur hexafluoride gas).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="96"> This has made it possible to cut emissions of toxic materials by a factor of 2-3.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="97"> In the area of machining, the NIID [expansion not given; Defectology Scientific Research Institute (?)] and sector enterprises have jointly developed and introduced the following low-waste processes and equipment: -- a resource-saving process involving the use of domestic cutting fluids instead of imported ones in the operations of grinding the blanks of components made of difficult-to-machine materials that has simultaneously doubled/tripled the duration of cutting fluid use and permitted effective cleaning of oil residues from the water in spent cutting fluids.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="98"> The cost savings has been in the vicinity of 850,000 rubles; -- an ecologically pure process for applying reinforcing coatings on a cutting tool by the vacuum ion-plasma method that has made it possible to boost a tool's wear resistance by a factor of 5 or 6; -- a process for diamond and artificial diamond grinding of blades that has made it possible to reduce dust by 40 percent; -- a briquetting process based on the use of plastics (glass-filled polyamide) to automate and mechanize the manufacture of blades at a number of the subsector's enterprises instead of toxic and scarce materials (alloys of the Wood's type); -- a process for finishing precision components of fuel-regulating equipment by using honing heads instead of finishing treatment with abrasive pastes that has reduced consumption of abrasives and, consequently, their release into the atmosphere by a factor of 3.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="99"> In the area of installing and testing on-board systems, the following have been developed: -- ecologically pure processing for checking leaktightness based on aqueous solutions of surfactants with color indication instead of the oil-and-whiting method; -- a stand to check the hydraulic characteristics of pneumatic-hydraulic system components by using demineralized water and a stand for comprehensive development of pneumatic-hydraulic systems by using distillate and neural gas (nitrogen) instead of highly toxic working fluids and expensive helium.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="100"> In the area of magnetic testing methods, work to introduce television-magnetic inspection of series-produced components was done in 1990-1992.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="101"> This type of inspection may replace the x-ray and magnetic powder methods for simply shaped components made of magnetic materials and would make it possible to eliminate the use of x-radiation and single-use x-ray films from the inspection operation, as well as eliminate developer and fixative wastes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="102"> In the case of the television-magnetic method, there are no wastes, and the magnetic tape may be used multiple times.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="103"> Completion of the aforesaid projects will make it possible to reduce the release of toxic materials (finely dispersed dust, nitrogen oxides, ozone, etc).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="104"> into the atmosphere, eliminate contamination of the atmosphere and water reservoirs by highly flammable liquids and pollution of the atmosphere by the volatile components of paints and varnishes, improve the sanitary and hygiene conditions of labor, reduce pollution of water sources by petroleum products, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="105"> Despite the definite work conducted by the sector with respect to ecological improvement of production and creation of new low-waste processes, it is, as is evident from the above data, still difficult to call this activity purposive and effective.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="106"> To a certain extent, significant ecological problems arise during aviation operations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="107"> The "greenhouse" gases CO[.sup]2[/], water vapor, and NO[.sub]x[/] nitric oxides form as kerosene burns in an aircraft engine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="108"> Efforts are currently under way to improve combustion chambers to reduce nitrogen oxide wastes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="109"> The only way of significantly reducing or completely eliminating these wastes, however, is to use cryogenic fuel such as liquefied natural gas or liquid hydrogen.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="110"> The development of cryogenic fuel-based aviation will make it possible to eliminate aviation's dependence on diminishing petroleum reserves.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="111"> Development and assimilation of the following processes/equipment are planned as priority directions of ecological improvement over the next few years: -- ecologically pure processes and equipment to wash components and subassemblies with aqueous solutions of commercial detergents instead of gasoline, kerosene, and other health-damaging materials that will simultaneously make it possible to economize fuel and raw material resources; -- a process and equipment for applying powder polymer coatings onto gas turbine engine components in an electrostatic field that will make it possible to eliminate paint solvent vapors and aerosols in the atmosphere; -- systems to evacuate and recover the chloride gas medium used when producing diffusion coatings on gas turbine engine components by the circulation method from the gaseous phase that will result in an ecologically pure technological process; -- a process and equipment for creating ecologically pure technological media for high-temperature soldering of refractory alloys to reduce the formation of fluoride compounds by a factor of 6-8; -- a process and automated chambers for microcomputer-controlled high-energy plasma-torch spraying of coatings to reduce the labor required for the soldering process by 25 percent on average.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="112"> These efforts will make it possible to accomplish the following: reduce emissions of toxic materials (finely dispersed dust, nitrogen oxides, ozone, etc).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="113"> into the atmosphere; eliminate pollution of the atmosphere and water reservoirs; improve the sanitary and hygiene conditions of labor; eliminate pollution of the atmosphere by paint material components; and reduce pollution of water sources by petroleum products.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="114"> The development of science-intensive processes and equipment and their introduction into industry are still far from adequate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="115"> One of the main distinguishing features of science-intensive technologies and production is the fact that they require little raw material and energy (i.e.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="116"> , they are more resource-saving); therefore, the wastes generated when they are used are not great.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="118"> Membrane, ultrasound, laser, plasma, high-speed machining, and progressive casting are among those resource-saving low-waste and science-intensive processes that are especially significant for the sector's production on an ecological plane.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="119"> The sector's lack of a systems approach to solving these problems is another very important reason why the work that is being done with respect to ecological improvement of industry and creation of new types of resource-saving low-waste processes has not been effective enough.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="154"> Today, it is important that the public understand that the solution to economic and ecological problems is not purification equipment, on which enormous funds are spent, but rather no-waste technology and reprocessing of recyclable material resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="155"> When recyclable material resources are reprocessed, environmental pollution is reduced by 40-45 percent versus when primary resources are used, and capital expenditures are 4-5 times lower than the costs of obtaining and processing comparable types of primary resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="165"> The total savings from using recyclable material resources consists of the profit obtained from selling the product made of recyclable material resources, eliminating their removal and burial costs, reducing transport costs, freeing ground occupied by dumps and disposal sites, and reducing expenditures on environmental protection.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43040" num="166"> Socio-economic criteria that give consideration to both the effect of producing a product and the social results of preventing the release of toxic materials into the environment must be used when estimating the savings resulting from using recyclable material resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="21"> Matyushin, candidate of technical sciences, NIID [expansion not given]; boldface as published in source text; UDC 502.7] [Text] Under the conditions of continuous intensification of production, the problem of environmental protection and rational use of natural resources is becoming increasingly socially and economically significant.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="22"> Included among the matters classified under this problem are the following: pollution of the water and air by toxic industrial wastes, toxic chemicals, and radioactive materials; prevention of harmful consequences of the use of pesticides to fight pests and diseases in agriculture and forestry; soil erosion and recultivation; further development of the legal bases of environmental protection; and economic assessment of natural resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="23"> The development of production, scientific and engineering progress, and expansion of human industrial activity must not destroy the harmony that has been established in nature or destroy natural resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="24"> There are no wastes in nature: All biological, chemical, and physical processes occur in a closed circle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="25"> All industrial enterprises affect the environment to some degree or other.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="26"> Research has shown that at least one third of all processible raw material is now transformed into finished products.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="27"> Consequently, the remaining fraction of raw materials becomes wastes that are often harmful to the environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="28"> In the past decade, the volume of industrial wastes released into the atmosphere in conjunction with the rapid increase in industrial development has increased sharply and continues to increase.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="29"> Each year, industrial enterprises, thermal electric power plants, motor vehicles, blast furnaces, aircraft engines, and other machines release hundreds of millions of tons of carbon in the form of oxides, primarily carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="30"> The carbon dioxide released by humans and the animal world is absorbed by plant life to provide a stable state of equilibrium in the atmosphere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="31"> Unfortunately, this equilibrium has now been upset, and the alarm of ecological catastrophe is sounding louder with each passing year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="32"> The continuing increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is an especially negative phenomenon.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="33"> Carbon dioxide is known to be toxic in large quantities: It causes hypoxia and debilitated respiration and cardiac activity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="34"> An increase in carbon dioxide concentration not only has a direct effect on organisms but also facilitates an increase in absorption of the earth's thermal radiation by the atmosphere, which in turn results in climate warming throughout the entire planet.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="35"> As is known, in the past 100 years, the average temperature of the earth's surface increased by 0.5-0.6Î, which has in turn accelerated glacial thawing and increased the sea's level by 1.5-2 m.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="36"> Also released along with carbon dioxide during the combustion process is carbon monoxide, which has an even more toxic effect and which may result in debilitation of many vital functions, including illness of the central nervous system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="37"> Metallurgy plants and thermal power plants release a large amount of sulfur dioxide.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="38"> Fossil fuels also contain a great deal of sulfur.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="39"> Each year, about 30 million tons of sulfurous gas are released in our country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="40"> When sulfur dioxide reacts with atmospheric moisture, sulfurous and sulfuric acids form.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="41"> When nitrogen-containing coal and oil are burned, oxides are formed that combine with atmospheric moisture to yield nitrous and nitric acids.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="42"> These acids may cause serious lung diseases.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="43"> Ecological and sanitary and hygiene estimates are formulated on the basis of data about emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="45"> Toxic impurities that end up in the air are returned to the earth in the form of precipitation falling on pastures, meadows, fields, gardens, and vegetable gardens.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="46"> Polluted precipitation also falls into water reservoirs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="49"> Precipitation is not the only source of water pollution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="50"> Industrial, transport, and household wastes are dumped into water reservoirs in quantities such that many rivers and lakes can no longer be cleaned with existing resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="51"> The natural purity of relatively shallow ground waters has been lost.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="52"> Phosphates from wastes, the nitrates that are used everywhere as fertilizers, and other toxic materials have infiltrated them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="53"> The situation regarding irrigation water is no better.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="54"> Its chemical composition largely dictates the quality of agricultural projects, in which the content of nitrates, phosphates, and metals has also risen.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="55"> Countries with a high technological discipline permit the use of relatively small amounts of fertilizer.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="56"> In countries with a lower technological discipline, the level is higher owing to an attempt to increase crop yields.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="57"> As a rule, this results in a decline in product quality.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="58"> And so, the circle has closed: People harm the environment, the environment shortens their life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="59"> The child mortality rate in many countries has stopped decreasing, and in several countries it has even begun to increase.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="60"> Studies conducted by the World Health Organization gave the sad results: An elevated lead content was discovered in the blood of 30 percent of neonates.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="62"> Reason suggests that, as soon as possible, further destruction of nature must be halted, it must be restored on a planetwide scale, and population control must be begun so as not to extend beyond the scope of the biosphere's objective capabilities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="63"> Understanding of the fact that people's lives truly depend on their effect on nature has not yet become widespread.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="64"> It must be acknowledged that more than a few measures to regulate man's relationship with nature have been developed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="65"> In the developed countries, where the economy is subject to market relationships, energy-saving technologies are being developed intensively.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="66"> This is making it possible to burn less fuel and, consequently, reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="67"> The manufacture of lead-free gasoline has begun, and exhaust gases have begun to contain far less toxic impurities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="68"> Today, the search for ways of solving ecological problems is being conducted at the international, state, and sector levels.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="69"> Many countries regularly exchange information about the current condition of the environment and are creating a common ecological data bank.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="70"> Unfortunately, our country has not yet become sufficiently actively engaged in this process.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="71"> And the situation in our country cannot be called good.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="72"> According to existing data, about 30 million of our citizens are living in ecological disaster areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="73"> Life itself is compelling us to consider the problems of restoring and protecting nature as priority problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="74"> Quality sewage treatment is not provided in 600 cities, more than two thirds of toxic sources do not meet the requirements specified in standards.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="75"> Volumes of unutilizable toxic industrial wastes are increasing, and a large portion of them are transported to household waste dumps or else to disorganized storage sites, which eventually results in toxic materials ending up in underground waters and water reservoirs and in infection of the plant and animal world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="76"> Unfortunately, the aviation industry, whose technical policy has long failed to recognize ecology as a priority directly, is a definite contributor to these negative consequences of economic activity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="77"> Each year, about 290,000 tons of toxic materials in the form of gases released from stationary sources are formed throughout the sector as a whole.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="78"> From them, dust- and gas-scrubbing units trap 136,500 tons of toxic materials (47.1 percent), and 153,700 tonnes, i.e., about 0.25 percent of the total volume of wastes throughout the country, are released into the atmosphere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="79"> Considering the fact that the sector's enterprises are located in cities with an industrially developed potential, where tough standards are in effect, and also, as a rule, in densely populated complexes of apartment buildings, the negative effect of the sector's production on the environment is not always adequately reflected by the volumes of emissions of toxic materials.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="80"> In the total mass of emissions, the greatest volume percentage of pollutants comes from boiler and other thermal power plants (36-40 percent), foundry work (15-18 percent), painting (14-15 percent), and engine ground tests (14-15 percent).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="81"> The sector's production is characterized by a long list of wastes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="82"> And although solid particles and hydrocarbons predominate in the composition of toxic materials generated (they account for 74.6 and 13 percent respectively), individual enterprises release up to 70 different toxic elements and compounds into the air medium.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="83"> Each year, about 3,800,000 tons of ash, slag, spend molding and core mixtures, sediments in cleaning equipment, and other wastes are generated at the sector's enterprises.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="84"> Of that amount, 800,000 tons is toxic.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="85"> Hundreds of thousands of tons of abrasive dust containing cobalt, niobium, molybdenum, tungsten, chromium, nickel, vanadium, and other metals that are needed for industry but are nevertheless harmful to the environment are released each year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="86"> According to data from a 1992 inventory of sector enterprises throughout Moscow, the total volume of toxic wastes generated consists of the following: 33 percent are wastes of galvanic and other types of chemical treatment; 17 percent are petroleum products (oils, cutting fluids, and storm sewer slimes); 12 percent are wastes containing highly toxic heavy metals (dusts, slags, slimes); 8 percent are spent liquid organic solvents, highly flammable liquids, and vat sediments left after regeneration of solvents; 5 percent are wastes from paint and varnish production; and 21 percent are other toxic wastes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="87"> The problems of ecological improvement of the sector's production and creation of new resource-saving low-waste technologies and equipment have not yet become basic and binding.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="88"> It should be noted, however, that the sector's institutes are definitely working in this direction.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="89"> The development and introduction into the sector of fluxless melting of magnesium alloys and mechanization of their casting by using vacuum furnaces with a gas shield have made it possible to significantly reduce protection of the air medium and reduce the toxicity of wastes (slags).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="90"> Also noteworthy from the standpoint of protection of the air medium and reduction of the toxicity of production wastes (slags) is the development of a process and equipment for vacuum preparation (degassing) of aluminum alloys instead of the process of refining them in layers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="91"> The process has been introduced on a wide scale at aviation industry enterprises and in other sectors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="92"> Work to replace graphite during the shaped casting of titanium alloys by artificial corundum by using titanium powder obtained from titanium wastes as a coating is now under way.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="93"> This will reduce the use of toxic binders (synthetic resins).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="94"> From an ecology standpoint, work to create processes and equipment for progressive automated high-precision methods of casting metals and alloys with complete regeneration, recovery, and neutralization of the wastes generated and to introduce them at sector enterprises should become a priority in foundry work.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="95"> In the past few years, the following ecologically promising low-waste processes and equipment for heat-treating components have been introduced by sector enterprises: ion nitriding of components used in basic production; vacuum nitriding of screws and cylinders made of titanium alloys; and heat treating magnesium alloy castings in ecologically pure media (in a vacuum or sulfur hexafluoride gas).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="96"> This has made it possible to cut emissions of toxic materials by a factor of 2-3.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="97"> In the area of machining, the NIID [expansion not given; Defectology Scientific Research Institute (?)] and sector enterprises have jointly developed and introduced the following low-waste processes and equipment: -- a resource-saving process involving the use of domestic cutting fluids instead of imported ones in the operations of grinding the blanks of components made of difficult-to-machine materials that has simultaneously doubled/tripled the duration of cutting fluid use and permitted effective cleaning of oil residues from the water in spent cutting fluids.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="98"> The cost savings has been in the vicinity of 850,000 rubles; -- an ecologically pure process for applying reinforcing coatings on a cutting tool by the vacuum ion-plasma method that has made it possible to boost a tool's wear resistance by a factor of 5 or 6; -- a process for diamond and artificial diamond grinding of blades that has made it possible to reduce dust by 40 percent; -- a briquetting process based on the use of plastics (glass-filled polyamide) to automate and mechanize the manufacture of blades at a number of the subsector's enterprises instead of toxic and scarce materials (alloys of the Wood's type); -- a process for finishing precision components of fuel-regulating equipment by using honing heads instead of finishing treatment with abrasive pastes that has reduced consumption of abrasives and, consequently, their release into the atmosphere by a factor of 3.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="99"> In the area of installing and testing on-board systems, the following have been developed: -- ecologically pure processing for checking leaktightness based on aqueous solutions of surfactants with color indication instead of the oil-and-whiting method; -- a stand to check the hydraulic characteristics of pneumatic-hydraulic system components by using demineralized water and a stand for comprehensive development of pneumatic-hydraulic systems by using distillate and neural gas (nitrogen) instead of highly toxic working fluids and expensive helium.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="100"> In the area of magnetic testing methods, work to introduce television-magnetic inspection of series-produced components was done in 1990-1992.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="101"> This type of inspection may replace the x-ray and magnetic powder methods for simply shaped components made of magnetic materials and would make it possible to eliminate the use of x-radiation and single-use x-ray films from the inspection operation, as well as eliminate developer and fixative wastes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="102"> In the case of the television-magnetic method, there are no wastes, and the magnetic tape may be used multiple times.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="103"> Completion of the aforesaid projects will make it possible to reduce the release of toxic materials (finely dispersed dust, nitrogen oxides, ozone, etc).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="104"> into the atmosphere, eliminate contamination of the atmosphere and water reservoirs by highly flammable liquids and pollution of the atmosphere by the volatile components of paints and varnishes, improve the sanitary and hygiene conditions of labor, reduce pollution of water sources by petroleum products, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="105"> Despite the definite work conducted by the sector with respect to ecological improvement of production and creation of new low-waste processes, it is, as is evident from the above data, still difficult to call this activity purposive and effective.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="106"> To a certain extent, significant ecological problems arise during aviation operations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="107"> The "greenhouse" gases CO[.sup]2[/], water vapor, and NO[.sub]x[/] nitric oxides form as kerosene burns in an aircraft engine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="108"> Efforts are currently under way to improve combustion chambers to reduce nitrogen oxide wastes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="109"> The only way of significantly reducing or completely eliminating these wastes, however, is to use cryogenic fuel such as liquefied natural gas or liquid hydrogen.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="110"> The development of cryogenic fuel-based aviation will make it possible to eliminate aviation's dependence on diminishing petroleum reserves.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="111"> Development and assimilation of the following processes/equipment are planned as priority directions of ecological improvement over the next few years: -- ecologically pure processes and equipment to wash components and subassemblies with aqueous solutions of commercial detergents instead of gasoline, kerosene, and other health-damaging materials that will simultaneously make it possible to economize fuel and raw material resources; -- a process and equipment for applying powder polymer coatings onto gas turbine engine components in an electrostatic field that will make it possible to eliminate paint solvent vapors and aerosols in the atmosphere; -- systems to evacuate and recover the chloride gas medium used when producing diffusion coatings on gas turbine engine components by the circulation method from the gaseous phase that will result in an ecologically pure technological process; -- a process and equipment for creating ecologically pure technological media for high-temperature soldering of refractory alloys to reduce the formation of fluoride compounds by a factor of 6-8; -- a process and automated chambers for microcomputer-controlled high-energy plasma-torch spraying of coatings to reduce the labor required for the soldering process by 25 percent on average.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="112"> These efforts will make it possible to accomplish the following: reduce emissions of toxic materials (finely dispersed dust, nitrogen oxides, ozone, etc).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="113"> into the atmosphere; eliminate pollution of the atmosphere and water reservoirs; improve the sanitary and hygiene conditions of labor; eliminate pollution of the atmosphere by paint material components; and reduce pollution of water sources by petroleum products.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="114"> The development of science-intensive processes and equipment and their introduction into industry are still far from adequate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="115"> One of the main distinguishing features of science-intensive technologies and production is the fact that they require little raw material and energy (i.e.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="116"> , they are more resource-saving); therefore, the wastes generated when they are used are not great.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="117"> Water consumption in these processes is also much lower than in conventional industrial processes, which ultimately reduces the amount of contaminated sewage.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="118"> Membrane, ultrasound, laser, plasma, high-speed machining, and progressive casting are among those resource-saving low-waste and science-intensive processes that are especially significant for the sector's production on an ecological plane.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="119"> The sector's lack of a systems approach to solving these problems is another very important reason why the work that is being done with respect to ecological improvement of industry and creation of new types of resource-saving low-waste processes has not been effective enough.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="120"> According to the standard international classification system, the aviation sector is among the 10 most science-intensive sectors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="121"> It is understood that the task of switching the industry over to science-intensive low-waste processes in the present period under the conditions of the systems of economic relationships that have developed in the sector, where the business agreement with enterprises has by and large become the main source of financing R\|[amp ]\|D, is rather difficult.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="122"> One of the main priority tasks related to organizing a systems approach is that of developing a special integrated environmental protection program.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="123"> The foundation of this program consists of measures geared toward ecological improvement of the sector's existing production and creation of new resource-saving low-waste processes with mandatory expert examination in all stages of development, introduction, and dissemination for the purpose of clarifying their ecological feasibility.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="124"> The technological measures planned by the sector should be based on priority directions, including those in the field of ecological improvement of the sector's production as determined first and foremost by the list of enterprises, types of production and processes, and materials with the biggest negative effect on the environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="125"> The technology section of the sector's integrated ecology program must contain a number of subprograms in different directions of environmental protection activity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="126"> Specifically, each subsector must have a separate program of operations to create a process and equipment for regenerating, recovering, and neutralizing production and consumption wastes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="127"> Expert ecological examination must be given a great deal of attention as a tool that makes it possible to make a scientifically well founded decision regarding the need to develop new technologies, as well as the need to replace and further develop ecologically imperfect technological processes, equipment, and materials that are in use.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="128"> In addition, it is necessary to have a system that makes it possible to conduct expert evaluations and prevent possible negative ecological and economic consequences of the effect of the sector's production on the environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="129"> What is needed most on this plane is coordination of the efforts of sector institutes in accordance with their specialization as a part of the methodological, standards and related reference information, and technical-organizational support of such an expert evaluation, which should be mandatory for all associations and enterprises.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="130"> The expert evaluation should be based on a comprehensive study of the effect on the environment in several directions, i.e., the effect on the air in the work zone's atmosphere, water consumption, generation of solid waste, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="131"> The sector's institutes now have the materials required to conduct expert evaluations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="132"> For example, they now have the following: normative-reference material related to determining indicators for an ecological-economic evaluation of the sector's manufacturing facilities from the standpoint of contamination of all industrial sewage; normative-reference material related to the basic manufacturing processes and allocation of water with consideration for its quality; a method of calculating the quantitative characteristics of emissions of toxic materials into the atmosphere from the basic types of manufacturing equipment at the sector's enterprises; a normative-methodological list of indicators of emissions of materials that pollute the atmosphere and civil aviation motors for use in ecological evaluations and forecasts; and sector methodological guidelines regarding calculating toxic emissions form aircraft engines.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="135"> The training of engineering personnel both in institutes and in enterprises for the purpose of providing them with the required body of modern ecological knowledge acquires great importance in this respect.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="150"> Reducing the volume of industrial wastes and making rational use of them reduces the size of dumps and the costs of maintaining them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="151"> About 2 million hectares of land in our country are currently used as dumps.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="152"> The dumps become full in an average of 4-5 years, after which new dump sites must be found.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="153"> The territory occupied by dumps can only be recovery after 10-20 years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="154"> The area of land withdrawn from circulation is therefore constantly increasing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="155"> Today, it is important that the public understand that the solution to economic and ecological problems is not purification equipment, on which enormous funds are spent, but rather no-waste technology and reprocessing of recyclable material resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="156"> When recyclable material resources are reprocessed, environmental pollution is reduced by 40-45 percent versus when primary resources are used, and capital expenditures are 4-5 times lower than the costs of obtaining and processing comparable types of primary resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="157"> Obtaining 1 ton steel from scrap metal, for example, requires 80 percent less energy than the entire cycle to produce steel from iron ore does.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="160"> Using waste paper when manufacturing paper makes it possible to reduce air pollution by 46 percent and water pollution by 25-45 percent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="161"> When assessing the feasibility of investing large amounts of funds in the creation of some new facilities to produce different types of products, it is thus necessary to bear in mind that in most cases it is much more advantageous from both economic and ecological standpoints to spend funds to improve existing production processes through more in-depth processing of raw material.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="162"> In such cases, the amount of additional product may be produced in much shorter time periods and at a lower cost.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="163"> In addition, toxic emissions into the environment are significantly reduced.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="164"> It should be noted that the existing methods of estimating the use of production wastes and their demand only consider the savings from selling the additional product obtained.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="165"> The scales of the true effect of introducing a recovery process are depressed because the reduction of economic damage due to environmental pollution is not considered.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="166"> The total savings from using recyclable material resources consists of the profit obtained from selling the product made of recyclable material resources, eliminating their removal and burial costs, reducing transport costs, freeing ground occupied by dumps and disposal sites, and reducing expenditures on environmental protection.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="167"> Socio-economic criteria that give consideration to both the effect of producing a product and the social results of preventing the release of toxic materials into the environment must be used when estimating the savings resulting from using recyclable material resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="168"> Extraction and processing of materials for use in the very same production processes for the second and, in some cases, the third time is the main direction in making use of industrial wastes abroad.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="169"> The membrane process and ion-exchange method have gained the greatest popularity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="171"> For effluent with a low salt content, an ion-exchange filter is used.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="172"> After that, the purified and desalinated (up to 90 percent) water is returned to the unit for electrochemical treatment, and the concentrate is subjected to additional treatment either for regeneration and reuse or else for neutralization.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="206"> Titanium-containing slimes, which amount to 947 tons a year, are particularly valuable.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="207"> It should be noted that the processing sectors of industry, for example, the paint-and-varnish and construction sectors, are not especially interested in this quantity of slime.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="208"> The principles of no-waste technology require that these wastes be included in technological chains, however.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="209"> The NIID has conducted an information search and identified 20 technologies in which recyclable material resources containing titanium slimes may be used.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="210"> The MMPO imeni Chernyshev [expansion not given] and Nitrogen Industry Institute have, for example, developed a process for using titanium slimes to prepare Claus oxide catalyst to replace imported catalyst in sulfur production.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="224"> The economic impact of the introduction of these sections has been about 180,000 rubles at each enterprise.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="225"> A technology for reprocessing wastes from grinding and pointing cutting tools made of high-speed steel is being developed at the institute.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="226"> At the present time, between 8 and 12 percent of the high-speed steel used ends up as grinding wastes, and up to 70 percent of the cutting portion of a cutting tool is ground away during resharpening.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="227"> Enterprises transport these wastes to the dump, where iron and heavy metals (tungsten and molybdenum) oxidize and are subsequently leached out into the ground waters.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="231"> Integrated solution of the problem of using recyclable material resources in the national economy will make it possible to significantly boost production efficiency and the degree of environmental protection.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-43002" num="232"> The problem of protecting the environment and using natural resources rationally is thus extremely critical for Russia's current economy and demands the most in-depth attention and active participation on the part of the sector's scientific research institutes, associations, and enterprises.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="6"> MRS Anne Evans was not in a champagne mood yesterday.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="7"> True, the sun was shining on Wolverhampton and she had just completed a 15-month struggle to secure financing for the UK's largest non-fossil fuel electricity generating plant.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="8"> Rather, she was a trifle wan.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="9"> It was all a bit of an anti-climax, said the US businesswoman.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="10"> It had been a close-run thing.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="11"> She told the lawyers in London at 11.20pm on Tuesday that either everybody signed up or she would walk away from the Pounds 49m project, which will use about 20 per cent of the UK's scrap tyres.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="12"> Come what may, she was catching the 11.40pm train to Wolverhampton.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="13"> The agreements were signed.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="14"> But the signatures were obtained about a year later than Mrs Evans had expected.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="15"> In October 1990 she was talking of a Pounds 36m project on the site of an old Wolverhampton iron foundry.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="16"> Now there is Pounds 13m more at stake - and it is that extra sum which caused a year of difficult negotiations and a final five days of tetchy discussions.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="17"> Mrs Evans's company, Performance Services Corporation of Hebron, Connecticut, acts as a consultant on the use of scrap tyres in energy production.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="18"> The Wolverhampton project, whose company name is Elm Energy, stems from the Department of Trade and Industry's desire to be rid of a growing mountain of waste tyres.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="19"> Originally the scheme was to have been financed by Pounds 12m of equity and Pounds 24m of bank borrowings.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="20"> Final financing is Pounds 14.5m equity and Pounds 34.5m of debt.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="21"> So Mrs Evans had to persuade her equity backers to put up more money, and to persuade the banks to lend more.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="22"> The cost escalation came from a number of factors.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="23"> Finding a contractor proved difficult.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="24"> Eventually a consortium of Tarmac of Wolverhampton and Black & Veatch Engineering of Kansas City agreed to take on construction - Tarmac for its building expertise, Black & Veatch for its knowledge of plant mechanics.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="25"> Designers then altered the plans to increase the plant's output.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="26"> This is set at 25MW, to be sold to Midlands Electricity as power for about 25,000 homes.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="27"> Land-reclamation costs rose.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="28"> Applications for a Pounds 2m reclamation grant were accepted by the Department of Environment but rejected by the Treasury.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="29"> As the costs rose so did Mrs Evans's demands on her US partner, Nipsco Development, a subsidiary of the Indiana electricity utility.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="30"> Nipsco had first agreed to put up Pounds 4m.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="31"> The amount grew and at the end of last week the US company threatened to pull out.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="32"> The more Nipsco put up as equity, the more Mrs Evans's stake was diluted.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="33"> She now has 5 per cent, Nipsco 95 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="34"> The banks were cautious.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="35"> In the background was concern about the rapidly changing pattern of environmental regulation, not to speak of more stringent lending policies.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="36"> Mrs Evans said she has a 13-year non-recourse loan at a margin over base rate, but only after the contractors had been tightly screwed down.</s>

<s docid="FT921-5259" num="37"> They have a Pounds 38m fixed-price contract with performance guarantees.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="6"> King Canute would not have approved of the method, but the land reclamation scheme in the southern Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung is sure to be watched with interest by the Netherlands.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="7"> Kaohsiung is reclaiming coastland using non-hazardous industrial waste as fill instead of sand and gravel.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="8"> The project creates much-needed new land - an expensive and highly sought-after commodity in the crowded, heavily industrialised city.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="9"> It also provides a practical way to dispose of materials which were previously dumped offshore.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="10"> The city government plans to reclaim up to 200ha (494 acres) of land by the end of the century.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="11"> Begun in 1989, reclamation of the first 50ha will be completed by the end of this year.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="12"> It will be used to build a public sports park and recreation area.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="13"> Uses for land still to be reclaimed have yet to be decided.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="14"> Kaohsiung's environmental protection bureau conceived the South Star project as a stop-gap measure to prevent further erosion of the shoreline south of the city, but it has since evolved into a more ambitious reclamation project.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="15"> South Star is using slag produced by the state-owned China Steel Corp, fly ash generated by the state power company, Taiwan Power Co, and construction rubble.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="16"> Even the sea walls are made with recycled material - primarily a concrete using slag powder and slag aggregate.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="17"> About 200,000 old tyres will be used to protect them from erosion.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="18"> The project is economical as well as environmentally friendly, according to the environmental protection bureau.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="19"> It says the cost of building the sea walls was half the price it would have been using conventional construction methods.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="20"> The project that most closely resembles the South Star reclamation is the new Kansai airport in Osaka, Japan, says Liu Chia-nan, deputy commissioner of the bureau of environmental protection.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="21"> 'The concept is similar, but compressed garbage was used for fill at Kansai, and now the airport is experiencing problems with subsidence,' Liu says.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="22"> 'However, our method is quite stable because the materials we are using for fill are solid'.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18126" num="23"> Future reclamation projects intend to use other waste material, including ash produced by Kaohsiung's several planned garbage incinerators.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="6"> Mrs Anne Evans knows about dirty industries.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="7"> The US businesswoman and her company, Elm Energy, are about to build a Pounds 50m electricity generating plant in the British Midlands which will burn used rubber tyres - the first of its kind in Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="8"> Not that the plant will besmirch the Midlands environment: it uses the latest clean technology, and has the blessing of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="9"> The UK government also gave it enthusiastic support because of its pioneering nature.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="10"> Mrs Evans's problem was with the banks, from which she was trying to raise Pounds 35m in loans.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="11"> Although they were satisfied about the quality of the technology, they were anxious about the green aspects of the plant.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="12"> Did Mrs Evans have all the right permits, would she be able to dispose of the waste products, and - their greatest worry - was there any danger of land contamination?</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="13"> After more than a year of negotiation, Mrs Evans finally secured the money she needed, but she reckons that environmental issues added greatly to her upfront costs, in lawyers' fees alone.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="14"> 'If banks are worried about contaminated land, they should not be lending in the Midlands,' she says with some impatience.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="15"> 'They should be lending in the middle of the desert'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="16"> Harrisons & Crosfield, the UK chemicals and feedstock company, also knows about financiers' worries.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="17"> Since last August, it has been negotiating a Dollars 120m private placement with a group of US institutions.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="18"> But Harrisons owns 110 chemical sites in the US and the institutions insisted on inspecting each one before they would commit themselves.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="19"> Eventually, Harrisons persuaded them that they need only visit a fraction of that number, and gave them documentation for the rest.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="20"> But the delays and lawyers' fees have added noticeably to the cost.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="21"> 'This is clearly indicative of a trend,' says Mr Bill Turcan, Harrisons' finance director.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="22"> The lenders' fears are twofold.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="23"> One is that a customer could be caught up in an expensive environmental lawsuit which might impair its ability to repay its loan.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="24"> The other is the extent of a bank's own liability for the environmental damage caused by a borrower - a legal grey area which bankers see lawmakers longing to fill to their cost.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="25"> 'We are worried about the uncertainty and the legislation that could come out of the UK and Brussels,' says Mr Humphrey Norrington, deputy chairman of Barclays Bank, one of the two banks involved in the Elm project, the other being Fuji Bank of Japan.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="26"> There has always been a danger that banks will find themselves liable for penalties incurred by a company when they foreclose on it because it cannot pay its debts.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="27"> The act of foreclosure makes them own-ers of the company's property, and responsible for any pollution it has caused.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="28"> More recently, though, there have been suggestions that banks might also be made liable simply by virtue of their lending relationship, regardless of whether or not they foreclose.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="29"> The fear was triggered by a notorious court case two years ago in the US involving a company called Fleet Factors, which set a broad precedent for bank liability for clean-up costs.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="30"> The court ruled that banks must pay if they participate 'in the financial management of a facility to a degree indicating a capacity to influence the corporation's treatment of hazardous wastes'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="31"> A bank did not have to exercise that capacity to be liable.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="32"> The case sent shock waves through the financial community and provoked several attempts - so far unsuccessful - to introduce new legislation into Congress which would define liability much more tightly, or specifically exempt secured lenders.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="33"> The position in the EC is less clear.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="34"> Although several member states have laws defining liability for environmental damage, none has so far created any big problems for banks.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="35"> However, last year the EC Commission produced a draft directive on civil liability for damage caused by waste, which said that 'the producer of waste' would be liable 'irrespective of fault on his part'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="36"> Although it was not clear whether a lending bank would count as 'a producer', the strictness of the proposed liability sent further tremors through bankers' ranks.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="37"> Since then, the Commission appears to have retreated on the proposal.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="38"> Instead, it is preparing a green paper on liability for environmental damage which will address the issue again.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="39"> However, officials say this will be more of an exercise to provoke discussion than an attempt to define precise borders to liability.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="40"> Some UK bankers are not satisfied by this.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="41"> Mrs Hilary Thompson, head of the environmental management unit at National Westminster and a leading lobbyist, says that remarks made by EC officials to her suggest that they intend to take a tough line.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="42"> 'What they forget is that we might stop lending to these people,' she says.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="43"> The irony is that the more a company needs green finance to clean up its act, the less likely it is to get it.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="44"> Mrs Thompson is proposing that secured lenders be exempted from liability provided they exercise due diligence before lending to a company which subsequently causes damage.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="45"> This would probably involve that company carrying out an environmental audit as a condition for a loan.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="46"> British bankers' worries have been noted by the UK government.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="47"> Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, told a recent audience of City financiers: 'There are real concerns in this area which I recognise'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="48"> But he assured them: 'We shall be looking for workable solutions in which we are equally as clear about the effects on business costs as we are about the beneficial effects on the environment'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="49"> What is already clear is that the level of anxiety about these issues is much higher in the Anglo-Saxon world than on the Continent.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="50"> This is partly because of the Fleet Factors case, and the fact that the US and the UK share similar legal traditions.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="51"> In continental Europe, lawyers say, the Napoleonic traditions treat liability more narrowly.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="52"> Also, enforcement of any environmental legislation emanating from Brussels would be a matter for individual countries, so differences in legal traditions could have a significance.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="53"> It is not clear at this point quite how dampening an effect such worries are having on bank lending.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="54"> It has certainly been in the banks' interest to sound the alarm bells to reinforce their case.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="55"> But, though Mrs Evans's experience shows how closely banks are scrutinising sensitive projects, they are still willing to lend to them provided they are well-managed and financially sound.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="56"> The Chemical Industries Association, representing the UK chemical sector, says it is unaware of any significant financing problems among its members.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="57"> But whatever form the EC's legislation ultimately takes, banks will play an increasing role in policing the environment.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="58"> To protect themselves, all the big UK clearing banks have introduced procedures to check out customers' environmental records before advancing a loan, and to keep watch until it is repaid.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="59"> And checks are bound to get tougher.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="60"> 'Lenders become essentially an enforcement agency,' says Mr Steve Jones, a lawyer with Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue of Washington which specialises in environmental issues.</s>

<s docid="FT921-667" num="61"> 'Almost all US property now goes through a site assessment, and I would be surprised if a similar process did not evolve in Europe.'</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="412"> In fiscal year 1994 NEDO is scheduled to begin development of a 1,000-kilowatt power plant based on MCFC technology (KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 9 Sep 93).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="413"> NEDO recently claimed a world-record 129 kilowatts of electric power generated using a stack of 102 MCFC cells with electrode areas of 1 square meter (see PERSPECTIVES Vol.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="414"> 8 No. 11, 30 Nov 93).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="415"> At the same time, NEDO tested a normal-pressure internal-reformer-type cell stack with electrode areas of 0.5 square meters in which natural gas can be used; this stack generated 33 kilowatts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="416"> NEDO has also operated a 5-kilowatt internal-reformer-type cell stack for more than 10,000 continuous hours with a voltage drop of 0.5 percent per 1,000 hours (Tokyo NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="417"> MITI's AIST and its MCFC Power Generation System Technology Consortium have succeeded in putting MCFCs to practical use.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="418"> The consortium includes equipment manufacturers and utility companies (see table).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="419"> A 100-kilowatt MCFC plant located at the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry's Akagi Experimental Center in Gunma Prefecture achieved 0.8 volt per square centimeter of electrode area and 150 milliamperes of current for 1,000 hours of operation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="420"> Even then, electric output dropped by a little over 1 percent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="421"> The Consortium was to begin drafting a design for the world's first 1,O0O-kilowatt experimental plant by the end of 1993.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="422"> The electricity generated is expected to cost 14 to 15 yen (about 13 cents) per kilowatt and power generation efficiency should reach 54 percent, with an overall energy efficiency of 76 percent--figures that are thought to be commercially viable (NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN 8 Nov 93).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="423"> Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have a power generation efficiency of 60 percent, about 1.5 times that of large thermal power plants.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="424"> Not only do they emit almost no NOx, but exhaust heat temperature is high, making them ideal for cogeneration systems in urban areas (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 24 Dec 93).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="425"> Basic research and development of S0FCs started in fiscal year 1989 and was aimed at developing a flat-plate cell stack capable of generating more than 10 kilowatts by fiscal year 1997.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="426"> A 500-watt stack is now being developed using cells with an electrode area of 200 square centimeters (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="427"> Osaka Gas Company is working toward producing a 5-kilowatt cell module prototype in 1995.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="428"> According to NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN (14 Dec 93), Chubu Electric Power Company and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries have claimed a record in generating power continuously for 7,000 hours using two stacks of 7.5- x 7.5-centimeter advanced SOFCs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="429"> These cells feature monolithic layers of electrolyte, fuel electrode (cathode), and air electrode (anode).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="430"> This reduces the surface area of electrodes coming into contact with one another by half, thereby decreasing the drop in power output to 1/10 that of conventional SOFCs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="431"> Each cell has a projected electrode area of 25 square centimeters, resulting in a 0.5-watt output density--three times that of conventional SOFCs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="432"> Meanwhile Toho Gas Company has claimed a world record for output density, achieving 1.61 watts per square centimeter for a single cell test-produced for a flat-plate SOFC stack (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 27 Dec 93).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="433"> Initial research for solid polymer fuel cells, or proton exchange membranes, under way since fiscal year 1992, is aimed at development of 1-kilowatt cell technology by fiscal year 1995.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="434"> At present a 200- watt stack of cells with electrode areas of 100 square centimeters is being developed (NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN 29 Sep 93).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="435"> For fuel cells to be commercially viable, both longevity and performance must meet certain standards.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="436"> In December 1993, a report on the prospects for clean energy by the Advisory Committee on Energy and ANRE's Electricity Utility Industry Council estimated a fuel-cell-generated power supply of 160,000 kilowatts in the year 2000.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="437"> This figure was in sharp contrast to a June 1990 estimate of 1.2 million kilowatts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="438"> According to ANRE, the 1990 estimate badly misjudged the technical difficulty of dealing with cell longevity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-24648" num="439"> The objective was a life of 40,000 hours (five years) for a cell stack and reformer catalyst, but the best achieved so far is 15,000 hours of operation at 0.08 watt per square centimeter in 1987 (KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO 6, 13 Dec 93).</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA040890-0156" num="10"> As a result, Malaysia's supply of coconuts far outstripped demand, forcing the government to fork out more than $5 million each year in production subsidies as Malaysian men, young and old, anxious to preserve their virility, shunned the drink.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA040890-0156" num="18"> Since taking over the Agriculture Ministry in 1986, he has carried that maxim to hilarious limits sometimes, hatching schemes that have drawn both laughter and skepticism from other Cabinet ministers and Malaysians at large.</s>
