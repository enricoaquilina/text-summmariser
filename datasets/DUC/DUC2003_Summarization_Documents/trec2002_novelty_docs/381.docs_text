<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="18"> When it comes to hip hangouts these days, those seeking a non-alcoholic, low-cal watering hole are heading to the Elixir Bar in Venice.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="19"> Restaurants are too pricey, cafes too intoxicating; and juice bars are downright passe.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="20"> At the varnished aspen bar, surrounded by antique wooden herb chests, people munch Taoist Journey Trail Mix and sip Chinese herbal cocktails made by mixing ginseng, licorice root and other exotic herbs with cold sparkling water.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="23"> Teeguarden, a Chinese herbalist who studied with a Taoist master, came up with the idea for the Elixir Bar while visiting Tokyo 10 years ago.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="24"> "There were street corner stands all over the city where you can buy Chinese herbal extracts in glass vials," Teeguarden explains.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="25"> "People sip them while walking down the street or riding on subways as a health supplement".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="26"> Although Western medicine downplays the impact of Chinese herbs, they have been used in China to enhance health and promote longevity for at least 3,000 years.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="27"> "While these herbal formulas don't cure disease," says Teeguarden, who cautions he isn't a doctor and he doesn't prescribe medicine, "they do help promote what the Taoists call 'radiant health'. "</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="35"> "Chinese herbs seem to attract creative, adventurous people who are interested in health without being fanatics".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="36"> "Over the years," says the lawyer, who comes by almost every day for take-home elixirs, "I've found that taking these oral liquids is more effective in preventing colds and other illnesses than the acupuncture and chiropractic treatments I used to get.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="40"> Since they opened in February 1988, Cynthia Teeguarden noticed that a high percentage of customers are either in Alcoholics Anonymous or trying to cut out cigarettes, coffee or marijuana.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="41"> "I used to smoke while I worked," says Thygesen, "but after taking Chinese herbs and elixirs for a few months, I don't crave the stimulation of cigarettes".</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="42"> She doesn't feel like drinking alcohol any more either.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="43"> "Besides this is the nicest bar you could ever go to".</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="44"> But the Elixir Bar also serves restorative drinks to those in the throes of a hangover or reeling from too much rich food.</s>

<s docid="LA090189-0086" num="45"> "We make a special cocktail for hangovers with angelica, trichosanthis (which is used in the new AIDS drug, Compound Q), chrysanthemum, magnolia and a splash of deer antler to get the mind going again," says Teeguarden.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="13"> WHEN YOU'RE healthy, things like faith healing or visualization therapy can seem flaky or at least ineffectual.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="14"> But to a person stricken with a life-threatening illness, even the most far-fetched herbal diet or psychological regimen can offer a flicker of hope.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="15"> Just recently, one of us faced a patient with AIDS who, frustrated with his failing health, had begun seeking alternative treatments.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="16"> He discovered a faith healer who promised a complete cure.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="17"> The healer told the artist he must stop taking his medicine (eight prescriptions) as a demonstration of his true belief in the spiritual process.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="18"> Obviously, we advised him not to do that, but after talking to several people who claimed to have been cured by the healer, the patient abandoned his medications and our advice.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="19"> Instead, he took herbal remedies to cleanse his system and attended group meditations and individual sessions with the healer.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="20"> For several weeks, he was enthusiastic; he said he felt healthy and energetic and, for the first time in years, had hope.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="21"> Then he became ill; five weeks later he died of a stomach infection, which his original medicines could have prevented.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="22"> That didn't have to happen.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="23"> Alternative healing and conventional medicine are not -- indeed, should not be -- mutually exclusive.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="24"> Traditionally, conventional doctors have been suspicious of unlicensed healers (and vice versa), but that is changing.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="25"> We are beginning to recognize that one form of treatment may not be enough and that doctors should avoid putting patients in an either/or position.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="26"> People turn to nontraditional forms of healing because they are "disillusioned with conventional medicine and searching for hope that is not available from conventional doctors," says Norman Cousins, author of best-selling books on self-care.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="27"> It is not surprising that, in general, the more serious the illness, the greater the likelihood that a person will seek alternative treatments.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="28"> Cancer is the most striking example; Americans spend about $4 billion each year on alternative cancer "cures," many of which have no clear scientific basis.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="29"> These treatments range from those that are potentially dangerous, such as Laetrile, to those that are not well-studied, such as imagery techniques and massage therapies, to those that are accepted as effective, such as acupuncture.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="30"> People seek alternative methods because they give a feeling of control.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="31"> Life-threatening illnesses such as cancer leave patients feeling helpless; they can't even make their own bodies do what they want.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="32"> Radiation therapy, surgery and chemotherapy, administered by the doctor to the patient, do nothing to restore that sense of control; the patient can only endure and wait to find out if they've worked.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="33"> But with illnesses such as heart disease, people can help themselves significantly by giving up smoking or changing their diet or getting more exercise.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="34"> Alternative treatments for cancer and AIDS give patients the same sense of power, the same hope that they can have an impact on the illness.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="35"> That's exactly what the faith healer told the artist who had AIDS: If he trained his mind carefully, he could beat the disease.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="36"> But the healer refused to acknowledge the additional necessity of conventional medication.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="37"> (In fact, he refused to return numerous phone calls from the patient's doctor or the clinic social worker, which should have been a clear warning sign).</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="38"> Studies of cancer patients show that most people use alternative treatments in conjunction with conventional ones.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="39"> And according to research done by Dr.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="40"> Barrie Cassileth at the University of Pennsylvania, faith healing is a very common form of alternative treatment; diet and vitamin therapies are even more popular.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="41"> One of the biggest attractions of alternative treatments, according to Cassileth and others, is the attention patients receive.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="42"> Alternative healers, some of whom are MDs, favor a holistic approach and spend more time listening to a patient's concerns.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="43"> Conventional medicine is usually aimed at disease, defined as a physiologic malfunction of the body.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="44"> Healers, on the other hand, treat the ramifications of illness, which, according to medical anthropologists, include a person's religious, cultural and psychological reactions to disease.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="45"> "Currently in medicine," Cousins says, "everything is technology, testing and procedures.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="46"> Instead of listening with their ears, doctors spend too much time listening with their stethoscopes".</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="47"> Leaders in the treatment of cancer and AIDS agree.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="48"> Recent medical journals are full of articles urging doctors to listen to all of their patients' concerns and to try to understand the many ways in which the patients are affected by disease.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="49"> Many doctors remain concerned that those who bill themselves as alternative practitioners may, in reality, be quacks preying on the fears and vulnerability of the seriously or terminally ill.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="50"> Doctors are obligated to caution their patients that "treatments marketed as alternatives don't meet the standards of safety and effectiveness set by the Food and Drug Administration," says William Jarvis, a health-education teacher at Loma Linda University.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="51"> Jarvis, who heads a consumer group called the National Council Against Health Fraud, believes that many alternative-therapy success stories are unsubstantiated and untrue.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="52"> He recently interviewed 150 cancer patients in California allegedly cured by alternative practitioners; none had actually been cured.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="53"> Jarvis' organization has become particularly wary of the many alternative treatments offered to patients with AIDS.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="54"> We advise people considering unorthodox treatments to be careful when selecting an unproven remedy and open-minded about the possibility of combining traditional and nontraditional forms of healing.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="55"> Research a treatment thoroughly and check out the attitudes of your alternative practitioner.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="56"> Be suspicious if she or he is unwilling to speak with your regular doctor.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="57"> Likewise, if your medical doctor refuses to consider supplementing your program with alternative treatments, you can probably find another with a more open mind.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="58"> That's very important, because you should be able to discuss with your doctor whatever treatments you use or want.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="59"> Unproven remedies can have harmful side effects, just as traditional medicines can, so it's crucial to keep the lines of communication open; if you have questions or concerns, you should be able to simply call and ask.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="60"> And use common sense.</s>

<s docid="LA082690-0003" num="61"> If an unproven remedy is outrageously expensive or seems at all dangerous, it might end up doing more harm than good.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="6"> Anyone who suffers frequently from a bad back - and that includes one in four Britons, according to a recent study - knows all too well that science has not been very good at controlling pain.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="7"> But scientists are catching up.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="8"> It has long been believed that pain is the body's alarm signal to prevent further damage (such as to a finger on a hot stove).</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="9"> But why then do we feel chronic pain, long after the body could take avoiding action?</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="10"> Recent research suggests an answer.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="11"> The main point is that signals about damage do not always pass straight into the part of the brain that experiences pain.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="12"> The signals can be blocked or amplified by switches in the spinal cord.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="13"> And signals that have nothing to do with damage can be switched into the alarm system so that they cause pain.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="14"> Scientists are now trying to understand how to manipulate the switches so that pain can be controlled.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="15"> Acute pain after an external stimulus is still best thought of as a damage warning.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="16"> Specialised nerve cells in all parts of the body activated by stimuli, such as from a cut or a burn, send signals into central pathways of the brain and nervous system where electrical activity causes the sensation of pain.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="17"> The brain works out where the pain has come from by knowing which part of the pathway is stimulated.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="18"> For example, a knock on the 'funny bone' causes pain over a wide area of the hand and arm because it strikes the nerve-carrying signals from this area.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="19"> a Indeed, one of the cornerstones of neural science is the idea that the sensations we experience from a particular stimulus may be different, depending on which pathways in the brain are activated.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="20"> This helps to explain some of the puzzles about the damage-warning theory of pain.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="21"> For example, why does vigorous rubbing of an injury sometimes relieve pain, whereas in other circumstances the lightest touch can be agonising?</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="22"> How can an amputated limb hurt?</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="23"> Why, in chronic pain, does the alarm continue to ring long after it has served its purpose?</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="24"> The answers come from research on the switches that block or redirect pain signals.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="25"> The first suggestion that pain signals could be blocked from entry into the spinal cord came in the mid-1960s.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="26"> It was proposed that they pass through a sort of gate that can be closed by a circuit activated by other sensory signals.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="27"> There is now much support for the gate theory.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="28"> Rubbing the skin relieves pain because it generates sensory signals that activate the circuit that closes the gate.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="29"> Acupuncture and electrical stimulation of the skin work in the same way.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="30"> Morphine's analgesic effects occur because it mimics a chemical that closes the gate.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="31"> The gate can also be closed by signals descending from higher levels of the brain, to block pain if we need to act to avoid something even worse.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="32"> Wounded soldiers can often disregard injuries until they are out of immediate danger.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="33"> A different set of spinal switches amplifies pain.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="34"> Prolonged or intense signals in the damage-sensing neurones have two effects.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="35"> Central pain pathways become more sensitive to their normal inputs so that pain is amplified.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="36"> They also become sensitive to signals caused by touching or moving the skin, so that these, too, cause pain, but no damage.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="37"> This intensification of prolonged pain has doubtless evolved to immobilise any part of the body which has become badly injured.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="38"> So any sensations that result from a disturbance of the injured part (such as a hand or foot) are rerouted into the pain pathway, even when a similar movement would not in other circumstances have caused direct pain.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="39"> The unfortunate consequence is that chronic pain conditions, for example from inflamed nerves, are made worse.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="40"> The pains that may be experienced in an amputated limb and by patients whose spinal cord has been severed (paraplegics) probably also owe much to this mechanism For even when a limb has been amputated its pain pathway in the central nervous system remains and can be activated.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="41"> Paraplegics usually lose all sensation below their spinal injury, but they may be left with severe pain.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="42"> In some cases the spinal pathway carrying pain signals may be intact and other sensory signals may be channelled into it.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="43"> Scientists do not yet understand the details of the mechanism of central sensitisation, but it is the focus of important research in universities and in the pharmaceuticals industry.</s>

<s docid="FT944-14416" num="44"> A drug to reverse its effects - still many years away - would lighten thousands of lives darkened by chronic pain.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="16"> [Text] Cynthia Khan writes us from east Africa.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="17"> She is working with the British medical team in east Africa and wants to know about the AIDS situation in China and how the Chinese Government is dealing with the problem.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="18"> Well, Cynthia, AIDS has become a global problem.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="19"> Since the first case was found in the United States in 1981, the disease has quickly spread throughout the world, killing hundreds of thousands of people, and China is not immune to the spread of AIDS.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="20"> The first HIV-infection case in China was reported in 1985 in the country's eastern province of Zhejiang.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="21"> Four children who had hemophilia contracted the HIV virus because of contaminated blood used in transfusions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="22"> The blood plasma was imported from abroad.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="23"> The Chinese Government banned the import of plasma immediately after that case.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="24"> Additional HIV infections were found among intravenous drug users in the southern border province of Yunnan in 1989.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="25"> Since then, China has identified more than 1,150 cases of HIV carriers, and 19 people have become afflicted with full-blown AIDS.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="26"> At present, 85 percent of those infected with the AIDS virus in China are intravenous drug users.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="27"> The border area with Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia is the most infected area because of its long history of opium trade and drug abuse.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="28"> This area is still backward economically and far from urban areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="29"> Transportation is limited.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="30"> Radio and television sets, which can be used to warn people about the dangers of contracting AIDS, are rare, and medical service is not always available.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="31"> In addition, cultural habits are responsible for some of the infections, as the local Dai and Jingpo ethnic groups believe opium is a cure for headache and diarrhea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="32"> Planting and processing opium is banned by the government, but it is difficult for the small police force in the area to eliminate the illegal practice when the villagers plant opium in very small fields in the dense forests.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="33"> Another problem is the shortage of needles, forcing many of the drug users to share needles.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="34"> This causes the disease to spread even faster.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="35"> The Chinese Government has set up a clinic in Yunnan to monitor AIDS cases and educate the public about the dangers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="36"> But getting the information out is very difficult.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="37"> Zhu Wei is working as a researcher with the AIDS surveillance center under the China Academy of Preventive Medicine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="38"> He has worked with the local teams in Yunnan Province.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="39"> [Begin recording; Zhu Wei is briefly heard, speaking in Mandarin, fading into English translation] The local people know little about disease that is threatening their lives.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="40"> When talking with them, we need interpreters in Dai and Jingpo languages, because these people do not speak Mandarin, and most of them do not know how to read and write.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="41"> The only thing they care about seems to be drugs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="42"> Every year the AIDS surveillance center sends a number of researchers to Yunnan to help with the local work and get firsthand information.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="43"> I went to Yunnan last year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="44"> A lot of local medical workers who know the languages and have knowledge of AIDS went to every family with us, explaining the fatal disease to them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="45"> We put up a poster warning about the danger of AIDS in the villages.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="46"> We paid special attention to the families that already had AIDS patients or HIV carriers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="47"> We talked to the family members on how to protect themselves from being affected.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="48"> And now and then, the local medical workers visit these families to see how things go on.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="49"> [end recording] Though drug users make up the majority of AIDS victims in China, they are not the most dangerous factors of the spreading of AIDS in the country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="50"> Medical experts say the most dangerous factor is promiscuous sexual activity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="51"> For more than three decades after the founding of the PRC, Chinese successfully protected themselves against venereal diseases.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="52"> However, while the opening and reform programs that began in the 1980's have brought prosperity to the country, they have also caused dramatic changes in people's ideas about morality and sex.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="53"> Cases of prostitution are increasingly rapidly every year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="54"> The number of people who have sexual partners outside marriage is increasing, and sexual activity among young people and teenagers is now occurring much earlier.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="55"> The number of venereal disease cases has increased dramatically.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="56"> In 1991, sexually transmission accounted for 10 percent of the total number of HIV cases.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="57"> In 1992 it was 20 percent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="58"> The rate is still growing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="59"> Another high risk group is homosexuals.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="60"> The first five victims in the world were all homosexuals, and in California, United States, 90 percent of HIV infections are found in gays.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="61"> Even though right now only a small fraction of Chinese homosexuals are confirmed HIV carriers, medical carriers warn they are a prime target for the disease [as heard].</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="62"> Influenced by Chinese traditions, most of these people have a normal family, but have unsafe sexual practices outside their family secretly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="63"> They, therefore, risk spreading the disease to their family who may not know there is a homosexual in their family.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="64"> The AIDS problem has caught the attention of the Chinese Government.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="65"> In March 1993, the Ministry of Public Health held a conference on AIDS protection and cure in the city of Haikou in the southern island province of Hainan.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="66"> The conference dealt with AIDS surveillance, management of HIV carriers, HIV test-kits, as well as public education on sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="67"> It was decided at the conference that all donated blood will be screened in the future, and more physicians will be trained in the clinical diagnosis of HIV infections.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="68"> The conference also called on all medical personnel to do more research on AIDS treatment and on developing testing methods which are both effective and inexpensive.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="69"> Qian Chunqiao, an expert on the disease, is also working with AIDS surveillance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="70"> [Begin recording; Zhu Wei is briefly heard, speaking in Mandarin, fading into English translation] The government has allocated quite a number of funds for AIDS prevention and research, but as far as AIDS medicines are concerned, China lags far behind such developed countries as the United States and some European countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="71"> For one thing, we do not have as many funds and specialized medical researchers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="72"> Another thing is that AIDS has a relatively shorter history in China, and we lack experience.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="73"> In recent years, some Chinese researchers have been trying to combine traditional Chinese medicines, such as herbal medicine and acupuncture, with Western methods in treating the disease.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="74"> It is difficult to say what results may come up from this research because AIDS is a very complicated disease, and we still do not know many things about this disease.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="75"> But I do not believe AIDS is incurable.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="76"> Sooner or later, humanity will find a way to cure themselves of the disease.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="77"> [end recording] On 1 December last year, the world's AIDS Day, the Ministry of Public Health held a symposium in Beijing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="78"> Experts suggested that work in 1994 should be focused on education, making people aware of the importance of self-protection.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="79"> The symposium also announced the establishment of China's first special organization to cope with sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-46348" num="80"> The China Association of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS Control and Prevention concentrated on AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases prevention and cure as well as information exchange.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="9"> FACIAL contouring, which involves manual massage or mechanical manipulation of the facial muscles, is coming into vogue as more men and women seek ways to look younger without going under the cosmetic surgeon's knife.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="10"> Although many cosmetologists refer to these facials as "non-surgical face lifts," contouring treatments are not a true alternative to the scalpel.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="11"> Rather, they are intended to develop facial muscle tone.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="12"> Vera Brown's salon, Vera's Retreat in the Glen in Los Angeles, offers both manual and machine treatments.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="13"> She claims that both methods increase the circulation in the face and neck "the same way that exercise works on the rest of the body.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="14"> These treatments won't get rid of deep wrinkles.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="16"> But for people who can't -- or won't -- have surgery, they're the next best thing".</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="17"> Television star Linda Evans of ABC's "Dynasty" reports that 10 years of contouring treatments have kept her face firm and have, so far, eliminated the need for cosmetic surgery.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="18"> Evans and fellow actresses Ali MacGraw and Jamie Lee Curtis receive treatments at Louise Bianco's salon in Westwood.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="19"> Bianco uses a manual massage technique developed about 60 years ago by a Viennese surgeon.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="20"> Bianco says the surgeon perfected the technique with a French cosmetologist named Renna Campbell, who later brought it to the United States.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="21"> Her husband, L.A. dentist Dr. George Campbell, gave up his practice to perform what he called the "Renna" technique on such stars as Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="22"> "The deep massage works on all of the muscle groups in the face, keeping the cheeks round and the jawline firm," Bianco says.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="23"> Jean Carle Devereaux, who uses the "Renna" method at Brown's salon, says that lubricating emollients must be used so the skin is not stretched during the massage.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="24"> "The circulation is increased about 20 times faster than normal," he says.</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="28"> Equipment with names such as Electro-Acuscope, Myopulse and Myopulse Renaissance are called "acupressure face-lift machines".</s>

<s docid="LA012289-0023" num="29"> Small amounts of electrical current stimulate the nerves, which causes capillaries to enlarge, increasing circulation.</s>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="6"> Federal health experts in the US estimate that 1,000 Americans die each day of smoking-related diseases.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="7"> According to a former surgeon general, the nation's 50m regular cigarette smokers are caught in the grip of an addiction more powerful than heroin.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="8"> Nicotine patches attached to the upper arm are the latest candidate for a miracle cure.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="9"> Unaided, fewer than 4 per cent of smokers kick the habit, according to some estimates.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="10"> The advent of hypnotism, nicotine-impregnated chewing gum, acupuncture and behaviour-modification therapy have improved the odds, but most would-be ex-smokers still fail.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="11"> Nicotine patches, which have been on the market for less than four months, are selling almost as quickly as they can be made.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="12"> Alza, which makes the Nicoderm patch, said its plant has been operating 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week since January to meet demand.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="13"> In only two and a half months Nicoderm chalked up Dollars 60m (Pounds 35m) in sales.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="14"> 'We knew that there would be a strong reaction,' a company spokeswoman said, 'but we did not expect such amazing demand for the product'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="15"> The technology behind patches is young, but not new.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="16"> A patch for motion sickness has been available in the US since 1981.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="17"> The product looks like an ordinary sticking plaster.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="18"> It usually has a reservoir to hold the drug, which enters the bloodstream by permeating the skin at a regulated rate.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="19"> With traditional tablet medications the drug quickly passes from the intestine to the liver, where enzymes often digest most of the medication before it has had a chance to work.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="20"> As a result, tablets often contain high concentrations of medicine.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="21"> Drugs administered through a patch reach the liver at a slower rate, after they have already started to work.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="22"> Consequently, lower doses can be administered, generally with fewer side-effects.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="23"> While nicotine is the addictive ingredient in cigarettes, the biggest risks are associated with the nitrosamines, tars and other particulates unleashed when a cigarette is lit.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="24"> By providing smokers with nicotine in a less toxic form the patches give smokers time to change their behaviour and give up cigarettes without suffering the irritability, lack of concentration and other symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="25"> The overriding advantage of patches over nicotine-impregnated chewing gum is that they are easier to use.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="26"> While gum allows patients to regulate the nicotine intake, in practice many people trying to give up tend to chew gum maniacally, releasing too much nicotine too quickly and making themselves ill.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="27"> The Food & Drug Administration has approved three nicotine patches for prescription sales - Habitrol marketed by Ciba Geigy, Nicoderm by Marion Merril Dow and ProStep marketed by American Cyanamid's Lederle unit.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="28"> A fourth patch, to be marketed by Warner Lambert, is waiting for approval.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="29"> The main difference between the competing patches is the mechanism for controlling entry into the bloodstream.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="30"> Some, like Nicoderm, have a special membrane which controls the flow of nicotine.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="31"> Others use the skin itself to control the drug's flow into the bloodstream.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="32"> The doses also differ; ProStep comes in one strength only, while Nicoderm and Habitrol offer patches with increasingly reduced doses.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="33"> The patches seem to be effective.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="34"> A study of Nicoderm's product, presented last December in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed that it had a six-week success rate of 61 per cent compared with 27 per cent for the placebo.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="35"> After six months, 25 per cent of the patients originally treated with patches were still not smoking compared with 11 per cent of the placebo group.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="36"> The patches work best for heavy smokers and are not recommended for those who smoke less than one pack a day.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="37"> They are also most effective in conjunction with behaviour-modification therapy.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="38"> ProStep offers free phone therapy from smoking-cessation experts; Lederle has offered to reimburse pharmacists for time spent educating patients.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="39"> Stephen Rennard, one of the chief investigators in the transdermal nicotine study group, is enthusiastic about patches as a means of nicotine replacement, but cautions that 'this won't cure everybody'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="40"> DynaGen, a Massachusetts biotechnology company, is starting clinical trials of an injectable non-nicotine material called NicErase, which it claims will do the same job as the patches.</s>

<s docid="FT922-15297" num="41"> It 'eliminates the need for the harmful and addictive nicotine,' says Indu Muni, DynaGen president.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="12"> On the bus ride to her therapist, Maria was panicky.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="13"> The woman, diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, had begun feeling dangerously out of control after her baby girl started crying.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="14"> Once, when she lost control, she threw a pot of boiling water at her husband and ended up in a mental ward.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="15"> This time, the shy soft-spoken woman walked into the Norwalk office of psychotherapist Ignacio Aguilar expecting help from the Old World cures that abound in the Mexican countryside, not from the theories of Sigmund Freud.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="16"> That's exactly what she got.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="17"> Aguilar has all his professional credentials hanging on his office wall: a framed master's degree in social work from USC and a certified therapist license from the state of California.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="18"> Beyond these pieces of paper are 17 years of experience working as a psychotherapist at Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk where he has counseled hundreds of mentally disturbed patients.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="19"> But in his practice, Aguilar, 63, also has borrowed methods from Indian pueblos in New Mexico, Tijuana herb shops and village wise men in outposts throughout Mexico.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="20"> The Mexico City native considers himself a folk healer with a repertoire of "mystical approaches".</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="21"> He is among a handful of licensed therapists in Los Angeles County who turn to ancient rituals of the Hispanic culture when traditional therapy fails to make headway with a patient.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="22"> For Maria, who visited Aguilar's office recently, there seemed to be little that would help her aside from her faith.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="23"> Trying to raise three girls, the 35-year-old Mexican immigrant was coping with an abusive husband and a neighbor she suspected was trying to harm her.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="24"> Aguilar had been providing her conventional counseling.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="25"> But she wanted a spiritual cleansing to drive out evil spirits after she had lost an amulet, which she believed protected her from harm.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="26"> The candles were glowing when she quietly entered Aguilar's office and was directed to kneel before the altar.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="27"> After both prayed quietly, Aguilar massaged her temples, neck and arms -- making the woman seem as limp as ribbon.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="28"> Then, he abruptly shook her as if to awaken her from a trance and let her sip from a goblet of rainwater "from the heavens".</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="29"> He splattered drops of the liquid on her head and body.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="30"> Religious Connection</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="31"> Next, the therapist took the branch of a California pepper tree and began vigorously brushing the woman with its shiny leaves -- releasing the scent of pepper in the room.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="32"> This tree is used because it is thought that Christ's crucifix was fashioned from one.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="33"> More prayers were interrupted by the blowing of a large conch shell into the woman's ears.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="34"> Maria snuffed out the bowl of incense with a note pad and peered at the black image left behind on the paper.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="35"> "It looks like a dove," she said.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="36"> The good symbol, Aguilar told her, meant that the evil spirit had been banished.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="37"> The woman looked radiant.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="38"> "My mind is not cluttered anymore about these ideas," she said smiling.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="39"> "I feel fine".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="40"> Aguilar said he began practicing folk medicine in the mid-1970s at Metropolitan State to fill a void in treatment for those unable to benefit from Western-style medicine.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="41"> "When I first started doing it, it was very difficult for me.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="42"> I really had to force myself to do it".</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="43"> But he added, "The important thing is not whether I believe, the important thing is that the patient believes".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="44"> Newly arrived Latino immigrants from the countryside are the usual candidates for the unorthodox treatments, according to a number of mental health professionals.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="45"> Often they blame their mental illness on evil spirits and spurn suggestions that their problems might come from within, these experts say.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="46"> A wife might believe a witch placed a hex on her to drive off her husband.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="47"> Seizures could be explained as the wrath of God.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="48"> Specialty Shops</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="49"> Usually, these people might seek out a neighborhood folk healer called a curandero or find one at a botanica shop, where amulets, herbs, feathers, candles and statues of saints are sold.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="50"> Once primarily confined to East Los Angeles, botanicas are sprouting up rapidly across Los Angeles' Spanish-speaking neighborhoods -- a few even advertising in the Yellow Pages.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="51"> Curanderos, who have traditionally operated in the shadows, also are getting bolder.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="52"> In downtown Los Angeles this week, several people on Broadway were distributing calling cards for curanderos that boasted of being able to cure headaches, alcoholism, nervous disorders, and mal de ojo, or evil eye.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="53"> "Whether we like it or not, these people are bringing with them this kind of belief," Aguilar said.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="54"> "There are many places in the community that are practicing this non-traditional medicine, but it lends itself to a great deal of quackery and exploitation".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="55"> Even the administration at Metropolitan State proved to be disbelievers.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="56"> Several years ago, hospital officials told Aguilar he could no longer conduct his controversial rituals on the hospital grounds.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="57"> He still works at Metro, but he also maintains a private office a few blocks away where he practices his more unconventional therapies.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="58"> Others who counsel Latinos don't go quite as far as Aguilar, but they applaud his work and occasionally send him patients for folk healing.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="59"> Like Aguilar, many said they attempt to honor the spiritualism of their Latino patients and believe folk medicine is healthy because it bolsters a person's ties to his native culture.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="60"> "Why not utilize it if it connects them with strengths in their past"? asked Jerry Tello, a Los Angeles therapist, who keeps a picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe and other cultural symbols in his office.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="61"> If pressed, he will perform a ritual cleansing if the client promises to explore through therapy why he or she is feeling poorly.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="62"> Traditional Practice</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="63"> The number of people who need the services of a faith healer is small, most therapists say.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="64"> Latinos traditionally seek help from family and friends, physicians or their church if they are troubled.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="65"> Yet, it is generally agreed that many Latinos loathe seeking help from a therapist because of the stigma attached to mental illness.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="66"> Some mental health professionals who have made referrals to folk healers can recite stories of surprising results.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="67"> When therapists "come across someone who believes strongly in folk healers or curanderos, it should be the responsibility of the mental health practitioner to refer them to a folk healer," said Armando Morales, a professor at UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="68"> Morales once resorted to a Tijuana curandero when he failed to help a patient who was experiencing hysterical seizures.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="69"> The folk healer spread a large amount of garlic on the woman's body and the seizures vanished.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="70"> "If that's what they believe, you have to work within the cultural limits of people's belief system to help them," agreed Vangie Montalvo, a bilingual Los Angeles County mental health worker.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="71"> "You can tell them they will get better with medication or therapy, but if they don't believe it. . . that's a problem" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="72"> Last fall, Montalvo sought Aguilar's help for a 19-year-old woman whose protective Latino family was rejecting traditional treatment.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="73"> The woman heard voices and her family was frightened by the way her body would twist uncontrollably in grotesque ways.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="74"> The family, who believed the mother's co-worker had placed a curse through black magic, took the woman to Aguilar after priests refused to perform an exorcism.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="75"> Improvement Told</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="76"> After a limpia, or spiritual cleansing, intended to dispel evil spirits, the patient improved and the family became more receptive to traditional therapeutic advice, Montalvo said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="77"> The cures sometimes seem magical, but experts say the explanation is mundane.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="78"> While the dimensions of the human brain remain largely uncharted, the power of faith appears to have tremendous curative value.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="79"> If a person believes that an amulet will help, it just might.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="80"> If somebody thinks it's hogwash, the amulet might as well be a lump of coal.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="81"> "Trust. . . is a very important part of the recovery process.</s>

<s docid="LA060989-0161" num="82"> If someone believes in faith healing, that it will be helpful, it probably will," said Arturo Fierro, a Montebello clinical psychologist with a predominantly Latino clientele .</s>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="6"> Mention back pain to a group of managers, and you will set off a deluge of personal horror stories.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="7"> Anyone who thinks bad backs are reserved for those who make a living moving pianos should think again.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="8"> According to the journal Spine, more than 80 per cent of people in industrialised countries suffer from back pain at some point in their lives.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="9"> The more sedentary you are, the greater the risk of severe back trouble.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="10"> Back pain does not just reduce your mobility on the tennis court and up the career ladder, it is also expensive for your employers.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="11"> In the US alone, back ailments are the second leading cause for going into hospital (after pregnancy), cost industry Dollars 14bn (Pounds 7.6bn) a year and 93m lost working days.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="12"> The back is a complicated structure: 33 vertebral bodies, the boney building blocks, are stacked on top of each other.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="13"> Between them are rubbery, fluid-filled discs, which cushion the weight of the upper body.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="14"> Then there are the muscles (roughly 140) and ligaments, which hold the spine erect in a natural, flattened S-curve, the optimum shape for flexibility, weight bearing and shock absorption.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="15"> As long as the concave curve in the lower back is preserved, the disc can usually tolerate the compression that comes from the pressure of the body's weight.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="16"> Problems begin when you eliminate that inward curve of the lower back by habitually bending forward, thus compressing the disc backwards.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="17"> The technological advances of this century - TV, the telephone, computers and cars - have all contributed to the current epidemic of back problems.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="18"> All involve the worst possible activity for the back: long-term sitting.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="19"> But even if you spend most of your time on your backside, there are ways of avoiding back trouble.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="20"> Regular aerobic exercise is crucial to maintain strength of the back muscles.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="21"> Brisk walking is ideal.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="22"> Complement these activities with some night-time stretching or yoga.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="23"> Get rid of that pot belly and get your weight under control.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="24"> Added weight distributed up front will only put more strain on the back muscles.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="25"> The spine gets most of its support from the massive abdominal musculature, not the back muscles themselves.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="26"> Tone up the abdominal muscles by flexing them while sitting on aircraft or driving.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="27"> Lift objects properly.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="28"> Perform the 'marble test'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="29"> In the morning, put a marble in your breast pocket.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="30"> During the day, if the marble rolls out of your pocket, it is because you bent over, instead of squatting to pick something up.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="31"> Let your legs do the bending.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="32"> When lifting, keep the object very close to your body.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="33"> In your car or at your desk, sit up and avoid stooping.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="34"> During the day, tense your abdominal muscles to give them them the strength they need to support your back.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="35"> Make sure your chair supports your lower back well.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="36"> When travelling or shopping, divide the weight of your bags evenly so as not to strain one side more than the other.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="37"> While driving long hauls, keep your knees higher than your pelvis.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="38"> Maintain the natural curve of your spine by placing a cushion or a rolled-up towel behind your lower back to lend support.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="39"> Do not twist your body getting in and out of your car.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="40"> Re-align your back every hour or so by standing, placing your hands in the lower back and bending backwards.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="41"> Sleep on a firm bed, on your side with the top leg bent and bottom leg straight.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="42"> Women should not wear high heels, as they throw the back into an unnatural position.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="43"> If despite all this you do develop back pain, there is a whole array of therapies - massage, manipulation, acupuncture, ultrasound, deep heat, traction, shoe inserts, and surgery.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="44"> The bad news is that none of these is 100 per cent successful.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="45"> The good news is that most back pain subsides eventually, regardless of approach, with bed rest, aspirin and time.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2333" num="46"> The author is medical director of the Insead Business Health course.</s>

<s docid="LA010490-0128" num="16"> Mrs. Bush, 64, has maintained a full agenda of public appearances, carrying out a schedule with no suggestion that the condition has forced her to curtail her activities.</s>

<s docid="LA010490-0128" num="17"> The move to the radiation treatments, however, suggests that she is finding it more difficult to shrug off the problem.</s>

<s docid="LA010490-0128" num="22"> The thyroid condition for which Mrs. Bush is being treated was named after Robert Graves, a 19th-Century Irish physician who first described it.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA010490-0128" num="25"> Mrs. Bush underwent treatment with radioactive iodine on April 12 to destroy the thyroid gland, which was producing excess amounts of hormones.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA010490-0128" num="27"> Subsequently, she began treatments with a drug known as prednisone, a powerful steroid in the cortisone family.</s>

<s docid="LA010490-0128" num="32"> It is "a sort of second-line treatment," Utiger said.</s>

<s docid="LA010490-0128" num="33"> "It's not one that is usually done initially or in a patient who has had a favorable response to prednisone".</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA010490-0128" num="34"> The success rate is "a matter of some controversy," he said, and the medical literature has shown that it has produced mixed results.</s>

<s docid="LA010490-0128" num="36"> Under one operation, bits of bone that form the cup in which the eye sits are removed, to provide more room for the swollen tissue.</s>

<s docid="LA010490-0128" num="37"> Perez said that the prednisone had served its primary purpose -- to stabilize the symptoms -- and that the condition is not getting any worse.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA010490-0128" num="38"> "Doctors do not look at prednisone as a long-term therapy," she said, adding that it is hoped that Mrs. Bush can be weaned from the drug, administered in a pill, when her radiation treatments end.</s>

<s docid="LA010490-0128" num="39"> Perez, as well as endocrinologists, said that no physical side effects from the radiation are expected.</s>

<s docid="LA010490-0128" num="40"> Utiger said that the dosage is considerably smaller, and more targeted, than the radiation commonly administered for treatment of brain tumors or cancers in various organs and is not likely to produce the fatigue, nausea or hair loss associated with such therapy.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="3"> In 1910, isolation practices in U.S. hospitals were altered by the introduction of the cubicle system of isolation which placed patients in multiple-bed wards.6 With the cubicle system, hospital personnel used separate gowns, washed their hands with antiseptic solutions after patient contact, and disinfected objects contaminated by the patient.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="4"> These nursing procedures, designed to prevent transmission of pathogenic organisms to other patients and personnel, became known as ``barrier nursing''.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="5"> Use of the cubicle system of isolation and barrier nursing procedures provided general hospitals with an alternative to placing some patients in infectious disease hospitals.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="6"> During the 1950s, U.S. infectious disease hospitals, except those designated exclusively for tuberculosis, began to close.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="7"> In the mid-1960s, tuberculosis hospitals also began to close, partly because general hospital or outpatient treatment became preferred for patients with tuberculosis.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="8"> Thus, by the late 1960s patients with infectious diseases were housed in wards in general hospitals, either in specially designed, single-patient isolation rooms or in regular single or multiple-patient rooms.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="9"> CDC Isolation Systems CDC Isolation Manual In 1970, CDC published a detailed manual entitled Isolation Techniques for Use in Hospitals to assist general hospitals with isolation precautions;2 a revised edition appeared in 1975.3 The manual could be applied in small community hospitals with limited resources as well as in large metropolitan university-associated medical centers.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="10"> The manual introduced the category system of isolation precautions.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="11"> It recommended that hospitals use one of seven isolation categories (Strict Isolation, Respiratory Isolation, Protective Isolation, Enteric Precautions, Wound and Skin Precautions, Discharge Precautions, and Blood Precautions).</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="12"> The precautions recommended for each category were determined almost entirely by the epidemiologic features of the diseases grouped in the category, primarily their routes of transmission.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="13"> Certain isolation techniques, believed to be the minimum necessary to prevent transmission of all diseases in the category, were indicated for each isolation category.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="14"> Because all diseases in a category did not have the same epidemiology (i.e.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="15"> , were not spread by exactly the same combination of modes of transmission), with some requiring fewer precautions than others, more precautions were suggested for some diseases than were necessary.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="16"> This disadvantage of ``over-isolation'' for some diseases was offset by the convenience of having a small number of categories.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="17"> More importantly, the simple system required personnel to learn only a few established routines for applying isolation precautions.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="18"> To make the system even more user friendly, instructions for each category were printed on color-coded cards and placed on the doors, beds, and/or charts of patients on isolation precautions.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="19"> By the mid-1970s, 93% of U.S. hospitals had adopted the isolation system recommended in the manual.7 However, neither the efficacy of the category approach in preventing spread of infections nor the costs of using the system were evaluated by empirical studies.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="20"> By 1980, hospitals were experiencing new endemic and epidemic nosocomial infection problems, some caused by multidrug-resistant microorganisms and others caused by newly recognized pathogens, which required different isolation precautions from those specified by any existing isolation category.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="21"> There was increasing need for isolation precautions to be directed more specifically at nosocomial transmission in special-care units, rather than at the intrahospital spread of infectious diseases acquired in the community.8 Infection control professionals and nursing directors in hospitals with particularly sophisticated nursing staffs were increasingly calling for new isolation systems that would tailor precautions to the modes of transmission for each infection and avoid the over-isolation inherent in the category-specific approach.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="22"> Further, new facts about the epidemiology and modes of transmission of some diseases made it necessary for CDC to revise the isolation manual.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="23"> Toward that end, during 1981-1983, CDC Hospital Infections Program personnel consulted with infectious disease specialists in medicine, pediatrics, and surgery; hospital epidemiologists; and infection control practitioners about revising the manual.</s>

<s docid="FR941107-2-00217" num="24"> CDC Isolation Guideline In 1983, the CDC Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals4 (hereafter referred to as the isolation guideline) was published to take the place of the 1975 isolation manual; it contained many important changes.</s>

<s docid="FR940805-2-00076" num="17"> Method of Operation._Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive method of graphically representing the distribution of water and other hydrogen-rich molecules in the human body.</s>

<s docid="FR940805-2-00076" num="18"> In contrast to conventional radiographs or CT scans, in which the image is produced by X-ray beam attenuation by an object, MRI is capable of producing images by several techniques.</s>

<s docid="FR940805-2-00076" num="19"> In fact, various combinations of MR image production methods may be employed to emphasize particular characteristics of the tissue or body part being examined.</s>

<s docid="FR940805-2-00076" num="20"> The basic elements by which MRI produces an image are the density of hydrogen nuclei in the object examined, their motion, and the relaxation times, the period of time required for the nuclei to return to their original states in the main, static magnetic field after being subjected to a brief additional magnetic field.</s>

<s docid="FR940805-2-00076" num="21"> These relaxation times reflect the physical-chemical properties of tissue and the molecular environment of its hydrogen nuclei.</s>

<s docid="FR940805-2-00076" num="22"> Only hydrogren atoms are present in human tissues in sufficient concentration for current use in clinical MRI.</s>

<s docid="FR940805-2-00076" num="23"> 2. General Clinical Utility._Overall, MRI is a useful diagnostic imaging modality that is capable of demonstrating a wide variety of soft-tissue lesions with contrast resolution equal or superior to CT scanning in various parts of the body.</s>

<s docid="FR940805-2-00076" num="24"> Among the advantages of MRI are the absence of ionizing radiation and the ability to achieve high levels of tissue contrast resolution without injected iodinated radiological contrast agents.</s>

<s docid="FR940805-2-00076" num="25"> Recent advances in technology have resulted in development and FDA approval of new paramagnetic contrast agents for MRI which allow even better visualization in some instances.</s>

<s docid="FR940805-2-00076" num="26"> Multislice imaging and the ability to image in multiple planes, especially sagittal and coronal, have provided a flexibility not easily available with other modalities.</s>

<s docid="FR940805-2-00076" num="27"> Because cortical (outer layer) bone and metallic prostheses do not cause distortion of MR images, it has been possible to visualize certain lesions and body regions with greater certainty than has been possible with CT.</s>

<s docid="FR940805-2-00076" num="28"> The use of MRI on certain soft tissue structures for the purpose of detecting disruptive, neoplastic, degenerative, or inflammatory lesions has now become established in medical practice.</s>

<s docid="FR940805-2-00076" num="29"> B. Covered Clinical Applications._Although several uses of MRI are still considered investigational and some uses are clearly contraindicated (see subsection D), MRI is considered medically efficacious for a number of uses.</s>

<s docid="FR940805-2-00076" num="30"> Use the following descriptions as general guidelines or examples of what may be considered covered rather than as a restrictive list of specific coverages.</s>

<s docid="FR940805-2-00076" num="31"> Coverage is limited to MRI units which have received FDA premarket approval, and such units must be operated within the parameters specified by the approval.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-51121" num="15"> About 90 experts and scholars from the medical community of 15 provinces and municipalities across the country attended the three-day conference, which received more than 70 papers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-51121" num="16"> The meeting also announced the establishment of Wuyishan Society of Buddhist Medicine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-51121" num="17"> Participants in the symposium held that Buddhist medicine is a combination of natural science and humane studies, and is an important part of traditional Chinese medicine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-51121" num="18"> They believed that Buddhist medicine has also proved effective in curing some difficult and complicated cases of illness in the fields of surgery, gynecology, ophthalmology and in curing cancers, but they also stressed the need to strengthen research and development of Buddhist medicine and enhance exchanges with overseas corresponding organizations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-51121" num="19"> The conference heard that scientific research and teaching of Buddhist medicine have made great progress in the past ten and more years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-51121" num="20"> So far, Buddhist clinics, hospitals and related academic research institutes have been established in a dozen provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, as well as at grass-roots Buddhist associations and in many famous temples.</s>
