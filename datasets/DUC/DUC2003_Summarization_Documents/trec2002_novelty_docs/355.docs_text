<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="19"> Synthetic Aperture Radar: ASAR"] [Text] An advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) has been selected as the imaging radar sensor for the Envisat-1 payload.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="20"> In addition to providing continuity of data with the single-swath, single-polarisation Active Microwave Instrumentation (AMI) currently flying on ERS-1 (and ERS-2), the ASAR has the additional advantages of offering: greater coverage, with more flexibility in the choice of swath positions, a wider range of incidence angles, and a wide swath capability; dual polarisation; and improved wave mode capabilities.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="21"> ASAR'S Role</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="22"> The objectives for the Advanced SAR are very similar to those of the AMI on ERS-1 and ERS-2.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="23"> The main task will again be that of monitoring the Earth's environment to collect more precise information on global change, focussing specifically on global climate and all of the factors that may influence it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="24"> Monitoring of the Earth's bio-mass, especially the deforestation in the large primeval forests in the equatorial regions, will allow better modelling of the influence on the greenhouse effect and global climate and facilitate the implementation of countermeasures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="25"> Desertification and the distribution of humidity, changes in water levels, flooded areas, and the extent of the ice caps around the North and South Poles are other major factors that need to be monitored in order to improve our understanding of global climate change.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="26"> Envisat's SAR images will also further improve our understanding of ocean dynamics, the interactions between oceans and atmosphere, as well as both manmade and natural processes in coastal zones.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="27"> The major advantage of using a SAR for earth-observation tasks lies in its ability to acquire imagery day or night and independent of cloud cover and weather conditions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="28"> This weather-independent capability is of vital importance for disaster assessment, as major floods or large oil spills, usually occur in weather conditions that drastically curtail the usefulness of optical sensors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="29"> ERS-1 SAR images have also proved extremely useful for shipping operations in Arctic ice.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="30"> Ocean-wave spectra taken around the globe with ASAR will further improve the safety of shipping routes and offshore activities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="31"> As experience with SAR data grows, its contribution to resource management will also become more and more important.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="32"> In addition to the bio-mass estimating application already mentioned, improved classification methods will allow more accurate harvest predictions, better estimates of sweet-water resources and, via geological surveys, support the search for mineral resources.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="33"> The ASAR Instrument</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="34"> Given the rapid expansion in the SAR data user community, it is essential that Envisat should carry an instrument that not only provides data continuity with ERS-1 and ERS-2, but also at the same time represents a step forward in terms of both system flexibility and the scientific and operational value of its data sets.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="35"> To satisfy these needs, the ASAR design incorporates: -- A flexible swath-position capability, which will offer the choice between several image swath positions at various distances from the subsatellite track with different incidence angles.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="36"> -- A dual-polarisation facility (cf.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="37"> vertical only on ERS), offering horizontal or vertical polarisation imaging.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="38"> The ASAR's ability to switch between different swaths offers very fast multiplexing, so that an overall swath more than 400 km wide can be imaged in one pass.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="39"> In addition to this so-called "Wide Swath Mode", the ASAR can be set to operate at a coarse spatial resolution of only 1000 m.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="40"> The data rate will then be low enough for tape recording onboard the spacecraft.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="41"> This is known as the "Global Monitoring Mode" and it constitutes a tool for monitoring such features as ice coverage, snow coverage, deforestation, desertification or humidity, without interruption and on a global scale, due to its independence from ground-station coverage.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="42"> The ASAR's ability to switch between two polarisation allows a special "Alternating Polarisation Mode" to be implemented which permits half of the looks at a scene to be acquired with a horizontal, and the other half with a vertical polarisation in a single pass, thereby considerably increasing the target classification capability (especially if used in conjunction with multi-temporal imaging of the same scene).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="43"> Furthermore ASAR will, like ERS, have a "Wave Mode" for taking 5 x 5 km images but more frequently, over 100 or 200 km distances, and with two such images in any swath over the oceans, to supply ocean-wave spectra on a global basis.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="44"> The ASAR instrument is divided functionally into two sub-assemblies: -- An Antenna Sub-Assembly (ASA), containing the phased-array antenna electronics distributed over 20 "tiles", and -- A Central Electronics Sub-Assembly (CESA), providing signal (RF) generation and reception, control signals, power conditioning and data formatting.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="45"> The ASAR antenna consists of five hinged panels, each containing four tiles.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="46"> The CESA equipment units are mounted on three of the Payload Equipment Bay panels inside the spacecraft.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="47"> Control of the instrument covers the following functions: -- Selecting the required mode and generating the appropriate timeline.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="48"> -- Selecting the required antenna beam pattern for the required swath (or beam patterns in modes where multiple swaths are needed).</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="54"> The ASAR instrument has several operating modes, which can be grouped into four areas: -- Support modes -- Operational modes -- Calibration modes -- Test/health-check modes.</s>

<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="59"> High-spatial-resolution Imaging Modes</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="60"> In these two modes - the so-called "Image Mode" and "Alternating Polarisation Mode" - the ASAR operates as an imaging radar with high spatial resolution (typically a few tens of metres), and relatively narrow swaths (up to 120 km).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="61"> The Image Mode provides continuous coverage over a single swath nominally 100 km wide.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="62"> The swath can be selected anywhere within a 500 km region (incidence angle range 15-45 degrees).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="63"> For nominal operation, seven swaths (IS1 to IS7) are defined over this region.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="64"> The imaging is performed by transmitting a continuous series of pulses and acquiring the required echo information after the appropriate return trip delay.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="65"> The transition to Image Mode is made automatically following the appropriate macro-command.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="66"> Before the actual measurement of data is initiated, a period of stabilisation, noise measurement and internal calibration is performed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="67"> Echo measurement then starts, during which the initial calibration is updated on a regular basis.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="68"> Image Mode operation continues uninterrupted until the receipt of another macro-command to switch to another mode.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="69"> The Alternating Polarisation Mode provides vertically and horizontally polarised imaging of the same scene by interleaving looks with each polarisation along track within the synthetic aperture.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="70"> The echo measurement is made within repetition cycles containing two bursts of transmissions on each of the polarisations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="71"> The sequence is only interrupted when the internal calibration requires updating (as for the Image Mode).</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="72"> Low-Spatial-Resolution Imaging Modes</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="73"> These are the "Wide Swath Mode" and "Global Monitoring Mode", in which the ASAR operates as an imaging radar with low spatial resolution (100 m to 1 km) and relatively wide swath (more than 400 km).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="74"> To obtain global coverage for the Global Monitoring Mode, the data is stored onboard the satellite and transferred to ground when it passes over a ground station.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="75"> The Wide Swath Mode provides continuous coverage over a swath nominally 400 km wide, which is divided into five subswaths ranging from 60 to 100 km in width.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="76"> The ASAR transmits bursts of pulses to each of the subswaths in turn in such a way that a continuous along-track image is built up for each subswath.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="77"> During a transition to Wide Swath Mode, all the necessary data transfers and timing parameters are established.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="78"> Stabilisation, noise measurement and internal calibration follow in a similar manner to the Image Mode, after which the echo measurement sequence itself commences.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="79"> For each subswath, there is a burst of transmissions followed by a short quiescent period whilst the echoes from the last transmit pulses are received.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="80"> Transmissions then switch to the next subswath in the cycle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="81"> The updating of the internal calibration is performed at the end of each subswath transmission burst.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="82"> The Global Monitoring Mode provides continuous along-track sampling across a 400 km swath, again using a SAR scanning technique.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="83"> This mode has a low data rate due to a slightly reduced along-track duty ratio and the use of digital filtering for reduction in the across-track direction.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="84"> The same subswaths as defined for the Wide Swath Mode are used.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="85"> Wave Mode</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="86"> In the "Wave Mode", the ASAR uses the facilities of the Image Mode to image small areas of the ocean surface, measuring the changes in radar backscatter from the surface due to wave action.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="87"> The imaging is carried out to a high spatial resolution over one or two areas across a swath of approximately 5 km x 5 km at intervals of nominally 100 or 200 km in the along-track direction.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="88"> The transition to Wave Mode is identical to that for the Image Mode, including the initial calibration sequence.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="89"> This is followed by a burst of transmissions covering the 5 km along-track vignette distance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="90"> A quiescent period is then used to transfer the data to the Payload Data Handling and Transmission System via the low-rate data interface.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="107"> In addition to achieving comparable performance to ERS-1 in the swath that coincides with the ERS-1 single fixed swath, the ASAR instrument will give Envisat-1: -- Wider swath and incidence-angle coverage -- A second channel of information by means of the dual- polarisation capability -- Variable spatial resolutions and data rates.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="108"> In addition, the ASAR can be tuned during its in-orbit lifetime to make optimum use of the power available.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="109"> Satellite instrument designs are generally driven by end-of-life requirements, which often results in under-utilisation early in a mission.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="110"> The ASAR's built-in flexibility will allow it to take advantage of beginning-of-life conditions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21019" num="111"> It will also enable operating modes other than the baseline modes that were identified in Table 1 to be explored during the Envisat-1 mission, thereby helping to define requirements and modes of operation for future SAR missions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21238" num="15"> The history of Japanese remote sensing had really begun.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21238" num="16"> In 1987, the reception of data from the Japanese Marine Observation Satellite (MOS-1) was started.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21238" num="17"> This was followed by reception of data from the French earth observation satellite SPOT in 1988, from MOS-1b in 1990, from the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1) in 1991 and from the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) in 1992.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-67760" num="16"> BNSC Assistant Director John Shrimplin opened the proceedings and introduced the speakers, Rene Bonnefoy, head of the ESA department for Earth observation programs, who reported on the current status of the ERS-1 mission, and T.W.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="24"> Since the mid-1970s, SAR technology has evolved from airborne applications to spaceborne applications.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="25"> In recent years, significant progress has been made in spaceborne SAR technology.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="26"> Since the launch of the SEASAT-A satellite by the U.S.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="27"> National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1978, the U.S.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="28"> SIR-A, SIR-B, SIR-C, and European ERS-1, the Canadian RADAR SAT and the Japanese JERS-1 satellites have all been equipped with advanced SAR imaging systems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="29"> The unique features of spaceborne SAR systems are: high altitude, extended range and coverage, wide bandwidth, and high data rate; also, various error correction and compensation schemes and complex signal processing techniques are used in spaceborne SAR.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="30"> There are distinct differences between spaceborne SAR and airborne SAR.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="31"> Because of the relatively low altitude and slow velocity of airborne SAR, the Earth can be regarded as a large planar surface, which makes signal processing relatively easy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="32"> In the case of spaceborne SAR, however, the effects of Earth rotation and Earth curvature produce coupling in the radar returns between the range direction and the azimuth direction; as a result, azimuth compression of the radar signal becomes very complicated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="33"> In general, digital image processing for spaceborne SAR involves range processing, azimuth processing, motion compensation and multi-look processing, of which the most difficult problems are azimuth processing and motion compensation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="34"> In this paper, a method of digital imaging using spaceborne SAR is presented.</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="39"> The radar transmits a linear frequency-modulated (FM) pulse signal.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="40"> Let _D_ be the pulse width, T be the pulse repetition period, R(t) be the slant range between the satellite and the ground target, W[.sup]a[/](t) be the azimuth directivity function of the antenna, _s_(x,r) be the scattering coefficient of the ground target, a(t) be a step function of width _D_, _l_ be the wavelength, and c be the speed of light; then the radar return signal can be expressed as:[.sup]1[/] s(x,r) = _s_(x,r)W[.sup]r[/](r) * h[.sub]1[/](x,r) *[.sup]r[/]h[.sub]2[/](x,r) (1) where W[.sup]r[/](r) is the range directivity function of the antenna, * is the two-dimensional convolution with respect to azimuth x and range r; *[.sup]r[/] is the one-dimensional convolution with respect to range r.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="41"> Also, In the above equation, f[.sup]D[/] is the Doppler center frequency, f[.sup]R[/] is the rate of change of Doppler frequency, v is the satellite velocity relative to the ground, and b is the frequency-modulation rate.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="42"> One can see from the radar signal model that the radar return is a complicated two-dimensional convolution; the purpose of signal processing is to extract the scattering characteristics of the target from the received signal, and ultimately to form a high-quality radar image.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="43"> III.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="44"> Range-Compression Processing</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="45"> Range processing of spaceborne SAR actually implies pulse compression.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="46"> Digital pulse compression in the range direction uses FFT for matched filter implementation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="47"> The processed signal can be expressed as: where c[.sup]0[/] = 2ãb_D_/c.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="48"> It is known from the principle of pulse compression that the slant range resolution after pulse compression is: _r_[.sup]r[/] = c/2B[.sub]r[/] and the ground range resolution is: where B[.sup]r[/] is the signal bandwidth, H is the satellite altitude, R[.sup]e[/] is the mean Earth radius, and _th_ is the antenna viewing angle.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="49"> The number of samples of the range reference function is where f[.sup]s[/] is the sampling frequency.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="50"> The raw data collected by SEASAT-A are digital data produced by the A/D converter; prior to range processing, they must first be orthogonalized and then matched-filtered.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="51"> The orthogonalization process is accomplished in the frequency domain, where a window function is applied and the signal carrier frequency is shifted to zero frequency; finally, a complex IFFT [inverse fast Fourier transform] is performed to complete the process of range digital pulse compression.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="52"> This process is equivalent to a transformation from real data to complex data; the complex data are stored for azimuth processing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="54"> Azimuth-Compression Processing</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="55"> The azimuth reference function is chosen based on the expression of the range-compressed radar signal:[.sup]2[/] Due to the effect of range drift, coupling between the range direction and the azimuth direction exists in the radar return; therefore, azimuth processing requires complicated two-dimensional processing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="56"> In fact, azimuth processing is actually a two-dimensional matched filtering; the filtered output signal represents the scattering characteristics of the ground target, which is of the form: _s_[.sup]0[/](x,r) = s[.sub]R[/](x,r) * h[.sup]*[/][.sup]a[/](x,r) (8) The implementation of two-dimensional matched filtering for azimuth processing is highly computation-intensive.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="57"> By using a hybrid time-domain and frequency-domain correlation technique, the two-dimensional problem reduces to a one-dimensional problem, and the correction of range drift can be accomplished in the frequency domain; as a result, the amount of computation is greatly reduced.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="58"> For a second-order curve R(x), the azimuth reference function for range r[.sup]0[/] is: where d[.sup]i[/] is the distance of the range reference value r[.sup]0[/], and The expression in the frequency domain after azimuth processing is of the form: It can be seen from the above expression that the hybrid correlation method uses time-domain correlation in the range direction and frequency-domain correlation in the azimuth direction; this approach takes full advantage of the FFT and therefore provides an efficient way of calculating precision impulse response.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="59"> If the above method is applied directly for azimuth compression, the amount of computation will increase with increasing Doppler center frequency.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="60"> A more efficient way would be to apply correction to the range wander (the linear term of range drift) before azimuth pulse compression, then apply correction to the range bending (the second-order term of range drift) in the frequency domain; this approach requires less computation, and R(x) in the azimuth reference function g[.sup]i[/](x,r[.sub]0[/]) becomes: Computer results show that the digital images of spaceborne SAR produced by this method and the previous method are almost identical, but the amount of computation for azimuth compression (at f[.sup]D[/] = 980 Hz) is reduced by one half.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="18"> I. Introduction</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="19"> In oceanography, the most important issues are to recognize the different phenomena that occur on the ocean surface and to have a good understanding of the available resources in the ocean.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="20"> These are also the objectives of ocean monitoring and surveillance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="21"> The traditional approaches for ocean monitoring and surveillance involve the use of surveillance ships, observation stations, ocean buoys, etc., to collect data that reflect the ocean environment and resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="22"> However, these approaches are expensive, time-consuming and can only cover a limited area; consequently, they are not suited for wide-area, real-time, synchronous, continuous and dense observations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="23"> Because of the immense dimensions and constant motion of the ocean, space-borne remote sensors have distinct advantages over other monitoring techniques.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="24"> These advantages are: 1) unlike most conventional techniques which can only perform point-wise or line-wise monitoring, space-borne sensors provide an economical and convenient way to perform wide-area monitoring; and 2) they have real-time monitoring capability.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="25"> Today, the simple ocean-surface monitoring technique has been replaced by the integrated technique which makes use of space-borne sensors, surface sensors and underwater sensors; in particular, space-borne monitoring is now becoming the principal technique.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="26"> [passage omitted] China's marine remote-sensing technology is lagging far behind [that of the United States and Europe]; the main reason is that the potential development of technical talents and scientists in this country is limited by the lack of raw remote-sensing data.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="27"> Nevertheless, a great deal has been accomplished even with the limited data.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="28"> In this paper, the main accomplishments are summarized, and an argument is made that since it is unlikely for China to launch its own remote-sensing satellites within the next few years, the best course would be to promote the research and application of remote-sensing technology in this country by making maximum use of the data collected by other countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="29"> II.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="30"> Objectives and Requirements of Satellite Remote Sensing</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="31"> in Oceanography The main objectives of satellite remote sensing in oceanography are monitoring the dynamic ocean environment, observing of ocean color, and mapping of the coastal belt and offshore islands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="32"> 1. Monitoring the Dynamic Ocean Environment Currently, satellite sensors can only detect changes on the ocean surface; internal conditions of the ocean are inferred from variations in the surface phenomena.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="33"> The important phenomena include: 1) surface wind fields, wave fields, flow fields, tides, water pockets, front movement, vortices and internal waves; and 2) surface terrain, surface height and ice formation in the ocean.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="34"> Like other dynamic processes, the dynamic process of the ocean has its own characteristic length and time scales.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="35"> In general, the length scale in the horizontal direction spans from several tens of centimeters to several thousand kilometers, with a span ratio of 10[.sup]6[/]-10[.sup]7[/]; the length scale in the vertical direction is typically 1/100 to 1/1000 that of the horizontal scale; the span of the time scale is even larger, from several seconds to several years, with a span ratio of 10[.sup]8[/] to 10[.sup]9[/].</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="36"> Based on these unique characteristics, the technical specifications of ocean-monitoring satellites must satisfy the following requirements: (1) To achieve global monitoring, the earth resource satellites in general are placed in near-circular, sun-synchronous orbits.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="37"> (2) The scan distance and scan width of the ocean surface should be matched to the horizontal length span ratio, but because of the large variations in the span ratio associated with the different dynamic processes, and the limitations of the satellite orbit and the onboard detectors, it is necessary to consider a compromise value for the satellite design.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="38"> (3) The accuracy of the vertical length span ratio is primarily determined by the stability of the satellite orbit and the measurement accuracy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="39"> (4) The operating life and the repetition period of the satellite orbit (including the back-up satellite) should be matched to the time span ratio.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="40"> Because of the large variations in the time span ratio associated with the different dynamic processes, it is impossible to satisfy all requirements simultaneously; therefore, a compromise must again be considered.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="41"> For an experimental satellite, it is reasonable to use a programmable repetition period.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="42"> (5) The observation of the key elements of the dynamic phenomena is based on the principle of measuring the roughness of the ocean surface; generally, active microwave detectors with all-weather capability are used.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="43"> 2. Observation of Ocean Color Ocean water contains organic and inorganic materials of different concentration.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="44"> These include non-soluble organic materials such as floating plants, soluble organic materials such as yellow substances, and non-soluble inorganic materials such as suspended particles of mud and sand.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="45"> The pollutants in the ocean are a mixture of organic and inorganic materials.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="46"> Observation of ocean color usually refers to the measurement of chlorophyll concentration, the content of suspended mud and sand, the pollutants, the soluble organic materials, the depth of water and underwater terrains.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="47"> The requirements on satellite orbit and altitude for observing ocean color are similar to those for measuring the dynamic environment, the only difference is that the repetition period can be somewhat longer.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="48"> The detectors used for observing ocean color elements generally operate in the visible-light band.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="49"> The commonly used techniques for measuring the chlorophyll content in the ocean are the blue-green spectral response method and the fluorescent peak response method; both techniques require fine resolution of the spectral band and high sensitivity of the measuring instrument.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="50"> 3. Mapping of the Coastal Belt and Offshore Islands The coastal belt consists of the land and sea region along the shoreline.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="51"> The main objectives of mapping the coastal belt are to monitor changes in the shoreline, the configuration of the beaches and reefs, the building environment along the shore, the water depth of shallow sea and underwater terrain, the geological structure and the distribution of vegetation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="52"> The technical requirement for mapping the coastal belt and offshore islands is the same as that for mapping land areas.</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="56"> Satellite Remote Sensing in Oceanography During the past 10 years, significant advances have been made in satellite remote-sensing technology.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="57"> In this country, progress has been slow mainly because of inadequate remote-sensing data.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="58"> But even under these limited conditions a great deal has been accomplished, and some useful results have been produced.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="59"> These results are derived from data collected by the meteorology satellites and earth resource satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="60"> 1. Application of Remote-Sensing Data From Meteorology Satellite in Oceanography Since the early 1980s, when China began receiving data from the U.S. polar-orbit NOAA satellites and the Japanese geostationary GMS satellites, the following results have been produced: (1) The data from NOAA AVHRR infrared channels 3, 4, 5 have been processed to derive surface temperatures of the ocean; the accuracy of the derived temperatures is +/- 1ëC on average and +/- 0.5ëC over a localized area; the geopositioning accuracy is 1-3 km.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="61"> The data have been used in the following applications: 1) Issuing timely reports of ocean conditions to the fishing industry.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="62"> By using the data of surface temperatures to determine the front of cold and warm currents, it is possible to issue timely reports of ocean conditions to the fishing fleet; these data have proved to be quite reliable from tests conducted over the past few years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="63"> 2) The Black Tide is a current that travels along the western boundary of the Pacific Ocean; it starts from Taiwan, moves northward past Okinawa, then turns east toward the coast of Japan, and terminates at 160ëE.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="64"> It is a warm current system which has a direct effect on the climate of regions along its path.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="65"> By analyzing the surface temperature data, preliminary results of the distribution of surface currents in the East China Sea during winter and spring have been obtained.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="66"> (2) Data from AVHRR infrared channels 3, 4, 5 of the NOAA satellite are used to monitor ice conditions in the northern part of Bo Hai and the Yellow Sea.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="67"> Ice maps of this region have been constructed using sophisticated data processing techniques including projection transformation, position correction, and image enhancement; these maps show detailed diagrams of ice coverage and thickness distribution of ice.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="68"> The maps are broadcast and distributed to the user every winter.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="69"> (3) Data from channel 1 (visible-light channels) of the NOAA satellite and channels 1, 3, 4 of the NIMBUS-1 satellite are used in a remote-sensing test to measure water color at selected points along the river and at the mouths of rivers; preliminary results of chlorophyll concentrations at the mouth of the Yantze River and in Hangzhou Bay and Bo Hai Bay have been obtained.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="70"> (4) Real-time cloud maps from the GMS satellite and its derived products are used to determine wind speed and direction, which in turn are used to predict the intensity, the location of the eye, and the path of a typhoon.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="71"> 2. Application of Remote-Sensing Data From the Landsat Satellite in Oceanography In the mid-1980s, China constructed a ground station to receive remote-sensing data from the U.S.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="72"> Landsat. The data have been used in the following applications in oceanography: (1) The MSS and TM data from Landsat are used to derive preliminary results of suspended mud and sand concentrations at the mouths of the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, Hangzhou Bay, the Pearl River, the Min River and the Yalu River.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="73"> The results obtained for the Yellow River are found to be correlated with the movement of mud and sand in the offshore region, the erosion of the shoreline, the characteristics of the flow system and with the formation of the river delta.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="74"> Therefore they provide a valuable data base for establishing future development plan for the Yellow River Delta, for performing maintenance and repair, and for developing oil fields and harbors in this region.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="75"> (2) The MSS and TM data from Landsat are also used to survey the northwest region of Hainan Island and to construct 1:200,000 and 1:500,000 scale maps that describe the vegetation cover, the terrain, the geology and land use of that region.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="76"> 3. Deficiencies of the NOAA and Landsat Satellites in Oceanography Applications (1) The accuracy of the AVHRR detector of the NOAA satellite in measuring ocean surface temperature is rather poor; also, the detector is subject to cloud cover limitations and therefore cannot make continuous temperature measurements.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="77"> In monitoring ice conditions, the surface resolution and geopositioning accuracy of the detector are poor; therefore it is difficult to obtain information on ice movement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="78"> In measuring ocean color, the spectral resolution and sensitivity of the detector are both quite low, hence it is difficult to obtain quantitative measures of chlorophyll concentration.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="79"> (2) The TM (ETM) data from Landsat have poor spectral resolution and low sensitivity so it is difficult to obtain quantitative measures of suspended mud and sand in the ocean; in monitoring ice conditions, its repetition period is too long to be useful in providing information on ice movement; in mapping the coastal belt, the detector does not have sufficient dynamic range to accommodate the large difference in reflectivity between water and land.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="80"> (3) Many of the important marine environmental elements cannot be effectively measured by the remote sensors of the NOAA satellite or the Landsat; e.g., measurement of key dynamic parameters of the ocean; quantitative determination of the ocean color; quantitative measure of the pollution level in the ocean; and measurement of the depth of the ocean floor.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="81"> 4. China's Technology Gap in Satellite Remote Sensing for Marine Applications The development of marine remote-sensing techniques in the United States began in the mid-1960s; the data used were collected by the TIROS/NOAA satellites and the GOES family of weather satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="82"> In the early 1980s, China began receiving data from the TIROS/NOAA satellites and the GMS satellites, and in the mid-1980s, the data were first used in marine applications.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="83"> Therefore, China is 20 years behind the United States and Western Europe in terms of receiving and applying data from weather satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="84"> Nevertheless, significant progress had been made within the past 10 years and China's current technology has reached a level comparable to that of advanced nations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="85"> But in the area of global weather monitoring and ocean monitoring, little progress can be made until China launches its own satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="86"> China's first experimental weather satellite, the Feng Yun-1A, was launched in September 1988, again 20 years behind the first TIROS/NOAA satellites; further effort is required to improve its operating life and storage capacity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="87"> In July 1972, the United States launched the first land-monitoring satellite, the Landsat-1.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="88"> In 1986, China began receiving remote-sensing data from Landsat-4 (launched on 16 July 1982), and has continued to receive data for the past six years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="89"> Data from Landsat have generated excellent results in the survey of land resources, but they have not contributed a great deal to the important aspect of oceanography -- mapping of the coastal belt and offshore islands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="90"> In February 1992, Japan launched its own Landsat which is equipped with an L-band synthetic aperture radar in addition to a multi-band scanning radiometer; it has a ground resolution of 18 m x 18 m and has large onboard storage capacity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="91"> Therefore, the Japanese Landsat is a satellite with full-duration, all-weather global monitoring capability.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="92"> The first Chinese Landsat is currently under development; it probably will not be launched until after 1994.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="93"> Its detectors are similar to those used on the U.S.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="94"> Landsat-5; in other words, the technology used on the Chinese Landsat is also 20 years behind.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="95"> In June 1978, the United States launched the world's first integrated marine observation satellite, the SEASAT-A.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="96"> It is equipped with five detectors, four of which are microwave detectors, and one is a visible-light-infrared radiometer.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="97"> This satellite operated continuously for over 100 days, during which time it collected various data on ocean wave fields, wind fields, current fields, internal waves, boundaries between land and water, terrains of shallow sea, ice distribution, oil pollution, and terrains of the ocean surface.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="98"> Analysis of the data by scientists in the international community shows that the detectors onboard the SEASAT-A are primarily used to monitor the ocean's dynamic phenomena.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="99"> Improved versions of the SEASAT-A detectors have been implemented on the ERS-1 satellite, which was launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) in July 1991; they are designed to monitor ice conditions in the ocean.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="100"> China currently does not have the technological maturity to launch its own marine satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="101"> The microwave detectors required for marine applications are still in the experimental stage; also, there is a lack of comprehensive research effort to develop microwave remote sensors for marine applications.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="102"> In October 1978, the United States launched the world's first ocean-color monitoring satellite, the NIMBUS-7; it was equipped with a multi-channel microwave radiometer and a coastal zone color scanner (CZCS).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="103"> During 10 years of operation (1978-1988), particularly the first five years, it had collected one-third of the global data on ocean color, ocean surface temperature, and wind velocity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="104"> In addition, the United States is planning to launch another ocean-color monitoring satellite, the SEASTAR.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="105"> Its onboard SEAWIFS detectors with eight visible-light bands are expected to provide better performance than the CZCS.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="106"> In China, there are no immediate plans for launching ocean-color monitoring satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="109"> Sensing for Marine Applications in This Century Satellite remote-sensing technology for marine application in China today is approximately 20-25 years behind the state-of-the-art.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="110"> In order to accelerate the pace of development and to narrow the technology gap, we should concentrate our efforts on the development of integrated techniques for applying remote-sensing data in oceanography.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="111"> We should also emphasize the systematic development of various technologies associated with satellite remote sensing, particularly detector technology, in order to build a good technical foundation in preparation for the launch of China's own marine satellites early next century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="112"> 1. Establishing Ground Systems for Receiving and Processing Satellite Remote-Sensing Data The plan is to extend the capabilities of existing ground stations to receive data from the ERS-1 satellite, the JERS-1 satellite (launched by Japan in February 1992), the ERS-2 satellite (a follow-on satellite to ERS-1, scheduled to be launched at the end of 1994), the RADARSAT (to be launched by Canada in 1994), and three other polar-orbit satellites (the United States, Western Europe and Japan each plan to launch one satellite after 1997).</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="113"> During the 1990s, when China's own satellite remote-sensing technology is still in the early stage of development, the most cost-effective approach would be to make use of the remote-sensing data collected by foreign satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="114"> Such data will be used to meet the growing domestic needs in ocean petroleum development, marine products, marine engineering, ocean transportation, disaster prevention, ocean exploration, ocean management and military applications; this will also provide an opportunity to accumulate a knowledge base in applying microwave remote-sensing data, and to build a solid technical foundation for launching our own marine satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="115"> The establishment of such systems will enhance China's position in the international community of remote sensing for marine applications.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="116"> 2. Establishment of Ground Systems for Receiving and Processing Data From Ocean Color Monitoring Satellites By upgrading existing ground stations of the weather satellites operated by the National Bureau of Oceanography, we will be able to receive data from foreign ocean-color monitoring satellites (e.g.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="118"> In view of the fact that China will not have its own ocean-color satellite during the 1990s, sharing data from other countries appears to be a viable approach.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="119"> The SEASTAR and the ADEOS satellites are expected to continue operating until the end of this century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="120"> They will be able to provide data on chlorophyll concentration in the ocean, suspended mud and sand content, and partial assessment of water quality; such data are important for the development and maintenance of fishing and cultivation zones, the construction of harbors and shipping lanes, and the development and utilization of beach-front areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="121"> 3. Promoting Basic Research of Marine Satellite Technologies The topics of basic research should include various types of microwave detectors (such as synthetic aperture radar, radar altimeter, microwave scattering meter, microwave radiometer, water-color detector and laser fluorescent detector), precision orbit determination techniques and precision measurement techniques.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="12"> In addition, the opportunity to capitalise on the public's concern for the global environment seems too good to miss.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="13"> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the US sees earth observation projects as a way to achieve good public relations after a series of embarrassing failures.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="14"> Efforts to explore deep space with the Hubble space telescope and the Galileo mission to Jupiter have been dogged by technical hitches, and last month the Dollars 980m Mars Observer was lost.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="15"> The European Space Agency has also experienced setbacks.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="16"> It has been forced to delay plans for manned space flights and has bowed to suggestions by member governments that, when they start, it will make use of cheaper Russian technology rather than its own more expensive equipment.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="17"> With manned flights on the back burner, Esa, funded by western European governments, has switched its focus to earth observation.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="18"> In June it approved funding for a project to build Envisat, so far the biggest earth observation satellite.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="19"> 'Earth observation means the arrival of applications that can be used by governments, rather than just scientists,' says Mr Emilio Lanfranco, the Esa earth observation director.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="20"> 'Earth observation now has the highest political interest'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="21"> This attention translates into big contracts on both sides of the Atlantic.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="22"> Today's planned launch - the Landsat 6 satellite made and put into space for Nasa by the American defence company, Martin Marietta - comes three days after the launch of a French satellite designed to do a similar job.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="23"> The FFr1.5bn Spot 3 lifted off from Esa's launch site in French Guiana, South America, on Saturday.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="24"> Built by Matra-Marconi Space, a joint venture between Matra-Hachette of France and GEC of the UK, Spot 3's tasks include map making, urban planning, geology, agriculture and forestry.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="25"> Other Spot satellites have been used by western military allies for surveillance, notably during the Gulf war.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="26"> The biggest project, Esa's Envisat, has a Dollars 2bn budget.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="27"> The joint prime contractors for the 8-tonne satellite are Deutsche Aerospace and British Aerospace.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="28"> The UK company's involvement is a reflection of the British government's championing of earth observation since the late 1980s.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="29"> Set for launch in 1998, Envisat will be followed by a regular programme of further Esa launches.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="30"> It is part of a global push into the environmental field in the second half of the decade.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="31"> Landsat 7, also to be built by Martin Marietta, is due for launch in 1995.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="32"> Japan, whose space agency, Nasda, decided this year to set up its own earth observation division, also plans an advanced earth observation polar platform, the Adeos, to be launched in 1996-97.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="33"> Even newcomers to space such as Brazil and South Africa are planning their own environmental satellites.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="34"> This new emphasis on observation satellites stems partly from their potential for commercial application: pictures of the earth's surface can be sold to various agencies, from the US Department of Defence to British Sugar.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="35"> France has set up an agency to sell pictures from the Spot series of satellites.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="36"> Spot Image, based in Toulouse, has subsidiaries in the US, Asia and Australasia.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="37"> Annual sales have grown from FFr15m (Pounds 1.7m) a year in 1986 to FFr220m in 1992.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="38"> The US Department of Defence is one customer, but wants to reduce its reliance on French photographs by installing a camera on Landsat 7, which can pick out objects 16ft in diameter.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="39"> Several companies in Europe and the US already offer satellite photographs that can be shown on personal computers for a few dollars each.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="40"> A smattering of Russian pictures, taken by reconnaissance satellites and detailed enough to identify objects only 6ft wide, are also trickling on to western markets.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="41"> The market for images of the earth's surface could be extensive.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="42"> British Sugar, for example, plans to use observation data to predict the size of the UK sugar beet crop so that it can plan the capacity of its sugar refineries.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="43"> The commercial potential of environmental satellites has prompted a US company, Orbital Sciences, to go it alone next year.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="44"> It intends to build, launch and operate its own small satellite which will take pictures of oceans, picking out sediment, plankton for use in assessing coastal erosion, and greenhouse gases.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="45"> Such small satellites can be designed and launched quickly and cheaply and are calculated to appeal to private sector customers as well as space agencies.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="46"> Despite the rapid development of the sector, problems could lie ahead.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="47"> Many satellites are being launched for scientific purposes, but since their pictures are finding ready commercial customers, the question of how much to charge different buyers has arisen.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="48"> European companies are not well placed to compete with their US counterparts, says Mr Chris Elliott, an adviser to the European and Japanese space agencies.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="49"> American companies have proved themselves winners in private-sector telecommunications satellites, where California's Hughes Aircraft has 60 per cent of the market, and in broadcasting, where all seven direct broadcasting satellites over Europe were built in the US.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="50"> While US companies such as Orbital Sciences aim to sell to the private sector, he adds, European companies are still dependent on giant space projects such as the Dollars 2bn Envisat.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="51"> Although Mr Elliott's views find little public backing in Europe, space agency officials agree in private that satellite companies could be more entrepreneurial.</s>

<s docid="FT933-678" num="52"> But with billion-dollar contracts such as Envisat's up for grabs, there is not much incentive to change the status quo - particularly when the satellites may be used for such popular causes as improving the environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="15"> The Beginnings of Earth Observation</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="16"> The history of earth observation with satellites began with mankind's first satellite, Sputnik-1, launched by the former USSR in 1957.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="17"> Following on from this, the United States and the former USSR, sent up satellites one after another.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="18"> Amongst these early satellites, Explorer-6, launched by the United States in 1959 was a breakthrough for earth observation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="19"> It was the first satellite to photograph the Earth from space.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="20"> In the same year, the former USSR used a satellite to photograph the dark side of the moon for the first time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="21"> The next big leap was to be in 1961, when Vostok-1, the first manned space ship, was launched by the former USSR.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="22"> Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on board this primitive space ship was the first man in space, a tremendous step in man's history.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="23"> Scores of astronauts have since that time had the opportunity to realize the beauty of the Earth and the frail thinness of the layers of Earth's life-supporting atmosphere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="24"> Manned satellites gave us a new viewpoint of our planet.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="25"> The first earth observation satellite, LANDSAT-1, was launched by the United States in 1972.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="26"> This was followed by another five LANDSATs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="27"> Out of these, two, LANDSAT-4 and LANDSAT-5, are still in operation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="28"> In the latter half of the 1970's, the two superpowers were joined by a new face.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="29"> Japan started earth observation in earnest at this time.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="30"> Japan's Earth Observation</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="31"> Five years after LANDSAT-1, in 1977, Japan launched a geostationary meteorological satellite called Himawari-1.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="32"> This satellite was put in operation and run by the Meteorological Agency the following year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="33"> In 1978, the Earth Observation Center of the National Space Development Agency was established in Saitama Prefecture, north of Tokyo.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="34"> Initially, the center was set up to receive and record data from LANDSAT-2 and LANDSAT-3.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="35"> This function still continues to the present day.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="36"> The data were used to make composite photographs of the Japanese landmass and sales of photographs to users started.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="37"> The Earth Observation Center continued to expand developing its initial functions until it became the key organ for earth observation that it is today.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="38"> Meanwhile, four satellites in the Himawari series have been launched so far.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="39"> The data from the Himawari satellites are utilized mainly by the Meteorological Agency for the prediction of adverse weather conditions such as typhoons and heavy rain and snowfall in addition to normal weather forecasting.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="40"> The images taken by Himawari appear in TV weather forecasts and weather columns in newspapers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="41"> TV stations also compose the images and use computer graphics to superimpose cloud movements when typhoons approach and so on.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="42"> Such weather information is now a vital part of everyday life.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="43"> The first marine observation satellite Momo-1 was launched in 1987, ten years after the Himawari-1.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="44"> This was followed by Momo-1b, which was mounted with the same observation equipment as that of Momo-1, in 1990.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="45"> The 1b unit has the same orbit as Momo-1 and is set at an angle of 180 degrees.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="46"> The purpose of developing the marine observation satellite No. 1 was to establish the basic technology needed to make earth observation satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="47"> This task included development of observation equipment to be mounted on the Momo-1, confirmation of the functions of the equipment and use of the equipment to make experimental observations of the Earth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="48"> Momo-1 carries three kinds of equipment to observe the following: --Distribution of plants, situation of land utilization, geological features, distribution of snow on land, disaster prevention, etc. --Water temperature on sea surface, conditions of ocean currents, red tide, conditions of water contamination, etc. --Volumeof vapor in atmosphere, ice floes, snow on ground, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="49"> In addition, Momo-1 has a function to collect data from buoys floating on the ocean and a basic experiment was also carried out using this system.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="50"> After completing its initially scheduled two-year service with no malfunction, Momo-1 is still in operation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="51"> The satellite Momo-1b, as a successor to the Momo-1, is continuing to observe the ocean, in particular, and the whole Earth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="52"> The most recent in the series is the earth resources satellite Fuyo-1, which was launched last year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="53"> Fuyo-1 was developed in order to evolve observation equipment, including a high-performance radar, to confirm the functions of the equipment and establish a comprehensive system for earth resources observation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="54"> Fuyo-1's main purpose is to probe resources, but the satellite also serves to survey national land and observe the conditions of agriculture, forestry and fisheries and environmental preservation, to prevent disasters and to keep a watch on coastal waters.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="55"> The observation equipment on board the Momo-1 is capable of checking the undulations and inclinations of land surfaces even under rainy conditions and at night.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="56"> It is also able to observe land shapes in three dimensions and distinguish rocks, minerals, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="57"> Japan's earth observation technology is thus shifting from an experimental stage to a stage of new development, in which the technology is widely recognized as effective.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="58"> It will soon become important for Japan to show what she can offer to international society.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="59"> Future Plans</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="60"> Under development now are the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="61"> ADEOS is designed to succeed the marine observation satellite and the earth resources satellite to continue collection of data in earth observation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="62"> The development of ADEOS is also aimed at developing new technology that will be required in order to develop future earth observation satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="63"> A total of eight kinds of observation equipment, of which two will be supplied by the National Space Development Agency and six will be selected from among those offered generally, will be mounted on ADEOS.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="64"> The function of this equipment is to observe the marine climate, the ozone layer, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="65"> The following are the missions for NASDA's two observation apparatuses: --Frequent acquisition of data on water color and water temperature of oceans and detection of chlorophyll density, floating materials and dissolved substances.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="66"> (These missions will give data on the volume of substances produced by marine activities, the mechanism of the circulation of carbon dioxide gas and conditions for fishing operations).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="67"> --Observation of land and coastal waters and surveys of the destruction of tropical forests, desertification and water contamination.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="68"> The equipment will also be able to serve in surveys of land use and to probe resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="69"> TRMM will make observations on global-scale climatic changes, such as the El Nino phenomenon and desertification.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="70"> To solve the mystery of climatic changes, it is necessary to make comprehensive observations of the atmosphere, oceans and land over a long period of time.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="71"> It is particularly important to observe the circulation of water and energy (heat).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="72"> For this reason TRMM will observe rainfall and radiation of heat from the ground surface.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="73"> These observations should be conducted on a global scale, but special emphasis will be placed on the tropical regions, because two-thirds of the rainfall on the earth occurs there.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="74"> The TRMM project is being jointly promoted by Japan and the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="75"> On this side, NASDA of Japan is to launch the satellite with an H-II rocket and to develop radar apparatus for rainfall observation, while NASA in the United States is to develop the main body of the satellite and the remaining observation equipment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="76"> The United States is also in charge of operating TRMM after its launch, using a data relay satellite.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="77"> Two further satellites, ADEOS-II and High Resolution Observation Satellite, HIROS are under development.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="78"> They will be launched to succeed the above satellites in operation and continue to collect data and to improve observation functions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="79"> ADEOS-II will be launched in 1999 mainly to conduct global-scale earth observation as a successor to ADEOS.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="80"> HIROS will be utilized for map drawing and disaster prevention, as it is capable of gathering detailed information.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="81"> Its launch is scheduled for the year 2000.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="82"> Postscript</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="83"> The technology for earth observation is thus about to enter a mature stage.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="84"> The important issue from now will be how to make use of it, using the given means.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="85"> The following are some of the expected applications: (i) Use of satellites for weather forecasting and other activities which directly affects peoples' daily lives (ii) To serve in national land development, covering agriculture, fisheries, urban development, etc., and to probe resources (iii) To watch for disasters and enable effective countermeasures (iv) To understand what is happening on the Earth and to enrich man's fund of useful knowledge (v) To balance the development and preservation of environment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="86"> To use satellites to find the most effective method to solve earth environmental problems, by warning the need to curb human activities, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="87"> It is important today to widen the fields in which satellite data are effectively used and to expand the data utilization volume.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-21242" num="88"> It is necessary to gain a solid recognition of Japan's earth observation efforts from not only Japanese people, but also from the peoples of the world.</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="22"> The twentieth century brought many extraordinary events, and one of the greatest events was mankind's going beyond the bounds of Earth.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="23"> Time will pass, and much will be forgotten, but the first manned flights into space will always be remembered.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="24"> In an unusually short period of time, space exploration has become an area of concentration of the latest achievements of mankind, the apex of scientific-technical progress, and a powerful practical means for solving the most varied of problems, problems that are often of a global scale.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="25"> Now the space program is making a very real contribution to the economy and culture, and it is playing an essential role in securing the safety of the state, in disseminating information to society, in monitoring the environment, and in solving vitally important social problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="26"> In the first decade of the space age, only the USSR and the United States had a space potential of their own that made it possible to effect the entire cycle from development and launch of space vehicles to the practical use of results; now 17 countries are launching their own satellites, and, by 1995, that number is expected to grow to 20-25.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="27"> In all, though, more than 130 countries participate in space activity either directly or indirectly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="28"> Our space program right now is undergoing profound reform, as is the entire economy of the country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="29"> The reform of the space sector entails primarily the development of a new concept and a long-term policy and program for Russia's space activity, plus the realization of new economic relations, a defense doctrine, and the interests of domestic and foreign consumers, including the states of the CIS.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="30"> In the process, it is vitally important that the space- related scientific-technical and intellectual potential that has been created be preserved and be used effectively.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="32"> The year 1992 was a difficult year for our space program.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="33"> Because of the sharp drop in orders for space hardware, space-industry enterprises and organizations found themselves in a very difficult financial position, and space research became unprofitable.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="34"> The reorientation and shutdown of specialized plants for space hardware got under way.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="35"> The ties that were in place are still being severed to this day, and the danger of losing state-of-the-art technologies and a substantial number of highly skilled specialists has not disappeared.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="36"> All that, plus the hundredfold rise in prices for rocket fuel, electronics, metals, and energy carriers, is leading to the curtailment of space activity in our country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="37"> In addition, the scaling down of the armed forces in Russia has resulted in a problem with the personnel who used to support the functioning and maintenance of the ground-based infrastructure used in the civilian space programs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="61"> Plans also call for considerable expansion of the telephone channels for stationary users (so-called fixed communications).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="62"> The currently existing system for such communications, Potok-SV, uses Gorizont satellites placed at 10 points in geostationary orbit and the ground stations Azimut, Orbita, Zevs, Nauka, and Pikhta.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="63"> In addition to providing 2,500 telephone channels, it feeds the first television program to the Moskva network of stations and 3-4 channels of mobile communications.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="64"> Unfortunately, because the orbital inclination cannot be corrected, the Gorizont satellites, by the end of the third year of their operation, shift 2ë in latitude, which exceeds the geostationary-satellite position norms allowed by the International Telecommunications Union, and they must be taken off line immediately.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="65"> Plans call for the development and building by 1995 of an upgraded Ekspress satellite operating in the range of 4/6 GHz, with a traffic capacity that is 1.5- to twofold greater and a more advanced system for control and correction of orbit (the program will be implemented by the Russian Space Agency, the Russian Ministry of Communications, and commercial structures).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="66"> Those satellites will gradually replace the Gorizont vehicles and will occupy three additional backup points in stationary orbit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="67"> Also expected is the creation, by 1997, on the basis of that same equipment, of the Ekspress-M satellite, which operates in the 11-14 GHz range, with a traffic capacity four- to fivefold greater than that of the Gorizont satellite.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="68"> The implementation of that program will reduce the needs for channels of fixed and nationwide communications by fivefold.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="69"> For setting up mobile communications (primarily, in the interests of the merchant marine), one channel of the Gorizont satellite relay is now used, which satisfies only 10 percent of the needs for such communications.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="70"> The Program calls for the creation of a separate communications system, Marafon, on the basis of the geostationary Arkos satellites and the highly elliptical-orbit Mayak satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="75"> At present, satellite television broadcasting is provided to Russia and the other countries of the CIS by the Ekran system, which is based on two Ekran-M1 spacecraft (in the 0.7 GHz range, the signal goes to a network of simplified receiving stations), as well as by the Potok-SV system, which is based on several Gorizont satellites (the signal is transmitted in the 4 GHz range to a network of Moskva and Orbita stations).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="76"> Plans call for the creation of the Gals satellites for the transfer of satellite-based television broadcasting in the 12 GHz range, which has been allocated by the world community for those purposes; after Gals will come Gals-R and Gelikon, with the number of TV channels increased to seven from three.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-23691" num="77"> The implementation of the above-enumerated projects will make it possible to solve almost completely the problem of setting up multiprogram zonal television broadcasting for the countries of the CIS and to provide regional television broadcasting in ethnic languages.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="16"> Must Be Viewed From Above"; the first paragraph is an introduction and the last six paragraphs provide general information] [Text] Images of the Earth's surface obtained by space monitoring, once of interest only to the military, have now become the object of an extremely large-scale business whose scope, according to a number of estimates, already exceeds a half-billion dollars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="17"> Monitoring data are valuable for organizations and enterprises engaged in exploration for and production of mineral resources, agriculture and the fishing industry.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="18"> They are needed by all who are associated with ecological problems, prevention and elimination of the consequences of natural and man-induced catastrophes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="19"> Space photographs, which "in color" are rather impressive, were on display at the International Exhibition "Oil and Gas-93," which ended yesterday in Moscow, including in displays of the Priroda and Soyuzkarta enterprises.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="20"> The situation in the world market for these products is discussed by our reviewer Sergey Morgachev and our expert Ilya Neyman.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="21"> Photograph Business; Four Points of Reference</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="22"> Four factors can ensure success in this specific market: low costs for the launching and production of satellites, high quality of the images themselves (equipment resolution and a number of other special characteristics), high quality of equipment and technologies for the interpretation and processing of images and, finally, the presence throughout the world of a well-developed network of points for the reception and processing of telemetric information (this ensures routineness in the client receiving the desired product).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="23"> In the first and second links of this chain Russia has completely competitive positions, in the third the situation is uncertain, but in the fourth Russian enterprises for the time being have not moved from the starting line.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="24"> Production costs and the cost of launching a payload into orbit in Russia, as is well known, are an order of magnitude below the world level.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="25"> If one speaks of the equipment carried on satellites operated by civilian organizations, Russian technology has superior characteristics (see table).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="26"> With respect to military satellites for visible reconnaissance, there are no precise data on Russian capabilities (the American photosatellite KN-11 ensures a resolution up to 15 cm, whereas the Lacrosse radar satellite ensures a resolution up to 60 cm).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="27"> However, here it is not the technical level in general which is important, but the characteristics specifically of that equipment which is used for commercial purposes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="28"> According to the specifications of the Russian government (August 1992), for commercial purposes it is possible to use equipment with a resolution up to 2 m, which unquestionably will provide Russian users of this technology advantages in technical competitiveness.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="29"> However, it is unknown how long this advantage will persist: in the United States the possibility of declassifying photographs with a resolution up to 1 m is already being considered.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="30"> The general backwardness of Russia in computer technology is greatly limiting its capabilities for creating image processing outfits.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="31"> If one speaks of the processing of optical information, for the time being there are no alternatives to the use of imported equipment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="32"> The situation is more encouraging with respect to the processing of radar information: at the NPO ELAS a highly productive processor has been developed and already is in use in which a number of original technological solutions have been introduced.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="33"> The only Russian foreign terminal for the reception of satellite information is located, evidently, at the Military Technical Reconnaissance Center operated at Lourdes (Cuba), but it is only possible to make proposals on the incorporation of this terminal into commercial operations.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="34"> A Foreign Network Must Be Established</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="35"> Insofar as is known, in Russia there are now four organizations engaged in the processing and commercialization of satellite images: the Almaz enterprise (founder -- NPO Mashinostroyeniye, Reutov, Moscow Oblast), working with radar images from the Almaz station; the Sovinformsputnik enterprise, working with photographs from military satellites (founders -- Central Special Design Bureau, Samara, and two other government agencies which the authors promised not to mention); the AO Soyuzkarta (founders -- private individuals; this organization inherited the functions of the former VO of the same name) and the State Center Priroda as part of the Russian Federal Service for Geodesy and Cartography.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="36"> Priroda and Soyuzkarta are commercializing photographs of satellites of the Resurs-F series.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="37"> The scales of activity of these enterprises constitute a commercial secret, but it can be assumed that real business for the time being is going on only at the latter two organizations, long concerned with this business and having the experience and the clientele.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="38"> Taken together, with an optimistic estimate, their annual sales may now be about a half-million dollars.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="39"> A primary product (copies of photographs) and its derivatives (photoplans, photomaps) are produced.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="40"> As a rule reference is to a low degree of processing, although there also are orders for preparation of a complex product.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="41"> The activity of Sovinformsputnik and Almaza for the most part is of a publicity nature and evidently their transactions do not exceed the limits of tens of thousands of dollars annually.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="42"> In general, however, the share of Russia in the primary world market for satellite photographs and their derivatives in any case does not exceed 1%.</s>
<FIG>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="43"> World (primary, commercial)</s>
</FIG>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="44"> There are several reasons for this.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="45"> First of all -- the stiff opposition of American and West European competitors who control the market; this applies to both the sale of the "raw product" and to a still greater degree to the processed product (Russian enterprises began to work in the Western market only several years ago -- earlier their activity was restricted to the socialist countries).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="46"> Second, the incompatibility of processing standards, making the sale of the processed material very difficult.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="47"> Finally, the problem of a foreign network.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="48"> Accordingly, the approach to success lies in the broad use of imported interpretation equipment and the adaptation of Russian analogues to Western technologies, agreement with Western partners on the organization of a unified network of surface complexes and changeover to work with information in digital form.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="49"> And, finally, simply through stubborn marketing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="50"> This activity scarcely will bring success in Western Europe, where the influence of France and the United States is too great; the most likely chance is to exploit old and new connections in the developing countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="51"> If Russia has pretenses to broadening its share in the world market, it must also incorporate the strictly technical trends in this sphere -- for example, the use of systems of light artificial earth satellites launched by light inexpensive boosters.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="52"> Such a project is now being developed by the Alenia Spacio Company (Italy) and in Russia by the NPO Energiya.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="55"> Petersburg). The developers and producers of radar apparatus are the NPO Vega, Scientific Research Institute for Precise Instruments, Special Design Bureau EI (Moscow) and the NPO ELAS (Zelenograd).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="56"> What is Space Monitoring?</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="57"> It includes exploration for minerals; monitoring of the state of agricultural areas, forests, ice, the world ocean and its resources, and in general the state of ecosystems; warning of and elimination of the consequences of natural misfortunes (drought, floods, fires) and industrial catastrophes (tanker accidents, toxic effluent, etc.).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="58"> Monitoring is carried out using optical and radar apparatus aboard space vehicles.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="59"> The information is "dumped" through radio channels to surface telemetric complexes or in the form of a film, passes through a greater or lesser number of computer processing stages and is trasmitted to the client, usually along communication lines in digital form.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="60"> Who's Who in the World Market</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="61"> The world market for space monitoring products is, according to approximate estimates, 50-100 million dollars annually.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="62"> This is the primary market, that is, sales of companies which have access to the initial information from satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="63"> Their products pass through several processing stages and then the price may increase in comparison with the initial cost by an order of magnitude or more.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="64"> As a result, according to estimates, the market attains 500 million dollars, although here there is evidently repeated recalculations involved.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="65"> In the market the leader is the French company Spotimage, operating the SPOT satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="66"> In contrast to the LANDSAT and ERS projects (see diagram), to a considerable degree oriented on the finalizing of technologies, the initiators of the SPOT project from the very beginning took measures for active advertising, establishment of a strong information-technical and commercial network.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="67"> If one reckons the final costs and revenues in this business, it is unprofitable: the expenditures on the development of satellites, their launching and operation, are too great.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-42527" num="68"> But the government (both in the United States, in France and in Russia), pursuing strategic goals, is assuming a large part of these expenses, which makes possible profitable operation of the commercial firms.</s>

<s docid="LA021290-0037" num="11"> Wataru Tanaka, a science fiction writer and self-described "aerospace exploration commentator," nearly became the first Japanese to venture into space.</s>

<s docid="LA021290-0037" num="12"> He hatched an outrageous plan four years ago to bring home a surplus American rocket and blast himself into orbit.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA021290-0037" num="13"> But Tanaka, 58, whose credits include a book titled "The Taste of Lettuce Eaten In Space," gave up his dream after running into a wall of red tape.</s>

<s docid="LA021290-0037" num="20"> And in a peculiar drama that gives a new meaning to the "space race," Japanese government astronauts and private cosmonauts are competing to see who will be the first to take a Rising Sun flag to the heavens.</s>

<s docid="LA021290-0037" num="21"> Japan's primary space agency, the National Space Development Agency or NASDA, is training two men and a woman to serve as payload specialists on the U.S. space shuttle Atlantis in a flight scheduled for June, 1991.</s>

<s docid="LA021290-0037" num="22"> At the same time, a commercial television network, Tokyo Broadcasting System, has paid a hefty sum, reportedly $10 million, to Moscow for the privilege of sending one of its journalists aboard the Soviet space station Mir in a mission that could come as early as the end of this year.</s>

<s docid="LA021290-0037" num="38"> The scientific organization that launched the lunar orbiter, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), grew out of a low-key research laboratory at Tokyo University that pioneered Japan's efforts to escape gravity in 1955 by launching 9-inch-long "pencil rockets".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="22"> For future budgets, as for the budget adopted in 1992, CNRS has distinguished between companion appropriations and the budgets proper of GANIL [Large National Heavy Ion Accelerator] and Saturne.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="25"> Developments in 1991-1992</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="26"> Expenditures for TGEs, exclusive of personnel costs, totaled 2,150 million French francs [Fr] in 1992; the corresponding figure for 1991 was Fr2,000 million (cf.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="27"> 1992 report).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="28"> Thus, absolute spending (without adjusting for inflation) increased by 7.5 percent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="29"> Although CNRS outlays remained practically unchanged (cf.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="30"> Table 2), CEA's dropped sharply (-94 million) by reason of serious budgetary problems in 1992.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="31"> The net increase [i.e.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="32"> for TGEs] was due principally to the space sector (+147 million for CNES) and to the Fr38 million voluntary contribution made to CERN, without which spending in that category would have remained unchanged.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="33"> The apparent decline of personnel outlays (Fr926 million in 1992 versus Fr965 million in 1991) is due solely to a change in the method used by IN2P3 to determine the sums allocated to TGEs: The old method added in both the budgets proper of the TGE facilities and the primarily personnel-related expenditures allocated to the laboratories.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="34"> These latter are now more correctly included under companion appropriations (see part three of this report).</s>

</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="36"> Nonpersonnel outlays rose from Fr2,150 million in 1992 to Fr2,328 million in 1993.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="37"> The Fr178 million increase (up 8.3 percent) is again due primarily to the steady growth of space programs (+ 157 million), especially ENVISAT-1, but in lesser degree to restoration of the CEA budget to its previous level (+20 million, principally for Super Torus).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="38"> Start-up costs for Project VIRGO are responsible for the Fr32 million augmentation of CNRS's budget.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="39"> Absolute spending on personnel was unchanged at about Fr925 million.</s>
<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="40"> Post-1993 Projections</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="41"> Nonpersonnel spending is programmed to increase by Fr115 million between 1993 and 1994 (from 2,328 million to Fr2,443 million).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="42"> For the first time in many years, the augmentation is not due to space programs, which are slated only for moderate growth (+20 million).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="43"> CNRS outlays are scheduled for a substantial increase (+53 million), primarily because of Project VIRGO (+59 million), the agency's other programs remaining at the previous level or even declining, as in the case of ILL [Laue Langevin Institute], which is down Fr13 million in light of new accords between the three partners.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="44"> Should construction of the LHC at CERN not get under way in 1994, the authorization in the CERN budget for this project (about Fr60 million) will be reviewed.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="45"> For out-years, no growth in spending is programmed (Fr2,455 million in 1995), which leaves little room for discretionary spending to launch new projects--especially on the part of CNRS, whose projected budgetary needs for 1995 (Fr298 million) are 29 percent greater than for 1992 (Fr231 million).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="46"> Though outlays by the individual institutions were not itemized, simultaneous financing of all projects currently on the drawing boards at CNRS and CEA (GANIL-Plus, the 15-GeV [billion electron volts] European electron accelerator), Orpheus-Plus, the SOLEIL synchrotron radiation source, [particle] detectors for the LHC, etc).</s>

<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="49"> Long-term Trends (Nonspace)</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="50"> If one calculates the growth of nonpersonnel expenditures, excluding outlays entailed by the space programs of CNES and CEA, the diminution of real spending for the TGEs, first seen in 1992, continues in 1993 as shown in the following table: Table 1: Nonpersonnel Outlays for Non-Space-Related TGEs (millions of French francs) Year 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 Total 1,082 1,085 1,127 1,187 1,192 1,197 1,290 1,289 1,226 Current francs 1993 francs Total 1,266 1,221 1,226 1,254 1,225 1,197 1,290 1,289 1,226 Constant 1993 francs In current francs, five-year growth from 1988 to 1992 is only 10.2 percent, or two percent per year on average, significantly less than inflation, as shown in the second line of Table 1.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="51"> The spending level for 1993 will be very close to the 1992 level, i.e. no increase.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="52"> Projections for 1994 offer the hope of some renewed growth in allocations for non-space-related TGEs, principally as a result of an expanded VIRGO program.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="53"> The stagnation of (non-space-related) TGE spending seen in the last few years is due to several factors: - the commitment of certain agencies such as CNRS [National Scientific Research Center] to rein in growth of TGEs and wait several years before launching new projects; - limitations--indeed, reductions in the case of the CEA--in the financial resources at the disposal of the various institutions; - the small number of new projects that have come to full maturity in the last few years; - the large share of new research funds earmarked for space programs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="54"> As in reports for previous years, it is interesting to note (Table 2) the changing ratio of nonpersonnel TGE-related spending to total research ministry program authorizations in the budget bill for CNRS and CEA, two agencies heavily involved with TGEs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="77"> The value to the French scientific community of having access to an apparatus like SOLEIL is scarcely in question.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="78"> We must be assured, however, that a premature positive decision not lead to dispersion of efforts within the French community: It would be a pity not to make maximum use of the ESRF [European Synchrotron Radiation Facility], a high-quality facility in support of which France makes a heavy financial contribution.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="88"> The Council endeavored, in its first meetings in 1988, to clarify the notion of TGEs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="89"> These are instruments whose importance for the scientific community and whose cost to build justify a decision-making process concerted at the national level and multiyear financial programming: - Such facilities must be international in their scientific impact, even if managed at the national level.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="90"> - The research center that develops around the instrument in question must be a hub that attracts a significant portion of the French researchers in the discipline concerned, as well as a number of foreign research teams.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="91"> - Most TGEs are built in the framework of an international collaborative effort: Even where such a facility is entirely national, it should figure prominently in France's international cooperation policy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="92"> - Financially, construction of a TGE necessitates multiyear programming and demands, if not a temporary or permanent increase in the budget of the responsible institution, at least a significant reprogramming of that budget.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="93"> Given its role as a hub for the discipline concerned, financing is in general provided by all the institutions active in that field.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="94"> - The minimum consolidated construction cost (including personnel outlays) for a national TGE amounts to several hundred million francs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="95"> If the facility is an international one, the French share is on the same order of magnitude, and the total cost of the facility is generally in excess of Fr1 billion.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="96"> Owing to these criteria there exists, between TGEs and the so-called "light-heavyweight" facilities (rarely costing more than Fr10-15 million), a third category of important facilities ("heavy infrastructure") which must appear under separate budgetary headings at the agency level but do not require a decision-making process that involves participation of the Council on Large Scientific Facilities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="100"> It is quite evident, especially for the later years, that figures furnished by the institutions are only provisional: They constitute, at the current scientific juncture, the best estimate of needs to come.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="101"> The final figures may be amended, among other factors, as a result of the need to take new projects or the overall growth in institutional budgets into account.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="102"> It should also be noted that the budgetary programming presented here covers only those facilities for which a firm go-ahead for construction was given prior to 31 December 1992.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="103"> Projects on which a Council opinion is still under preparation are presented in the second part of this report.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="104"> Information furnished by the institutions has been used to prepare two groups of tables: - a breakdown of all facilities by broad scientific discipline (Tables I-1 to I-6); - a comprehensive breakdown by research institution and responsible ministry (Tables II-1 to II-6), which has been placed at the end of this report (Annex A5) to keep down the length of the main text.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="105"> Annual expenditures for each TGE are presented in three columns: - personnel expenses, covering persons employed at the TGE itself.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="106"> These outlays can be evaluated very accurately for the national TGEs and for most of the international TGEs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="107"> However, the appropriate breakdown between personnel outlays and construction expenses is very difficult to establish for CNES and ESA [European Space Agency] scientific programs, and has not been obtained; - operating expenses, which cover all nonpersonnel expenditures obligated after the TGE went into service.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="108"> These include both operating costs and new investments to improve or extend the facility's capabilities; - construction expenses, which include all nonpersonnel outlays entailed by construction of a TGE up to the time it goes into service, as well as major remodelings.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="109"> This classification, which puts the information into the form most useful for the Council, does not necessarily correspond to typical budgetary breakdowns between ordinary expenditures and program authorizations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="110"> The reasons for this are explained in Annex A3.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="111"> Since appropriations for the institutions are granted on an "all-taxes-included" basis, the data provided in the tables are quantified in the same way.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="112"> Because of the special tax status enjoyed by CEA, it is difficult to establish the precise amount of taxes paid by each facility: An average rate of 9.3 percent was added to the HT [taxes not included] data to rationalize comparisons of CEA data for national TGEs with data from other facilities.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="118"> CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research/European Particle Physics Laboratory: the acronym comes from its original name, European Council on Nuclear Research) has seen the number of its member states grow from 14 in 1990 to 17 as of 1 January 1993 with the entry of Finland, Poland, and Hungary.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="119"> The Czech and Slovak Republics will be admitted separately in the course of 1993, bringing the number of member states to 19.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="120"> Scientific activity in 1992, as in the previous year, was focused on exploitation of the LEP [Large Electron-Positron Collider].</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="121"> Thanks to several important technical advances, beam intensity is expected to exceed specifications in the very near future.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="122"> As a result, more Zë boson decays were observed in 1992 (3 million) than in the three previous years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="123"> Very precise tests of the "standard model" are carried out with the help of four large detectors whose performance is being steadily improved.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="124"> The program to augment the beam energy level continues: By the end of 1994, the energy level should be high enough to produce a pair of W bosons (160 GeV); the maximum energy level of 180 GeV should be reached by spring 1995, with installation of 192 superconducting accelerator chambers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="125"> The performance of the first chambers delivered by the manufacturers (including one French enterprise) regularly exceeds contractual specifications.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="126"> Beginning in 1993, 48 LEP chambers will be operational.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="127"> Finally, work continues apace on preparatory studies for construction of the LHC, both the apparatus itself and the detectors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="128"> This subject will be discussed in greater detail in the second part of the present report.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="129"> The annual budget of CERN's basic program for 1993 totals 951 million Swiss francs; growth from 1992 is less than inflation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="130"> A further reduction of about 2.5 percent is planned for 1994, Germany having been exempted from contributing the full amount of its quota until 1995.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="131"> The French contribution for 1993, representing 16.6 percent of the combined normal contributions of the 14 "original" member states, comes to 153.3 million Swiss francs (down 2 million Swiss francs from 1992), or about Fr567 million (one Swiss franc = Fr3.7, as of 1 February 1992).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="132"> France in 1992 was able to make a voluntary contribution of 10 million Swiss francs, thanks mainly to fluctuations in the exchange rate, to help resolve the dispute with the Eurolep consortium.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="133"> As in previous years, we must add to the contribution the sum of about Fr50 million for repayment of taxes on the income of French international employees residing in France.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="134"> Thus total appropriations to CERN in 1993 will amount to about Fr617 million.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="135"> The breakdown shown in Table I-1 (particle physics, nuclear physics, fusion) is calculated by applying to our contribution the overall relative proportions of the three expense categories in the CERN budget.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="136"> The only expenditures listed in the "construction" category are those associated with the LEP (final instalment to pay off debts incurred for Phase I in 1992 and completion of Phase II) or programmed for construction of the LHC if approved at the end of 1993.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="137"> The figures corresponding to the years 1995 and 1996 all concern the LHC: In case the decision is postponed, they would of course be revised.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="138"> As will be recalled, the HERA (Hadron Elektron Ring Accelerator) electron-proton collider went into service in Hamburg in June 1992.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="145"> Operating and capital expenses for the two facilities are divided equally between CEA and CNRS/IN2P3.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="146"> a) GANIL (Large National Heavy Ion Accelerator) is a three-cyclotron unit, in service since 1984 and currently one of the best installations in the world in its field, which is acceleration of heavy ions over a vast range of masses and energies, on the order of several tens of millions of electron volts per nucleon.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="147"> Research there focuses primarily on exotic nuclei and general properties of nuclear matter.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="148"> Nonpersonnel operating expenses planned for 1993 amount to Fr52 million.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="150"> Companion appropriations for outside research teams for experiment preparation are listed and discussed in the third part of this report.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="151"> GANIL's budget for 1993 should be sufficient to allow it to return to a normal operating schedule (37 weeks) instead of the 33-week schedule funded in the 1992 budget.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="152"> Future prospects for GANIL, apart from obtaining very high-intensity beams, depend on installation of radioactive beams, which will open up a new line of research in nuclear structure.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="153"> A final proposal will be presented in 1993: If approved, the financing required beginning in 1994 would amount to about Fr12 million (all taxes included) per year for each of the three partners (CEA, IN2P3, and the Basse-Normandie region).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="154"> b) The Saturne accelerator, rebuilt between 1974 and 1978 as an "intermediate" energy accelerator dedicated to nuclear physics and enhanced in 1987 by a new injector (MIMAS), accelerates protons up to 3 GeV and "light" heavy ions up to 1.2 GeV per nucleon.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="155"> It is the world's best generator of polarized protons and deuterons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="156"> It is used to study the internal structure of nuclei and nucleons with the help of the "hadron detector," which offers the advantage of high effective sections but has the disadvantage of complex interaction with the object being studied.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="157"> Except in the domain of polarized light ion beams, Saturne's capabilities are now exceeded by those of the SIS [strategic information system] synchrotron at Darmstadt.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="158"> For 1993, its operating budget is Fr38 million, divided equally between CNRS and CEA.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="159"> This is enough to support 5,000 hours of operation (versus 4,500 hours in 1992), while maintaining accelerator and experimental equipment operations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="162"> It should be noted that the personnel costs borne by CEA (Fr60 million in 1993, versus Fr14 million for IN2P3) are particularly high: The equipment is operated primarily by CEA personnel, but most users are employed by IN2P3 or foreign laboratories.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="437"> a) Detection of gravity waves (Project VIRGO) This project in fundamental science, under the leadership of CNRS/IN2P3, involves a broad spectrum of physicists and astrophysicists, theoreticians, and experimenters.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="438"> It was approved by the Council in 1992, and in cooperation with Italy it has now been launched.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="439"> CNRS is considering committing a Fr40 million program authorization in 1993 to this project, which is described in detail in part two of this report.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="440"> b) Manned space flights These are experiments carried out with human beings in attendance, under microgravity conditions (10[.sup]-3[/] to 10[.sup]-5[/] g).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="441"> The primary areas of research involved are: --study of human behavior during manned flight: - understanding the effects of gravity on the process of perception and spatial orientation; - analysis of adaptive responses of major physiological functions to microgravity (cardiovascular and immune systems) --biology: reproductive functions, radiation environment and its effects on living tissue; --physical sciences in general: materials, crystal growth, atomic physics, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="442"> The latter two research categories do not require the presence of human beings and could be pursued with robotic equipment.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="443"> CNRS in 1993 will spend Fr170 million on all these programs, the cost of which is bound to increase.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="444"> The manned flight program is an important element of bilateral collaboration programs (United States, Russia) and the ESA program (notably the European contribution to the Freedom space station, which could require sizable investments).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="449"> a) Construction of the European Transonic Wind Tunnel (ETW) at Porz (Germany) continued in 1992, remaining on schedule.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="453"> Projections of total cost remain under the budget ceilings set by the governments of the four participating countries (France, Germany, Great Britain, Netherlands).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="454"> France's 28-percent share of costs in the construction phase (which ends in 1994) will translate in 1993 into a Fr37 million contribution from the Ministry of Transport (and an equal amount from the Ministry of Defense).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="455"> b) The METEOSAT network of meteorological satellites in geostationary orbit was developed under the overall lead of the European Space Agency and is exploited by the meteorological organization EUMETSAT [European Meteorological Satellite Organization].</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="456"> France's share in 1992 was financed with a Fr139 million contribution from the Ministry of Transport (national meteorological directorate).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="457"> This subsidy is listed in the BCRD under technical programs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="461"> [table omitted] The operational character of the METEOSAT satellite network prompted EUMETSAT to reposition one of its satellites to compensate for the delay in stationing of an American satellite, thus to ensure coverage of the Atlantic zone for the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="462"> One of the tangible benefits from this action was the detection of Hurricane Andrew last August and issuance of an alert a week before its passage over Florida.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="463"> The expected increase in appropriations between 1993 and 1996 will be sufficient to keep the existing system operational until about the year 2000 (construction of two additional satellites and one launch), to begin building the new-generation satellites that will replace them, and finally to fund European participation (per international agreements) in observations from polar orbit, which today only the United States can conduct.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="464"> The budget augmentation is less than projected initially.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="465"> In fact, from a technical standpoint the METEOSAT satellite system is doing so well that the launch date for the next satellites could slip without jeopardizing continuity of EUMETSAT operations; having loaned METEOSAT-3 to the United States to cover for the delay in orbiting GOES-Next, we can expect the favor to be reciprocated at some point, should the METEOSAT system run into problems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="492"> As previously noted, in rendering its opinions the Council decided to put most emphasis on the following points: - the scientific value of the project and its impact on the discipline concerned; - the size of the community of potential users and the structuring role of the facility for that community; - the role of the facility at the international level, and analysis of the cooperation expected; - construction and exploitation costs, attendant laboratory costs, personnel needs, and ramifications for institutional and agency budgets.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="493"> These conditions have already been formulated explicitly in the previous reports.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="497"> At that time it indicated its interest in the scientific objective pursued and noted the high technical caliber and overall quality of the scientific teams proposing it; it underlined the necessity for further strengthening these teams and continuing with the research and development needed for fabrication of the antenna and precise evaluation of costs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="498"> The analysis, presented in the 1991 report, is updated in what follows.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="503"> Even more importantly, such detection would have the long-term consequence of giving birth to a new mode of observation in astrophysics.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="504"> The physical observation being sought is an infinitesimal variation in the distance between two mass points during the passage of a gravity wave.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="506"> The collapse of the core of a supernova situated in our galaxy will generate a brief signal (1 millisecond), one of the most intense imaginable, but this type of event is rather infrequent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="507"> It is thus necessary to be able to detect more distant supernovas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="508"> Consequently we must aim for a relative sensitivity of 10[.sup]-21[/] to 10[.sup]-22[/] (approximately the ratio between the radius of an atom and the distance between the earth and the sun).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="509"> Such sensitivity would also make possible the observation of other sources whose existence is all but certain.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="510"> In short, this is an experiment in fundamental physics which requires recourse to highly multidisciplinary technologies, and whose impact on astrophysics, albeit long-term, could be essential.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="511"> Technical characteristics of the project: The development of laser metrology opens up the possibility today of interferometric detection of gravity waves thanks to increased sensitivity over a wide band of frequencies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="512"> This approach is much more promising than those hitherto explored.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="513"> The interferometry projected for VIRGO has the structure of a Michaelson [interferometer], i.e. a separating plate that splits the laser beam into two waves propagating along two perpendicular arms.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="514"> The passage of a gravity wave train induces differential deformation of the two arms, producing a phase displacement of the partial wave, thus a change in observed luminosity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="515"> The optimal signal level (differential phase displacement of the two arms) is reached when the optical length L of each arm is equivalent to one-fourth the length of the gravity wave.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="516"> For a band of frequencies below the kilohertz [kHz], this yields optical paths greater than 75 km in length.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="517"> Inasmuch as such a length is not practically attainable, the arms of the interferometric apparatus, 3 km long, form a Fabry-Perot [resonating] chamber with a grid fineness rating of 50.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="518"> Despite this optimization, the effect to be measured is still infinitesimal (10[.sup]-16[/] m).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="519"> Preparations for VIRGO were responsible for several complex technical advances: computer-programmed simulations of the precise characteristics of optical components, vibration isolation, high vacuum in a large container, and an extremely stable single-mode Neodymium/YAG laser.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="520"> It is important to note that indisputable proof of the existence of gravity waves can only be obtained by simultaneous detection of these waves by two independent detection devices, to be certain of eliminating ground noise mimicking the signal being investigated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="521"> Structure of the project: New researchers, engineers, and technicians became involved in the project in 1991.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="522"> About 90 people are currently participating in it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="523"> Project teams have made considerable progress in defining and testing all components of the antenna with the exception of mirrors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="524"> As early as 1991, the scientific value of the project was accepted unreservedly by scientific experts independent of the project.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="525"> The reliability of the technology, the modalities, and the cost of building the antenna were set forth in February 1992 in the "Final Conceptual Design" (FCD) prepared by the Italian and French promoters.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="526"> At the request of INFN [Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics] and CNRS, experts reviewed it in April 1992.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="527"> The experts have submitted a very favorable recommendation, which was taken into consideration along with subsequent comments from the scientists concerned.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="528"> Investment and timetable: This favorable evaluation led CNRS to request a formal opinion from the Council, with a view to giving top priority in the TGE program to finance this project.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="529"> The antenna would be installed at Cascina, near Pisa.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="530"> Construction would last six years and cost 81 million ECU in 1992 currency (about Fr540 million), to be divided between INFN (55 percent) and CNRS (45 percent).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="531"> Personnel needs have been estimated at about 500 man-years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="532"> Most personnel will be researchers, engineers, or technicians belonging to INFN or CNRS; their salaries are not included in the above figures.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="533"> International context: Detection of gravity waves is the subject of research in all major countries, but especially the United States and Europe.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="534"> Project VIRGO today is collaborating closely with America's counterpart Project LIGO and receives scientific and technical support from English and German researchers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="535"> After Britain's SERC backed off from a joint project with Germany's MPG, that project was shelved.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="536"> But European efforts to build at least one antenna in Europe are being more closely coordinated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="537"> A tripartite ad hoc committee--called for in an April 1992 declaration of common interest signed by CNRS, INFN, and MPG--met in Geneva in May of that year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="538"> It recommended that German, British, French, and Italian physicists and engineers expand technical collaboration and coordinate their research and development efforts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="539"> Representatives of MPG confirmed their interest, though the latter is not currently in a position to participate in financing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="540"> Collaboration with the American Project LIGO (which calls for two antennas in the United States) has been expanded, with a view to correlating future American and European observational data.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="541"> In comparing the two projects, the Council made the following comments: - In its initial version, VIRGO will be able to make finer measurements: The American antennas will be much less sensitive below 50 Hz and about equal between 100 and 10,000 Hz; - there are significant design differences between VIRGO and LIGO, a fact which will reinforce the credibility of signals detected by all the antennas; - assuming the existence of two American antennas with sensitivity equal to VIRGO, the latter's presence would significantly augment the probability of detecting a signal; - the two LIGO antennas will not be built simultaneously: NSF [National Science Foundation] estimates that the second will be completed a little less than two years after the first, and VIRGO would be completed before the second American antenna.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="542"> In consequence, given the acknowledged value of the scientific objective pursued, the quality of the proposing research teams, the excellence of their comprehensive description of the project, the solid European cooperation embedded in it, and the collaboration already established with Project LIGO (which was launched in 1992), the Council recommends unreservedly that: - this project proceed to the construction phase as early as possible, i.e. as soon as research budgets permit; - the agencies and institutions put in place a very well articulated structure for the project group, with responsibilities well defined, to assure strong coordination and complementarity of French and Italian teams working on subsystems of the novel and highly technical antenna; - progress on the project be reviewed at regular intervals by a review committee composed of experts not involved in the project; - as early as possible the appropriate manufacturers be informed of or involved in development of project components, especially the mirrors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="543"> The CNRS's council on large instruments has also endorsed Project VIRGO.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="544"> But the construction schedule and corresponding program authorizations have been altered to take into account what CNRS can contribute (Fr40 million for construction) and to smooth out the 1994 spending surge entailed by the optimal timetable proposed in the FCD.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="545"> This means about six months' slippage in completion of the project.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="546"> The Italian partner, INFN, has accorded it top priority among its special projects for the next five-year plan, which is to be negotiated during the first half of 1993.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="553"> The ring, with an energy level of about 2 GeV, should have the characteristics of so-called "third-generation" devices and be able to function either at high intensity or with a low number of packets to permit experiments involving time correlations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="556"> This document gives a brief description of a 2.15 GeV machine, indicates the principal technical variables that dictate the structure of the project, and gives a more exhaustive presentation of scientific arguments in favor of the new equipment.</s>

<H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="564"> National and international context</s>
</H5>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="565"> a) LURE Laboratory: The current status of the LURE laboratory is described in the "SOLEIL" report.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="566"> The laboratory presently operates three machines: the DCI, the Super-ACO, and the injector that serves both.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="567"> DCI: Built between 1971 and 1975 for high-energy physics, it was used for that purpose for 9 years but was converted in 1985 into a synchrotron radiation source.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="568"> The 1.85-GeV energy beam generates photons at energy levels between 3 and 25 keV [kiloelectron volts] on magnetic dipole lines and 3-40 keV on lines from the superconducting wiggler.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="569"> The machine is notable for the exceptional duration of its powerful beam (55 hours at an intensity of 300 milliamperes [mA]).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="570"> It is handicapped in some experiments however by the large transverse dimension of the positron packet (hence of the optical source), the lack of sufficient space surrounding the ring, and limitations on the number of insertions (only one in practice).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="571"> It presently has 22 experiment stations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="572"> Start-up funds provided in 1990 should be sufficient to ensure acceptable operations up to the end of the decade.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="573"> Super-ACO: Built between 1982 and 1987, this ring was the first of the so-called third-generation machines dedicated to synchrotron radiation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="574"> The source is small in size, and its cross-sections can accommodate up to six undulators.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="575"> At present it has 28 experiment stations operated full-time or on a shared basis around the ring.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="576"> It currently is the best machine in the extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray range.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="577"> With energy of 800 MeV [megaelectron volts], it permits coverage of the visible band up to 5 keV and will soon operate in the millimetric wavelength range (the SIRLOIN experiment now in the final stages).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="578"> It is the only machine that makes such massive use of temporal structuring of the beam, which operates 50 percent of the time in a stable two-packet mode, with a 120-nanosecond interval, at a total intensity of 200 mA, while the other half of the time it operates in a 24-packet mode at a total intensity of 400 mA for production of high-flux photons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="579"> Injector: This is a linear accelerator with energy of 2.3 GeV which with the help of a converter generates positrons with energy of 1.1 GeV.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="580"> The choice of positrons is justified by the fact that they make it possible to obtain beams that are more stable and have longer duration than electrons.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="581"> The oldest part of this apparatus dates from 1957, the most recent from 1968.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="582"> With this impressive equipment endowment and with what might be called its adolescent years behind it, LURE has grown considerably in recent years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="583"> In 1991 it had close to 1,300 users working at some forty experiment stations--a load factor that makes use of almost all possible beam lines.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="584"> Seventy-five percent of users are French (European demand has been rising steeply over the last two years), and participation is evenly balanced between the Paris region and the provinces; industrial demand (including demand assimilable to industry, such as calibration of on-board satellite instruments for ESA via IAS [Institute of Space Astrophysics], or experiments conducted by CEA's DAM [Directorate of Military Applications]) accounts for about 10 percent of all work sessions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="585"> The number of projects submitted and the number of users have more than doubled in the last 6 years.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="586"> This trend, noted at LURE as well as other centers, shows no sign of leveling off--quite the opposite.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="587"> LURE's weak points have to do with the age of some of the equipment: The injector is old, too big, and very costly to maintain; the DCI ring, built 20 years ago for elementary particle physics, is no longer competitive with machines being built now.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="588"> On the other hand, the Super-ACO could continue to play an important role in its domain for many more years if furnished with a modern injector.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="589"> b) Status of the project vis-a-vis ESRF: ESRF is beginning to get into operation at Grenoble well ahead of schedule, and is already obtaining excellent beam quality.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="590"> However, several objective considerations argue for giving French researchers access to a complementary machine that operates at lower energy levels: - The ESRF source is unable to cover the ultraviolet to far-ultraviolet to soft x-ray range (photons with energy less than 1 keV, basically the domain of Super-ACO).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="591"> Also, it is unlikely that the time-structured configuration can be used with the ESRF synchrotron radiation source; - our financial contribution will give French researchers access to about 25 percent of ESRF's operational availability, the equivalent of about ten full-time experiment stations (including time used by collaborating research groups).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="592"> Access will thus be difficult and competition very tough.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="593"> Experience in the neutron domain has demonstrated the utility of having, along with ILL, facilities at LLB for purposes of training users, conducting standard analytic tests, preparing original experiments, developing new technologies, and serving the needs of industry.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="594"> c) Other projects in Europe: Several facilities that are comparable to SOLEIL (energies between 1.3 and 2.5 GeV) and complementary to ESRF are already in operation or under construction in neighboring countries: - In Germany, DORIS III (at Hamburg) will be augmented, per a very recent decision, by the BESSY II in Berlin, a third-generation ring optimized for the ultraviolet-far ultraviolet-soft x-ray range; - In Italy, ELETTRA will enter into service in Trieste in 1994 with a program very comparable to that of SOLEIL; - In the United Kingdom, since 1987, the SRS at Daresbury has been Europe's best source of high-intensity x-rays.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="595"> A new machine is under study (DAPS [Daresbury Advanced Photon Source]); In Sweden, construction of the MAX II at Lund has been authorized; In Spain, plans are being considered to install a 2.5-GeV synchrotron in Catalonia (Barcelona).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="596"> Technical characteristics of the project: Project SOLEIL is the result of taking the following factors into consideration: - user requests, described hereinafter; - the experience acquired in developing ACO, DCI, and Super-ACO; - experience at the international level, ESRF in particular.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="597"> The project starts from the concept of a 2.15-GeV positron storage ring (i.e.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="598"> with enough energy for the undulator to function properly in the kiloelectron volt range) with about thirty emission points, about one-third of which are multi-user, for a total of about forty experiment stations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="599"> The circumference of the ring is close to 200 m.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="600"> Its energy is comparable to third-generation machines such as ELETTRA and BESSY II.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="601"> With optimization of parameters, the ring can be very compact and cost-effective.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="602"> The apparatus supports maximum-flux operation with a total intensity of 300 mA (240 packets) and beam life of 15 to 20 hours, the possibility of operations with one to six packets, and unit intensities of 10 mA for more than 10 hours with excellent emissivity (greater than Super-ACO at 800 MeV, and 10 times greater than DCI).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="603"> It should be noted, and this is the most novel feature of the project, that the solution adopted meets user needs in terms of both emissivity and beam duration, accommodating both temporal structuring and high flux.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="604"> Most of the technical decisions have already been made, thanks in part to the experience acquired by LURE itself and to the optimizing solutions adopted by other centers.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="605"> This is the case in particular for alignment techniques, which will be based on ESRF's experience (alignment by hydraulic level, with lifters capable of effecting displacements on the micrometric scale in a gamut of frequencies ranging from.1 to several dozen Hertz while preserving excellent time precision).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="606"> Already finalized options concern utilization of positrons (despite its initial cost), sextipoles fully integrated into the quadripoles, generalized utilization of split-pair control of beam elements, the vacuum chamber, injection, photon beam stability, and topography of the building.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="607"> Two options are still open.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="608"> They concern radiofrequency acceleration and beam lines, an area where LURE, despite its own experience, is very closely following developments under way at other centers to stabilize photon beams.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="609"> As for the injector, in light of the experience amassed and the options adopted in numerous other projects, the proposal is leaning toward the idea of a booster synchrotron adjoining the positron source rather than a long linear accelerator.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="610"> Accordingly, the system will include: - a 200-MeV linear electron accelerator delivering beam pulses of 2 to 5 A [Angstrom units] via an electron-positron converter; - a converter (e[.sup]+[/]/e[.sup]-[/] output =0.02 GeV); - a linear positron accelerator with an energy of 400 MeV; - a booster synchrotron accelerating the positrons at 2.15 GeV before injection into the ring, the two accelerators being built by a company with expertise in the field.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="611"> With the booster option, and assuming it is built at the Orsay site, the estimated cost is Fr700 million HT (1991 prices).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="612"> The proposal calls for financing in two stages.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="613"> The first (five year) stage corresponds to construction of the machine and two-thirds of the beam lines; the second, also five years long, would see installation of the final one-third of the lines and introduction of experiments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="614"> Scientific justification: This takes into account the strong pressure for utilization of methodologies already mastered, openness toward other research sectors, and the possibility of new upstream research in the physics of radiation-matter interactions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="615"> For the source to have characteristics that meet these three objectives, three options were explicitly adopted: spectral range, temporal structure, and photon beam polarity.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="616"> A doubly versatile machine was needed: coverage of both UV and x-ray bands by numerous insertion units, and operations at either high intensity or utilizing the unique temporal beam structure of this type of machine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="617"> Beyond the intensive discussions between engineers and researchers entailed by these objectives, an instrument was required which, from an interdisciplinary perspective, was optimized in an energy range where coupling of structural and electronic research is maximized.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="618"> a) In atomic and molecular physical chemistry, the challenges first of all concern particles that are unstable or difficult to produce.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="619"> These include radicals and transitory particles that govern elementary chemical reactions, van der Waals molecules and aggregates, the structure and reactivity of which are not precisely understood, and simple and multiple-charge ions found in plasmas, the ionosphere, or in interstellar space.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="620"> Owing to high densities, high-resolution spectroscopy of these particles is essential.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="621"> SOLEIL's high-flux capabilities, in the ultraviolet as well as x-ray region, will provide that resolution; its pulsed character will allow spectroscopy of threshold electrons and field ionization.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="622"> Apart from current developments in ion disintegration (selective photochemical reactions, dissociation dynamics), this domain is not yet well developed, owing to insufficient intensities, whereas in this energy range the typical nuclear vibration cycles are equivalent in time-span to the duration period of gaps in the inner shells (10 fs [femtoseconds]), giving rise to interference effects not yet well explored.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="623"> Finally, in this sector of research, SOLEIL will make it possible to perform experiments combining two sources of photons (RS [radioscopic source] + laser, or RS + free-electron laser) for the study of ionization of excited particles and dynamics of short-term dissociation (50 ps [picoseconds]) in order to understand transition states in the break-up of complex molecules.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="624"> b) In biophysics, the demand of biocrystallographers in the areas of x-ray diffraction, diffusion, and absorption is constantly growing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="625"> The domains concerned, where the frantic pace of international competition impels us to decisive and immediate action, range from time crystallography to the study of molecular interaction with very large groups of molecules, to studies of microcrystal structure, to resolution of the phase problem by use of anomalous dispersion at variable wavelengths.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="626"> In this respect, SOLEIL is complementary to existing facilities elsewhere, Grenoble in particular.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="627"> The other category concerns the study, using pulse fluorometry, of dynamic and structural properties of proteins in solution and multimolecular systems (membranes, micells).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="628"> Synchrotron radiation, which makes it possible to repeat a great number of measurements across a wide range of wavelengths of excitation, offers the only means of meeting this demand.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="629"> The tunability of energy wavelengths and operability with small numbers of packets complement the picosecond laser measurements; the high flux levels of SOLEIL's undulators permit studies of weakly fluorescent samples as well as kinetic experiments with excellent quantification potential.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="630"> c) In the domain of surfaces and interfaces, the synchrotron remains an essential tool, notwithstanding near-field microscopy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="631"> In the hard x-ray domain, ESRF opens up new possibilities, but a majority of experiments must continue to rely on an intense white source centered in the soft x-ray region (hv less than 3 keV), which ESRF covers rather poorly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="632"> By permitting x-ray absorption in polarized light, combined with anomalous glancing diffraction and stationary waves, it supports structural, electronic, and magnetic depiction of imbedded interfaces, which are of capital importance in miniaturized systems.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="633"> With SOLEIL, angular photoemission and photodiffraction can be further improved with resolutions down to a few meV [millielectron volts].</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="634"> Numerous domains (opening of "gaps," quantic "wells," Kondo effect) are sure to benefit.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="635"> With polarization, photoemissivity will yield information on magnetic moments at the surface of magnetic materials.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="636"> SOLEIL's capabilities will allow further progress in surface EXAFS [expanded x-ray absorption fine structure] and glancing-incidence diffraction on very thin heteroepitaxies, and much broader extension of the infrared spectroscopy work begun on the Super-ACO with vibrations of adsorbed molecules.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="637"> The primary benefits will be very high resolutions (cm[.sup]-1[/]) and excellent sensitivity (up to 10[.sup]-3[/] unilayers).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="638"> d) In the materials sciences, x-ray adsorption or diffraction is important in a great number of domains, in particular materials that are unordered on the large or very small scale (aggregates, films, multilayers).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="639"> In addition, the recent trend away from stationary systems toward studies of the dynamics under stress of the crstallographic and electronic parameters of materials creates a considerable need, no more than one-third of which currently can be satisfied.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="640"> In Project SOLEIL, the very important feature of polarization, especially in adsorption, will support structural anisotropy and studies of local magnetism by selective measurement of partial density of spin for a given type of atom.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="641"> By virtue of the geometric characteristics and duration of beams, SOLEIL should greatly facilitate adsorption experiments not only at high resolution but also with multiple stresses.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="642"> Another important and unique feature in the domain of adsorption, also linked to high resolution, has to do with K-threshold light-element spectroscopy (low-energy domain: 200-3,000 eV).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="643"> The excellent extractability of different events at this level should make it possible to obtain direct structural information simply by examining structures near the thresholds.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="644"> With other structural methods (diffusion and diffraction), SOLEIL will continue to provide a useful service for a traditional but wider community: that of occasional users who, having extracted the maximum information compatible with their semi-heavy equipment, employ the source for its white spectrum and its wavelength tunability, its linear and circular polarization capacities, and its microsecond temporal beam structuring.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="645"> It can be predicted that such users, given the nature of their needs, will not be using high-energy source such as ESRF over the medium term.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="646"> These users want a high-quality, easily accessed source of intermediate energy that incorporates recent progress and responds to their needs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="647"> This large community must not be forgotten, because it plays a very important role in current developments on new materials: quasicrystals, superconductors, multilayers, fullerenes, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="648"> Site of the machine: Much of the LURE laboratory's current success is a function of the exceptionally fine scientific environment in which it is situated: the immediate vicinity of the University of Orsay and the Saclay nuclear studies center, close to the large universities of Paris.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="649"> At the technical level, LURE has considerable drawing power vis-a-vis the large nearby CEA and IN2P3 laboratories.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="650"> Current estimates of the cost of the project assume a site on the Saclay plateau, at Orme des Merisiers, where 15 hectares of land belonging to CEA is available.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="651"> The land and soil characteristics--important to consider--are excellent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="652"> Assuming a site outside Ile-de-France [the Paris region], one would have to take into account, in addition to problems of accessibility, the currently strong interaction with the local science and technology community, and the percentage of researchers and engineers willing to accompany the project away from Orsay, and the costs such a transplantation would entail: creation of new work areas, reception facilities, ease of access to site, scientific environment, etc.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="653"> At all events, a gradual disappearance of large installations at the Orsay-Saclay complex would seriously weaken this important scientific hub.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="654"> Remarks and recommendations of the Council: At the current stage of the proposal, the Council is not in a position to issue precise recommendations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="655"> The usefulness for the French scientific community of having a machine such as SOLEIL seems to admit of little doubt.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="656"> As a scientific instrument it would complement the ESRF, toward which France makes a heavy financial contribution: Assurances would be needed that the communities concerned have the capacity to exploit them both.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="657"> The most difficult problem with which institutions affected by the project must concern themselves is how to finance it.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="658"> Projections of TGE-related expenditures presented in the first part of this report appear to leave no resources available, in the short term, to finance construction of SOLEIL unless these institutions receive significantly larger allocations for TGEs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="659"> The Council is thus waiting for these institutions to submit precise proposals exploring all the possibilities .</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="661"> In its 1991 report, the Council examined the LHC issue, which at the time was presented in a preliminary form that required future technical and financial studies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="662"> With the information then at its disposal, the Council was in a position to "recommend that France maintain a positive attitude in pursuit of negotiations to secure approval of the project by the member states of CERN, provided however that the growth in our own contribution remain limited and that the companion appropriations necessary to build the detectors must for the most part be found by redeploying current budgets in the discipline".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="663"> At its meeting in September 1992, the Council undertook to review the status of progress in the decision-making process and on preparation of the detector proposal.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="664"> The TGE Council took note of an important resolution of the CERN Council, adopted unanimously at its December 1991 meeting.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="665"> In that resolution, the CERN Council declared: - "that in every respect the LHC is the right machine to ensure the future of CERN and continuation of its mission;" - that before the end of 1993 the director general shall furnish detailed information on the cost and participation of member and nonmember states, to enable the Council to move toward a decision on the LHC; in particular, information is required on the following points: --technical feasibility of the project; --best estimate of the final cost of the machine, sources of finance, and timetable for delivery of components; --details of the program of experimentation, its objectives, and direct costs to CERN, as well as indirect costs that will have to be borne by the financing agencies of the principal participating institutions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="666"> The year 1992 was marked by important progress in design and preparation of the LHC: - the injection system, utilizing existing accelerators (including the 26-GeV PS and the 450-GeV SPS), was tested successfully; - the machine's grid was optimized.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="672"> Important steps were taken in 1992, in particular at an important colloquium held at Evian in March, where 650 physicists from 30 countries met for a broad discussion of possible experiments and the detectors needed to conduct them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="673"> In November, CERN hosted a meeting for public presentation of the "letters of intent" prepared by three collaborative teams that hope to build and operate a detector.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="674"> Only two detectors can be installed adjoining the machine, and the LHC committee on experiments will therefore have to make its decisions before the close of 1993--probably thereby encouraging some restructuring of the groups: - the ATLAS team has chosen a magnetic field created by a large toroid, which permits precise measurement of muons, complemented by a superconducting coil in the center.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="675"> The electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry uses a liquid argon detector; - the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) team proposes to install a high-resolution electromagnetic calorimeter (CeF[.sup]3[/] crystals) inside a large superconducting solenoid (3-meter radius) providing a 4-Tesla field; - the L3P (Lepton and Proton Precision Physics) team proposes far-reaching modifications to the L3 detector installed for the LEP, to adapt it to the LHC.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="676"> French teams are strongly represented in ATLAS and to a lesser degree in CMS and L3P.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="677"> Their research and development efforts have focused on calorimetry, trace measurement, and radiation-resistant electronics.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="679"> Each team involves between 400 and 900 researchers representing 50 to 90 laboratories.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="680"> Depending on which proposals are accepted, the estimated cost (exclusive of salaries) would be between 300 and 450 million Swiss francs per detector.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="681"> France's cumulative investment in LEP detectors amounts to Fr170 million (1983 francs), or Fr240 million in 1993 currency.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="682"> Assuming a French contribution of 15 percent of the total cost of the two LHC detectors, and taking the lower cost estimate (600 million Swiss francs), we obtain a burden of about Fr350 million, or 50 percent more than France's cumulative investment in LEP detectors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="683"> The Council remains concerned by the magnitude of the financial burden which institutions will have to shoulder to participate at an appropriate level in construction of these detectors.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="684"> It wishes to obtain detailed information from them on how they plan to accomplish this, given that the majority of such financing will have to be found by internal reprogramming, as it already recommended in 1991.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40388" num="685"> The Council is also waiting to be provided with all the information promised to the member-state delegations by the CERN directorate--in principle before the end of 1993--before rendering a definitive opinion on the project.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44683" num="18"> Officials at the French space agency consider it a "good budget" and one that underscores the fact that "as far as the political authorities are concerned, space remains a priority," according to a statement by CNES President Rene Pellat at the agency's annual press conference on 16 March.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44683" num="19"> With a civilian and military space budget accounting for 40 percent of the amounts being invested in space by Europe, "France remains the European leader in that area" and must keep that role within the ESA [European Space Agency], Pellat added.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44683" num="20"> The CNES is nevertheless going to place a ceiling of some Fr5 billion on its participation in ESA programs pending a reformulation of European space policy, which "should be decided on in mid-1995 during the next ministerial conference".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44683" num="21"> "That ceiling is not the result of an anti-ESA stance," Jean-Daniel Levi, general director of the CNES, pointed out.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44683" num="22"> "Our participation in that agency will remain as it is; it will always be a compromise between our national programs and those of the agency".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44683" num="23"> Pellat emphasized that the agency "is essential to Europe, but it cannot carry out military programs, whereas we must do so".</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44683" num="24"> Of the total Fr11.039 billion--program authorizations (Fr8.4 billion), ordinary expenditures (Fr875 million), and own funds (Fr1.764 billion) combined--47.95 percent will be used for French participation in the various programs of the ESA, to which France, along with Germany, is the biggest contributor; 5.65 percent will be used for bilateral cooperation with countries such as the United States and Russia; 19.44 percent will be used for the national program; 15.06 percent will provide operating support for the programs; and 11.9 percent will be used for general operations, Levi said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44901" num="18"> It was a solid-propellant rocket 23 centimeters in length and 1.8 centimeters in diameter and was smaller than a model rocket used in competitions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44901" num="19"> Its range was about 1-1.5 km.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44901" num="20"> It was followed by various rockets -- such as Baby, Kappa (weighing 1.75 tons), Lambda (9.4 tons), and Mu (over 40 tons) -- which started space science in this country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44901" num="21"> The first satellite made by Japan, Oosumi (23.6 kg), was launched by a Lambda-4S rocket, which was a four-stage rocket.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44901" num="22"> It made Japan the fourth country in the world to launch a satellite -- after the USSR, the United States, and France -- but it was in 1970, 13 years after the launch of Sputnik 1 by the USSR.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44901" num="23"> Oosumi's main task was the observation of the upper atmosphere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44901" num="24"> It was developed by the Aerospace Research Laboratory of the University of Tokyo (currently the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science), which was founded in 1964 and has since been continuously in charge of developing rockets for launching scientific satellites.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44901" num="45"> The propellants were kerosene and liquid oxygen for the first stage and hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide for the second stage, and they were the same as those used for the Thor-Delta rocket.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44901" num="46"> The vehicle was guided by a radio guidance system, in which the speed and location of the vehicle were measured by means of a radar, and the navigational information based on that measurement was sent to it on a radio wave.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44901" num="47"> The N-1 launch vehicle made its debut when it succeeded in launching the engineering test satellite Kiku, which was roughly a sphere with 26 facets, 80 cm in diameter, and weighed 82.5 kg; the N-1 launched a total of seven satellites, including the observation satellite, Ume, and the practical communication satellite, Ayame.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44901" num="48"> It also succeeded in lifting the country's first geostationary satellite, Kiku 2, on 23 February 1977.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44901" num="61"> The first-stage engine, the MB-3, was also used on N-type vehicles, so the key point of the development was the second-stage engine.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44901" num="62"> The same type of engine had been developed by the United States, the USSR, Europe, and China by then.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44901" num="63"> After \|[yen ]\|160 billion and six years, the H-1 made its debut with a two-stage prototype in August 1986.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-44901" num="64"> It successfully launched the geodetic satellite, Ajisai, and the amateur satellite, Fuji, followed by Kiku, which was launched by a three-stage version of the launch vehicle the following year.</s>
