<s docid="FBIS4-23026" num="21"> Research Antiplague Institute of Siberia and Far East] [Abstract] The proliferation of antibiotic resistant strains due to wide uses of antibiotics in infectious disease therapy and as fodder additives for agricultural livestock and the observed variability in the strains' resistance to chemotherapy preparations prompted an investigation into the stability of Vibrio comma isolated from the water of surface reservoirs in the Far East in Siberia in the past 15 years to antibiotics.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23026" num="22"> To this end, 1,383 El Tor strains isolated from 12 administrative regions (from Amur to Tyumen and from Yakutia Sakha to Buryatia) are tested for their resistance to eight antibiotics: ampicillin, streptomycin, monomycin, polymyxin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, rifampicin, and nalidixic acid.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23026" num="23"> The findings do not display a common tendency toward increasing the resistance but confirm the observed variability, especially for Ap, Sm, Mn, and Pm.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23026" num="24"> Of these, most strains are resistant to Pm, Ap, and Sm (up to 100% in some years) and the least number are resistant to Cm and Tc (0.4 and 1.9%, respectively); in some cases a geographic correlation is established.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23026" num="25"> In addition, a direct quantitative dependence of the resistance level on the minimum inhibitory concentration is revealed: the lower the the minimum inhibitory concentration, the fewer the number of resistant strains.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23026" num="26"> The findings may be used for comparative retrospective analyses of the antibiotic resistance of Vibrio cholerae isolated in different regions and for solving certain epidemiological problems.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="7"> Diphtheria strikes at the heart of European Russia.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="8"> Hantavirus starts killing Navajo Indians in the south-western US.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="9"> Drug resistance fuels a resurgence of the world's two biggest killers, tuberculosis and malaria.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="10"> And the global Aids epidemic sweeps on.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="11"> The current spate of stories about plague and pestilence may hasten the end of what the US Institute of Medicine calls an 'era of complacency' - a period of about 30 years, during which the medical profession and general public assumed that they had won the war on acute infections and focused instead on chronic degenerative disorders such as cancer, heart disease and mental illness.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="12"> 'We claimed victory too soon,' said Dr Robert Shope, professor of epidemiology at Yale University and co-chairman of the institute's committee on emerging infections.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="13"> 'The danger posed by infectious diseases has not gone away.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="14"> It's worsening'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="15"> Changes in the environment, in human behaviour and in the microbes themselves are interacting in a complex way to set the stage for new diseases to emerge and old ones to reappear.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="16"> The main factors include: Poverty and population growth.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="17"> Diseases thrive in overcrowded third world cities with inadequate sanitation and unclear water.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="18"> An alarming example is a new strain of cholera now spreading fast through the Indian sub-continent; meanwhile the previous cholera epidemic, which originated in Indonesia in 1961 and reached South America in 1991, is still killing thousands of people a year.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="19"> Development of forests.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="20"> The rapid human intrusion into tropical forests is exposing people to new reservoirs of infection in animals and insects.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="21"> Several 'new' diseases are probably caused by old monkey viruses, including Aids, Ebola and Marburg fever.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="22"> In the eastern US, the rapid increase in Lyme disease is due mainly to housing development close to wooded areas; the bacteria responsible are carried by ticks from woodland mice and deer - their normal hosts - to people living nearby.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="23"> International travel and commerce.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="24"> Increased mobility can spread a new disease rapidly around the globe wherever it arises.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="25"> Aids, for example, probably took hold first in tropical Africa, travelled along the Mombasa-Kinshasa highway with truck drivers, soldiers and prostitutes - and reached the western hemisphere by air.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="26"> Farming and food processing.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="27"> Intensive animal rearing can transfer germs from animals to humans.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="28"> Microbiologists believe that the most dangerous strains of influenza arise in south China where integrated pig-duck farming is practiced; the animals act as genetic 'mixing vessels' in which genes from different flu viruses are recombined.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="29"> Today's record levels of salmonella food poisoning in Europe and north America are linked to large-scale poultry production.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="30"> Civil unrest and political instability.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="31"> Pestilence has been linked with warfare throughout history; a current example is the epidemic of Kala-Azar, a virulent form of leishmaniasis, a disease spread by sandflies which has killed an estimated 50,000 people as a result of the prolonged civil war in southern Sudan.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="32"> Political disruption can also lead to disease, as the current outbreak of diphtheria in Russia shows; its principal cause seems to be a breakdown of the immunisation system in the former Soviet Union.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="33"> Drug resistance.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="34"> Misuse of antibiotics has produced drug-resistant strains of many bacteria.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="35"> In western industrialised countries, thousands of people die every year from antibiotic-resistant infections which they pick up while in hospital for other reasons.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="36"> Tuberculosis, which kills 3m people a year worldwide, is beginning to acquire antibiotic resistance.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="37"> And the fight against malaria, now responsible for 2m deaths a year, is hampered both by drug-resistance in the microscopic parasite that causes the disease and by pesticide-resistance in the mosquitoes that carry it.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="38"> Many microbes can undergo genetic changes at frightening speed - either random mutations or responses to environmental forces.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="39"> As Mr Robert Walgate of the World Health Organisation's tropical diseases research unit put it, 'one can see the 20th century, subjecting micro-organisms to so many pressures, as the most ambitious short-term experiment in evolution in the history of the world'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="40"> Under those circumstances, it is not surprising that some unpleasant new forms of viruses and bacteria arise.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="41"> For example the latest cholera strain, known officially as 0139 Bengal, causes similar symptoms to its predecessor -diarrhoea, vomiting and severe dehydration - but appears to last longer in the environment and may be more difficult to eradicate from water supplies.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="42"> Microbiologists advocate a four-pronged strategy to contain the threat of infectious diseases.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="43"> Surveillance. 'Global infectious disease surveillance is the most urgently needed first step to protect ourselves,' said Dr Stephen Morse, a virology professor at New York's Rockefeller University.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="44"> WHO and the Federation of American Scientists are sponsoring a conference next month in Geneva, to lay the foundations of an international network of monitoring centres, located mainly in the tropics.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="45"> The global network would use the latest genetic and computer technology to spot emerging diseases, rather as the Centres for Disease Control does in the US.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="46"> CDC was quick to identify the cause of a mysterious fever that has killed at least 20 people in the south-western states this year; the fever was a new Hantavirus spread by mice.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="47"> Vaccines. One disease has already been eradicated by mass vaccination: smallpox in the 1970s.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="48"> Several others that exist only in humans, with no animal reservoirs, could be wiped out in the same way and WHO says its campaign to eradicate polio by 2000 is on target.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="49"> But prevention of many other diseases, including malaria and Aids, will require new vaccine technology.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="50"> Drugs. Doctors must learn to be more sparing in their use of antibiotics, prescribing them only for known bacterial infections; doctors must also stop contributing to drug resistance by giving broad-spectrum antibiotics to patients with ill-defined symptoms who are unlikely to benefit.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="51"> At the same time, pharmaceutical researchers need to develop not only new classes of antibiotic but also drugs against viruses and parasitic diseases such as malaria.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="52"> Sanitation and hygiene.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="53"> As Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, WHO director-general, put it, 'cholera is the litmus-test of a country's socio-economic well-being.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="54"> For as long as there is lack of proper sanitation facilities and safe drinking water, epidemics of cholera are bound to return, time and again'.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="55"> In our present dirty world, with its inadequate drugs, vaccines and surveillance, is there a threat of more serious epidemics than those raging today?</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="56"> The apocalyptic nightmare would be a new microbe combining extreme virulence -quickly killing a high proportion of those infected - with high transmissibility, passing easily from person to person through normal social contact in an otherwise healthy population.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="57"> Fortunately the human virus that came closest to that combination of virulence and transmissibility is the one already eradicated, smallpox.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="58"> Some microbiologists say there are theoretical reasons for believing that the chances of anything similar arising again are extremely low.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="59"> Viruses introduced from animals may cause lethal fevers but they do not pass easily between humans.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="60"> But Dr Shope warns against complacency.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="61"> 'The most disastrous emerging event might be another pandemic of influenza, like the 1918-19 pandemic that killed 20m people worldwide,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT933-7438" num="62"> 'But we don't know what the next event is likely to be and we must prepare to be surprised.'</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="7"> Infectious diseases are re-emerging as a serious threat to health in advanced industrialised countries, the US National Academy of Sciences says in an alarming new report.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="8"> A particular cause for concern is the growing resistance of microbes to antibiotic drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="9"> The NAS report follows a series of calls by American microbiologists and epidemiologists for an end to the 'era of complacency' about infectious illnesses.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="10"> 'The medical community and society at large have tended to view acute infectious diseases as a problem of the past,' said Robert Shope of Yale University.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="11"> 'But that assumption is wrong.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="12"> We claimed victory too soon'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="13"> The drugs industry is listening to such views - and is attracted by the growing commercial potential of antibiotics.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="14"> Their sales are now accelerating fast, after a sluggish spell in the 1980s.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="15"> Stewart Adkins, a pharmaceutical analyst at Shearson Lehman, estimates that the worldwide market for antibiotics was worth Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13bn) last year, 12 per cent up on 1990.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="16"> 'Drug resistance is the key driver of the market,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="17"> Soon after penicillin came into use in the 1940s, microbiologists began to find resistant strains emerging, as a simple result of selective evolution.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="18"> If any bacteria survive a course of antibiotic treatment, they will be the ones with natural resistance, while their more susceptible sisters are wiped out.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="19"> However, pharmaceutical researchers managed to avert a penicillin resistance crisis by discovering new classes of antibiotics - cephalosporins, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, carbapenems - which doctors could use instead.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="20"> As bacteria became resistant to one drug, doctors could prescribe another.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="21"> But for some bacteria, this approach has come to the end of the road.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="22"> All over the world, people are dying as a result of infections which do not respond to any of the 160 different antibiotics on the market.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="23"> The problem has been exacerbated by excessive use.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="24"> Although antibiotics attack bacteria rather than viruses, there are still many doctors willing to prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics to patients with ill-defined symptoms that are almost certainly viral in origin.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="25"> And the veterinary industry has contributed by dosing farm animals with unnecessary antibiotics.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="26"> Estimates of the total cost of antibiotic resistance in the US range up to Dollars 30bn a year.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="27"> Organisms in which resistance is a serious problem include Streptococci, Staphylococci, Enterococci, Pseudomonas, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and many others.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="28"> They cause a horrifying range of diseases, from pneumonia to meningitis.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="29"> People are most likely to fall victim to a resistant organism when they go into hospital.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="30"> In the US, 5 per cent of patients - some 2m people - pick up infections they did not have when entering hospital, and more than 20,000 of them die every year, according to the NAS report.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="31"> 'Every year, hospital-acquired infections account for between Dollars 5bn and Dollars 10bn in additional medical-related expenses'.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="32"> Meanwhile, drug companies continue to develop novel antibiotics for use against microbes that are resistant to the old ones.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="33"> Several promising newcomers come from Japan.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="34"> Lorabid, discovered by Kyowa Hakku and just launched in the US by Eli Lilly, is the first in a new class of oral antibiotics with a broad spectrum of activity, the carbacephems.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="35"> Pharmaceutical analysts say Lorabid could be a Dollars 1bn-a-year blockbuster for Lilly, the leading US antibiotics manufacturer.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="36"> In the UK, ICI has high hopes for meropenem, discovered by Sumitomo and developed as an Anglo-Japanese collaboration.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="37"> Meropenem - due to be launched in Europe in 1994 - belongs to a related class of antibiotics, the carbapenems, which also have a very wide range of anti-bacterial activity.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="38"> But SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US group, has taken the lead in tackling resistance head on.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="39"> Bacteria protect themselves against many antibiotics by producing an enzyme called beta-lactamase which destroys the antibiotic before it has a chance to destroy them.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="40"> After a long search SB found a substance, clavulanic acid, which inhibits the production of beta-lactamase in bacteria.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="41"> SB combined clavulanic acid with amoxyllin, a well-established derivative of penicillin, to create Augmentin.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="42"> Augmentin cures a wide range of infections that are resistant to amoxyllin itself and its sales are rising rapidly.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="43"> This year or next, Augmentin is expected to overtake Lilly's Ceclor and become the world's best-selling brand of antibiotic.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="44"> According to SB, no resistance to Augmentin has yet emerged.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="45"> But the drug is by no means powerful enough to deal with all bacteria, and SB scientists are developing other combinations of antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors, which promise to be more potent and wide-ranging.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="46"> At the same time, several small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working on more radical solutions to the resistance problem.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="47"> They are using natural peptides - small protein molecules produced by living creatures such as frogs, insects and bacteria themselves as a chemical defence against microbes - as a basis for developing alternative bacteriocidal drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="48"> These peptides, which go by various names such as bacteriocins, magainins and cecropins, work in a quite different way to conventional antibiotics.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="49"> They kill bacteria by 'punching holes in their cell walls so that their guts spill out,' as David Guttman, chief executive of Applied Microbiology, puts it.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="50"> It is far more difficult for bacteria to evolve resistance to this external attack than to antibiotics, which interfere with their inner workings.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="51"> Applied Microbiology, a biotechnology company based in New York, is developing drugs based on nisin, a peptide produced by Lactococcus bacteria in milk to kill off competing microbes.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="52"> Nisin is manufactured in the UK by Aplin & Barrett - now owned by Applied Microbiology - and has been used as a food preservative for 30 years without any resistance emerging.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="53"> By combining nisin with chemicals known as chelating agents, scientists at Applied Microbiology have created powerful drugs with a broad spectrum of anti-bacterial activity.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="54"> One target is Helicobacter pylori, an important cause of peptic ulcers.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="55"> Magainin Pharmaceutical, based in Pennsylvania, is focusing on defensive peptides which frogs secrete from their skins.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="56"> The company's first magainin drug, a topical antibiotic for skin infections, started human clinical trials last month.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="57"> In the UK, Proteus is using computer-aided molecular design techniques to change the structure of the peptides, so as to make them more potent and longer-lasting than the natural chemicals.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="58"> Its drugs have shown promise in laboratory tests but are not yet ready for human trials.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="59"> A limitation of many peptides is that they are broken down by the human digestive system and therefore cannot be taken by mouth to give a systemic effect.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="60"> But Magainin is developing modified versions which could be systemic antibiotics.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="61"> And Jay Moorin, chief executive, is excited about a recently discovered molecule, squalamine, which circulates in the blood of sand sharks.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="62"> 'It is the broadest spectrum natural antibiotic we have every seen, and it's absorbable orally,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="63"> Entirely new antibiotics such as squalamine may help to turn back the tide of infectious disease in the next century.</s>

<s docid="FT924-5307" num="64"> Until then both the human and animal health sectors must learn to curb their excessive use of antibiotics.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23024" num="21"> Antibiotics Research Center, Moscow] [Abstract] The mechanism of clinical enterobacteria strain resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics due to the antibiotics modification by three types of enzymes is discussed, and it is stressed that despite the great diversity of enterobacteria's aminoglycoresistance genes, three-to-four different types of encoding enzymes are predominant among clinical isolates.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23024" num="22"> Consequently, an attempt is made to determine the types of enzymes produced by Serratia marcescens strains which inactivate aminoglycoside antibiotics and to identify the genes which encode them.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23024" num="23"> To this end, 31 aminoglycoside antibiotic resistant strains of Serratia marcescens isolated by mid-1908s are used.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23024" num="24"> The experimental procedure and the components used are outlined in detail.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23024" num="25"> The study of the clinical isolates' sensitivity to a number of aminoglycoside antibiotics did not reveal strains which are highly resistant to amikacin yet the microorganisms' levels of sensitivity to this antibiotic varied within 0.5-8 æg/ml.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23024" num="26"> The diameters of the micro-organism growth suppression zones and types of aminoglycoside activating enzymes determined by two methods are summarized, and the conclusion is drawn that DNA-DNA hybridization is a reliable method of determining the presence of the specific resistance genes which makes it possible to identify silent genes which cannot be detected by the AGRP method; the latter, however, is suitable for reliably determining the types of aminoglycoside activating enzymes provided that the strains do not contain genes which code the enzymes with overlapping resistance spectra.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23024" num="27"> Thus, 85% of the strains under study contain other genes encoding aminoglycoside activating enzymes in addition to the gene encoding the AAC(6')-Ic aminoglycosideacetyltransferase; this makes these strains resistant to a broad range of aminoglycoside antibiotics.</s>

<s docid="FR940523-0-00045" num="5"> Potential Transfer of the kan r Gene From Crops to Microorganisms One comment posited a connection between ``the prophylactic use of antibiotics [resulting] in antibiotic-resistant bacteria reaching the human population'' with a health risk from the possible addition of up to ``10 antibiotic genes [sic] in most of the cells of major crops''.</s>

<s docid="FR940523-0-00045" num="6"> The comment agreed with Calgene's documentation that the widespread use of antibiotics has led to an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment, but went on to postulate that this was evidence that introducing antibiotic-resistance genes into plants has human health implications.</s>

<s docid="FR940523-0-00045" num="7"> The comment further asserted that the ``scientific question is whether the resistance genes in the crops can be transferred by any mechanism [to] organisms that might be human pathogens,'' and that the company should be required experimentally to ``determine the rates of gene transfer to soil bacteria from plant debris, the persistence or selection of organisms containing such genes in soil ecosystems, and other important factors in the assessment of the likelihood of releases compromising the use of antibiotics''.</s>

<s docid="FR940523-0-00045" num="8"> The comment noted that Calgene analyzed these issues ``in some detail,'' but with ``arm chair calculations, most based on extrapolations from experiments done with other organisms under other circumstances''.</s>

<s docid="FR940523-0-00045" num="9"> A second comment noted that Calgene had supplied information that three kinds of bacteria, with and without plasmids 7 carrying antibiotic resistance genes, had little effect on several measures of soil ecosystems, but wrote that the ``relevance of experiments on bacteria to releases of plants is marginal, at best''.</s>

<s docid="FR940523-0-00045" num="10"> A third comment asserted, without any supporting evidence, that ``genetic resistance to antibiotics in these plants could be transferred by plasmids to microorganisms in the soil and elsewhere in the food chain''.</s>

<s docid="FR940523-0-00045" num="14"> FDA considers the relevant scientific question to be whether there would be a meaningful increase in antibiotic-resistant pathogenic microbes in the human environment due to transfer of the kan r gene from plants to microbes.</s>

<s docid="FR940523-0-00045" num="15"> This issue was also the subject of considerable discussion at the April 1994 Food Advisory Committee meeting.</s>

<s docid="FR940523-0-00045" num="18"> Regarding whether Calgene should be required to determine experimentally the rate of transfer, the agency notes that Calgene's calculations represent worst-case scenarios, and the agency believes it would not be useful to do experiments to attempt to measure that which is too small to measure.</s>

<s docid="FR940523-0-00045" num="19"> Regarding the relevance of experiments on bacterial releases to the environment, FDA finds that information concerning the lack of an environmental effect from the release of microbes with and without antibiotic resistance genes is of limited direct relevance to the environmental effects of plants with antibiotic resistance genes.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="8"> Definitely not.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="9"> There is no risk of anything like the past pandemics, such as the Black Death of the mid-14th century and the Great Plague of 1665.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="10"> The disease is now preventable and curable.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="11"> If the patient is treated with tetracycline antibiotics when symptoms appear, there is almost always a complete cure.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="12"> Outbreaks can be prevented by ensuring reasonable standards of public hygiene.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="13"> What is the risk of a plague epidemic in India?</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="14"> The disease is extremely unlikely to return to the levels that were normal before antibiotics brought it under control.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="15"> Until 1950, plague killed about 20,000 Indians each year.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="16"> What should the Indian authorities do to control the outbreaks?</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="17"> Most important is to ensure that adequate stocks of antibiotic are available in the affected areas, together with health workers to dispense them to those showing signs of infection.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="18"> However, mass-administration of antibiotics to the whole population of cities such as Surat and Delhi would be a mistake, because it could lead to the evolution of drug-resistant strains of the bacteria.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="19"> The spread of the disease can be reduced by keeping those infected in isolation hospitals.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="20"> Should other countries take action to prevent plague spreading outside India?</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="21"> Plague is already present in many parts of the world.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="22"> The World Health Organisation says that in 1992, the last full year for which figures are available, 1,768 cases, including 198 deaths, were officially reported from nine countries (including the US).</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="23"> Under-reporting means that the real incidence of plague is probably much higher.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="24"> Even so, it is sensible for countries to take some precautions against Indian plague - for example, by advising against travel to places directly affected by the outbreaks and by ensuring than everyone arriving from India is aware of possible symptoms.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="25"> WHO says a comprehensive ban on travel to India is not justified.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="26"> If the world is over-reacting to the threat of plague, which infectious diseases should we be worrying about?</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="27"> Today's biggest killer is tuberculosis - responsible for 3m deaths a year worldwide.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="28"> Close behind is malaria, with 2m.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="29"> Both are on the increase.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="30"> Other infections that kill many thousands of people a year include dysentery, cholera, typhoid and Aids.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="31"> What about the future?</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="32"> Is there a threat of new germs emerging to threaten world health?</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="33"> Yes, microbiologists are becoming increasingly concerned about the complacency of the western world and its assumption that medicine has won the war on lethal infections.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="34"> They fear that a variety of factors are combining to set the stage for new killers to appear and old ones to re-emerge.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="35"> These include increased international travel, over-use of antibiotics, and human disturbance of tropical forests (which are breeding grounds for lethal new germs).</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="36"> What sort of germs should we be most frightened of?</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="37"> There is no way of predicting what is going to emerge.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="38"> But most scientists are more frightened of viruses than bacteria such as plague.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="39"> Viruses can reshuffle their genes and mutate more rapidly than bacteria, and the pharmaceutical industry has few antiviral drugs with which to fight them, even in the early stages of research.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="40"> What is the microbiologist's ultimate nightmare?</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="41"> For some, a previously unknown monkey virus mutating into a new strain that is virulent, untreatable and transmitted easily between humans.</s>

<s docid="FT944-18645" num="42"> For others, the fast-changing influenza virus emerging in a form more virulent than the one that killed 20m people worldwide in 1918-19 and then mysteriously disappeared.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23032" num="27"> To this end, an experiment is carried out on 18-20 g albino mice and 250-300 g guinea pigs infected with plague by injecting them with a mixture of fraction II of the plague microbe (according to Baker) and plague microbe's lipopolysachharide (LPS) obtained by Westphal's method.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23032" num="28"> The joint toxicity of these two agents was examined.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23032" num="29"> The plague infection was experimentally induced by subcutaneous injection of the Yersinia pestis 231 virulent strain, and treatment began 48 h after infection for mice and 72 h--for guinea pigs.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23032" num="30"> Statistical data processing involved an assessment of the confidence of various relative survival indices of mice in experimental and control groups.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23032" num="31"> The detoxicating activity of polymyxin B relative to the plague microbe toxin and the efficacy of a combination of antibiotics in starting treatment of experimental plague in albino mice 48 h after infection are summarized.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23032" num="32"> The study shows that polymyxin has a detoxicating effect and facilitates albino mice survival at the early plague intoxication stage; this is attributed to the ability of polymyxin B to inhibit the biological activity of lipopolysachharide in the external membrane of gram-negative bacteria.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23032" num="33"> The use of a single antibiotic, such as amikacin, rifampicin, doxycyclin, or cefotaxime, which are efficient at the early treatment against the background of polymyxin therapy at the stage of marked infection generalization increases the animal survivability compared to the individual use of each preparation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23032" num="34"> As for the guinea pigs at the same stage of disease, a certain therapeutic effect is observed under the combined use of gentamycin with trenthal or dipromonium whereby the life span and survival of individual animals increase.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-23032" num="35"> The conclusion is drawn that the proposed treatment is promising for comprehensive treatment of generalized plague infection and is capable of increasing the therapy efficacy.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="6"> The thousand journalists covering the international Aids conference in Amsterdam this week found it far easier to write scare stories than to report scientific breakthroughs.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="7"> One obsession was a mysterious new microbe, possibly responsible for several dozen cases in which patients had symptoms of Aids but no trace of HIV, the virus that normally causes the disease.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="8"> On the global level, there were statistics galore to show how 'small discrete epidemics have coalesced into a worldwide pandemic sparing no region and virtually no country', as Dr Michael Merson, director of the World Health Organisation's Aids programme, put it.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="9"> Between 10m and 12m adults and 1m children are infected, 80 per cent of them in developing countries; 2m people have developed Aids and more than 1m have died.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="10"> Projections for the year 2000 range from 30m to 120m people with HIV.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="11"> African delegates described how Aids - spread mainly through heterosexual intercourse - was starting to destroy the social fabric of their countries.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="12"> Aids patients take up more than half the beds of urban hospitals in countries such as Zaire and Zambia.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="13"> The global cost of Aids care, research and prevention was about Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.24bn) last year, the Harvard School of Public Health estimates.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="14"> The US alone has already spent Dollars 10bn looking after people with HIV in the 10 years since Aids was first recognised as a disease.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="15"> The good news in Amsterdam was too subtle to make headlines.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="16"> None of the several thousand doctors and scientists at the conference reported anything that even the most excitable journalist could call a big breakthrough.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="17"> Even so, the pharmaceutical industry is making progress in developing drugs and vaccines.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="18"> Scientists are uncovering the bizarre biological processes underlying HIV infection and disease.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="19"> Within the next year or so, new drugs such as Glaxo's 3TC and Bristol-Myers Squibb's d4T are likely to begin large-scale clinical trials.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="20"> Although they work in a similar way to Wellcome's AZT, which has had a virtual monopoly of the anti-HIV market since it was rushed into production in 1987, they may have fewer side effects and/or stronger anti-viral activity than AZT.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="21"> The latest evidence shows that a 'cocktail' of two or more anti-HIV drugs works better than any single medicine on its own.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="22"> Combination therapy will multiply the benefits of new drugs, but unfortunately not to the extent of curing patients.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="23"> A dozen candidate vaccines are in the first phase of clinical trials.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="24"> None of the uninfected volunteers has suffered any adverse reaction - and their immune systems have developed some of the antibodies required to fight HIV.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="25"> Vaccine manufacturers and government health bodies in developing and developed countries are now confident enough to be preparing for large-scale trials, each involving several thousand people, which could start in 1994-95.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="26"> There will be formidable ethical problems: how, for example, to obtain informed consent from a partly illiterate group to take part in a trial in which half receive a 'placebo' dummy jab and the other half a potentially risky experimental vaccine.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="27"> Dr Stephen Lwanga, director-general of the Uganda Aids Commission, said his country would a large-scale trial, on certain conditions.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="28"> 'I'm sure we will come to an amicable understanding on who bears the liability if things go wrong - and who derives the profits if they go right,' he commented.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="29"> Looking further ahead, scientists at the conference reported remarkable progress in understanding how the human immune system first defends itself against HIV and then, after a few years, begins to succumb to the virus.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="30"> This has been balanced by new evidence of how HIV itself changes character in a patient over time by genetic mutation.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="31"> Together these two avenues of research will lead eventually to new ideas for treating HIV.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="32"> Now that Aids is in its second decade, scientists are paying attention to the minority of people with HIV who are still healthy more than 10 years after infection.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="33"> Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, have discovered that a type of white blood cell called CD8 keeps HIV under control by suppressing the virus in infected cells.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="34"> In most people the CD8 cells lose their activity after a few years.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="35"> Then the CD4 cells - the immune cells normally studied to define the progress of Aids -disappear and symptoms appear.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="36"> The UCSF researchers are working to develop treatments based on CD8 cells.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="37"> The virus itself mutates more rapidly than any other microbe.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="38"> Not only are there countless different strains, but within each individual person HIV changes character as the disease progresses.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="39"> In the early years of infection the rate of mutation is relatively low.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="40"> Later, after the patient's immune defences have collapsed, HIV can quickly change into more virulent forms.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="41"> These observations explain why patients become resistant to anti-HIV drugs more quickly in the final stages of the disease.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="42"> Several experimental drugs have recently been abandoned because the virus quickly became resistant to them.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="43"> Researchers are now identifying the precise genetic changes responsible for drug resistance.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="44"> They will then be able to predict which drug combinations are best able to outwit HIV's genetic variability.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="45"> This could be used to delay the onset of resistance or even deliberately create resistance in order to weaken the virus.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="46"> (New evidence suggests that some mutations which make HIV resistant to drugs also make it less virulent).</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="47"> The pharmaceutical industry remains committed to converting the advances in basic science into better HIV drugs and vaccines.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="48"> Drug companies were very visible at the conference, with marketing staff in the vast exhibition hall and researchers in the scientific sessions.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="49"> The industry spends several hundred million dollars a year on Aids R&D.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="50"> Compared to the likely commercial return from the products, HIV probably gets a disproportionate share of pharmaceutical research funds, because the companies' scientific credibility would be at stake if they pulled out of such a fast-moving and medically important field.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="51"> They got no thanks from the hundreds of Aids activists who were officially accredited to the conference.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="52"> Act-Up, the most vocal group, targeted several companies for noisy 'die-in' demonstrations, accusing them of making excessive profits from overpriced Aids drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="53"> Professor Anthony Pinching of St Bartholomew's Hospital in London voiced the concern of many specialists that the activists would go too far.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="54"> 'The industry makes a classic pantomime villain but what they fail to understand is that its commitment and goodwill is jeopardised by their ridiculous abuse,' he said.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="55"> 'The executives will eventually decide that Aids is too hot politically and they'll pull the plug'.</s>

<s docid="FT923-11350" num="56"> If the drug companies cut back on research it would be a scare story for the millions of people who are dependent upon them to come up with a cure.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="6"> Fungi fight on both sides in the war between people and pathogens.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="7"> They have provided several of the most valuable antibiotics used to control bacterial infections but they are themselves an increasingly important target for the pharmaceutical industry.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="8"> Hospital doctors are alarmed by the rising incidence of life-threatening fungal infections in cancer and transplant patients, whose immune systems have been depressed by chemotherapy, and in people with Aids.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="9"> Although there are no reliable estimates for the number of people worldwide dying from fungi, doctors are beginning to think of them as a hidden killer.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="10"> According to a survey by the US Centres for Disease Control, the rate of fungal infection almost doubled from 2.0 to 3.8 per 1,000 hospital patients between 1980 and 1990.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="11"> A German study of all autopsies carried out in Frankfurt showed an even faster increase in invasive fungal infections: from 0.4 per cent in 1978-82 to 1.2 per cent in 1983-87 and 2.4 per cent in 1987-92.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="12"> Contributing factors include antibiotic treatments, which wipe out bacteria and leave the field clear for competing fungi, and the increasing use in hospitals of intravenous catheters - tubes which provide a route for infections into the body - as well as the growing number of 'immuno-compromised' patients.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="13"> To meet the need, anti-fungal drug sales are expanding fast.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="14"> Datamonitor, the business research company, puts the annual growth rate at 19 per cent, with the world market projected to increase from Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in 1993 to Dollars 4.9bn in 1997.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="15"> Another research company, Frost & Sullivan, estimates that the US anti-fungal market will grow from Dollars 1.1bn in 1993 to Dollars 2.1bn in 1999.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="16"> On the supply side, the market growth is being driven above all by Diflucan, launched by Pfizer of the US in 1990.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="17"> Analysts expect Diflucan, which was developed at Pfizer's UK research centre in Sandwich, Kent, to become the anti-fungal sector's first Dollars 1bn-a-year drug.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="18"> Before Diflucan, the leading treatment for systemic anti-fungal disease - serious infections in which microscopic fungi have spread right through the patient's body - was amphotericin B, an old drug associated with severe toxic side-effects.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="19"> Diflucan has the potency of amphotericin B, with fewer side-effects.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="20"> It can be given as an emergency injection to treat life-threatening infections, or taken by mouth as long-term therapy by immuno-compromised patients who need to keep fungi at bay.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="21"> Although Diflucan was a great improvement on previous treatments for serious fungal infections, it is far from perfect.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="22"> The most serious drawback is that Diflucan does not have a sufficiently broad spectrum of activity.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="23"> It works well against Candida, the yeast which is the single most prevalent fungal pathogen in human beings, but it is much less effective against Aspergillus, the second most common one.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="24"> And, ominously, there are signs that Diflucan-resistant strains of Candida are evolving.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="25"> Therefore Pfizer is developing follow-up drugs to hit fungi that do not respond well to Diflucan.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="26"> So are several other companies that do not have a significant presence in the anti-fungal market today but are attracted by its potential, including Zeneca and Glaxo of the UK and Eli Lilly and Merck of the US.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="27"> Most anti-fungal drugs belong to a class of chemicals called azoles.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="28"> Diflucan is an azole.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="29"> So are Sporanox, Nizoral and Daktarin, the three drugs sold by Janssen, the Belgian subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, which is number two in the anti-fungal market behind Pfizer.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="30"> Janssen's biggest development effort at the moment is focused on extending the uses of Sporanox, which was launched in 1989.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="31"> Mike Emanuel, the company's UK research director, says the drug's great advantage is its broad spectrum of activity, including effectiveness against Aspergillus.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="32"> Azoles work by blocking the synthesis of ergosterol, a fungal hormone that is essential for the maintenance of cell membranes.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="33"> They have also been developed by agrochemical researchers to combat fungal diseases in cereals and fruit.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="34"> There are several more azoles in the development pipeline, including one from Pfizer and another from Zeneca, in Phase II clinical trials.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="35"> David Denning of Manchester University Medical School, scientific adviser to the Fungal Research Trust, is involved in the clinical trials of both Pfizer's and Zeneca's new azoles.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="36"> 'They could be useful drugs but I don't think either is going to be a giant leap forward,' he says.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="37"> 'What we need is a drug with a completely new mode of action - and that is a tall order, because a lot of the fungal cell processes are the same as in mammalian cells,' Denning says.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="38"> 'Another difficulty is that fungal cells have a thick coating of sugar molecules; we have to find a chemical structure that will get through the wall without causing damage to human cells'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="39"> One fruitful development is the re-formulation of amphotericin B, in a way that reduces its side-effects while retaining its potency.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="40"> Two US companies, Vestar and Liposome Technology, have encapsulated amphotericin B in microscopic fatty particles called liposomes; these release the drug more slowly into the patient's body and reduce its toxicity.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="41"> The products - Vestar's AmBisome and Liposome's Amphocil (marketed by Zeneca outside North American and Japan) - have recently been licensed for use against severe infections that do not respond to other drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="42"> The best-selling non-azole drug is Lamisil, launched by Sandoz of Switzerland in 1991.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="43"> Whereas Diflucan aims mainly at systemic internal infections, Lamisil's primary market is the treatment of skin, nail and hair infections.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="44"> These external infections by dermatophyte fungi affect 10 to 15 per cent of the population, according to David Pearson of Sandoz.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="45"> Although not life-threatening, they can be irritating and disfiguring and are extremely hard to clear up with conventional drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="46"> Lamisil, which can be taken by mouth or applied as a cream, is very effective at eradicating dermatophyte infections.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="47"> But it is also turning out to have a broader spectrum of activity than Sandoz originally expected, with potential for treating some systemic infections too.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="48"> 'We're forecasting sales of more than Dollars 800m a year for Lamisil by 1998-99,' Pearson says.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="49"> Chemically, Lamisil is an allylamine.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="50"> It interferes with ergosterol production, like the azoles, but at an earlier step in the biosynthetic pathway.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="51"> The effect, according to Sandoz, is that Lamisil is 'fungicidal' - it actually kills them - whereas azoles are just 'fungistatic', keeping the fungi under control.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="52"> Therefore patients treated with Lamisil are less likely to relapse after treatment stops.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="53"> 'In principle the distinction between fungicidal and fungistatic drugs is very important,' says Roderick Hay, professor of cutaneous medicine at Guy's Hospital, London.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="54"> 'But in practice there is little clinical data yet to show that it makes any difference'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="55"> Meanwhile, the search continues for entirely new drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="56"> At Imperial College, London, Tony Barrett is running a particularly active anti-fungal chemistry programme.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="57"> Promising compounds being investigated by his group include: papuamine, a powerful fungicide produced naturally by tropical sponges; papulacandins; hennoxazole A; and FR-900848, a research compound from Fujisawa of Japan.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="58"> An elegant approach is to use fungi themselves as a source of new anti-fungal drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="59"> It has yielded several promising research leads for Myco Pharmaceuticals, a Massachusetts biotechnology company.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="60"> 'There are an estimated 1.5m fungal species worldwide,' says William Timberland, Myco's vice-president for research.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="61"> 'Because fungi are competing with each other in natural eco-systems, one would expect them to produce anti-fungals to protect themselves from other species'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-7095" num="62"> The series continues next month by focusing on drugs that act on the immune system.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="6"> Vaccine production, for long a sleepy sideline of the pharmaceutical industry, is being rejuvenated through a combination of new technology and corporate restructuring.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="7"> With the help of biotechnology, researchers are developing vaccines for diseases against which there is no protection today, from malaria to Aids.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="8"> At the same time they are working to combine existing vaccines and ultimately achieve the World Health Organisation's goal of an 'ideal children's vaccine' which would deliver immunity against all serious childhood illnesses in a single dose shortly after birth.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="9"> The corporate background to vaccine development is changing as fast as the science, through mergers and alliances which are transforming a patchwork of national vaccine companies into a handful of global players.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="10"> The most important event was the Dollars 785m (Pounds 430m) takeover of Connaught of Canada by Institut Merieux of France at the end of 1989.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="11"> That boosted Merieux's worldwide vaccine sales to Dollars 300m a year - well ahead of its three leading competitors, Lederle (Cyanamid) and Merck of the US, and SmithKline Beecham whose vaccine business is based in Belgium.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="12"> Together the top four companies account for half of the Dollars 1.3bn a year world vaccines market.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="13"> Meanwhile the single-country vaccine companies are gradually selling out.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="14"> For example, Wellcome sold its century-old UK vaccine business to Medeva for Pounds 20m at the beginning of this year, making Medeva the country's only commercial vaccine producer.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="15"> The next moves on the world stage are likely to be strategic alliances between the leading companies.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="16"> Merieux and Merck recently signed a letter of intent to co-operate on developing and marketing combined childhood vaccines for the US market and they are waiting for the Federal Trade Commission to approve the agreement.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="17"> 'If we get the green light from the FTC, I'm convinced we will then go further with Merck,' says Alain Merieux, chief executive of the French company.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="18"> And there is speculation in the pharmaceutical industry that Lederle and SmithKline Beecham are planning a vaccines alliance to balance the link-up between Merieux and Merck.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="19"> The primary reason for these alliances, according to Alain Merieux, is that 'the future lies in combined vaccines with multiple antigens'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="20"> (Antigens are the proteins produced by viruses and bacteria which stimulate the immune system to make protective antibodies).</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="58"> The corporate background to vaccine development is changing as fast as the science, through mergers and alliances which are transforming a patchwork of national vaccine companies into a handful of global players.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="59"> The most important event was the Dollars 785m (Pounds 430m) takeover of Connaught of Canada by Institut Merieux of France at the end of 1989.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="60"> That boosted Merieux's worldwide vaccine sales to Dollars 300m a year - well ahead of its three leading competitors, Lederle (Cyanamid) and Merck of the US, and SmithKline Beecham whose vaccine business is based in Belgium.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="61"> Together the top four companies account for half of the Dollars 1.3bn a year world vaccines market.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="62"> Meanwhile the single-country vaccine companies are gradually selling out.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="63"> For example, Wellcome sold its century-old UK vaccine business to Medeva for Pounds 20m at the beginning of this year, making Medeva the country's only commercial vaccine producer.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="64"> The next moves on the world stage are likely to be strategic alliances between the leading companies.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="65"> Merieux and Merck recently signed a letter of intent to co-operate on developing and marketing combined childhood vaccines for the US market and they are waiting for the Federal Trade Commission to approve the agreement.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="66"> 'If we get the green light from the FTC, I'm convinced we will then go further with Merck,' says Alain Merieux, chief executive of the French company.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="67"> And there is speculation in the pharmaceutical industry that Lederle and SmithKline Beecham are planning a vaccines alliance to balance the link-up between Merieux and Merck.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="68"> The primary reason for these alliances, according to Alain Merieux, is that 'the future lies in combined vaccines with multiple antigens'.</s>

<s docid="FT921-16061" num="69"> (Antigens are the proteins produced by viruses and bacteria which stimulate the immune system to make protective antibodies).</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="6"> The Cancer Research Campaign, a medical charity, has joined with Xenova, a biotechnology company, to develop a new cancer drug.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="7"> Cancer Research Campaign Technology, the charity's technology transfer arm, has sold the worldwide marketing rights to the drug Daca in return for cash payments and royalties should the drug be marketed.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="8"> The payments are based on the progress of the drug through trials up to a maximum of Pounds 1.7m.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="9"> If clinical trials go to plan, the drug could be approved at the end of the decade.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="10"> Stockbroker Lehman Brothers estimates that it may eventually generate Dollars 250m in sales.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="11"> Daca is still in the early stages of development.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="12"> Less than a quarter of drugs make it to the market from this stage.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="13"> CRC and Xenova, which is based in Slough, Berkshire, are taking the development forward because laboratory tests showed that low doses of Daca overcame two main types of drug resistance - a common cause of failure of chemotherapy - in various tumours, including colon, skin and lung cancers.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="14"> Mr Louis Nisbet, chief executive of Xenova, said he may resell certain marketing rights, such as those in Asia, to large drug companies to secure more funding for the final, most expensive, clinical trial stages.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="15"> The compound was discovered by scientists at the Auckland Cancer Society in New Zealand and handed to the British charity for further investigation.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="16"> Dr Paul Bevan, Xenova's research director, said the drug worked by blocking two enzymes, topoisomerase I and II, involved in the uncontrolled replication of cancer cells.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="17"> Existing anti-cancer drugs of this type hit only one or other of the two.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="18"> The effect is to kill rapidly dividing cells in tumours.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="19"> Such an approach is already used in chemotherapy drugs which kill cells by other means, so side-effects such as hair loss, infection and anaemia are also possible with Daca.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="20"> Daca appears to overcome drug resistance that arises when cancer cells are able to to pump out chemotherapy drugs before they can work.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="21"> The deal is one of a series CRC has done with the private sector.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="22"> But it is more unusual for Xenova, whose collaborations in the past have been with companies such as Genentech and academic centres such as Purdue University of Indiana, rather than charities.</s>

<s docid="FT943-9461" num="23"> Xenova, which specialises in rapid screening of large numbers of potential drugs derived from fungi, bacteria and plants, floated its shares on the Nasdaq market in the US last month.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="17"> Though the disease has now been wrestled into submission by a new vaccine, it has decimated breeding and laying stock in several production centres, resulting in losses of around Rs 50 crores and widespread panic in the poultry industry.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="18"> The epidemic has left in its wake a severe shortage of eggs and chicken that has sent prices soaring; industry observers reckon that it will be at least eight months before the situation returns to normal.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="19"> Isolated instances of infectious bursal disease (popularly called Gumboro disease, because it was first detected in a town of the name in Delaware, U.S). were first noticed at the beginning of the year in farms in the east.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="20"> Though farmers routinely vaccinate their birds against this disease, the outbreak proved resistant to available medication.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="21"> "We found that our birds were dying in very large numbers, even though we had vaccinated them," said Mr M.P.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="22"> Merchant. He is among the more cautious, since the first outbreak ever recorded in India occurred in 1978, on his Vasai farm.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="23"> Veterinarians soon realised that they were battling a new strain of the birnavirdae virus.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="24"> "The disease is like AIDS," said Dr Sangeeta Dasgupta, a consulting immunologist at a Nashik-based farm.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="25"> "It attacks the bird's bursa, the organ which gives immunity against infection".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="26"> Thus, the birds are as likely to die from other poultry killers as Raniketh disease as from Gumboro disease itself.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="27"> She hastened to add the Gumboro disease was not communicable to humans.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="28"> "No poultry disease, besides salmonellosis, can affect human beings," she said.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="29"> While the old strain of the virus usually killed between 8 per cent and 12 per cent of flocks, the 1993 variety led to a mortality rate of between 75 per cent and 90 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="30"> "Only later we realised that we were dealing with a more dangerous form of the virus," explained Dr V.S.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="31"> Narsapur of the Bombay Veterinary College.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="32"> The new strain was identified as VVIB (very virulent infectious bursal disease) which caused great damage to Europe's poultry stock last year.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="33"> As scientists struggled to cope with the threat, the mutated virus travelled aboard trucks carrying eggs, chicken and feed, wreaking havoc in every poultry pocket in the country when the epidemic peaked in August and September.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="34"> Losses were most extensive in the three southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which accounted for around 9 million of the 13 million poultry deaths reported nationwide.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="35"> Speaking to this newspaper from his farm in Hyderabad, India's largest supplier of parent birds, Mr Sheikh Imam, said: "At least 5 million chickens have died in this area".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="36"> Experts estimate that the 100-km area around Hyderabad city had a poultry population of around 14 million before the disease flared up.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="37"> The Namakal area of Tamil Nadu's Salem district was also badly hit, losing 3.5 million of its 9 million birds.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="38"> In Maharashtra, the first signs of Gumboro were detected in Yavatmal, in February.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="39"> "The virus spread to Ahmednagar and, in no time at all, we found that it was all over the state," said Mr G.R.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="40"> Naik, the deputy director of poultry in the directorate of animal husbandry.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="41"> He estimated that at least 2.5 million birds had fallen prey to Gumboro disease in the state, losses being especially heavy in Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur districts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="42"> After several weeks of heavy losses, a team from the livestock health surveillance division of the department of animal husbandry and dairying in New Delhi extensively toured the affected areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="43"> "We found that overcrowding and improper disposal of carcasses was contributing to the high mortality rate," said Dr Lal Krishan, one of the members.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="44"> In its report, the Central team recommended that sanitary measures on hatcheries be improved, the hatcheries be properly registered, that a proper vaccination schedule be followed, and that the quality of the vaccines be checked.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="45"> The virus was finally reined in by October, after a new pattern of vaccination was introduced.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="46"> "We now recommend that our farmers vaccinate the birds three times, at the age of eight or nine days, with simultaneous doses of `live' and `killed' vaccines; then a fortnight later with `killed' vaccine again," said Dr P.G.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="47"> Chowdhury, technical director of a Pune-based Venkateshwara Hatcheries, the largest producer and supplier of vaccines in the country.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-60454" num="48"> He said that his company had to develop a new form of vaccine, incorporating the virulent strain of the virus.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="6"> THE FUTURE of pharmaceuticals is critical for Zeneca, Imperial Chemical Industries' biosciences company, given the bleak immediate outlook for company's agrochemicals and speciality chemicals businesses.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="7"> The company's drugs pipeline has been criticised for being thin, with few new chemical entities.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="8"> However, in a presentation yesterday described by analysts as up-beat, Mr David Friend, pharmaceuticals chief executive, said extending the number of new diseases that existing products could treat was more important than introducing new drugs that could generate only limited sales.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="9"> Mr Tom McKillop, research and technology director, considered the pharmaceuticals pipeline to be the most promising for many years.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="10"> The division aimed to bring a new chemical entity for licensing each year.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="11"> There would be no new compound launched next year, but Zeneca expected to receive seven new US drug approvals and make nine new submissions.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="12"> Four drugs were in regulatory development, said Mr McKillop.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="13"> These included Merrem, an antibiotic, Casodex, an anti-cancer agent, Accolate, an asthma drug, and a compound called 204636, designed to treat schizophrenia.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="14"> Analysts said the last two, which had been briefly described last year, were extremely promising but were some way from launch.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="15"> Mr Friend said profit growth presented the division with a singular challenge because of the rapid collapse in sales of Tenormin, the heart drug and the world's fifth best-selling drug.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="16"> The rapid decline had been in spite of the preparations made well in advance of the expiry of its US patents.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="17"> He admitted the 12 generic versions of Tenormin had captured about 50 per cent of the market within a year, instead of the expected two years.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="18"> Tenormin had proved the largest ever target for generics, he said.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="19"> ICI's own generic version had generated some sales until April, when prices had deteriorated.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="20"> A programme called Wellspring, designed to create customer loyalty, had proved a rather limited defensive strategy.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="21"> Mr Friend said there were signs that the generics' progress was decelerating and Tenormin would end up with more than 25 per cent of the market.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="22"> He added that the division should be back on its normal growth track by 1994.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="23"> The group was far less dependent upon a single product and would be far more stable in the long-term.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="24"> Meanwhile, Zeneca's new drugs had progressed well, said Mr Friend.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="25"> Diprivan, the world's most important anaesthetic by value should generate sales this year of about Pounds 140m, an improvement of approximately 50 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="26"> It enjoyed 65 per cent of the worldwide market for intravenous induction of anaesthesia.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="27"> The company was looking to introduce the drug into the market for maintaining anaesthesia and sedation.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="28"> Zoladex, a cancer treatment, should generate revenues of Pounds 100m this year, a rise of about 50 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="29"> The group said it hoped to gain approvals for the drug to treat hormonal tumours and benign gynaecological conditions.</s>

<s docid="FT924-3416" num="30"> The market was becoming increasingly competitive, Mr Friend warned, but efforts to find a longer-acting formulation remained a high priority.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="6"> It is barely two decades since drugs like cimetidine revolutionised ulcer treatment, sparing many patients the knife.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="7"> Now it has been discovered that a simple course of antibiotics may cure ulcers and even certain forms of stomach cancer.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="8"> The BBC's Horizon programme on Monday night told the story of the appropriately named Stephen Hope.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="9"> He is one of several people with lymphoma of the stomach who have been treated successfully not by surgery or radiotherapy but by antibiotics against the bacterium Helicobacter pylori.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="10"> H. pylori was discovered about 100 years ago but misunderstood until recently.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="11"> It was almost an accident that, while looking for a suitable research topic, young gastro-enterologist Barry Marshall became interested in H. pylori in 1983.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="12"> Among other things, he tried giving himself the germ and eradicating it in his patients.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="13"> Both were a great success, even if his efforts met with little acclaim at first.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="14"> H. pylori is highly resistant to stomach acid, which kills most known germs.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="15"> It moves in corkscrew fashion, penetrating deep into the stomach lining.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="16"> In the last ten years, research has increasingly implicated it in gastritis, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the stomach.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="17"> Around 95 per cent of patients with duodenal ulcers and 80 per cent of those with gastric ulcers are thought to carry H. pylori.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="18"> According to a study just published in the British Heart Journal, there is also evidence that the bacterium is associated with a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, though a causal relationship is unproven.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="19"> H. pylori is often acquired in childhood, especially among poorer households, where it may spread from person to person.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="20"> Infection with H. pylori increases with age - at 50, around 50 per cent of us are infected; at 70, around 70 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="21"> Eradicating the bacterium can now be done fairly simply.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="22"> A fortnight's treatment with two drugs (the antibiotic amoxycillin and the anti-ulcer drug omeprazole) does the trick in around three-quarters of patients infested with H. pylori.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="23"> This regime is easier than its predecessor, triple therapy, which involved more tablets, had more than a 20 per cent incidence of side-effects, and precluded alcohol for the duration of the treatment.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="24"> It is now possible to test for H. pylori (one such test costs about Pounds 26 per person).</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="25"> But many gastro-enterologists believe that all patients proved to have a duodenal ulcer should be offered eradication therapy, whether or not they carry H. pylori.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="26"> Studies point out that patients treated in this way feel better and relapse less often than those given conventional anti-ulcer treatment, and the treatment may cost less in the long run.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="27"> A report from general practitioners in Suffolk suggested recently that annual savings of at least Pounds 120 per patient could be achieved.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="28"> Some authorities would also agree that eradicating H. pylori is good treatment for gastric ulcers, and the last year has seen increasing evidence that it can work wonders for gastric lymphoma.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="29"> But this type of tumour accounts for only 5 per cent of all stomach malignancies.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="30"> So what hope is there for most stomach cancer sufferers?</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="31"> H. pylori is thought to multiply the risk of stomach cancer by six, but is only one of several factors - diet and blood group are also important.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="32"> One hypothesis is that a chain of sugars found only in type A blood may help H. pylori attach itself to the stomach lining.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="33"> It is not yet known whether eradicating H. pylori affects gastric cancer (as opposed to lymphoma).</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="34"> Nor is it clear how much it can offer those with gastritis - specialists are now trying it, though many believe it will confer few benefits.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="35"> A wider question is that since H. pylori can be tested for, might it be worth treating those who carry it but do not have symptoms, in the hope of preventing serious disease later?</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="36"> At the moment, the answer is no.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="37"> One problem is that the incidence of infection with H. pylori is very much higher than the incidence of diseases it is associated with.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="38"> Until it is known precisely how the bacterium causes harm, it would be fruitless to treat aIl carriers.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="39"> Prevention of stomach malignancies may therefore be around the corner.</s>

<s docid="FT942-8985" num="40"> From where we are now, however, that corner seems to be some way down the road.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="16"> Pharmaceutical Industry"] [Text] [No dateline as received] At a moment when the U.S. blockade aimed at making the Cubans surrender out of hunger is being intensified, Cuba's pharmaceutical industry has risen to cover the back of the national economy and is now expecting high profits as a result of its output of products that right now are unique in the world.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="17"> In 1993, the controversy over the effectiveness of Cuban vaccines took new heights as a result of epidemics in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil and although there are reservations in purchasing the vaccine, threats of epidemics must be taken into consideration.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="18"> By exporting the vaccine against the meningococcic meningitis, interferon, the anticholestorelomic PPG, and the recombining streptokinase, Cuba can secure a new market that will be backed by the research, raw materials, and laboratories that have the Made in Cuba label.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="19"> This has come as a big surprise for transnational firms that unlock trade ambitions while in poor countries many people die for lack of vaccines that Cuba is already producing.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="20"> In Cuba, as in the rest of the world, the pharmaceutical industry is the main beneficiary of advanced technology, over which the highly industrialized nations almost have a monopoly.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="21"> This is the context into which the Cubans broke some years ago when the island produced a vaccine against the Type B Meningococcic Meningitis (the serotype that produces the most deaths among the infant population) and Type B Hepatitis, which also affects millions of Latin Americans.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="22"> These two vaccines are already being marketed in other countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="23"> In some countries of the area, where different meningococcic serotypes exist, groups of experts are thinking about acquiring these vaccines.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="24"> Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the United States, and WHO have issued a positive assessment, the obstacles against the marketing of the vaccines are huge.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="25"> This marketing has become a strategic field of the Cuban economy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="26"> At the National Forum of Science and Technology recently held in Havana, Cuban President Fidel Castro described the war that has been launched from the United States against Cuban pharmaceutical products as terrible.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="27"> No one could imagine how far the Cubans would go when they took, in the 1980's, the short cut that biotechnology and genetic engineering opened to the developing countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="28"> The Cubans began producing interferon and now have a series of products to treat cancer, to fight infections resulting from the human papiloma virus, and to delay AIDS manifestations in persons with the HIV virus.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="29"> These products are marketed by Heberbiotec S.A. and their effectiveness has been demonstrated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="30"> More than 160 products have been obtained through genetic engineering, including eight medications that come as injections, creams, and eye-wash.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="31"> Although the main results derive from genetic engineering and biotechnology, progress is also being made in chemical and pharmaceutical products such as the anti-ulcer Qulcer, antibiotics, and biological remedies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="32"> In 1993, the main objective of Cuba's pharmaceutical sector was to launch a commercial struggle in the face of a powerful market where 10 of the largest and most notable pharmacological enterprises sold more than $170-billion-worth [of products] in 1992.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="33"> New formulas are presented at the island's medicine registration offices, thus strengthening the arsenal of medicines with high international demand.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="34"> Some formulas are streptokinase (used to dissolve cardiac thrombosis) and several others developed from human placenta and melanin (used to cure vitiligo).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="35"> The more complex field of biotherapy has contributed with monoclonal antibodies.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="36"> IOR-T3 was the first product to be registered at the state pharmaceutical control office.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="37"> Dr. Agustin Lage, the director of the National Molecular Immunology Center, told PRENSA LATINA that the center is currently performing clinical tests using several lymphoma treatments.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="38"> An anti-cholesterol agent, known as PPG or Ateromyxol, was developed with the aid of molecular biology.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="39"> It is currently riding the crest of an advertising and sales wave among tourists, who come to the island looking for the "sexuality formula", as some have come to call these pills.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="40"> PPG was conceived to treat high cholesterol levels and presently enjoys wide acceptance for its lack of unwanted side effects.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="41"> Patients report a general improvement of their circulation process and, especially, their sexual functions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="42"> This effective weapon against cardiovascular disease was introduced to the local therapeutical scene in 1991 and in a 1993 report issued by the University of Geneva it was recognized to be the best anticholesterol drug available.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="43"> Producing pharmaceutical products nowadays means plenty of scientific research.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="44"> This was evident at the Fifth Cuban Pharmaceutical Science Congress, the National Pharmaceutical Technology Development Workshop, and the International Antibiotics Workshop, all of which were held in Havana during 1993.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="45"> These events assessed the Caribbean nation's research potential.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="46"> The island's scientists are preparing to begin the production of antibiotics using the method of fermentation, with the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="47"> Chemical development has produced other achievements such as the production of a cytostatic agent called "Actinomicina D," which, according to Dr.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="50"> The production of hydroxyapatite, which is a complex phosphate calcium produced by sea coral and used as an excellent element for bone implants and in stomatology, has gained strength.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="51"> The most innovative discovery of the year about to close, was the cancer therapy developed from shark cartilage.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="52"> A multidisciplinary Cuban team elaborated and expanded the research that began in the United States.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="53"> A 16-week study was carried out with terminal patients, from September 1993 to January 1993, under the direction of Dr. Jose Menendez Lopez and labeled "The New Option".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="54"> Dr. Lopez Menendez [name as received], in explaining the new cancer therapy, said that the product is registered and sold in the United States as a dietary supplement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="55"> There are recent reports, however, that indicate that they are doing clinical research similar to that completed in Cuba.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="56"> I can affirm, he said, that their results, as ours, may not be described as spectacular.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="57"> They can, however, be seen as highly promising and encouraging enough to press on with this therapeutical effort.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="58"> The specialist explained that Cuba began by importing the product.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="59"> Now, Cuba is producing shark cartilage of unsurpassed quality and excellence, as shown in simple spectral analysis.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="60"> The formula is rich in an astounding collection of biologically active substances with anti-inflammatory and angiogenetic inhibiting properties.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="61"> The scientist pointed out, however, that shark cartilage is by no means the divine nectar of the gods, nor does its use entail magical results.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-50580" num="62"> Cuban experience does recognize it though as the strongest neoangiogenesis inhibitor tested to date.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="6"> Medical magic bullets come and go.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="7"> From cancer cures to obesity treatments, precisely targeted drugs regularly show early promise which fades during clinical trials.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="8"> Medicine based on the immune system aims to be different.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="9"> It uses the natural mechanisms that can defend the human body against almost any microscopic invader.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="10"> The promise is that, while drug companies spend billions of pounds developing synthetic chemicals to fight disease, the body's defensive arsenal is in place waiting to do the job.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="11"> The right trigger could release a new generation of successful treatments.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="12"> The idea is one of the oldest in medicine.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="13"> In 1796, Edward Jenner conferred immunity against smallpox by infecting healthy people with a milder disease called cowpox.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="14"> In effect, he taught the immune system how to tackle an enemy it had not yet encountered.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="15"> Since then, vaccination has all but eradicated former killers such as tuberculosis, typhoid and cholera.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="16"> New vaccines continue to be developed.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="17"> SmithKline Beecham's Havrix for hepatitis A is today's world best seller with revenues of about Dollars 500m (Pounds 330m) a year.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="18"> As well as being boosted, the immune system can be suppressed.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="19"> For 30 years this has helped transplant patients receive donated organs which would normally be rejected.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="20"> With the power of immune system manipulation already demonstrated, researchers promise more to come.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="21"> The body's natural defences could be directed to kill cancer cells or the Aids virus HIV.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="22"> Diseases in which the defence mechanisms have gone wrong, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, could one day be brought under control.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="23"> Unfortunately, the immune system is resistant to exploitation because of its staggering complexity.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="24"> It has virtually uncountable numbers of mechanisms and components.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="25"> Those discovered so far are grouped into categories with names such as scavenger cells, natural killer cells, eosinophils, T-cells, B-cells and immunoglobulins.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="26"> Each can work in small numbers or be mass produced, function independently or together, influencing each other in the war against invaders.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="27"> Ian Hutchinson, professor of immunology at Manchester University, points out that there are 100,000bn different kinds of T-cell alone.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="28"> Each one is pre-formed in the body and designed to attack a different invader.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="29"> It is as if every man, woman and child were a crack shot with 20m types of firearm, each distinct from the next and each capable of killing just one kind of attacker.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="30"> If an alien invader landed, a search would have to be mounted for the one gun that was effective.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="31"> It would have to be mass produced and shipped to the landing site.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="32"> Progress in the medical version of firearm production has been slow.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="33"> Some individual components of the immune system have been isolated, but this is a long way from finding the right one to cure a disease.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="34"> David Barry, director of research and development at UK drug company Wellcome, says: 'There are literally hundreds of molecules that are said to stimulate the immune system.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="35"> In theory, and sometimes in animal models, they work.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="36"> In real life diseases, it is very difficult to prove anything'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="37"> He says that biology has not yet analysed the fine detail of how immunity works.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="38"> For example, Aids patients, whose immune systems have been damaged, tend to suffer from some types of cancer and not others.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="39"> Yet the exact relationship between cancer and the immune system remains unclear.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="40"> However, plenty of work is going on that could lead to new therapies within two or three years.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="41"> Cancer is frequently the target, largely for the commercial reason that effective therapies are not yet available.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="42"> The immune system could be harnessed in the fight against cancer if only cancer cells could be distinguished better from normal cells.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="43"> The work of New York biotechnology company Imclone Systems is typical.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="44"> It has a drug called Vaccine 105AD7 which mimics a material on the surface of colon cancer cells in a way that triggers production of large numbers of killer cells able to attack the cancer.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="45"> Clinical trial results published in April showed that patients receiving the drug survived for 12 months, compared with an average of three months for those not receiving it.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="46"> Cancer vaccines are being developed by several biotechnology companies.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="47"> Products from Therion Biologics of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Somatix of Alameda, California, are already in clinical trials.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="48"> Other companies are trying to use the power of immune system cells to bind to specific targets such as cancer cells to carry poisons directly to targets.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="49"> But all of these products are still at a relatively early stage of development.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="50"> Closer to the market are the latest advances in suppressing, rather than stimulating, the immune system.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="51"> The idea is not new.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="52"> Earlier this century, doctors noticed that children with measles sometimes suffered a recurrence of tuberculosis.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="53"> Measles had depressed the immune system enough for dormant TB bacteria to become active.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="54"> Similar immune suppression was observed in the 1960s as a side effect of potential cancer drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="55"> The first proper immunosuppressive drug, launched in 1964, was Wellcome's Imuran, a failed cancer therapy.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="56"> Immune suppression is now big business.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="57"> There are almost 3,000 organ transplants a year in the UK alone, mostly of kidneys.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="58"> Transplant patients take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="59"> The most widely used drug is Sandimmun from Switzerland's Sandoz.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="60"> It had sales of almost Dollars 1bn in 1993, making it about the world's 30th best selling drug.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="61"> Compared with immunostimulants, Sandimmun is not very specific.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="62"> This is just as well because a transplanted organ stimulates the production of up to 1,000bn different kinds of T-cells.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="63"> Sandimmun is poisonous, limiting the dosage, and it depresses too much of the immune system.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="64"> Patients have to be given antibiotics to prevent infection.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="65"> There are several drugs, which promise fewer side effects, being launched or close to the market.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="66"> FK-506 from the Japanese company Fujisawa has over the past year received approval from many countries to go on sale.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="67"> The price of about Dollars 12,000 for the first year's supply has not stopped it winning sales from Sandimmun.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="68"> In theory, immune suppression should be able to help in conditions where the immune system is over active.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="69"> In the case of multiple sclerosis, parts of nerve cells are mistaken for invaders and attacked.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="70"> In rheumatoid arthritis material in the joints is damaged.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="71"> Even allergy is thought to result from an over-enthusiastic immune response.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="72"> Here the goal is to understand the mechanism of action and block it.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="73"> Several biotechnology companies are close to marketing treatments.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="74"> Immulogic of Massachusetts has developed a way to immobilise the T-cells that respond to cat fur and trigger cat allergy in millions of people.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="75"> This spring, clinical trials indicated the company's lead product, Allervax Cat, reduced allergic symptoms in 70 per cent of patients.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="76"> Drugs for MS and rheumatoid arthritis are proving harder to find.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="77"> Earlier this month Wellcome abandoned research on its drug Campath 1-H, which once promised to be a breakthrough in RA.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="78"> Such failures are commonplace in immune system drug research.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="79"> The field is vast and the interlinking of biochemical processes so complex that some promising routes will inevitably prove to be blind alleys.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="80"> But the immune system is pervasive and on a good day so effective that immunology is likely to prove a popular area for drug research for many years to come.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="81"> The series continues next month with a look at drugs for coughs and colds.</s>

<s docid="FT943-208" num="82"> Articles over the last six months have looked at pharmaceutical advances in the following areas: Fungi 25 August Stroke 29 July Painkillers 30 June Blood products 27 May Multiple sclerosis 29 April Sepsis 31 March</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="12"> Every week last year, more than 30 livers and hearts were transplanted in the United States in operations that, quite literally, gave the patients months or years of extra life.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="13"> Just eight years ago, only 62 livers and 103 hearts were transplanted during the entire year.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="14"> That sharp increase was a result of the discovery of an anti-rejection drug called cyclosporine, which, by making transplants both safer and more effective, revolutionized the field of transplant surgery to the point where a major organ is transplanted every 40 minutes in the United States.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="15"> Today, surgeons are experimenting with a new generation of anti-rejection drugs that may alter the field every bit as much as cyclosporine did.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="16"> These drugs are more potent than cyclosporine at preventing rejection and, so far at least, seem to have fewer side effects.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="17"> Some also are cheaper -- a not insignificant consideration for drugs that must be taken for the remainder of a person's life.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="18"> But more important, most of the new drugs seem more selective, pinpointing and suppressing only the portion of the immune system that attacks the organ and leaving the rest free to fight off infections.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="19"> Dr. Hans Sollinger, a transplant surgeon at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, predicts that the use of transplant drugs will soon bear a strong resemblance to the current situation with antibiotics, where physicians choose from among 20 or more drugs to treat a certain type of infection and a certain type of patient.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="20"> "I foresee a time in the future when we will determine the type of rejection, what (immune) cell type is involved, and so forth, open our drawer, and select the proper drug for a given organ and a given type of rejection," he said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="21"> As a result, transplants will become even more routine than they are now.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="22"> More people who have a defective organ will be able to receive a replacement and those replacements will last longer than they do now.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="23"> On the darker side, however, these developments will increase the demand for donor organs, which are already in short supply.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="24"> More than 19,000 Americans are on waiting lists for donor hearts, kidneys and other organs, and increased success rates will make the demand even larger.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="25"> Attempts at transplants have been recorded as long ago as Egyptian manuscripts written in 2000 BC, but it was not until the 1940s that scientists comprehended how to successfully carry out a transplant.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="26"> During that period, the late Nobel laureate Sir Peter Brian Medawar of Oxford University demonstrated definitively that transplant failure was caused by the very immune system that protects the body against infections.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="27"> Based on Medawar's work, researchers realized that it was necessary to stop the immune system from attacking an implanted organ as it would a disease-causing bacterium.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="28"> Unfortunately, the only technique available to suppress the immune system was whole body irradiation, which destroyed all the immune system cells.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="29"> Several kidney transplants were attempted using this technique.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="30"> The kidneys survived but the patients did not, succumbing to infections.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="31"> The first successful kidney transplant was achieved in 1954 by Harvard surgeon Joseph E.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="32"> Murray. He used steroids, hormones that suppress the inflammation that is part of the rejection process.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="33"> Because the steroids did not suppress the immune system effectively, he was forced to use organs from living donors who were closely related to the recipient.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="34"> In the late 1960s, chemist George Hitchings of the Burroughs Wellcome Co. synthesized a derivative of a cancer drug that strongly suppressed the immune system.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="35"> This drug, called azathioprine or Imuran, made transplants practical when it was used in conjunction with steroids.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="36"> Its development made possible the first heart, lung, liver and pancreas transplants.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="37"> But none of these transplant procedures was successful in more than 65% of the patients, and most were much less successful.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="38"> Furthermore, Imuran's broad suppression of the immune system left patients susceptible to a variety of infections, as well as to an increased risk of cancer, which is normally kept in check by the immune system.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="39"> That situation changed dramatically with the 1970 discovery of cyclosporine in a fungus from southern Norway.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="40"> Immunologist Jean Borel of the Swiss pharmaceutical firm Sandoz Ltd. showed that it suppressed only a part of the immune system -- specifically one type of white blood cell (lymphocyte) called the T helper cell.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="41"> He speculated that the drug thus could reduce the chance of rejection while leaving most of the immune system intact to fight off infection.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="42"> Once surgeons began using cyclosporine in the early 1980s, they never went back to Imuran.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="43"> At Stanford University, the two-year survival rate for heart transplants jumped from 63% to 83% by 1985.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="44"> For kidney transplants throughout the United States during the same period, the one-year survival rate leaped from 60% to 80%.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="45"> But liver transplants showed the most dramatic increase, with one-year survival rates more than doubling, to 70%.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="46"> Transplant operations flowered as never before.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="47"> But cyclosporine had its unfortunate side effects as well.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="48"> Most critical, it damaged the kidney by lowering its clearance of wastes from the blood -- a supreme irony in that the drug had made kidney transplants so successful.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="49"> It also did not greatly improve survival rates after the first year: Fewer than 70% of the organs that survived for the first year survived for a second, noted Stanford immunologist Randall C.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="50"> Morris. In practical terms, that attrition means many patients, perhaps as many as half of all kidney recipients, are coming back for second, third and even fourth organs.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="51"> But researchers such as Morris are studying a number of new drugs that they think will change that curve for the better.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="52"> One of the most thoroughly studied so far is called FK506.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="53"> FK506 was discovered in 1984 by researchers from the Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. in a soil sample taken only a couple of miles from their laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="54"> They were using what Morris describes as an "extremely sophisticated" -- and still largely secret -- system for screening soil and water samples to look for anti-rejection drugs.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="55"> It is the first such agent that was not found by accident.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="56"> The new chemical belongs to a class of bacterial products called macrolides, a family that includes the commonly prescribed antibiotic erythromycin.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="57"> Fujisawa scientists found that FK506 was 30 times more potent than cyclosporine in suppressing the immune system, which meant that it potentially be could given in much smaller doses to minimize side effects.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="58"> But FK506 was almost never used in humans.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="59"> Immunologist Roy A.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="60"> Calne of Cambridge University in England found that it was toxic in dogs, and his report in the British journal The Lancet caused many researchers to abandon their studies.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="61"> But surgeon Thomas E.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="62"> Starzl of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center found that the toxicity varied from species to species.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="63"> More important, he found that the drug could greatly extend the survival of transplants in animals other than dogs and that it could rescue organs suffering acute rejection episodes.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="65"> Starzl decided to use FK506 in conjunction with cyclosporine to try to rescue the organ.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="66"> The combination proved extremely toxic to Ford, but when Starzl took a gamble and stopped using cyclosporine, FK506 stopped the rejection episode.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="67"> Unfortunately, the cyclosporine had already destroyed Ford's kidney, but she received FK506 along with a second donor organ and is back at work for the first time in two years.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="69"> Starzl has used the drug in more than 300 liver and kidney transplant patients with uniformly good results.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="70"> Interestingly, Morris said, the drug not only halts rejection episodes, it also stimulates regrowth and repair of damaged liver cells.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="71"> "No other drug does that," Morris said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="72"> Starzl said that most patients who receive the drug leave the hospital within two weeks after a liver transplant, about half the recuperation time required with cyclosporine.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="74"> Because of the improved recuperation time, Starzl predicted that the cost of liver transplants will be reduced by at least one-third from the current level of about $200,000, and that cost reductions also will be achieved with other types of transplants.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="77"> To speed up research on the drugs, Morris has developed an innovative technique: He takes small pieces of heart tissue from one strain of mouse and places them between the cartilage and skin in the ears of mice from a different strain.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="84"> One new drug that Morris considers promising is rapamycin, a close relative of FK506 that was discovered in the 1970s by researchers from Ayerst Laboratories in Canada who were looking for antibiotics to fight yeast infections.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="85"> Rapamycin was a good antibiotic, Morris said, but it also interfered with the immune system, so it was shelved.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="86"> But it was that very property -- plus the fact that it has a molecular structure much like that of FK506 -- that prompted Morris to evaluate it as an anti-rejection drug.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="87"> "I didn't expect it to be much different from FK506," Morris said.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="88"> "I was very, very surprised because in rats it is very potent" -- about 60 times as potent as cyclosporine and twice as potent as FK506.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="91"> Morris has high hopes for another drug called RS-61443 because it operates by a completely different mechanism than FK506 and other macrolides and thus may be able to intervene at a different stage of rejection.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="92"> Morris has tested RS-61443 in all three animal systems -- mice, rats and monkeys -- and found that it could prevent rejection and reverse advanced rejection.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="93"> It is particularly promising, said Wisconsin's Sollinger, who has also tested it in dogs, because it combats chronic rejection, which none of the other available drugs does.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="94"> Sollinger used the drug -- which is routinely used to treat the skin disease psoriasis -- for the first time in a human transplant patient in April, and he and researchers at the University of Alabama plan to study it in more kidney transplant patients.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="95"> Morris said that the Stanford team plans to test RS-61443 in heart transplant patients, perhaps as early as this summer.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="96"> Two other drugs deserve mention.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="97"> One is deoxyspergualin, a bacterial product that "is more impressive than FK506 in some species, particularly primates," said surgeon Robert Corry of the University of Iowa Medical Center.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="98"> Deoxyspergualin already has been used successfully for a small number of kidney transplants in Japan and kidney and pancreas transplants in Europe.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="101"> "We'll be dealing with a population for which there is a 60% success rate rather than 90%" as is the case with first kidney transplants, he said.</s>

</P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="103"> The other drug that is attracting interest is not new, but it is one that was largely discredited 25 years ago.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="104"> Thalidomide was developed as a tranquilizer and a sleeping aid, but those uses were abandoned after it caused unusually severe limb deformities in almost 12,000 European children whose mothers took the drug while they were pregnant; the drug was never approved for use in the United States.</s>

<P>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="105"> Now, researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore are finding that it is useful in treating recipients of bone marrow transplants, which are used for the treatment of certain types of cancer, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia.</s>

<s docid="LA061390-0002" num="106"> These transplants are unusual because the transplanted organ -- bone marrow -- is the source of lymphocytes and thus part of the immune system.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7537" num="6"> ASTRA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, believes it has developed a new therapy for peptic ulcers that could seriously undermine sales of Zantac, the world's best-selling drug, which generates annual revenues of Dollars 3bn for Glaxo of the UK.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7537" num="7"> The new treatment eradicates a bacterium, helicobacter pylori (HP), which specialists believe is a significant cause of recurring peptic ulcers.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7537" num="8"> By eliminating HP, Astra believes it could reduce the need for long-term preventative therapy.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7537" num="9"> Glaxo estimates that 40 to 50 per cent of Zantac prescriptions are for long-term maintenance therapy.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7537" num="10"> Astra has been testing a combination of its Losec ulcer drug with an antibiotic on patients infected with HP.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7537" num="11"> Two studies revealed last week at the annual convention of the American Gastroenterological Association showed that the drugs could eradicate HP in as many as 80 per cent of duodenal ulcer patients.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7537" num="12"> Of these patients, all remained ulcer-free for 12 months after the treatment.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7537" num="13"> The effect of eradicating HP is not new, said Mr Robin Gilbert, pharmaceuticals analyst at James Capel.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7537" num="14"> However, previous treatments to eliminate the bug required taking 18 pills a day on five separate occasions, normally within a hospital environment.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7537" num="15"> The importance of the new treatment is that only one pill a day, prescribed by a general practitioner, would be needed.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7537" num="16"> 'If this combination fulfils its early promise it could revolutionise the market,' said Mr Gilbert.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7537" num="17"> 'The maintenance market could virtually disappear'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7537" num="18"> Astra claims the combination works because Losec reduces the acid content of the stomach allowing the antibiotic to work more effectively.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7537" num="19"> Antibiotics able to withstand acid did not prove as effective because patients had built up resistance to them.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2018" num="7"> Wall Street EQUITIES showed a mildly firmer tendency yesterday in moderate activity, in spite of a drop in leading computer issue International Business Machines (IBM) on a sharply reduced earnings forecast from Soundview Financial, writes Karen Zagor in New York.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2018" num="8"> The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged ahead 7.15 to 3,261.40, while advances held a narrow lead over declines by 912 to 773 after a total of 194m shares had changed hands.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2018" num="9"> The Standard & Poor's 500 was just 0.65 up at 409.80, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks was 1.02 higher at 625.96.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2018" num="10"> There was little stock market reaction to the release of trade data for January, which showed a slightly narrower US merchandise trade deficit of Dollars 5.77bn, compared with a revised Dollars 6bn for December.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2018" num="11"> IBM fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 85 7/8 in heavy volume after Soundview Financial cut its first-quarter earnings estimate to 25 cents a share from the previous 90 cents.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2018" num="12"> Soundview also reduced its 1992 earnings forecast to Dollars 4.50 from Dollars 6.50 a share.</s>

Harley-Davidson, the last of the big US motorcycle makers, moved ahead Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 after Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of the company with a 'buy' rating.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2018" num="18"> In the pharmaceutical sector, Pfizer initially moved higher following an analysts meeting where a professor at Yale University said the company's new Zithromax oral antibiotic had potential for use in the treatment of gonorrhea, lyme disease, toxoplasmosis in Aids patients and a range of gastrointestinal infections.</s>

<s docid="FT921-2018" num="19"> These indications, however, have not been reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration, which has so far approved the drug to treat respiratory tract infections, uncomplicated skin infections and chlamydia.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="6"> A RUSH to invest overseas by Japanese pharmaceutical companies in the late 1980s appeared to signal their entrance on to the world stage.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="7"> However, it has since become clear that Japanese pharmaceutical groups are far from becoming the Toyotas or Matsushitas of the global drugs market.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="8"> Despite strong efforts by some Japanese groups, the country's pharmaceutical industry has been unable to develop the world-beating innovatory products needed to break into overseas markets.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="9"> Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, with annual sales of Y226bn (Dollars 1.8bn) and one of the drugs companies to expand most aggressively internationally, hopes to be a truly global company within the next 10 years.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="10"> Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, Japan's third-largest with sales of Y227bn, says: 'It's essential for Japanese companies to globalise since domestic market conditions are going to be increasingly difficult'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="11"> However, western managers have doubts.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="12"> Mr Thomas Hofstatter, executive managing director of Hoechst Japan, says most Japanese drugs companies are going to take time to grow into leading global operations unless a real breakthrough product is discovered.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="13"> In the 1980s, most Japanese drugs companies started their overseas expansion with simple licensing agreements and established clinical trial offices.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="14"> The more ambitious, however, set up joint ventures or acquired distributors in the US and Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="15"> Fujisawa acquired Lyphomed, a small drugs company in the US, and Yamanouchi built a manufacturing plant in Ireland, a research centre in Oxford and, last year, acquired the pharmaceutical division of Gist-Brocades, a Dutch chemical company.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="16"> Japanese drugs-makers are now trying to build comprehensive independent operations in research and development, production, and marketing.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="17"> Fujisawa is increasing production and marketing capacity in the US and Europe ahead of the launch of FK-506, an immune system suppressor used to prevent transplant patients rejecting their new organs.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="18"> However, compared with the multi-billion dollar mergers and acquisitions of US and European companies, the Japanese operations and acquisitions have been modest in size.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="19"> Total overseas sales by Japanese pharmaceutical companies remain around 5 per cent of their turnover, compared with 30 to 50 per cent of leading US companies and 70 to 90 per cent of leading European companies.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="20"> The main barrier for the Japanese companies has been their lack of marketable products, as most have lagged in the development of important new drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="21"> This was due to their reliance on small-step innovations of existing drugs, mainly lower-value antibiotics and vitamins.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="22"> Mr Muneyuki Sakai, pharmaceutical analyst at County NatWest in Tokyo, says an overseas subsidiary needs at least four or five original mainline products.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="23"> Exceptions to this pattern include Sankyo, with its anti-cholesterol product Mevalotin.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="24"> The drug has annual exports to its licensees of Y13.2bn.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="25"> Yamanouchi is known for its anti-ulcer agent Gastar, which had Y90bn overseas sales last year.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="26"> Japanese drug companies have traditionally been complacent about R&D because of the government's pricing policy on drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="27"> The Health Ministry used to award all new drugs premium prices, whether they were improvements or not, and failed to give drug companies an incentive to develop innovative drugs.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="28"> Rather than take the risk of spending high sums on product development, many of the larger companies chose to only make small improvements of existing drugs, and distribute drugs supplied by foreign companies under licence for the Japanese market only.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="29"> Development programmes have also been hurt by cumulative price cuts by the Health Ministry, which started in 1981.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="30"> It forced 10 to 15 per cent price reductions every two years.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="31"> This pressured cash-flow at the Japanese drug companies, which are considerably smaller than their western counterparts.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="32"> However, attitudes towards R&D are changing rapidly as innovation has become the key to profits.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="33"> The ministry is pushing for innovative drugs through a change in its pricing rules.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="34"> From this fiscal year, the only drugs to be allowed premium prices will be those which represent a new concept, are more effective than existing drugs, and which make a noticeable contribution to treatment.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="35"> At the same time, foreign drug companies have started to end distribution tie-ups as they establish their own networks in Japan, reducing commissions at the former Japanese partners.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="36"> Ultimately, companies will need to establish a worldwide presence in order to recoup mounting R&D costs.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="37"> Fujisawa needs to globalise because its market share in Japan has hit a ceiling and profits have reached their upward limit.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="38"> Companies which do not succeed internationally will see a pressure on profits.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="39"> In the long run, Japanese companies are expected to become more innovative.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="40"> However, for companies whose development policies are aimed at marginal improvements, changing direction will not be easy.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="41"> Mr John Wilson, analyst at James Capel, says: 'Companies are under pressure, with sales of the industry growing at 5 per cent and costs of R&D increasing by 10 per cent'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="42"> Since a typical drug takes 10 years and Y10bn to develop, only those companies large enough to absorb the costs will be able to survive.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="43"> Mr Sakai at County NatWest believes that about 10 companies, led by Sankyo, Fujisawa, and Yamanouchi, will be able to establish a position in the international pharmaceutical market.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="44"> In the near future, companies predict a wave of mergers and acquisitions, especially rescues of smaller companies lacking new products.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="45"> Takeda, the industry leader, says: 'There are a lot of negotiations going on behind the scenes'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-2196" num="46"> Mergers and acquisitions by foreign companies, in line with Merck and Banyu in 1983, and more recently Bohringer Ingelheim and Yamaguchi Seiyaku in 1990, are also expected to increase, as Japanese companies are now cheaper following the slump in Japanese share prices.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="6"> The blood products sector used to be a quiet backwater of the healthcare business.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="7"> Now, it is a rapidly growing money-spinner.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="8"> The engine of change has been biotechnology, and the treating of blood disorders has created the first superstar of that business, California's Amgen.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="9"> Five years ago, blood products meant substances derived from blood.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="10"> These would be used in blood transfusions and as supplements in conditions such as haemophilia (uncontrolled bleeding).</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="11"> But the business suffered from high costs, owing to the laborious nature of collecting blood from donors, a lack of patent protection which in turn limited prices, and periodic scandals over contamination.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="12"> Few of the big pharmaceuticals companies bothered to get involved.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="13"> What biotechnology did was to make possible the high-volume manufacture of some of the components of blood, even those that appear in only minute quantities in the body.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="14"> Two big-selling products have been developed so far.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="15"> The most dramatic sales have come from erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone produced naturally by the body which Amgen has synthesised and commercialised as Epogen.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="16"> EPO is used to treat anaemia, a condition which can arise when not enough EPO is made by the kidneys.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="17"> EPO travels via the bloodstream to the bone marrow were it stimulates the production of red blood cells.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="18"> It is these cells which carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="19"> For more than 30 years, patients with kidney disease have received dialysis, a mechanical treatment that mimics much of what the kidney does.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="20"> But dialysis machines do not make EPO, so the patients develop anaemia.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="21"> In the past these patients have received blood transfusions, an expensive and laborious procedure that carried risks of infection and other complications.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="22"> Today the shortage of natural EPO can be addressed directly by Epogen.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="23"> Amgen says that 80 per cent of dialysis patients in the US now receive the drug.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="24"> The second new drug stimulates the development of white blood cells - a central component of the body's immune system - rather than red.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="25"> Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) also works by stimulating the bone marrow, but this time to produce white blood cells.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="26"> G-CSF is sold by Amgen as Neupogen.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="27"> It is used in the treatment of cancer patients because chemotherapy damages the bone marrow and with it the body's defence mechanisms.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="28"> Chemotherapy patients are especially vulnerable to infection.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="29"> Giving them G-CSF not only allows them to improve their defences against infection but means that more of the chemotherapy agent can be used to try to deal with the cancer.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="30"> Both Epogen and Neupogen are made by the complicated, but now well-tested, techniques of genetic engineering.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="31"> Scientists analyse human EPO and identify its components.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="32"> With that knowledge, they can calculate the shape of the gene that triggers the production of EPO and scan thousands of human genes to search for it.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="33"> Once the correct human gene is identified, it is put in the ovary of a hamster.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="34"> The egg that the ovary later releases is capable of making EPO.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="35"> It divides many times and a master cell bank is built up.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="36"> For large-scale manufacturing, cells from the master bank are nourished in a fluid.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="37"> As they grow they secrete EPO.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="38"> The fluid is periodically removed and the EPO extracted, purified and bottled.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="39"> Amgen received its first patent for this process in October 1987.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="40"> Less than two years later, the US Food and Drug Administration approved its use for kidney patients.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="41"> Neupogen was approved by the FDA in 1991.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="42"> The drugs are among the most effective on the market today because they are chemically identical to natural products of the body.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="43"> As natural products they cannot be patented and cannot easily be improved upon.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="44"> Amgen protects its discovery through patents on the manufacturing method and the uses of the drug.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="45"> These patents are effective enough to have shut out competition and allow high prices to be charged.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="46"> One course of Neupogen costs about Pounds 800, for example, and a cancer patient may need several courses.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="47"> The pay-off is that patients are far less likely to have to come back into hospital to be treated for an infection that the white blood cells would normally have fought off.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="48"> That saves money on both hospital beds and the cocktail of antibiotics that would have to be administered.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="49"> The combination of high price and potential savings to buyers translates into big profits for Amgen: the first three months of this year saw pre-tax profits of Dollars 93.5m (Pounds 62.3m) on sales of Dollars 345.7m.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="50"> The success story has barely begun.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="51"> According to analysts at stockbroker Lehman Brothers, by 2000 Epogen will be the world's best selling drug with Neupogen not far behind in third place.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="52"> Their combined sales will be more than Dollars 5bn a year, roughly the level of the UK National Health Service's annual budget today.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="53"> The successes of Neupogen and Epogen have now attracted other companies into research and development programmes.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="54"> They include Sandoz of Switzerland, which has signed research agreements with North American biotechnology research centres Terry Fox Laboratories in Vancouver and Systemix in Palo Alto, California.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="55"> One of the most advanced research programmes is at British Biotechnology, in Oxford.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="56"> It is trying to combine the effectiveness of both Epogen and Neupogen by defending the bone marrow against damage.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="57"> This can be done by first recognising that chemotherapy agents kill cancers by destroying cells that are dividing.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="58"> Chemotherapy does not distinguish between cancer cells and others that are dividing, such as hair, which is why cancer patients often lose their hair.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="59"> Bone marrow contains the cells, called stem cells, that divide and develop into a range of blood cells - red, white and the platelets which cause clotting.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="60"> British Biotechnology's programme is to develop a drug that temporarily switches off the division of stem cells.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="61"> The chemotherapy agents will then leave the stem cells untouched and when the therapy is finished, they can be switched on again.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="62"> 'Rather than a treatment for the damage caused by chemotherapy, it is a prophylaxis or prevention of the effect,' says Peter Lewis, director of research and development at British Biotechnology.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="63"> The company is not the only one developing a stem cell protector.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="64"> Sandoz, Sweden's Astra, and T-Cell Sciences, a California biotechnology company, are close behind.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="65"> The pharmaceutical industry knows that there is a huge market to be tapped.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="66"> This is a far cry from a decade ago when Epogen and Neupogen found themselves in virgin markets.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="67"> There were no products they could compete with and there were no sales forces or doctors accustomed to selling or buying treatments.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="68"> Amgen established a series of licensing deals and joint ventures with big drugs companies even though many companies were sceptical.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="69"> 'It was a completely novel drug,' explains Paul Hooper, UK marketing director for Swiss company Roche, now Amgen's joint venture partner in Europe for Epogen.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="70"> Another company, one of the largest in the US, turned down the chance to be a licensee.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="71"> 'We didn't recognise its potential,' says a former senior executive.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="72"> 'Later I felt like the record company man that turned down the Beatles.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="73"> I won't be making that mistake again'.</s>

<s docid="FT942-6984" num="74"> The series continues next month with a look at pain killers.</s>
