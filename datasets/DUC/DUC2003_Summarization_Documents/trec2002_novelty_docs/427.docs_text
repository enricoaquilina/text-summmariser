<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="9"> PINT-SIZED, inexpensive sunglasses perched on button noses are too cute for words, but are they ruining the eyes of the children who wear them?</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="10"> Perhaps. Eye specialists say that unless the lenses protect against ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a child is better off without sunglasses, even on the brightest days.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="11"> The safest approach is to buy sunglasses that block at least 95% of UV rays.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="12"> "The worst thing you can do is put a child in sunglasses without UV protection because studies have shown that the long-term absorption of UV radiation probably contributes to cataracts and may also cause degeneration of the retina," says Dr.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="14"> In bright sunlight, the pupil of the eye automatically constricts and muscles around the eye contract to a squint.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="15"> This offers natural protection, by letting in fewer harmful rays.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="16"> But when the eye is covered by a dark lens, muscles relax and the pupil dilates, allowing more UV rays to enter the eye.</s>
</P>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="17"> Concern about UV radiation absorption has been a hot topic with regard to adult sunglasses for several years, but only recently have studies shown that children are particularly vulnerable.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="18"> So doctors have begun to urge parents to protect children's eyes from UV.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="19"> "I'm prescribing more sunglasses for kids with normal vision to make sure that they get adequate UV protection," says Dr.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="21"> "Parents are now beginning to realize that the more UV you absorb in your lifetime, the more susceptible to damage you are.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="22"> They want their kids to be protected as early as possible".</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="23"> For that reason, optician Katheryn Dabbs-Schramm sells sunglasses sized to fit infants at her A Child's View optical shops in El Toro and Huntington Beach.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="24"> "It's commonly thought that parents won't spend money on kids' glasses, so most optical shops don't carry children's sizes," she explains.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="25"> "But I find there is no limit to what they'll spend".</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="26"> Although non-prescription infant sunglasses with UV protection are only $12, Dabbs-Schramm says the average price of children's prescription eyewear is about $150, on a par with the national average for adult eyewear.</s>

<s docid="LA082089-0008" num="29"> Eyewear marked "General Purpose" and "Special Purpose" provide 95% and 99% UV protection, respectively.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="6"> Chic Simple's handbook* on spectacles is in no doubt about what is the most important thing about them - 'remembering where you left them last'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="7"> True, true.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="8"> Even now I am lamenting my cool blue Calvin Klein shades - they sum up everything that this year's sunglasses should be - and I have not the faintest idea where I last left them.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="9"> The second most important thing is not, you may be dismayed to learn, the shape of the frames, but how much protection they offer to the eyes.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="10"> In these ozone-depleted days most of us are only too aware of what excessive sunlight can do to the skin but few of us are aware of just how much damage we risk to the eyes.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="11"> Eye cancer, age-related cataract, age-related macular degeneration, ageing and cancer of the circumocular skin, pterygium, photokeratitis - this is the gloomy roll-call of eye problems that those who flirt dangerously with strong sunlight might expect.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="12"> If this sounds a bit alarmist let me refer you to the work of optical company Fabris Lane International.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="13"> 'Damage to the eyes,' its eminent researchers, among them Professor Richard Young of the University of California, conclude, 'is cumulative and therefore it is better to wear protective sunglasses from an early age and to continue through life to wear them whenever subject to bright sunlight for extended periods'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="14"> While UVA, B and C rays are harmful, the real baddie in the solar spectrum is ultraviolet light and it is all the more dangerous for being invisible.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="15"> Cheap sunglasses bought off market stalls and in some chain stores are little more than fashion accessories - but highly dangerous ones - for some of the lenses are simply tinted and offer no protection.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="16"> Fortunately, it is usually very easy to check which glasses offer proper protection and which do not - there is now a British Standard (2724), which means that, at the very least, the eye will have basic protection.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="17"> Within that standard there are three different levels of protection - if for use just as a fashion accessory (sashaying into Joseph, lunching in Le Caprice, at Academy Awards, that sort of thing) then the lenses should transmit between 29 per cent and 100 per cent of light (meaning that the lens will get paler as the light gets darker).</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="18"> Then there are sunglasses which transmit between 8 per cent and 29 per cent of daylight and these are suitable for driving in strong sunlight.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="19"> Most protection of all is offered by those which transmit only between 3 per cent and 8 per cent of light and these are not suitable for driving but are intended for skiers, mountaineers and sailors.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="20"> Ray-Bans seem to survive the ups and downs of fashion's fickle favours.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="21"> If you own and wear a much loved pair you will clearly not be at the cutting-edge of fashion but you will be able to rest assured that you are wearing a classic.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="22"> They have the enduring cachet of pearls and Chanel.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="23"> Last year's oblong frames, most fashionably done by Cutler & Gross, are this summer, says my style-adviser, very, very square.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="24"> (Sod's law being what it is, these will, of course, be the ones you have failed to lose).</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="25"> This year's look centres on thin metal frames, gently oval in shape which, coincidentally and happily, seem to flatter most faces.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="26"> Clip-ons (even for those with 20/20 vision - they wear clip-ons over frames with plain glass) are what the really cool set is wearing.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="27"> This is one of those splendid turns of the wheel of fashion - when clip-ons first came in they were strictly for the geriatric set, a reminder of the passing of time and the withering of age.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="28"> Now what once was naff has become big business with even some of those who normally wear contact lenses abandoning them for the summer in favour of prescription lenses and clip-ons.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="29"> Calvin Klein does clip-ons with different coloured lenses - normally Pounds 140 for the frame (currently Pounds 105 in Selfridge's summer sale) and Pounds 40 for the clip-ons.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="30"> Emporio Armani, too, is rushing in vast quantities of its little metal frames and clip-on attachments.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="31"> Anglo-American is one of the great names in what the trade calls 'eye-wear'.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="32"> Initially famous for its horn-rimmed glasses, made from zylonite and cellulose nitrate in imitation tortoise-shell, and given clout among the glamour set when Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton took to wearing them, they have long been established as one of the first places of call for those who would be both safe and fashionable.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="33"> Anglo-American has added proper optically-sophisticated sunglasses, including Grade 1 optical quality plastic lenses and impact resistant organic glass, to a wide range of frames.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="34"> It has some 10 different frames with clip-ons which exactly match the frame in metal and four in acetate.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="35"> Frames start at Pounds 60 and its clip-ons are Pounds 45 to Pounds 49.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="36"> If your summer is going to include lots of energetic sporting activities then you should look out for Fabris Lane's Etalia Sports range which uses polycarbonate safety lenses of great strength.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="37"> Fabris Lane also offers other specialist lenses - Advanced Graphite Driving lenses (blocks ultra-violet light completely) yet retains good visibility and polarised lenses which eliminate up to 90 per cent of the glare reflected from flat surfaces such as the sea, snow and wet roads.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="38"> Those who are unaccustomed to the kind of prices designer frames tend to attract might like to look at the Mazzucchelli range.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="39"> It does for sunglasses what Warehouse and Miss Selfridge do for fashion - delivers the latest designer look at a fraction of the designer price.</s>

<s docid="FT943-13952" num="40"> For just Pounds 22.50 there is pair of the slightly oval, thin metal-framed frames with good protective lenses which have all this summer's fashionable hallmarks.</s>

<TEXT>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="6"> The idea of surgeons manipulating the shape of the eye to correct faulty vision would have been unthinkable to most people a few years ago.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="7"> But today -with the help of laser incisions, special materials and new techniques - defective eyesight can be improved with a surgical precision that only the latest technology can provide.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="8"> For many, this means a visit to the optician for a new pair of spectacles or contact lenses will no longer be necessary, or not so often.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="9"> Surgeons can break up the lenses of patients with poor vision and replace them with artificial ones.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="10"> The profile of the cornea can be altered and tests are being carried out on injectable lenses made of gels.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="11"> One of the most common eye defects, especially in old people, is the cataract in which the lens becomes clouded.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="12"> It is more common in old people and affects 80 per cent of over 80s in the UK, according to Arthur Steele, a surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="13"> The causes are unknown, but exposure to ultraviolet light and poor diet may be important.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="14"> To restore the vision of an eye with a cataract, the cloudy lens must be removed and may be replaced by a plastic implant.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="15"> But early implants caused problems.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="16"> The Perspex (PMMA) lenses were large and heavy.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="17"> A long incision, weakening the eye and changing its shape as it heals, is needed to insert them and their weight makes them tend to move around.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="18"> Cells tend to stick to the PMMA lenses, making the implant cloudy and the implant is rigid, so the eye cannot accommodate (focus) on near objects.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="19"> Yet all these problems, except the lack of accommodation, have been solved by advances in equipment and techniques.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="20"> The first step towards reducing incision size was to break the lens up before extracting it.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="21"> The problem was to hit the lens hard enough, without damaging anything else inside the eye.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="22"> In the technique known as phaco-emulsification, a vibrating ultrasonic probe breaks the lens up and removes it by suction.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="23"> The latest instruments remove the lens through a 1.5mm incision.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="24"> The problem, however, is that the implant replacing the lens has to pass through the incision and be big enough to sit snugly in the lens capsule holding it in the correct position inside the eye.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="25"> Extracting the old lens through a pinhole is no use if the incision has to be enlarged to insert a big implant.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="26"> The development of foldable lenses alleviates this problem.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="27"> PMMA is rigid, but small lenses can be made with folding extensions (haptics).</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="28"> After insertion the haptics are unfolded to keep the lens in the centre of the capsule.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="29"> These lenses can be inserted through a 5mm incision.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="30"> Even more advanced are lenses that can 'remember' their unfolded shape, and resume it after insertion.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="31"> Made of newer plastics, such as silicone or acrylic, they can be folded or rolled up and inserted through even smaller incisions.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="32"> Lens insertions through incisions as small as 1.5 mm have been reported.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="33"> But these techniques are experimental and need to be carefully evaluated.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="34"> One potential problem is that silicone lenses may unfold violently and damage the eye.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="35"> New lens materials also have other advantages.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="36"> Cells do not stick to them, so the lenses stay cleaner.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="37"> Acrylic lenses can be made very thin, because the plastic has a high refractive index - it bends light sharply, allowing implants of very high optical quality to be designed.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="38"> However, even the latest implants cannot change focus.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="39"> In the normal eye, the lens capsule is under tension and flattens the lens by squeezing it.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="40"> The eye focuses on near objects by relaxing the capsule, allowing the lens to curve.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="41"> Researchers in several countries are searching for a substance that will form a lens that fills the capsule, corrects the focus of the eye and is elastic enough to permit accommodation, or close-up focusing.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="42"> Yet even without accommodation, vision with a rigid implant can be improved by a new technique.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="43"> The profile of the cornea is measured before surgery and the size and shape of the surgical incision are then planned so that the eye heals with a corneal profile giving a precisely calculated degree of astigmatism (difference in focus for lines of different angles).</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="44"> According to Julian Stevens, a London eye surgeon who uses a computer-controlled laser to make the incisions, the desired astigmatism leaves the cornea slightly more curved in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="45"> The subjective effect is that clear vision is obtained except for the very closest work.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="46"> For patients with simpler vision problems surgeons can also modify the profile of the cornea, avoiding the need for spectacles or contact lenses.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="47"> The profile must be made flatter to correct myopia (short sight) or more curved to correct hypermetropia (long sight).</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="48"> One such method is radial keratotomy, in which a star-shaped incision flattens the cornea.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="49"> The success of this technique is highly dependent on the surgeon's skill.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="50"> A newer, and rapidly evolving, technique - entirely driven by technological changes, many derived from military applications - is photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="51"> A computer-controlled laser etches tissue from the corneal surface to change its shape.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="52"> PRK is an area of extremely rapid development.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="53"> Companies in the US, Europe, Japan and Russia are developing more flexible ways of controlling the lasers so that problems requiring different patterns of tissue removal can be treated.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="54"> The change in profile is produced by varying the amount of tissue removed from different parts of the surface.</s>

<s docid="FT943-5736" num="55"> Long-sightedness can now be treated using a moving laser beam.</s>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="11"> Loma Linda University Medical Center on Tuesday inaugurated the world's first hospital-based cancer treatment facility that uses a beam of protons to irradiate tumors.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="12"> Declaring that their $45-million center marks a "milestone" in cancer treatment, Loma Linda officials said proton therapy could ultimately be effective for many of the 1 million new patients diagnosed with cancer in the United States each year.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="13"> Although the use of protons -- positively charged particles in the nucleus of atoms -- to destroy cancer cells is not a new concept, Loma Linda's facility is the first dedicated solely to medical purposes.</s>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="14"> Previously, several thousand patients have received proton treatments at laboratories designed for physics research.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="15"> "This is an important beginning," said Dr. James M.</s>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="16"> Slater, chairman of Loma Linda's department of radiation medicine.</s>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="17"> "If this (treatment) produces the benefits we anticipate, there will be many, many centers like this one available to cancer patients".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="18"> On Tuesday, the Loma Linda center treated its first patient -- a 35-year-old rehabilitation nurse from the Los Angeles area suffering from a tumor in her right eye.</s>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="19"> At a news conference, the patient, Becky Carrillo, said the proton treatment gave her hope of retaining her eye and her vision.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="20"> "I feel very grateful," said Carrillo, who will undergo five treatments and was told there is a 96% chance they will destroy her tumor.</s>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="21"> "My husband said, 'Don't get your hopes up too high,'. . . but I feel like I've been given another chance" .</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="22"> Carrillo was diagnosed with ocular melanoma on Sept. 18 after a partial vision loss prompted her to consult an ophthalmologist.</s>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="23"> Her doctor said the only remedy was removal of the eye, but a friend told Carrillo to seek a second opinion at Loma Linda, and the medical center agreed to treat her.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="24"> Several weeks ago, several tiny metal rings were sutured around the base of the eye tumor to help doctors focus exactly on their target.</s>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="25"> Tuesday morning, Carrillo sat in a padded gray seat resembling a dental chair for her first encounter with the proton beam.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="26"> Her head was held still by a plastic mask attached to the chair's frame, and she was told to focus her eye on a light.</s>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="27"> There was some minor discomfort, caused by having her eyelids stretched open to reveal the eye's surface, but otherwise Carrillo called the 67-second treatment "painless".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="28"> Proton therapy is a form of radiation effective on certain types of so-called localized tumors -- those that have not yet spread throughout the body.</s>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="29"> It is made possible by the use of an accelerator, called a synchrotron, that accelerates the protons to reach the energy level proven effective against cancer cells.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="30"> Because the energy of the beam can be precisely delivered to a tumor without seriously harming healthy surrounding tissues or vital organs, proton treatment is free of many of the side effects of conventional radiation.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="31"> Proton therapy also allows doctors to supply a more potent dose of radiation.</s>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="32"> In conventional radiation therapy, the danger of inflicting excessive damage on adjacent organs or healthy cells often requires doctors to use a less-than-optimal dose, Slater said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="33"> Loma Linda's center, funded by private contributions and $19.6 million in grants from the U.S.</s>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="34"> Department of Energy, will initially treat patients with ocular tumors, like Carrillo.</s>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="35"> Slater said patients with head and neck cancers will be accepted in December and those with cancers below the shoulder may be treated early next year.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="36"> By late 1991, the facility could be treating as many as 100 people a day, Slater said.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="37"> Development of proton therapy has evolved over the past 45 years, and to date 8,000 cancer patients worldwide have been treated.</s>

<s docid="LA102490-0132" num="38"> One Harvard University study showed that after at least two years of follow-up, 96.3% of 1,008 patients with melanoma of the eye had no further tumor growth, and 90% retained their eyes.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="7"> SOME USE them to hide their hangover, some to look glamorous, some to seem famous and others just to 'avoid having to say hello'.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="8"> And some people, of course, even wear them to protect their eyes.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="9"> We are talking about sunglasses, the ubiquitous shades without which no Grand Prix race, film festival or fashionable night happening could take place.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="10"> Shades these days are more than just a passing fad.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="11"> They are part of the growing essentials of the fashionable person.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="12"> Ritzy designers worth their logos turn them out in droves.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="13"> Men and women no longer content themselves with a single pair for serious jet-lag or the tropical sun - in fashionable circles they are bought like handbags, a pair to match the mood and occasion.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="14"> For those who think that shades are only for poseurs, it is worth saying that this is simply no longer true.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="15"> The evidence is piling up that, these days, eyes need protecting from the bad rays of the sun - the UVAs, Bs and Cs - that are increasingly penetrating the thinning ozone layer.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="16"> All have long ago been identified as being harmful to the retina and contributing to the growth of cataracts.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="17"> Of all the rays, invisible ultra violet radiation is the most dangerous to the human eye and, of course, not easy to identify.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="18"> For instance, in Namibia, which I have just visited, inside the characteristic thick morning mist rolling in from the Atlantic shore hover highly dangerous ultraviolet rays.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="19"> So, having agreed that shades these days are more than just a glamorous fashion accessory when strong sunlight or ultraviolet rays are around, how do you choose them?</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="20"> The temptation is to begin with the frames.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="21"> Thick tortoiseshell from Giorgio Armani, solid black from Valentino or little round metal ones from Romeo Gigli? A tempting roll-call but - hold your horses - take a look at the lens first - most of the big names produce lenses of high optical quality and lenses is where you should really start.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="22"> Daska Barnett, President of the North London Optometrists Society advises checking on the label to see if a lens is produced to British Standard 2724 -not easy to do as many, particularly the most fashionable sunglasses, are imported.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="23"> Good opticians, however, will give advise and most will not deal with lenses which are not up to proper optical standards.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="24"> The British Standard classifies sunglasses into several categories of which the most relevant are for: Cosmetic Purposes (mainly just a fashion accessory, these lightly tinted glasses will not protect against significant sunlight); General Purposes (will reduce glare in bright conditions, including driving in daylight); Special Purposes (which means they will reduce glare in abnormal conditions such as sailing and skiing).</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="25"> Either glass or plastic or glass lenses will do.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="26"> Plastic lenses can protect the eyes just as well (provided, of course, they have the UV filter) but they are slightly easier to scratch unless they are coated.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="27"> On the whole, plastic is better for action sports and glass should certainly not be used unless it has been toughened.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="28"> Glass is usually slightly heavier than plastic although it can be made a lot thinner and so is cosmetically better for those who have a heavy prescription.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="29"> Some manufacturers, such as Luxottica, produce lenses of tempered crystal, making them more resistant to scratching and breakage.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="30"> Remember that the colour of the lens has nothing to do with how much UV protection they provide.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="31"> If lenses are coloured, but do not protect against UV rays, Daska Barnett says they are more damaging to the eyes than wearing no glasses at all.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="32"> The eye, noticing that it is dark, dilates making it more vulnerable to the sun's rays, whereas usually in bright sunlight an eye with no glasses over it uses its own protection system by contracting the iris and allowing fewer rays to penetrate.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="33"> If you have not bought a pair recently you may need to sit down before you consider the matter of price.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="34"> A designer name, such as Armani or Valentino will cost anything from Pounds 85 to Pounds 160, while Yves St Laurent starts at Pounds 110 and at Cartier, a Pounds 290 price tag, if not de rigueur, is reeled off without a blush.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="35"> A designer name is not just a way of paying a lot of money for something that could be bought cheaper - designers have to solve complicated functional and technical problems as well as producing frames and lenses that give the consumer the image he is after.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="36"> A canny manufacturer such as Luxottica needs designers such as Armani and Valentino not just for their names, but to make sure his ranges are at the forefront of fashion.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="37"> Ever since Bausch & Lomb was asked to produce anti-glare glasses for fighter pilots in the 1930s and came up with the functional Aviator shades, sunglasses have joined that troupe of accessories that tell the world more about you than you may wish it to know.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="38"> For years Ray-Bans (as they came to be called), Aviator and Wayfarer shapes were the only frames to wear (they still are perenially, classically fashionable) but these days the choice is vast.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="39"> At Harvey Nichols, the Knightsbridge store, a snazzy new sunglasses department has just opened and Daniela Rinaldi, the buyer, tells me the two current looks are big arms, wide eyes, wide-frames in tortoiseshell - Persol, the Italian brand, at about Pounds 99, Cutler & Gross (cats-eyes shaped, tortoiseshell frame) at about Pounds 70 - and small-round metal frames (here the lead brands have to be Gaultier, at anything up to Pounds 300, and Romeo Gigli).</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="40"> Confident extroverts could go for Moschino - lots of cheeky designs like credit cards and combs on the arms, spots and colour, Dame Edna-style jewel-encrusted frames, all jokey, fun and slightly tongue-in-cheek at prices ranging from Pounds 105 - Pounds 185.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="41"> Almost every manufacturer these days has to offer its own version of the shapes now in fashion - little round metal glasses, Jackie O, Grace Kelly, teamed with Hermes-style silk scarves (think of the Riviera circa 1960 To Catch A Thief time).</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="42"> For the shapes without the chichi price tags, Mazzuchelli is a name to look out for - most lie in the Pounds 59 - Pounds 69 bracket.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="43"> Serengeti's is a good photochromic range - traditionally fashionable with toughened glass making them safe.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="44"> The Aviator shape sells the best in that range.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="45"> For drivers looking for protection, it would be hard to beat the Serengeti range.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="46"> Dolland & Aitchison, a chain of some 500 opticians around the UK, reports that Serengeti is one of its best-selling ranges.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="47"> Not cheap - prices range from over Pounds 100 to Pounds 250 - they sport specialised photochromic lenses.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="48"> The glass is toughened and the lens is graded in colour so that it is darker at the top, giving more protection when looking into setting or rising sun, and lighter at the bottom so that the driver can still see the dashboard.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="49"> Persol, it seems generally agreed, does the best fold-ups at about Pounds 99 but it also has a popular Italian cats-eye style - wide-armed in tortoiseshell, also at about Pounds 100.</s>

<s docid="FT922-7705" num="50"> For those who wear glasses all the time, there are two solutions.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="16"> Levels Over Britain `Threatening Food Chain'"] [Text] The Earth's protective ozone is at a record low over Britain and there are fears that the resulting high levels of ultraviolet light could affect pollinating insects and the growth of seedlings.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="17"> Scientists with the Stratospheric Ozone Review Group said yesterday that despite measures to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals, such as the aerosol gases chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the layer will continue to be destroyed into the early part of next century.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="18"> By 2005, the levels of ultraviolet light hitting Aberdeen could be equivalent to those in mid-France.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="19"> Joe Farman, of the European Ozone Research Coordinating Unit and the man who discovered the ozone hole over Antarctica in 1985, said the main threat could be to seedlings and "pollinating insects at the heart of the food chain".</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="20"> He said that to the best of his knowledge no research had been carried out on the links between higher levels of UV and insects such as bees increased levels of ultraviolet light may damage the leaves of seedlings and kill insects by damaging their genetic material.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="21"> As the ozone layer thins, environmentalists and medical researchers fear that the levels of skin cancer will rise.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="22"> The UN has predicted that a 10 per cent decrease in the ozone layer will lead to 300,000 more skin cancers a year and 1.75 million cataracts.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="23"> Dr John Pyle of Cambridge University, chairman of the ozone review group, said this was unlikely, particularly if people took sensible protective measures such as wearing a hat and sun cream.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="24"> The fifth report of the group, which was set up in 1985 by the Department of the Environment and the Meteorological Office, assesses the results from satellite measurements, aircraft and field work.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="25"> It finds that between May 1992 and May 1993 the average global thickness of ozone fell by between 2 and 3 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="26"> Over northern Europe, however, winter levels of ozone slumped by around 25 per cent between 1991 and 1993.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="27"> The scientists said the sharp decline was partly due to unusual weather conditions, in particular a strong and persistent anticyclone over the area, and the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in June 1991.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="28"> They also said the destruction was triggered by a build-up of chlorine chemicals.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="29"> Such chemicals, released from products such as aerosols, refrigerants and fire extinguishers, have been shown to be causing the hole over Antarctica, but these are the first firm findings showing they are also damaging ozone over the northern hemisphere.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="30"> The scientists said that measures under the Montreal Protocol to phase out CFCs and some other ozone-depleting chemicals by 1996 were working, with concentrations beginning to tail off.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="31"> Nevertheless, build-ups of breakdown chemicals, the actual ozone killers, will persist into the next century, peaking between 2000 and 2005.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="32"> This is likely to trigger a 20 to 25 per cent average thinning over Britain and northern Europe since records began in 1979.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="33"> Dr Pyle said the hole over Antarctica was unlikely to disappear until 2080.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="34"> The scientists also called on the Government to save Snoopy, the C130 Herculese aircraft operated by the Meteorological Research Flight at Farnham, Hampshire.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="35"> Last week The Times reported that the plane, which is involved in crucial atmospheric research, was on a Ministry of Defence hit list.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="36"> While America and Germany are building new research aircraft, Britain will have none if Snoopy goes.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-22135" num="37"> Dr Pyle said the aircraft was not only vital for research, but secured Britain a presence in scientific projects of international importance.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="32"> Introduction A.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="33"> Statutory Authority This proposed rule is issued under sections 313(d) and (e)(1) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11023.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="34"> EPCRA is also referred to as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="35"> B. Background Section 313 of EPCRA requires certain facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using listed toxic chemicals to report their environmental releases of such chemicals annually.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="36"> Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such facilities also must report pollution prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention Act, 42 U.S.C. 13106.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="37"> When enacted, section 313 established an initial list of toxic chemicals that was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and 20 chemical categories.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="38"> Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria for these actions.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="39"> Under section 313(e), any person may petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="40"> EPA has added to and deleted chemicals from the original statutory list.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="41"> EPA issued a statement of petition policy and guidance in the Federal Register of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479), to provide guidance regarding the recommended content and format for submitting petitions.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="42"> EPA must respond to petitions within 180 days either by initiating a rulemaking or by publishing an explanation of why the petition is denied.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="43"> On May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23703), EPA issued guidance regarding the recommended content of petitions to delete individual members of the section 313 metal compound categories.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="44"> II. Explanation for Expansion of the EPCRA Section 313 Chemical List A.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="45"> General Rationale The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), through the public access provisions of EPCRA, has proven to be one of the most powerful forces in empowering the Federal government, State governments, industry, environmental groups, and the general public, to fully participate in an informed dialogue about the environmental impacts of toxic chemicals in the United States.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="46"> A major section of EPCRA, which Congress passed in 1986, resulted in the creation of the Toxics Release Inventory.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="47"> TRI is a publicly available data base that provides quantitative information on toxic chemical releases, transfers, recycling, and disposal.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="48"> With the collection of this information for the first time in 1987, came the ability for the public, government, and the regulated community to understand the magnitude of chemical emissions in the United States; to compare chemical releases and transfers of chemical wastes among States, industries, facilities, and environmental media; and perhaps most importantly, to assess the need to reduce and where possible, eliminate these releases and transfers.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="49"> TRI enables all interested in environmental progress to establish credible baselines, to set realistic goals, and to measure progress over time, in meeting those goals.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="50"> The TRI system has become a neutral yardstick by which progress can be measured by all interested parties.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="51"> The original list of chemicals for which reporting was required consisted of 320 chemicals and chemical categories.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="52"> The list was a combination of the Maryland Chemical Inventory Report List of Toxic or Hazardous Substances and the New Jersey Environmental Hazardous Substance List.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="53"> The combination of these two lists provided a sound and logical starting point for the national TRI program.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="54"> Recognizing however that the list would need to be a dynamic one, EPCRA specifically authorizes additions to and deletions from the list.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="55"> To date, EPA has added 16 chemicals to the list and has deleted 12 chemicals from the list.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="56"> With 5 years experience behind the program, EPA, other federal agencies, Congress, and the public have recognized the need to expand the TRI list beyond the original chemicals and chemical categories and beyond the relatively limited reporting universe.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="57"> (Currently reporting is only required from facilities that fall within the manufacturing Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes 20 through 39 that meet certain thresholds).</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="58"> While the data on the chemicals that are covered have allowed the public and private sectors to be informed and involved in environmental decisionmaking as they never were before, it has become increasingly evident to those same constituents that they have access to information on a relatively small number of important chemicals.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="59"> Congress has echoed this recognition in the Right-to-Know More bills that were put forward in the 102nd Congress.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="60"> EPA and State regulatory agencies have integrated TRI information as a critical component in their environmental decisionmaking and in many cases are constrained by the lack of similar information on chemicals of concern not covered by the TRI.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="61"> While the TRI has been successful in focusing attention on the initial list of chemicals and in many cases fostering emissions reductions and prevention activities, that same focus has highlighted the need to expand beyond that initial list and to include additional chemicals that exhibit similar toxicity characteristics.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="62"> This proposal is one of the first in a series of actions that EPA plans to use to expand the coverage of the TRI.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="63"> This first phase will focus on adding chemicals, followed by a second phase that will identify additional facilities for inclusion.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="64"> EPA is considering a third phase, which would look at modification of the data elements currently required by TRI.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="65"> In conjunction with these expansion activities EPA has been considering whether other adjustments are needed in the scope of the TRI program.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="66"> EPA received petitions from the Small Business Administration and the American Feed Industry Association seeking an exemption for ``small sources'' (i.e, those facilities that file TRI forms with zero or small release estimates).</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="67"> EPA previously put those petitions out for public comment and, on review, believes there is substantial merit to the general concerns raised in the petitions.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="68"> The Agency's plan for proceeding on the small source issue would include the following steps.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="69"> EPA is examining four options for establishing a small release exemption from the TRI reporting obligation: Cutoffs at zero, 500 pounds, 1,000 pounds, and 5,000 pounds.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="70"> EPA will provide the public with a report on these four options by the end of January.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="71"> This analysis will consider what data might not be available at both the national and community level, and the cost savings to the government and to industry of the four exemption levels.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="72"> EPA plans to hold a public meeting in February for discussion of the report.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="73"> Based on this feedback, EPA will then design a regulatory strategy that will align the small source issue with final action on today's proposal.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="74"> The Agency's objective will be to minimize unnecessary data collection and reporting by facilities, including for the chemicals identified in today's proposal.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="75"> B. Development of the Chemical Addition Candidates As a starting point for screening candidates for addition to the toxic chemical list under EPCRA section 313, EPA chose to examine the lists of chemicals regulated or identified, as of concern, under various environmental statutes including: (1) Section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990 (Hazardous Air Pollutants); (2) section 602(b) of the CAA (Class II ozone depleting substances); (3) section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) (Priority Pollutant List); (4) Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Active Ingredients, including Special Review, Canceled/Denied or Suspended, and Restricted Use Pesticides; (5) section 302 of EPCRA (Extremely Hazardous Substances); (6) section 102 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); (7) section 3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and chemicals listed at 40 CFR 261.33(e) and (f) and Appendix VIII; (8) section 1412 of the Safe Drinking Water Act as amended; (9) certain chemicals subject to the Toxics Substance Control Act (Existing Chemicals); and (10) the State of California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65) (List of Chemicals Known to the State to Cause Reproductive Toxicity).</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="76"> In addition, EPA considered chemicals designated as possible, probable, or known carcinogens in the Monographs of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the 6th Annual Report on Carcinogens of the National Toxicology Program (NTP), U.S.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="77"> Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="78"> From this initial group of substances, EPA excluded chemicals that are already listed on section 313 or are already reportable under one of the EPCRA section 313 categories.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="79"> For example, ``cyanide, total'' is listed under section 307(a) of the CWA.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="80"> This listing is considered to be a subset of the EPCRA section 313 cyanide compounds category and the hydrogen cyanide listing.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="81"> EPA decided not to propose listing these types of chemicals separately because they are already reportable under one of the existing section 313 categories.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="82"> To prioritize chemicals for possible addition to EPCRA section 313, EPA applied a human health and ecotoxicity screen and a production volume screen, which are described below.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="83"> The results of the toxicity screen for a subset of these chemicals were presented at a public meeting on May 29, 1992 (Ref.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="84"> 4). Other chemicals were also removed from consideration for this rulemaking because they are the subjects of two recently published EPCRA petition responses.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="85"> On March 4, 1992, EPA received a petition from Governor Mario M.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="86"> Cuomo of New York and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) to add 80 chemicals and 2 chemical categories to the list of toxic chemicals under section 313 of EPCRA.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="87"> All of these chemicals and chemical categories appear on the RCRA list of hazardous wastes under 40 CFR 261.33(f) and as such are a subset of the chemicals screened by EPA.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="88"> EPA responded to the petition in a proposed rulemaking on September 8, 1992 (57 FR 41020) and in a final rule adding 22 chemicals on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63500).</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="89"> On December 3, 1991, EPA received a petition from the NRDC, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund to add hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) to the list of toxic chemicals under section 313 of EPCRA.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="90"> The HCFCs are listed under section 602(b) of the CAA as Class II ozone depleting substances and as such are a subset of the chemicals screened by EPA.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="91"> EPA responded to the petition in a proposed rulemaking on June 24, 1992 (57 FR 28159) and in a final rule adding 11 HCFCs on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63496).</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="92"> An additional 16 HCFCs not added to the TRI list by the November 30, 1993 final rule are proposed for addition in this rulemaking (See Unit IV.B.135. of this preamble).</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="93"> 1. Toxicity screen. A toxicity screen is a limited review of readily available toxicity data (e.g.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="94"> , information in data bases and other secondary sources) that is used for a preliminary categorization of a chemical during the process of selecting candidates for possible listing under EPCRA section 313.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="95"> The toxicity screen is used to identify chemicals for further consideration and does not reflect a final determination for listing a chemical under EPCRA section 313.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="96"> Such a determination can only be made after a hazard assessment is conducted (See Unit II.B.3. of this preamble).</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="97"> The chemicals identified above were screened for four general effect categories: Acute human health effects, cancer, other chronic human health effects, and ecological effects.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="98"> The screening criteria associated with each of the effect areas used in the toxicity screen are discussed in detail in the Revised Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines for Listing Chemicals on the Toxic Release Inventory (Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines), (Ref.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="99"> 6). The numerical screening values reflected in the Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines were developed to capture, in the ``sufficient for listing'' screening category, the majority of chemicals already listed on various CERCLA and EPCRA lists, and thus known or suspected to be toxic and/or hazardous.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="100"> These Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines contain guidance for both the screening and hazard assessments of chemicals and are available for review in the docket associated with this rulemaking.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="101"> This draft document was distributed at a public meeting on May 29, 1992.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="102"> A final version of these guidelines has not yet been developed.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="103"> Requests for further information about these draft guidelines should be addressed to the person identified under ``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT''.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="104"> Based on the results of this screen, the chemicals were preliminarily placed in one of three screening categories defined in the Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines : ``sufficient;'' ``may be sufficient;'' or ``insufficient''.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="105"> EPA received comment in response to the Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines that objected to the Agency's use of the terms ``sufficient,'' ``may be sufficient,'' and ``insufficient'' as titles for the toxicity screening categories.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="106"> The commenter claimed that these terms are appropriate only for the results of a hazard assessment.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="107"> The commenter stated that these terms should not be used for screening categories because the toxicity screen only identifies chemicals for further consideration.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="108"> EPA agrees that the screening categories only reflect a preliminary determination on each chemical, and therefore, to avoid further confusion, will refer to the screening categories as ``high priority,'' ``medium priority,'' and ``low priority'' to reflect the difference between a toxicity screen and a hazard assessment.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="109"> These terms will be used throughout this document in reference to the toxicity screening categories.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="110"> Chemicals that were categorized as ``low priority'' during the screening process were not considered further as candidates for addition to the EPCRA section 313 list in this rulemaking.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="111"> 2. Production volume screen . EPCRA section 313(f) establishes reporting thresholds related to the amount of a chemical that is manufactured, processed, or otherwise used.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="112"> [The EPCRA section 313 manufacture (includes import) and processing thresholds are 25,000 pounds per facility per year.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="113"> The otherwise use threshold is 10,000 pounds per facility per year].</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="114"> EPA anticipates that the addition of chemicals manufactured, imported, processed, or used in quantities less than the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds would not result in the submission of TRI reports.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="115"> Thus, EPA elected to initially focus its attention on chemicals likely to yield reports.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="116"> Accordingly, EPA also screened potential candidates for the likelihood of meeting the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="117"> Chemicals for which there were no data to indicate that the chemical is likely to meet or exceed the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds were not considered further as possible candidates for addition to the section 313 list at this time.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="118"> Production volume data on each of the chemicals were gathered primarily from two sources: (1) The TSCA Chemical Update System (1990); and (2) the FIFRA Section 7 Tracking System.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="119"> On June 12, 1986 (51 FR 21438), EPA promulgated a rule pursuant to section 8(a) of TSCA which required manufacturers and importers to report every 4 years, subject to certain threshold production quantities and other exclusions, the quantities of chemicals they produced (40 CFR part 710).</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="120"> Among the exceptions to the inventory update rule (IUR) reporting were polymers, biological products, inorganic substances, and chemicals produced at less than 10,000 pounds, all with certain limitations.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="121"> Data from the IUR is maintained in EPA's TSCA Chemical Update System (CUS).</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="122"> Section 7 of FIFRA provides the Agency with annual production information on registered pesticides.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="123"> EPA regulations implementing FIFRA section 7 (40 CFR part 167) require all manufacturers of pesticidal products (which includes formulated pesticides, active ingredients, and devices) to submit an annual report detailing the amount of each type of pesticidal product manufactured, sold and distributed during the past year, and estimated to be manufactured, imported, and processed during the current year (40 CFR 167.85).</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="124"> For industrial inorganic compounds not subject to FIFRA or available on CUS, information from the public literature was used, supplemented with information from companies.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="125"> 3. Hazard evaluation . EPA conducted a hazard evaluation for each of the addition candidates that resulted from the above analyses and determined based on the weight-of-the evidence if there was sufficient evidence to establish that the candidate chemical met the statutory criteria for addition to EPCRA section 313.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="126"> To make this determination, EPA senior scientists reviewed readily available toxicity information on each chemical for each of the following effect areas: acute human health effects; cancer; other chronic human effects; and environmental effects.</s>

<s docid="FR940112-1-00044" num="127"> In addition, EPA reviewed, where appropriate, information on the environmental fate of the chemical.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="6"> If your definition of a proper holiday includes sunburn, complete with sandy sheets and blisters, you should think again to save your skin.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="7"> Without an intact healthy epidermis your hours would be numbered.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="8"> Whether in the Mediterranean or in the back garden in Wimbledon, you should confine the roasted meat to the barbecue.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="9"> Your skin comprises three layers: the epidermis (the outermost waterproofing which prevents fluid loss and toxin entry), the dermis (a mixture of nerve cells, tissue, glands and blood and lymph channels), and the subcutaneous tissue (which cushions the outer layers from the underlying bone and muscle).</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="10"> It is the body's largest organ, and is a breathing first-line defence against infection.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="11"> Any rupture attracts a ferocious immunologic response.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="12"> If the invader penetrates beyond the skin, the battle is half over.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="13"> It also helps cool the body by dilating the vessels to cool the surface blood and by excreting sweat.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="14"> When exposed to mild radiation, it can produce the precursor to Vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="15"> There are two types of ultraviolet (UV) rays; the first, UV-A, the alleged 'safe' UV, can pass through eyelids, and penetrates into the dermal layer, hair follicles and underlying subcutaneous tissue, causing ageing of these tissues (wrinkles, freckles, ageing spots).</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="16"> The tan obtained this way will not protect you from the burning effects of the sun.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="17"> The other ultraviolet rays, UV-B, penetrate the layers of the epidermis and upper dermis, stimulating the production of a hard protective substance, keratin, which thickens the skin.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="18"> These are the rays believed to cause cancer and burning.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="19"> You can take advantage of the sun this summer by knowing when the sun's UV rays will be most intense and protecting yourself and your children accordingly.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="20"> Because UV rays are filtered by the atmosphere, their strength depends on the location and the time of day.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="21"> Your skin will absorb less intense UV rays in the morning and in the evening (more atmospheric gases to pass through), and in the winter.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="22"> According to Dr John Reeves, professor of dermatology at San Francisco School of Medicine, about 65 per cent of burning rays strike the ground during the four hours around noon.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="23"> The rays also intensify with altitude: for every 330 metres, there is a 5 per cent increase, and snow can reflect up to 100 per cent more (sand and water reflect up to 20 per cent more UV).</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="24"> As for your children, watch them carefully.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="25"> Dr Reeves believes 75 per cent of lifetime sun exposure occurs before the age of 22.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="26"> Sunscreens are de rigueur on beaches and boats this summer, as are hats, UV protective eyeglasses, and clothing.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="27"> But which Sun Protective Factor (SPF)?</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="28"> SPF2 will protect against about 50 per cent UV-B, SPF4 against 75 per cent and SPF15 against 94 per cent.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="29"> All sunscreens protect primarily against UV-B, so that the rays causing premature ageing, UV-A, are unimpeded.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="30"> The sunscreen manufacturers are researching some effective UV-A blockers.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="31"> The UV Warning Badge - one of the most promising recent innovations - is applied to the skin and changes colour to warn that it is time to cover up.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="32"> Once the the skin is red and painful it comes down to damage control.</s>

<s docid="FT923-10771" num="33"> Cool compresses and aspirin might help a little; better still, learn to enjoy the sun without getting cooked.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="9"> WHEN ERNEST Hemingway first met Scott Fitzgerald in a Paris bar in 1925, he was struck by his rival's boyish good looks.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="10"> Fitzgerald, he later wrote, had a delicate mouth and "excited and friendly eyes".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="11"> In fact, throughout Fitzgerald's life, people remarked on his eyes.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="12"> When he was a boy, they were described variously as green, blue or gray.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="13"> And a Princeton friend remembered him as "the handsomest boy I've ever seen.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="14"> He had yellow hair and lavender eyes".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="15"> Unfortunately, not all men are blessed with such mesmerizing features -- especially since many women say that a man's eyes are what they notice first.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="16"> But eye-care specialists and grooming professionals say there are many things a man can do to enhance his eyes.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="17"> Makeup artist Mark Richard, whose clients have included Kirk Douglas and Robert Stack, thinks that if a man is being photographed for a wedding or a corporate brochure, he shouldn't hesitate to apply a little concealer to camouflage dark circles under his eyes.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="18"> But even a man who would never wear cosmetics, Richard says, should make sure that his eyes are well-groomed.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="19"> "I'd start with what I call elephant-hair eyebrows," he says of the coarse hairs that sprout as a man gets older.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="20"> "They're not only unflattering but aging".</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="21"> To get rid of them, he suggests, stroke each brow inward, toward the bridge of the nose, and then clip any stray hairs left standing.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="22"> And, he says, "it's true what your mother told you: Eyes that look too close together make a man look as if he can't be trusted".</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="23"> So a man whose brows run together may want to consider plucking them with tweezers, asking his haircutter to do it or having them waxed.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="24"> Eyebrow waxing is available at numerous hair and skin-care salons.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="25"> Catherine Wood is an independent facialist who works at the Cristophe salon in Beverly Hills and charges $12 to wax a man's brows.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="26"> Wood also dyes eyelashes ($18) and uses a collagen pack to alleviate dryness around the eyes.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="27"> "It's a sponge saturated with collagen liquid that I lay around the eyes at the end of a massage," she says.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="28"> "It's $15 extra on top of a facial, which costs $60".</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="29"> While Wood acknowledges that "crow's-feet can look good on men," such lines can disturb some people's self-esteem.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="30"> Hence, more and more cosmetics manufacturers are offering eye creams formulated to minimize wrinkles.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="31"> Kiehl's Since 1851 is a venerable New York company whose products are available at selected retailers (Neiman Marcus and Fred Segal) and by mail.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="33"> Klaus Heidegger, spokesman for men's division of Kiehl's, says that any man who engages in an outdoor sport should use at least a moisturizer, especially around the eyes, if he wants to forestall wrinkling.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="38"> As he got older, the alcoholic Fitzgerald's eyes appeared bloodshot and bleary.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="39"> But Dr. Peter McDonnell, an ophthalmologist at the Doheny Eye Institute at USC, says that "as part of the aging process, your eyes are a little less clear.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="40"> You get little broken blood vessels in other parts of your body as well, but the conjunctiva (the mucous membrane that covers the front of the eyeball) being so thin, they show up in your eyes more".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="41"> McDonnell says that "some conjunctival changes -- raised spots, yellowish maybe -- are caused by ultraviolet-light exposure.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="42"> So there seems to be a good rationale for wearing UV-absorbing sunglasses.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="43"> And the effect seems to be cumulative, so the earlier you start using them, the better -- driving, skiing, on the beach, sailing".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="44"> But if a man's eyes are merely betraying fatigue or overindulgence, McDonnell says, eye drops and other simple measures can help.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="45"> "Some people find comfort with a cool washcloth," he says.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="46"> "Coolness constricts blood vessels and can be soothing.</s>

<s docid="LA080590-0077" num="47"> It decreases swelling".</s>

<s docid="FT934-14520" num="7"> OZONE levels over the Antarctic have fallen to record lows in the past few weeks and for the second year running the ozone hole has extended to populated areas of South America, the World Meteorological Organisation said yesterday.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14520" num="8"> The latest data show no halt to the trend that has seen the seasonal ozone hole steadily deepen and widen since its first appearance in the late 1970s.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14520" num="9"> The United Nations agency said that, for three weeks in late September and early October, the ozone hole encircled the entire continent, with more than 60 per cent of the ozone destroyed over an area greater than all of Europe.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14520" num="10"> For two days at the end of September, ozone levels over the southern tip of South America were 40 per cent below pre-ozone hole averages and over the Antarctic ozone measurements on several days were the lowest on record.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14520" num="11"> Loss of ozone in the upper atmosphere, which acts as a natural filter against harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun, causes sunburn, skin cancer and cataracts and threatens plant and marine life.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14520" num="12"> Under the Montreal Protocol industrialised countries will prohibit production of chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-eating chemicals from 1995, but their concentration in the atmosphere may not fall until early next century.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14520" num="13"> The US and the European Community are expected to be among some 60 countries ratifying the international treaty on biological diversity by the end of this year, according to Mr Vicente Sanchez, chairman of the intergovernmental committee negotiating details of its implementation.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14520" num="14"> The treaty, which has received 31 ratifications so far, is due to come into force on December 29.</s>

<s docid="FT934-14520" num="15"> However, a week-long meeting of the committee in Geneva involving some 129 nations ended yesterday with little progress on such key issues as funding arrangements, intellectual property rights and the sharing of benefits from use of genetic resources.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="11"> "It would probably be hard for me to quit," Landegent said one recent evening in the lobby of a Westside tanning parlor, his burnished face newly reddened by a blast of ultraviolet rays.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="27"> Vogue and other fashion magazines have declared pale to be "in".</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="28"> The California Legislature in January enacted a law that requires tanning salons to warn customers of the risks.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="29"> Zonker Harris, the Doonesbury comic-strip character who had a passion for tanning, gave up his toasty look a few seasons back.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="35"> Thousands of people too busy to hit the beach or lie by the pool show up each day -- especially after sundown -- to places with names like Jiffy Tan, California Gold, Tan Your Hide, Tan It All, the Covina Beach Club (in the East San Gabriel Valley) and Manhattan Tan (as in Manhattan Beach).</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="36"> Business slows down when the real sun is high and the days are long, and scores of parlors have opened and quickly closed in recent years.</s>

</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="45"> It was the best of tans, it was the worst of tans -- it was, in fact, Coco Chanel's tan that helped make tanning what it is today.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="46"> For centuries, fashion historians report, a tan was the mark of the working classes.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="47"> But in 1922, Chanel, the influential fashion designer, returned from a cruise wearing a darker hue, and a look was born.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="48"> In time, sun-bronzed skin became a symbol of affluence -- of excess leisure time by the pool, on the beach, on the slopes.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="49"> Five years ago, increasing reports of skin cancer -- now up to 500,000 new cases each year in the United States -- prompted the American Academy of Dermatology to launch its anti-sunning campaign.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="50"> Explanations for the increase range from the aging of baby-boomers to the depletion of the Earth's ultraviolet-filtering ozone layer.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="52"> The artificial tanning business began booming in Southern California about the same time.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="53"> The trend arrived late in Los Angeles for the obvious reason.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="54"> "It seemed like selling ice to the Eskimos," said Brian Hebberling, co-owner of the Electric Sun chain.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="55"> What ersatz sunshine merchants discovered were that many Southern Californians wanted a tan but couldn't find the time for the outdoors.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="56"> Some salons cater to their busy clients by providing rooms with telephones, allowing them to conduct business while they brown.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="57"> Although physicians generally condemn tanning machines as harmful, salon operators argue that current tanning machines are safer than natural sunlight because the machines emit fewer "burning" ultraviolet B rays and more of the "tanning" ultraviolet A rays.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="58"> Regardless, dermatologists say a tan is itself a sign of damaged skin.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="59"> "I guess in an absolute world, they're correct," said Wayne Lavassar, owner of the Le Beach Club chain.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="60"> "The case for getting a tan is that we look better and we feel better.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="61"> And if we are going out of doors, it does provide protection from a painful burn.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="62"> That is our body's natural defense against the sun.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="63"> "The reason for indoor tanning is we can achieve that cosmetic benefit, and if we're sensible, we can get that benefit while minimizing the risk".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="64"> Typically, the customer enters a private room, dons protective eye wear and lies on a plexiglass bed outfitted with light tubes.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="65"> Sessions of no longer than 30 minutes are recommended, and no more often than once every 48 hours.</s>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="66"> Wide Range in Fees</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="67"> Fees range considerably.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="68"> One popular club offered a four-month membership special with unlimited visits for $129.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="69"> Another charges $9 per month, plus $1 for every 10 minutes.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="70"> By contrast, a parlor that uses expensive machines that offer only ultraviolet A rays charges $49 per month plus $10 per 30-minute session.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="71"> For that price, one parlor guarantees a tan without a burn.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="72"> But this type of tan produced by ultraviolet A rays provides no protection against the sunburn, so use of a sun block is also recommended.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="73"> But Moy, the UCLA dermatologist, says the dangers of an intense dose of ultraviolet light -- be it A or B rays -- is unknown.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="74"> Two decades ago, he points out, X-ray technology was used to treat cancer.</s>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="75"> Only years later did doctors determine that those treatments enhanced the chances of a person developing skin cancer.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA082589-0056" num="76"> "Ten years from now, 20 years from now, I'm sure I'll be seeing people who went to these tanning parlors," Moy said.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="15"> Sunglasses are not just for the Hello] set, photographed as they stumble out of jets or enter nightclubs.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="16"> With lenses of good optical quality they are more than just a fashion accessory, they are essential eye protection.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="17"> Unfortunately, good lenses do not come cheap.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="18"> Those which are just coloured will not protect against ultra-violet rays and are more damaging to the eyes than wearing no glasses at all (the eye, thinking it is dark, dilates making it even more vulnerable to the sun's rays).</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="19"> Most branded lenses do give some protection but you should always check.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="20"> Having made sure that the lenses are good you can then worry about fashionable frames.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="21"> This year's latest shape is what you might call Swot-of-the-Remove, small round frames giving an air of entirely illusory (in most cases) scholarly distinction.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="22"> Not the most flattering shape, it is the one most in favour with the Voguettes.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="23"> Sketched here is a version by Giorgio Armani, Pounds 115, while Armani's other pair folds into a neat leather pouch, Pounds 125.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="24"> The black Valentino shades are Pounds 115 and represent the other fashionable shape - upswept sides with protection at the sides.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="26"> THERE ARE some for whom the only holiday hat is a Panama.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="27"> Proper Panamas, like the two sketched here, come from Ecuador, where they hand-plait the fibres of the jipijapa plant to make the distinctive headgear.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="28"> They are then steamed and blocked in the US, from whence they set out on their journeys round the world.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="29"> If you are wondering why they are called Panamas it is because north American sailors first discovered them on sale there.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="30"> The two sketched here are imported for gardeners by Pulbrook & Gould.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="31"> Not only are they flattering but they can be folded and packed in a suitcase.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="40"> Shown above is a two-piece bikini with an underwired bra-top and a matching mini-sarong which does not exactly add-up to formal restaurant wear but does lend a vestige of cover-up to the skimpy bottoms.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="47"> CHOOSING luggage has become a complicated business.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="48"> Those who belong to the 'you are what you buy' school of thought believe that your choice of luggage reveals volumes.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="49"> This is a school of thought I am deeply apprehensive about myself, as I feel that my own luggage says nothing at all about my inner being but plenty about the state of my purse and the efficacy of my shopping habits.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="50"> However, the real problem with suitcases revolves around two conflicts: on the one hand one wants them to be light, inexpensive and easy to carry but, on the other, one would like them to be beautiful, too.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="51"> When it comes to appearance no material, in my view, looks as good as leather.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="52"> It may be heavy, it is indubitably expensive, but the older it gets the better it looks.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="53"> Sketched on the right, are four very special pieces, each designed to meet a specific travelling need and each of which, while indubitably expensive, is so finely made that it should last way beyond your own lifetime.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="54"> Henry's, an all-British leather company with a flagship store at 143 Fulham Road, London SW3 (tel: 071-581-1321) has produced the Survival Bag, which is small enough to fit under an aircraft seat yet seems to hold an amazing amount.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="55"> A combination of suitcase, briefcase and document case, it also has two flaps on the front to hold things such as passports, vaccination certificates and the like.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="56"> One side holds the briefcase and document case while the other has four separate deep pockets, each of which has a canvas container into which you can put all those myriad things that seem an inevitable part of modern travelling (the personal toiletries, the malaria tablets, the pocket calculators, or the tot of whisky).</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="57"> It costs Pounds 751.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="58"> Next come three pieces from a new range by Baronessa Franchetti.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="59"> First comes The Weekender - roomy (22in by 10 in by 13) but nothing like as heavy as it looks.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="60"> It has a large, front pocket, another pocket at each end and a detachable shoulder strap.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="61"> Like all Baronessa Franchetti's collection it is made from full hide tanned with natural ingredients.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="62"> In green and tan or black and tan, it is Pounds 375.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="63"> Next comes The Overnighter, a simple, classic Boston-style overnight bag with a detachable shoulder strap,.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="64"> 30 in by 14 in.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="65"> It, too, comes in green and tan or black and tan for Pounds 250.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="66"> Finally, there is The Suiter.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="67"> Suits or dresses hang on the inside hanger and there are three outside pockets, one large and two small, for accessories or documents, as well as two further pockets inside.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="68"> Measuring 18 in by 24 in when closed, it costs Pounds 250.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="69"> All have fine brass detailing with good locks.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="70"> Franchetti-Bond is at 7 Burlington Arcade, London W1 or 5 Lion and Lamb yard, Farnham, Surrey GU9 7LL.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="73"> Whether you want something as simple and useful as a portable iron (The Slim Press), some travelling adaptors, a sturdy flight bag or a tough holdall, Go will be bound to have it.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="74"> There is a travelling laundry (tube of Kwikwash, Stain Go spot removal sachets, a clothes line with hooks and suction cups, a PVC laundry bag, laundry pegs and a carry case for just Pounds 4.50), an array of money belts and bags, as well as inflatable pillows, packaway macs, blow-up hangers and pouches.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="75"> Photographed above is the Wonder towel (Pounds 4.50) which, measuring just 70 cm by 25 cm, mops up as much moisture as a bath towel.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="76"> Apart from its uses while travelling it is ideal for the aerobics set.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="77"> Also pictured is the Aquasafe, a waterproof - if you follow the manufacturer's instructions - belt safe which means you need not leave your valuables on the beach but can take them swimming with you - though not, it seems, scuba-diving.</s>

<s docid="FT933-16379" num="78"> Go products can be found in most department stores and Big airports, such as Heathrow and Gatwick, have a large selection of their wares .</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="10"> "A 40 on my lips, 30 on my face, 15 on my arms and chest and 6 on my legs," says the blue-eyed blonde just before ripping off her regulation red jacket and white T-shirt and jumping into the Pacific for a save.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="11"> Protecting herself from the ravages of the sun is Burke's biggest concern, so she takes extra care to apply sunscreen lotions with higher SPF levels where her skin is more sensitive.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="12"> To combat the drying effects of the sun after exposure, she also moisturizes her face and conditions her hair daily.</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="13"> Southern California lifeguards like Burke realize that spending eight hours on the beach every workday can make sun-induced skin cancer an occupational hazard.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="15"> "Once the information about skin cancer and premature aging of the skin started coming out, lifeguards jumped right on it," says a decidedly untanned Matt Karl, who has been a Huntington Beach lifeguard for the past nine years.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="16"> Karl now wears a long-sleeved T-shirt every day, in addition to an SPF 30 sunscreen lotion, to protect his fair skin.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="18"> Fifty-four-year-old Howard Lee, chief lifeguard of the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbor, has worked the beaches for 36 years.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="19"> He had manned a guard tower for about 12 years when he developed skin cancer on his lip, and he recently had more cancerous cells removed from his shoulder.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="20"> "Thirty years ago, we used baby oil to fry our skin," remembers Lee, who also has no semblance of a tan today.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="21"> "It's not uncommon for (veteran) lifeguards to develop skin cancer.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="22"> Now, because we have more knowledge, the guards check unusual skin conditions early, before they become cancerous".</s>
</P>
<P>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="23"> Although the county has no regulations about skin protection for lifeguards, Lee distributes advisory information at least twice each summer to notify his team of lifeguards about the latest developments in skin cancer research and sun protection.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="24"> He also encourages the men and women to wear protective clothing such as hats and Windbreakers.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="25"> But the decision to take these precautions is up to each individual, he explains.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="26"> "When there's a lot of rescue activity going on, it's not always possible to keep a shirt and hat on".</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="27"> Mark Bitler, who has been a lifeguard at Will Rogers State Beach for 17 years, says that only the new lifeguards appear to feel invulnerable to the sun and still go after a tan.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="28"> By contrast, he wears an SPF 15 sunscreen and a jacket most days and sees a dermatologist for checkups -- just in case there might be early signs of the disease.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="29"> "You start taking precautions as soon as your older co-workers start developing skin problems -- or as soon as you see the first signs of aging on your own skin," he says.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="31"> Bombarded by the media and his supervisors with information about the dangers of the sun, he's become extra cautious.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="32"> Now he wears a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses with ultraviolet light protection, and he slathers on SPF 30.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="33"> He also applies moisturizer to keep his skin supple.</s>

<s docid="LA091089-0004" num="34"> But despite his efforts, Henry's skin is tanned, a sign that it hasn't escaped unscathed.</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="14"> Depletion of stratospheric ozone allows more UV-B radiation to penetrate to the earth's surface.</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="15"> Increased radiation, in turn, has been linked to higher incidence of certain skin cancers and cataracts, suppression of the human immune system, damage to crops and aquatic organisms, and increased formation of ground-level ozone.</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="16"> Further, increased radiation can cause economic losses from materials damage such as more rapid weathering of outdoor plastics.</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="17"> (See 53 FR 30566 (August 12, 1988) for more information on the effects of ozone depletion).</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="18"> In response to scientific concerns and findings on ozone depletion, the United States and twenty-three other nations signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer on September 16, 1987.</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="19"> The original agreement set forth a timetable for reducing the production and consumption of specific ozone-depleting substances, including CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, CFC-114, CFC-115, Halon 1211, Halon 1301, and Halon 2402.</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="20"> EPA implemented the original Protocol through regulations allocating production and consumption allowances equal to the total amount of production and consumption granted to the United States under the Protocol.</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="21"> (See 53 FR 30566).</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="22"> The Parties to the Montreal Protocol met in London June 27-29, 1990 to consider amendments to the Protocol.</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="23"> In response to scientific evidence indicating greater than expected stratospheric ozone depletion, the Parties agreed to accelerate the phaseout schedules for the substances already controlled by the Protocol.</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="24"> They also added phaseout requirements for other ozone-depleting chemicals, including methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and other fully-halogenated chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="25"> On November 15, 1990, then-President Bush signed the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990.</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="26"> Title VI, section 604 of the amended CAA requires a phaseout of CFCs, halons, and carbon tetrachloride by 2000, which is identical to the London Amendments to the Montreal Protocol, but with more stringent interim reductions.</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="27"> Title VI also differs from the London Amendments by mandating a faster phaseout of methyl chloroform (2002 instead of 2005), a restriction on the use of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) after 2015, and a ban on the production of HCFCs after 2030.</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="28"> In Title VI, section 602, the CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, and methyl chloroform are defined as class I substances; HCFCs are referred to as class II substances.</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="29"> Appendix A of this final rule lists the class I and class II substances identified in the CAA.</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="30"> In addition to the phaseout requirements, Title VI includes provisions to reduce emissions of class I and II substances to the ``lowest achievable level'' in the refrigeration sector and to maximize the use of recycling and recovery upon disposal (section 608).</s>

<s docid="FR940318-0-00111" num="31"> It also requires EPA to ban certain nonessential products containing ozone-depleting substances (section 610); establish standards and requirements for the servicing of motor vehicle air conditioners (section 609); mandate warning labels on products made with or containing class I or containing class II substances (section 611); and establish a safe alternatives program (section 612).</s>

<s docid="FT921-8446" num="7"> RUSSIAN and Chilean scientists are to begin studying the depletion of the atmosphere's protective ozone layer over Chile.</s>

<s docid="FT921-8446" num="8"> The joint project will be backed by the air force of Chile (Fach) and the Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which signed a scientific protocol in Santiago at the weekend.</s>

<s docid="FT921-8446" num="9"> Russia will provide a M-17 aircraft equiped to study atmospheric conditions at high altitudes.</s>

<s docid="FT921-8446" num="10"> The research team will include Fach meteorologists as well as scientists from both countries.</s>

<s docid="FT921-8446" num="11"> The involvement of the Chilean air force is an indication of how widespread concern has become over the problem of ozone depletion.</s>

<s docid="FT921-8446" num="12"> Last spring, farmers and fishermen in Chile's far south raised the alarm by reporting that sheep, wild rabbits and salmon were going blind.</s>

<s docid="FT921-8446" num="13"> The inhabitants of these remote parts also began to suffer from eye irritations, allergies and severe skin burns.</s>

<s docid="FT921-8446" num="14"> The symptoms were blamed on the growth of the springtime ozone hole over the Antarctic, which is beginning to extend over parts of southern Australia, New Zealand and Chile.</s>

<s docid="FT921-8446" num="15"> The ozone hole, caused by the accumulation of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) above the Antarctic, allows increased levels of cancer-causing ultraviolet rays to reach the earth.</s>
