<HEADLINE> UK Economists Expect Single Currency to Go Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The European single currency euro
will go ahead on schedule on January 1, 1999 with a broad
membership, according to a survey of some prominent British
economists.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by the pro-European pressure group
named European Movement, revealed that a majority of those polled
agree that the single currency to be broadly successful, but none
of them expects Britain to join the European Monetary Union (EMU)
in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
Those who believe that the EMU will be a success cite low
interest rates, low unemployment and low inflation as benefits of
the planned single currency.
</P>
<P>
Fears of a single currency failure focus on the reduction of
monetary flexibility and the risk that the European Central Bank
will set interest rates too high.
</P>
<P>
Director of the European Movement Stephen Woodard said, "The
single currency debate in this country has suffered from too much
ill-informed speculation and too little fact."
</P>
<P>
sooddard called on Britain to make various preparations and
rational debates on the single currency as "the single currency is
going to happen."
</P>
<P>
"If Britain is to make up its mind on this crucial issue, it
must be discussed in an informed way, free from prejudice and
hype," he added.
