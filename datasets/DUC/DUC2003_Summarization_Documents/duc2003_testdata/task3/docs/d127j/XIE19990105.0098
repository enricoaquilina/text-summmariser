<HEADLINE> News Analysis: What Does Euro Mean to Asia? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- With the bells ringing for the
first day of the last year of the 20th century, a new currency was
introduced to the world's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The euro, the European single currency, made its debut in the
Asian markets Monday, bringing new challenges and new hopes for
the continent, which has been suffering from the financial crisis
in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Markets in Asia gave the euro a warm welcome in the first
trading day of the new year on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The euro was trading at 1.18 U.S. dollars or more on all
markets, compared with the starting level of 1.16675 dollars
established on December 31 when the rates of the currencies were
irrevocably fixed by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the launch of euro will alleviate the pressure
which Asian currencies felt from the strong U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
They had predicted that a higher euro against the dollar will
strengthen the yen against the greenback and lend support to the
other Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the euro rose against nearly every
currency in Monday's trading while the U.S. dollar fell against
every other currency. In Thailand, the baht appreciated to 36.55
baht to the dollar from 37.30 last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of the euro, some central banks in Asia have
been considering the reallocation of their reserves since there is
under-representation of European currencies in reserve holdings.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some Asian central banks were buying the
euro against the dollar on Monday to diversify their
greenback-dominated reserves.
</P>
<P>
Apart from balancing their reserves, Asia would also face
greater demand for the euro and decreased demand for the dollar in
the medium term as transaction costs in Europe will be denominated
in the new currency.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries have long been dependent on the greenback in
their trading. In Thailand, more than 80 percent of total trade is
denominated in dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the European Union has the largest share of the global
economy, with 29 percent of the world's gross domestic product, as
well as a 20-percent share in global exports.
</P>
<P>
With the back of the market of the 11-nation "Euroland", the
euro is expected to play an important role in future market
activities.
</P>
<P>
But the euro also caused some worries among Asian economic
policy makers.
</P>
<P>
Hoping that relatively weak currencies could make the region's
export more competitive, Asian leaders would not be so happy to
see the rapid appreciation of their currencies as a result of the
strong euro.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Asian central banks would enter the market to
ensure that their currencies do not appreciate rapidly to guard
the region's competitiveness in exports, the key to reviving the
recession-hit economies.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean central bank already acted last month to
cushion the won's rapid rise against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Asian leaders also worry that their traders would face stiff
competition in European markets.
</P>
<P>
Reduced foreign exchange and transport costs could push more
European importers to seek goods from European sources, instead of
from Asian exporters.
</P>
<P>
"The greater efficiencies which come with the common currency
will help Europeans produce cheaper products, and thus make them
more competitive in relation to Thai businesses," Apinan
Pavanarit, director-general of the Thai Foreign Ministry's
European Affairs Department, said.
</P>
<P>
And if the euro is stable and does help the European countries
to lower their interest rates and production costs, more
investments will be lured to the European markets, which is by no
means good news for the cash-strapped Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Experts said it would take up to five years before the euro's
direction could clearly emerge, as well as the new role the
currency would play in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Though posing no real threat to the dominance of the greenback
in the market, the message the euro delivered is much more
important to the Asian countries, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the euro is a big push for some regional
organizations in Asia, particularly the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, which is planning for an economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Many Asian countries have realized that closer economic
cooperation within the region is crucial in a highly competitive
world market today.
