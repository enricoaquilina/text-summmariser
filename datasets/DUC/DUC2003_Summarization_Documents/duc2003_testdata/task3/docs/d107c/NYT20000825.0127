<P>
   Mattie Compton describes her personal position on the death
penalty as ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth woman has a strong sense of the need to keep
society safe and the importance of the criminal justice system,
especially when dealing with horrific crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But as an African-American, she sees that the death penalty
disproportionately affects her community and also the poor. And as
a Christian, she feels called to act with compassion, forgiveness
and care, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people of faith are certainly struggling with the
issue,'' said Compton, chairwoman of the trustees at Mount Zion
Baptist Church in Fort Worth. ``... It is a moral, ethical issue,
and it is one in which people of a very strong faith are indeed
still human and where we have great difficulty in following Christ
and not seeking vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of many faiths have officially expressed opposition to
the death penalty, and some have recently reiterated their
position, joining those who have called for scrutiny of how capital
punishment is administered.
</P>
<P>
   But others, particularly leaders of the Southern Baptist
Convention, support the death penalty. Still others, like Compton,
continue to struggle with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in attitude were evident in the results of a Gallup poll
released in June that showed 66 percent of Americans favor the
death penalty as punishment in murder cases, down from the 80
percent who did in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Christian Life Commission of the Baptist General
Convention of Texas gathered a group of about dozen people _
including Compton _ to develop a statement on the death penalty,
said Phil Strickland, director of the Christian Life Commission of
the Baptist General Convention of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee as a whole expressed various views,'' Strickland
said. ``There is a consensus about how the death penalty is used in
Texas and also at the point of our penal philosophy being more
oriented toward retribution than restoration.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there are differences of opinion within the committee,
the group could well find itself on the opposite side of the debate
from the Southern Baptist Convention, the national organization of
Southern Baptists. This summer, the group, the largest Protestant
denomination in the United States, approved a resolution in support
of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   At a June meeting in Orlando, Fla., the Southern Baptist
Convention voting members for the first time approved a resolution
that supports ``the fair and equitable use of capital punishment
... as a legitimate form of punishment for those guilty of murder
or treasonous acts that result in death,'' the resolution states.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the death penalty can be found in both the Hebrew
Bible and the New Testament, said Richard Land, president of the
Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Bible says that civil government is divinely
authorized to protect citizens and does so by executing those
convicted of capital crimes and in declaring war, said Land, who
also hosts the daily radio program ``For Faith and Family.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age in which sophisticated methods are used to collect
evidence, the justice system can ``virtually guarantee that an
innocent person is not going to be executed,'' but cannot ensure
that convicted murderers will not kill again, Land said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the right to expect that, if you kill my wife, the
government will exact justice; not revenge, justice,'' Land said.
``If I did it, that would be revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But others disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hugghins, pastor of Elkins Lake Baptist Church in
Huntsville, Texas, said his opinion of the death penalty is
changing.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he accepted capital punishment as the price of justice in
an imperfect society, Hugghins said. But in the community where
Texas houses its Death Row, Hugghins has been a pastor to church
members who work in the justice system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he recognizes that capital punishment can be found in the
pages of the Bible, the message of Jesus Christ is one of
redemption, he said. It is through this prism that the death
penalty should be opposed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure Jesus is real thrilled about putting a final note
on anybody's life,'' Hugghins said. ``I think the Jesus ethic is,
`Always look for redemption.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the Roman Catholic Church in the United States, opposition
to capital punishment is now considered consistent with the
church's teachings on the sanctity of life, said Dan Misleh, a
policy adviser for the United States Catholic Conference's
department of social development and world peace.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Catholic Church has not always been doctrinally
opposed to the death penalty, Catholic bishops in the United States
began discussing their concerns about it in the mid-1970s. In 1980,
the conference of bishops issued a formal statement that clearly
denounced capital punishment, Misleh said.
</P>
<P>
   But for many Catholics, a firm call to oppose the death penalty
came in a 1995 message from Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   In that statement, the pope said that modern penal systems made
it unnecessary to protect society by executing dangerous criminals,
Misleh said. Then in a speech during his 1999 visit to St. Louis,
the pope called capital punishment ``cruel and unnecessary'' and
urged Americans to end the practice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the Church has taught that capital punishment is
legitimate, that door is pretty much slammed shut,'' Misleh said.
</P>
<P>
   That door may not be slammed shut for Orthodox Jews. The Hebrew
Bible allows for the death penalty, said Rabbi Gedalia Schwartz,
the chief presiding judge of the rabbinical court of the Rabbinical
Council of America, a professional association of Orthodox rabbis.
But when viewed in the context of the Talmud, the body of teaching
and interpretations of Jewish law, it is clear that capital
punishment is only to be used in rare cases and after extreme
scrutiny of the case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the actuality of the Scriptures, of the law, the
death penalty, to be carried out to its conclusion, was extremely
rare,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   For the governing body of the United Methodist Church, carrying
out the death penalty should not just be rare, but prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the Methodist church's governing body approved a
statement against the death penalty in any form and urged ``the
abolition of capital punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   At the quadrennial meeting of the General Conference this
summer, the group supported a moratorium on using the death penalty
and proposed steps Methodists can take to oppose the death penalty
in their own states, said Frances Jett, a program director for the
United Methodist Church's General Board of Church and Society.
</P>
<P>
   The church also supports a network of capital punishment
opponents, United Methodists Against the Death Penalty, started
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much has come to light about the death penalty being so
unfair,'' Jett said. ``... With the heightened awareness ... it has
given new life to the movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A) has opposed
the death penalty since 1959, said the Rev. Kathy Lancaster, who
works in the denomination's National Ministries Division.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is unclear how many believers in the pews see the
death penalty the same way denomination leaders do, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 survey of 5,164 Presbyterians showed that 63 percent of
church members favor the death penalty in murder cases, but only 34
percent of pastors do, Lancaster said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Southern Baptists, most agree with the convention's
resolution in support of the death penalty, Land said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most Southern Baptists would agree that (convicted
serial killer) Ted Bundy deserved to die for what he did to those
young women,'' he said.
