<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Halts Two Executions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Supreme Court known for its impatience with  
death row appeals surprisingly halted two executions this week and 
is on track to issue four significant rulings on capital punishment 
by summer. 
</P>
<P>
	One case asks the justices to ban the electric chair. Two focus  
on a federal law aimed at speeding up executions. The fourth asks 
whether a person can be sentenced to die by a jury admittedly 
confused about a judge's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	The four death-penalty cases represent an unusually high  
percentage of the court's still-growing decision docket, which now 
totals 54. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect the court to scale back the states' use of  
capital punishment across the board, but this may be a year when 
important guidelines are offered,'' said Steven Hawkins, executive 
director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope is the court will conclude that the time has come for  
the electric chair to be eliminated as a means of execution,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the current nine justices is unalterably opposed to  
capital punishment, as were some past justices. 
</P>
<P>
	But an hour before a Virginia death row inmate was to have died  
by lethal injection Thursday night, the justices ordered the 
execution postponed and said they will fully review his case. At 
issue is federal court access for state prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Two nights earlier, they had similarly halted an imminent  
Florida electrocution and agreed to use that death row inmate's 
case to decide whether death in the electric chair amounts to 
unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Death row inmates in Arizona and Texas failed to win last-minute  
Supreme Court help this week. Those two executions raised the 
year's total to 83, the most since 1954. Across the nation, around 
3,600 convicted killers await execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over continued use of the electric chair may prove  
dramatic in light of recent experiences in Florida, where flames 
shot from one inmate's head, and another bled heavily during his 
execution. But the immediate impact of anything the court decides 
will be limited because only four states -- Florida, Alabama, 
Georgia and Nebraska -- require execution by electrocution. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court were to ban all use of the electric chair, those  
states likely would switch to a more common method such as lethal 
injection. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices are using two Virginia death row cases to clarify  
an expansive 1996 federal law, the Anti-Terrorism and Effective 
Death Penalty Act. The law sharply limited federal court access for 
all defendants convicted in state courts. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in Terry Williams' case is how much discretion Congress  
wanted federal judges to have in reconsidering state courts' 
findings, particularly over the adequacy of the legal help a 
defendant received. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia death row inmate Michael Williams, who was scheduled to  
die Thursday, is challenging a portion of the 1996 law that bars 
federal judges from conducting hearings if a state prisoner 
``failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court 
proceedings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Williams says lower courts wrongly applied that  
provision when denying him a federal court hearing because state 
prosecutors' conduct deprived him of a meaningful hearing in state 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	While both Virginia cases are narrowly focused, the court's  
decision in each could affect hundreds of inmates nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In another Virginia case, Lonnie Weeks says he was condemned  
after a judge refused to tell jurors they were not required to vote 
for death just because they had made a certain factual finding. The 
jury had told the judge it had not fully understood the sentencing 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court's appetite for death penalty disputes is not yet  
satisfied, the justices could agree -- as early as Monday -- to 
tackle a potential whopper. A pair of appeals from Nebraska and 
Florida contend that keeping a convicted killer on death row for a 
long time -- decades after his conviction and sentence -- amounts to 
unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment.
