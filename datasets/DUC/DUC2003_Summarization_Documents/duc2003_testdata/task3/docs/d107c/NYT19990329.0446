   BOSTON _ Following six hours of passionate debate Monday, the
Massachusetts House of Representatives defeated a bid to reinstate
the death penalty in a vote that underscored the erosion of
legislative support for capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   By an 80-73 tally, the House accepted the Criminal Justice
Committee's vote last week to reject death-penalty legislation that
Governor Paul Cellucci had made a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, an opponent of capital
punishment, called the vote a decision of conscience for a chamber
that only 15 months ago blocked reinstatement in a tie vote after
an 11th-hour switch by one representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no strong-arm approach whatsoever,'' said the
Mattapan Democrat. ``This is as straight as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monday evening, Cellucci assailed the speaker for holding
the vote when the House had six vacant seats, and he questioned
whether Finneran influenced the resignation last week of a
pro-death penalty legislator, Dennis M. Murphy, a Springfield
Democrat, who stepped down to take a private-sector job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he was determined to defeat it, and he did,''
said the Republican governor. ``And I think it's unfortunate
because I believe that the people of this state are not being
represented by their representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci pledged to refile the legislation again next year. And
House Minority Leader Francis L. Marini said the death penalty
could resurface again this year, as an amendment to the Senate
budget.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative A. Stephen Tobin, a death-penalty supporter
who is cochairman of the Criminal Justice Committee, conceded that
such a maneuver would be futile in a House that already has spoken.
</P>
<P>
   The last execution in the state was in 1947. The state Supreme
Judicial Court threw out the most recent capital-punishment law in
1984. Massachusetts is one of 12 states that does not carry the
death penalty on its books.
</P>
<P>
   For six hours, the century-old chamber echoed with rhetoric that
contained counterbalanced pleas: descriptions of the death penalty
as the ultimate justice for victims of horrific murders, and
arguments that capital punishment is nothing more than
state-sanctioned murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one irrefutable fact: Innocent people are wrongly
convicted,'' said Representative Peter J. Koutoujian, a Democrat
from Newton. ``Innocent people have been sent to death row and been
executed. Today, we deal with an issue of life itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, a Democrat from Quincy, said ``common ground'' could be
found between the two camps because ``no one has argued that these
criminals have a right to go on living.'' The argument has been
that the execution of a murderer is akin to the crime, Tobin said,
and that ``seems to be an exercise in semantics.''
</P>
<P>
   Due-process safeguards in the legislation, Tobin said, ``would
make it virtually impossible to execute an innocent man.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold P. Naughton Jr., a Democrat from Clinton, was the only
legislator to change his vote from 1997. A supporter of the death
penalty that year, Naughton surprised administration officials when
he cast the deciding negative vote for the Criminal Justice
Committee last week.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 new legislators in the House this year were considered a
key factor in the vote, but they broke almost evenly on the issue.
Representative Steven V. Angelo, a Democrat from Saugus who
endorsed capital punishment in 1997, did not vote Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most eloquent speeches made on the floor was
delivered next to last by freshman Representative Brian P. Golden,
a Democrat from Brighton. With a membership listening intently for
nearly the first time since debate began hours before, Golden
declared the country's judicial system to be fraught with the
potential for deadly mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Golden, a lawyer and son of a career police officer, told the
rapt chamber: ``If the death penalty is resurrected, the capacity
for error in our all-too-human system will beget tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans offered amendment after amendment in unsuccessful
attempts to make the bill palatable to opponents. After a bid to
postpone the vote until September was defeated overwhelmingly,
death-penalty foes also rejected efforts to limit capital
punishment to killers of law enforcement officers, to convicted
murderers who kill again in prison, and in cases where several
layers of proof and witnesses would be required.
</P>
<P>
   Representative John P. Slattery, the Peabody Democrat whose vote
change in December 1997 created an 80-80 tie that doomed the bill,
lashed out at the attempt to reserve capital punishment for ``cop
killers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is a cop's life more important than my mother's?''
Slattery asked angrily. He also said that the much-debated concept
of capital punishment as a deterrent is ``a lame argument,'' and
that the impact of a death penalty is felt disproportionately by
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no good murder,'' said Representative Byron Rushing,
a Democrat from the South End. ``We want a place with less murder.
We want a place with less violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile outside the State House, a noontime rally was solidly
behind the reinstatement of capital punishment. Flanked by
relatives of murder victims and standing before dozens of police
officers, Cellucci pointed to the State House and said in a rising
voice: ``We have a House of Representatives that is out of touch
with the people they represent.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly an hour, pro-death penalty speakers squinting in the
sunlight stepped up to the podium. Some gave raw details about how
a loved one was murdered. Voices cracked. Chins quivered with
emotion. Fists banged the microphone stand. Police officers nodded
in agreement with political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   One speaker was Ann Schiavina, whose son, a police officer, was
murdered on the job in Springfield. Wearing a large gold cross
around her neck and saying she was a Catholic originally from
Northern Ireland, Schiavina recalled her outrage at not being able
to vote in her former homeland because of her religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that right was taken from me again,'' she said, adding
that she sent a certified letter to Finneran requesting he delay
the vote until all the House seats are filled. She never got a
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the speaker of the House ... you're not a man and I hope to
god you're not Irish,'' Schiavina said.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following the rally, Cellucci conceded defeat even
though the vote was several hours away. He said that momentum had
waned in the two years since 10-year-old Jeffrey Curley's murder,
that the opposition is better organized, and that the good economy
has taken away some of the issue's urgency.
