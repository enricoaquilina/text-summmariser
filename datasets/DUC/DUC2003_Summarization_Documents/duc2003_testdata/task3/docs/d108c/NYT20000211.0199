   The best comment on the demise of Steve Forbes' presidential
campaign was disseminated by The Associated Press, which quoted the
executive director of a group that studies the financing of
campaigns: ``Never has so much been spent with so little in
return.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will go down in the annals of presidential politics as a
spectacular example of the dictum that just throwing money at an
election doesn't win you an office,'' said Larry Makinson of the
Center for Responsive Politics. ``It's a lesson that seems to be an
expensive one for millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it? Ask Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes offered a different take on his $60 million-plus
investment in two futile campaigns for the Republican presidential
nomination. He said the money was well-spent because he ``created a
new conservative agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure he did. And Perot gets credit for balancing the federal
budget because he railed about deficit spending in two pointless
campaigns for president.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. People who set fire to all that money are probably
entitled to rationalize the spending any way they want to _ even
though the rest of us know that self-aggrandizing egomaniacs such
as Forbes and Perot contribute nothing of value to the political
process in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Forbes has become the seventh Republican to bail out of
this year's race, the pundits are pondering the impact of his
departure on the remaining candidates. Most of the experts figure
that the impact will be minimal or nonexistent because Forbes would
have commanded even less voter support in upcoming primaries than
he did in the first two.
</P>
<P>
   That's an accurate assessment, as far as it goes.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes' decision to quit the race will have an effect
because it helps clear the field for George W. Bush and John McCain
to confront each other without the annoying distractions created by
marginal candidates. With Forbes gone, the only marginal candidate
still standing is Alan Keyes _ and even the self-righteous Keyes
will surely realize before long that he's making a nuisance of
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he won't.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the Bush-McCain showdown has begun, and Republican
voters must seriously come to grips with the challenge of choosing
a candidate to carry their party's banner into the November
election against the Democrats. The operative words here are
``Republican voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The media and the pollsters are fixated on McCain's popularity
among Democrats and independents, but Democrats and independents do
not choose Republican nominees for president. Republicans choose
Republican nominees for president.
</P>
<P>
   So. Once these early primaries that allow and even encourage
capricious party-switching are out of the way, Bush and McCain will
settle down to the task of winning Republican votes in Republican
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   All these left-leaning commentators who are beating the drum for
McCain would like nothing better than to see both major political
parties nominate presidential candidates who espouse liberal
causes. The Democrats will give them what they want in the person
of either Al Gore or Bill Bradley; but Republicans, believe it or
not, do not share the media's view that the only good candidate is
a liberal candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to be represented in the general election by a
conservative nominee, which puts McCain at a colossal disadvantage
as the GOP race proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   McCain might be a conservative, but he's been pandering to
liberals in his effort to draw Democrats and independents into
Republican primaries. He'll be hard-pressed in coming weeks to
convincingly portray himself as a conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, of course, has forthrightly proclaimed his conservatism
from the beginning. He is the natural choice for real Republicans
in real Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans get down to the serious business of choosing
their candidate for president, McCain's independent/Democrat-driven
surge will melt faster than a New Hampshire snowball in the warm
sun of Texas.
