<HEADLINE> Navy Gives Potential Pilots Tryout  </HEADLINE>

   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- The Navy is giving college students and
graduates a one-week aviation tryout to boost recruitment and
reduce a flight-training dropout rate that can be as high as 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   One purpose is to weed out those who lack the commitment or
physical and mental attributes necessary to get through rigorous
and expensive training programs for pilots and navigators.
</P>

   ''The other part of this is the motivational aspect, bringing
them down here and giving them an aviation, quasi-Top Gun
experience and getting them feeling good and pumped up about the
fact that they want to do this,'' said Capt. A.J. Gallardo.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, the Navy has brought 100 young men and women to
Pensacola Naval Air Station in small groups once a month for the
Aviation Certification Evaluation and Screening Program.

<P>
   Participants undergo physical training and swimming tests, get
medical examinations and take rides in turboprop training planes.

   ''It's hard to comprehend what it is like until you get down
here and see how the whole process works,'' said Dan Brown, 26, a
copy machine salesman who graduated from the University of
Wisconsin in 1996 and opted to stick with flight training.
''Nothing was sugarcoated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy plans to expand the program next year to Naval Academy
graduates and students in Officer Candidate School.
