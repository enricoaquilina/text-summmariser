 &HT;    `Peanuts' creator officially retires, but characters to continue
in other formats

   ATLANTA _ His message begins, with perfect rightness, ``Dear
Friends'' _ for who in the world doesn't feel like a close personal
pal of Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy and all the other
pint-sized legends of ``Peanuts''?
</P>
<P>
   Today Charles M. Schulz bids farewell to his daily installments
of ``Peanuts'' with the letter to readers, bringing to a close the
half-century run of the world's most beloved comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Peanuts'' world won't close up shop. New Sunday strips
will run until Feb. 13, when Schulz plans a final farewell. After
that, newspapers will continue to run daily and Sunday reprints
from the last 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Peanuts'' characters will loom large as ever in a $1
billion-a-year worldwide empire of theme park attractions, videos,
books and other licensed products (would you believe a chain of
Snoopy Place restaurants based in Singapore?).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the day-to-day narrative of ``Peanuts,'' the
ever-unfolding comedy (with streaks of high drama!) is done. For
Charlie Brown, the yearning for the little red-haired girl will be
forever unrequited; the successful football kick (with Lucy
diabolically ``holding'') unconsummated. Schulz, 77 and receiving
chemotherapy for colon cancer, has decided to give up the rigors of
the strip in order to recover his health. Assuming the treatments
are successful, he hopes to concentrate on select ``Peanuts''
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Paige Braddock, a former Atlantan who is creative director for
Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates in Santa Rosa, Calif. (the
six-person studio that coordinates all ``Peanuts'' products), is in
regular contact with Schulz at his California home and says that he
is looking forward to writing screenplays for more ``Peanuts''
animated videos when his cancer treatments are complete. Already in
production in London is ``It's the Pied Piper, Charlie Brown,''
first of a series of new videos contracted with Paramount.
</P>
<P>
   As for the reprints, they will commence in newspapers Tuesday
with classic strips from as far back as 1974, a cut-off date
stipulated by the cartoonist even though he's been drawing Charlie
Brown and a few other characters since 1950. A spokesman for United
Media, which syndicates the strip to 2,600 papers worldwide,
explained that by 1974, all of the major characters _ including Pig
Pen, Peppermint Patty and Woodstock _ had been introduced, and the
strip had basically achievcurrent look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Schulz isn't as fond of reprinting his earliest strips,
because his drawing style has constantly evolved,'' says Lisa
Wilson of United Media. ``For many younger readers, the '70s strips
will be brand new. We hope that with these reprints we can cushion
the shock of Mr. Schulz's retirement _ give people their daily dose
of `Peanuts' comfort and joy.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the people who lives for those injections is Sandy
Norman, a homemaker who for the Christmas holidays decorated two
rooms of her Rockmart home with ornaments and plush figures of
Snoopy and Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a cool yet classy dog,'' Norman said of the
multiple-role-playing canine. ``The `Peanuts' characters may be
retiring but I believe there is too much history around for them to
fade away.''
</P>
<P>
   Jodi Goldfinger of Stone Mountain, Ga., saluted her longtime
favorite, Charlie Brown, who ``thinks he's a loser but he's not,
because he keeps on trying no matter how often the `kite-eating'
tree chomps his kite. Thank you, Charles Schulz, for keeping the
kid alive in all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Luckovich, Atlanta Constitution editorial cartoonist, says
that one of the biggest thrills of his career was being asked by
Sparky (as Schulz's friends call him) to advise him on the choice
between two possible endings to a ``Peanuts'' strip. Schulz took
the Atlantan's advice.
</P>
<P>
   Luckovich said many of the nation's foremost syndicated
cartoonists are conspiring to pool their talents and create ``a
very big surprise for Sparky'' in late May, when he will be honored
with the Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award at the National
Cartoonists Society Reuben Awards convention in New York. As
recently as last spring, Schulz was spotted outside a convention
hall, tossing a baseball with friends _ keeping in touch with the
all-American wellspring of Charlie Brown's angst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sparky's a very nice, gentle person, and some people may even
think he's difficult to approach, because he's so shy,'' Luckovich
says. ``I think there's still some Charliein him, after
all.''
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of Snoopy, too, perhaps. Like the shyest of humans,
Snoopy never spoke, but he had a bold, colorful interior life that
we could telepathically share by means of thought balloons. Like
Snoopy, Schulz could play myriad roles in his own mind. Fittingly,
it's Snoopy that we see in today's final ``Peanuts'' strip, mulling
over the typewriter that's magically balanced on the peak of the
doghouse roof.
</P>
<P>
   It's a portrait of the artist as a young beagle, dreamily
scanning the horizon, interpreting the clouds.
