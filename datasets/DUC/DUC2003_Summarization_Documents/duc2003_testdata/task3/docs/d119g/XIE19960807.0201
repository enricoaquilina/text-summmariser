<HEADLINE> India, Bangladesh to Hold Talks on Disputed Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Foreign Secretary
Faroq Sobhan is expected to arrive here today for talks with India
on three long-standing issues troubling bilateral relations -
Ganges water-sharing, trade imbalance and transit, the Indian
Express said today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that while a long-term agreement to the
contentious water-sharing problem may not be easy to come by, it
is imperative, in view of improved Indo-Bangladeshi relations,
that a short-term solution should be worked out.
</P>
<P>
While water-sharing may be Dhaka's foremost concern, India is
equally keen on transit rights for Indian goods to its North
Eastern states.
</P>
<P>
But India's request has been met with fears that providing a
transit route through Bangladesh would pose a security risk to
that country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there is a possibility that India may be willing
to sort out the water-sharing problem with Bangladesh in exchange
for a transit route for Indian goods.
