PHONING AND DRIVING DON'T MIX IN CLEVELAND SUBURB 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BROOKLYN, Ohio _ It is illegal to drive while talking on a cell
phone in this Cleveland suburb, apparently the only place in
America with such a ban.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John Coyne, 82, who is in his 52nd year in office, and who
can recall when people survived without driving automobiles or
talking on telephones, let alone doing both at once, believes it is
just a matter of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have gotten a little out of hand, don't you think?''
said Coyne, noting that some cars now have computers, fax machines,
even televisions. ``Pull off the road if you want to use an
electric shaver, if you want to put on lipstick, if you want to use
a cell phone. But if you're driving, for goodness sakes, then keep
two hands on the wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded on three sides by the city of Cleveland, this older
suburb of factories, strip malls, modest bungalows and ranch
houses, with a population of about 11,000, might not seem like a
trend-setter. But it was Brooklyn, in 1966, that passed the first
law in the nation to require the use of seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Talking on the phone while driving here carries a penalty of
$100, plus $45 in court costs. So far, the police have only issued
warnings. More than 100 people have been stopped for the offense
since the ordinance took effect in March.
</P>
<P>
   The grace period will end ``in a reasonable time period,'' said
Coyne, after the town posts some no-talking-while-driving signs and
people become familiar with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief James Maloney said he thinks most people know about
the law by now. ``When a squad car passes, you see them jump off
the phone and hide it under the dash.''
</P>
<P>
   Support for the ban was fueled by an accident near City Hall,
when the automobile of an elderly motorist was rammed by a driver
talking on his cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney witnessed the accident. ``The guy was so engrossed in
his telephone conversation, he just slammed into the car stopped in
front of him at the light,'' Maloney said. ``Even after the crash,
the guy still had the phone in his ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Brooklyn, no town or state outlaws talking on the
phone while driving, according to Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in Washington. But
some countries, including Israel, ban cell phones while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd said the federal safety agency, while cautioning that
phones can be a distraction for some drivers, has not focused on
them as a particular danger.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 35 million cell phones in the United States, a
figure that is growing fast. Not so many years ago, cell phones
were seen as a toy for hard-charging business executives or those
who liked extravagant flourishes. But they have become fixtures of
middle-class life.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association, a trade group that opposes the Brooklyn law,
said the issue is not the telephone, but the driver. He said the
telephone industry has been running ads and sending mail to remind
people to drive safely while using a cell phone. Some states,
including California, Wisconsin and Utah, have campaigns that do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said there are many things besides a telephone that
could distract a driver, such as ``the kid in the backseat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While driving, with or without a cell phone, you have to
exercise a series of good judgments,'' Wheeler said. ``Should I
turn around now and look at the kids in the back? Is this a good
time to change the radio station? Is it the right time to have an
argument with my spouse?''
</P>
<P>
   He said new technology has often sparked worries about road
safety. Some states once drafted legislation to ban radios from
cars.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``When windshield wipers were first introduced, people
said, `These things are going to be hypnotic _ people won't be able
to drive _ better stay with the goggles.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a terrible hazard, cellular phones, in Wheeler's
view, have made American roads safer.
</P>
<P>
   He said nearly 100,000 calls a day are being made from cars,
just to ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, the ban on driving and talking has prompted mixed
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crazy law,'' said Tony Justice, a 35-year-old foreman
at an electroplating factory, who said he depends on a cell phone
to make arrangements to pick up his daughter after work. ``Some
people can actually talk and drive. And for people who can't
function, well then, just ticket them for bad driving.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of Dan Peters, a 27-year-old tile installer,
jail time would be too easy for some chatty drivers. ``They speed
up, slow down, speed up, hit the breaks,'' said Peters. ``I think
their driving follows the rhythm of their phone conversations. It
drives me crazy. They should pass this law everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has fielded more than a few calls about the town's
policy, most of them positive.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the calls have been dialed from cell phones in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to be such a part of people's lives,'' Coyne said,
``they can't help themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   For passing motorists who might not be familiar with the local
ways of Brooklyn, the mayor said, the police show some
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them, `Look, there's a law in Brooklyn, so please get
off the phone.'''
