   CELLPHONES AND DRIVING: WHERE IT'S AGAINST THE LAW
</P>
<P>
   CITIES
</P>
<P>
   Bans exist in:
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn, Ohio. The first ban in the nation was created a year
ago and since last Sept. 1, nearly 300 citations have been issued.
The law allows drivers to use hands-free speaker phones while
driving or to use their cell phones in the case of emergency. With
a fine of only $3 per violation, the law is intended more ro raise
public awareness of the issue than to punish.
</P>
<P>
   Hilltown Township, Consohocken, and Lebanon, Pa. These three
cities enacted bans on using cell phones while driving bans this
year after a much-publicized accident last fall in which a
2-year-old, Morgan Lee Pena, was killed by a driver talking on a
cell phone. The ban in Hilltown Township is being challenged in
court.
</P>
<P>
   New York City prohibits taxicab drivers from using cell phones
while driving.
</P>
<P>
   STATES
</P>
<P>
   This year, legislatures in 24 states considered bills to ban or
restrict cellphone use while driving. But so far, no state has
passed a law prohibiting cellphone use while driving. Bills in
Georgia, Texas and Ohio failed to proceed beyond consideration in
committee.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, three states have enacted minor measures:
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts requires drivers using cell phones to have one
hand on the wheel at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Florida bans the use of headsets. Drivers talking on cell phones
must have one ear uncovered at all times.
</P>
<P>
   California requires that written safety materials on cell-phone
use be included with all rental cars.
</P>
<P>
   Only two states, Minnesota and Oklahoma, offer law enforcement
officials a check-box on accident reports to indicate that the use
of a cell phone was a contributing factor in a accident.
Pennsylvania will soon start the practice. Other states and local
jurisdictions allow officers to write it in the report at their
discretion.
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN COUNTRIES
</P>
<P>
   As a safety measure, 13 foreign countries have banned or
restricted the use of cell phones by motorists, though many allow
drivers to use hands-free sets.
</P>
<P>
   The countries are Germany, Japan, Australia, Brazil, United
Kingdom, Chile, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the Philippines,
Switzerland and Singapore.
