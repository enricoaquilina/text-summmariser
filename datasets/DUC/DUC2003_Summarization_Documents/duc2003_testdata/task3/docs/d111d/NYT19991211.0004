<P>
   (PHOENIX) - State Sen. Tom Smith wants Arizonans to follow the
suggestion on a popular bumper sticker: ``Hang up and drive.''
</P>
<P>
   The east Phoenix Republican has drafted a bill that would make
it illegal to talk on the telephone or use a computer while driving
a motorized vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has prefiled the measure and expects to be debated when
the Legislature convenes in January. He's the only sponsor, but
says the bill has the backing of a groundswell of constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm surprised at the amount of support I've
received,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona chapter of the Automobile Association of America,
however, remains neutral on the bill. It encourages its members to
use handless communications devices in vehicles and believes more
research is needed on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular phone companies contacted oppose the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Janine Liscic, a spokeswoman for US West Wireless in Denver,
said her firm opposes legislating the way people use telephones. It
advocates education that stresses the safe use of such devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the bill is not necessary,'' said Jim McPhearson, a
spokesman for AT&AMP;T Wireless in Phoenix. ``Drivers' safety is
essential, but restricting the use of this tool goes beyond the
scope of proper public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he drafted the measure in response to repeated
concerns from constituents over the safety issues posed by the
growing use of wireless telephones in vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have told me horror stories about people
talking on cell phones while driving,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give drivers a two-minute grace period to get off
the roadway and park their vehicle after receiving or initiating a
phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers, emergency vehicle drivers and operators of
commercial vehicles that use electronic devices in the scope of
their work would be exempt. Also exempt would be drivers who used
their phones to report reckless drivers or a dangerous situation.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Arizona Department of Transportation nor the Phoenix
Police Department track the incidence of cell phone-related traffic
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an item on the accident reports we use,'' said Lt.
Geary Brasi in the Phoenix Police Department's Traffic Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Brasi doesn't believe cell phones are a significant cause of
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking on a cell phone would fall under `inattention,' which
is a relatively insignificant cause of accidents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speeding and red-light running remain the most frequent culprits
in accidents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it's reasonable for lawmakers to say no one
can talk on the phone and drive,'' Brasi said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brasi noted that lawmakers have banned video screens from
the front seats of moving vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of vehicular phone use is part of a dramatic increase
in wireless phones in general. The Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association in Washington, D.C., says that from 1994 to
1999, U.S. wireless customers have increased from 19 million to 80
million.
</P>
<P>
   That increased usage has led to a spate of proposed bills to
prohibit talking and driving.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Lisa Ihde, a cell phone trade group
spokeswoman, the only area in the United States that has banned the
practice for the general public is the Cleveland suburb of
Brooklyn, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In September, it began to ticket those who chat and drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming a popular thing for legislators to propose,''
Ihde said.
</P>
<P>
   Many other cities around the country, including Chicago, are
considering similar bans. New York City already prohibits
cabdrivers from phoning while driving.
</P>
<P>
   Several foreign countries have banned or limited cell phone use
while driving.
</P>
<P>
   In England, Singapore and Brazil, drivers must use hands-free
attachments on their phones. Israel, Spain, Germany, Switzerland,
Japan Italy, Portugal and Chile and parts of Australia have imposed
cell phone bans or restrictions on all drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Some states have attempted to address the issue. California
requires rental cars with phones to have safety instructions on
operating the device.
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone trade group has launched a vigorous campaign
aimed at educating drivers how to safely use their car phones.
</P>
<P>
   The association encourages the use of handless devices, such as
earpieces, head phones or car kits that act like speaker phones.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips include keeping the phone within reach; not looking
up numbers while driving; and not using a car phone for stressful
or angry conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The association stresses that wireless phones are important
safety devices. Ihde said wireless phones are used to make almost
100,000 calls to 911 each day, most of them from vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Last session, Smith sponsored a bill that the Legislature passed
into law that gave consumers more powers against annoying and
fraudulent telemarketers. &QL;
