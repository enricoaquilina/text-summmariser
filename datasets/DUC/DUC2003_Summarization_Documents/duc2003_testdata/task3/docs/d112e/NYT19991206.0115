   WASHINGTON _ Adrift above the Earth, the eye to the universe is
closed. But if all goes according to plan, the Hubble Space
Telescope, a window through which humans have viewed the edges of
space for almost a decade, will soon be reawakened by the nudging,
gloved hands of astronauts replacing and repairing the failed inner
works that forced it into hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, as NASA still struggles to understand the silence
from Mars where the Mars Polar Lander was scheduled to touch down
on Friday, the space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to blast off on
a mission to restore the observatory.
</P>
<P>
   The telescope has been shut down since Nov. 13, when its
precision pointing system failed and the observatory went dormant.
</P>
<P>
   During the mission, scheduled to last almost 10 days, Discovery
is to dock with Hubble 300 miles above Earth. Astronauts then
expect to move the telescope into the cargo bay where repairs are
to be made during four six-and-a-half-hour spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   The objective is to replace all six gyroscopes, rapidly spinning
devices that use their momentum to stabilize the spacecraft and
help it aim at distant targets. Since February, Hubble had been
getting by on just three gyroscopes, which is the minimum, until
this month, when another failed.
</P>
<P>
   With only two working gyroscopes, the telescope went into a
``safe mode'' to await repairs. It closed its aperture door to
protect its optics and instruments and aligned its solar panels to
the Sun to assure adequate power.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble, which cost $2 billion, was launched in 1990 and,
despite problems with a defective main mirror, has become one of
the most important telescopes in history.
</P>
<P>
   Looking into space from above the obscuring effects of the
Earth's atmosphere, the 12.5-ton observatory has given astronomers
an unprecedented look at colliding galaxies, star formation and the
remnants of events that occurred early in the history of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has spent $1 billion maintaining and operating Hubble since
it was launched, including developing corrective optics for its
flawed mirror, making second-generation instruments to replace
older ones and sending space shuttles to maintain and repair the
observatory in 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A third service mission had been scheduled for June 2000, but
NASA decided in March that it would move up some of the maintenance
because of the deteriorating gyroscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Weiler, associate administrator for space science at
NASA, said the agency decided to schedule an earlier mission to
minimize the loss of observation time with Hubble, which has a
backlog of assignments.
</P>
<P>
   If repairs by the Discovery crew succeed, officials said, Hubble
will lose about a month of observation time compared with at least
seven months if the agency had stayed with the original schedule.
</P>
<P>
   To complete all of the maintenance that had been planned for the
flight in June, NASA has scheduled a mission for May 2001, which
will include major upgrades of Hubble's instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's flight was originally scheduled for mid-October, but
the mission had been delayed because of assorted problems. A series
of electrical wiring problems required extensive inspection and
repairs, and shuttle managers decided to replace one of Discovery's
three main engines because of an accident while the craft ws being
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dittemore, NASA's shuttle program director, said the agency
has set Dec. 14 as the last date to launch the mission this year.
NASA does not want to be flying on New Year's Day because of the
threat of any possible computer problems caused by the Year 2000
date change. While the agency has tested its computers and
software, Dittemore said, ``It is prudent not to fly if we don't
have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew members said delays in the launching have provided
additional time to train. Keith Johnson, who is in charge of
spacewalk training at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said the
astronauts were able to complete 10 hours of training in an
underwater tank for each hour the job takes in space.
</P>
<P>
   The mission commander, Lt. Col. Curtis Brown, a veteran of five
shuttle flights, said approaching and grabbing Hubble might be more
difficult now that it has been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after launching, Brown and Lt. Cmdr. Scott Kelly, the
mission pilot making his first shuttle flight, will guide Discovery
up to Hubble from below.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the astronauts would not know how the observatory was
positioned until they saw it. If Hubble is drifting, he said,
Discovery may approach the observatory from the wrong end or from
the side, requiring the pilots to maneuver more than planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes Scott's and my job a little more interesting because
we get to do some more flying around,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Once Discovery is in position, Jean-Francois Clervoy of France,
a veteran of two previous flights, would use a 50-foot robotic arm
to grab the observatory and lower it into a docking module in
Discovery's cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   Clervoy, who is the chief robot arm operator, would then assist
repair teams from inside the shuttle as well as control the release
of Hubble when the mission was completed.
</P>
<P>
   If Discovery takes off as planned on Saturday at 12:13 a.m. ET,
the shuttle should grab Hubble early Monday and lock it in the
cargo bay. The spacewalks are scheduled to begin at about 7 p.m. on
four successive days, beginning that Monday evening.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first spacewalk is to be done by Steven Smith, a veteran of
two previous flights, including the 1997 mission to work on Hubble,
and John Grunsfeld, also a veteran of two missions. The team plans
to replace three Rate Sensor Units, each of which contains two of
the crucial gyroscopes. It also plans to install
voltage/temperature improvement kits to protect Hubble's six
batteries from overcharging and overheating when the observatory is
in safe mode and not using much power.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Foale, a veteran of five shuttle flights and of a
four-month stay on the Russian space station, Mir, in 1997, and
Claude Nicollier, a European Space Agency astronaut who flew on the
first Hubble service mission in 1993 and on two other shuttle
flights, expect to conduct the second walk. This team plans to
replace the telescope's central computer with one that is 20 times
as fast and has six times as much memory. The astronauts also
expect to swap one of Hubble's three Fine Guidance Sensors for an
improved version that should enhance the observatory's pointing and
measurement capability.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Grunsfeld are scheduled for the third walk during
which they are to replace a radio transmitter and swap a tape
recorder that stores data on reels for a faster, solid-state model
that stores information on computer chips. The astronauts also are
to upgrade other electronics and begin reinforcing the telescope's
thermal covering.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth spacewalk, Foale and Nicollier plan to do more
work on Hubble's outer insulation and coverings, found during the
1997 mission to be damaged and deteriorating because of exposure to
sunlight and to small amounts of atomic oxygen. The astronauts are
to attach stainless steel sheets covered with a thermal coating
over existing insulation on Hubble's exterior surface.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ham, the flight director for the mission at the Johnson
Space Center, said the effort would be considered a success if the
crew completed all the tasks of the first two spacewalks, including
leaving a complete set of working gyroscopes. The work of the last
two spacewalks would be a bonus, Ms. Ham said, and would relieve
the workload on the next service flight.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said the mission would cost about $205 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Leckrone, senior project scientist for Hubble, said
the telescope should be back in action within three weeks to a
month after the mission. ``We can't wait to get it back online,''
he said.
