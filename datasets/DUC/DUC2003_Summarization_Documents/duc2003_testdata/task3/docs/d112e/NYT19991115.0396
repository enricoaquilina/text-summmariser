HUBBLE TELESCOPE TEMPORARILY SHUT DOWN 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ The Hubble Space Telescope has temporarily ceased
scientific operations because of the failure of its precision
pointing system, a development that will leave the valuable
observatory dormant until a space-shuttle repair mission scheduled
to arrive next month, NASA officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The orbiting telescope shut itself down on Saturday when one of
the three remaining gyroscopes used to stabilize and point the
observatory failed after 12 hours of erratic behavior. The
telescope needs a minimum of three of its six gyroscopes operating
to make astronomical observations, and had been limping along on
three of the devices since February.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by the threat of losing valuable observations from one
of the world's premier optical telescopes, National Aeronautics and
Space Administration officials decided last March to divide a
Hubble service mission planned for June 2000 and send up a
space-shuttle crew early to install new gyroscopes and do some
other work.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-day service flight, originally scheduled for mid-October
but delayed because of space-shuttle problems, is tentatively set
for launching on Dec. 6. A second mission, to complete Hubble
modifications planned for the original service and repair flight,
is scheduled for May 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Leckrone of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md., the senior project scientist for Hubble, said
Monday that the observatory's shutdown shows the wisdom of last
spring's decision to fly a service mission early. If the shuttle
mission gets off on time and is successful, he said, the loss of
Hubble data will be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling very lucky today,'' Leckrone said in an interview.
``It could have been much worse, and it's gratifying to know that
we made the right call.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the early mission, Dr. Edward Weiler, NASA's chief
scientist, said the agency wanted to avoid a ``science emergency''
in which researchers would lose the service of one of astronomy's
crown jewels. About $20 million a month is budgeted for Hubble
observations, he said, and the $75 million cost of the extra
shuttle service mission was worth the expense to protect this
research investment.
</P>
<P>
   With only two working gyroscopes, the Hubble automatically went
into ``safe mode,'' a dormant condition in which the telescope
closed its aperture door to protect its optics and aligned itself
to the sun to ensure that its solar panels could draw adequate
power. Ground crews continue to control and monitor the craft when
it is in the safe state, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said Hubble's shutdown should result in only
three weeks of lost data. Leckrone said about 100 observations had
been scheduled between last weekend and the beginning of the
service mission, at which time the telescope was to have stopped
doing studies for three weeks to a month anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It should be possible to reschedule most of the lost
observations within the next year, Leckrone said.

<P>
   The shuttle Discovery was moved to its launching pad over the
weekend and its seven-member crew is at the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida to rehearse the countdown and launching. Discovery's flight
was delayed because testing and modifications to all electrical
wiring in all four shuttles took longer than expected, and one of
Discovery's three main engines had to be changed after a servicing
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The primary task of the mission is to replace all six of
Hubble's gyroscopes, which are packaged in pairs. Four new
gyroscopes were installed during the first Hubble servicing
mission, in 1993, and all six of the instruments were working
during the second service mission, in 1997. One failed later in
1997, a second stopped working in 1998 and a third was lost last
February.
</P>
<P>
   The gyroscope problems appear to be caused by corrosion in
silver-copper wires the size of a human hair that carry electricity
to the high-speed motors that turn the gyroscopes' stabilizing
wheels. The wires are immersed in thick fluid in the sealed
chambers containing the wheels.
</P>
<P>
   NASA scientists believe that compressed air used to push the
viscous fluid into the chambers forced oxygen into the mixture,
which led to the formation of a corrosive substance that eroded the
wires.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of eliminating the problem, engineers used inert
nitrogen gas instead of compressed air to move the fluid when
making new gyroscopes to be installed on Hubble.
