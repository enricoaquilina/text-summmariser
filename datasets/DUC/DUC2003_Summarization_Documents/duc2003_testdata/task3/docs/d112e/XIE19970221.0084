<HEADLINE> Discovery Returns from Successful Hubble Service </HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. space shuttle
Discovery returned home early this morning after astronauts
successfully ended their 10-day Hubble Space telescope service
mission.
</P>
<P>
Discovery touched down on the runway of Kennedy Space Center,
Florida, at 3:32 a.m. EST under an almost full moon after passing
the first landing chance one and a half hours earlier because of
scattered clouds. The landing before dawn this morning is only the
ninth in darkness in total 82 space shuttle flights.
</P>
<P>
During their 10-day space voyage, the astronauts equipped the
Hubble telescope through four spacewalks with a new powerful
infrared camera and an advanced spectrograph as well as new
electronics, data recorders and some mechanical components. They
also repaired peeling thermal insulation on the telescope in the
unplanned fifth spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
The $795 million mission was the second of at least four service
calls planned for Hubble, which is near halfway through its 15-year
voyage. Hubble will be equipped with a more advanced camera during
astronauts' next visit in late 1999.
