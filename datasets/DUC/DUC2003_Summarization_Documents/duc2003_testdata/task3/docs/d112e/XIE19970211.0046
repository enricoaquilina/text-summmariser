<HEADLINE> Upgraded Hubble to Probe Deeper Into Universe </HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hubble Space Telescope,
one of the finest tools of Big Science, awaits a servicing call
this week for the installation of advanced instruments which will
open a new window on the universe.
</P>
<P>
Aboard shuttle Discovery, which blasted off early this morning
with seven crew members, there are two instruments. One is the
100-million-dollar Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object
Spectrometer (NICMOS), and the other, a 120-million-dollar Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS).
</P>
<P>
After replacing older science instruments with the above two,
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) expected
to look farther back in space and time with the Hubble than ever
before, and have a more powerful tool in the search for black
holes, planets and details of galaxies and stars.
</P>
<P>
Experts said it was possible to look back to the epoch of
galaxy formation, less than one billion years after the Big Bang,
with the new instruments.
</P>
<P>
According to NASA's schedule, following a two-day orbital
chase, Discovery will approach the telescope from directly below,
using a rendezvous procedure developed for docking with the
Russian Mir Space Station.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes well, the astronauts will use a robot arm to
pluck the Hubble at 2:52 a.m. Thursday, and mount it vertically on
a service platform in Discovery's cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
In four space-walks, the astronauts will install the 765-pound
NICMOS and the 700-pound STIS in place of old hardware, and then
replace computer equipment, data recorders and other ageing
electrical and mechanical components of the telescope.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to release the upgraded Hubble back into open
space at 12:42 a.m. on February 18. Then engineers on the ground
will begin to check out and calibrate the new instruments.
