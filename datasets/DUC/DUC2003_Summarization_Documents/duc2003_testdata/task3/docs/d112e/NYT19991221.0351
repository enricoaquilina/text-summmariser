   HOUSTON _ After a spirited chase across the sky, the space
shuttle Discovery grabbed the Hubble Space Telescope with its robot
arm Tuesday, retrieving the observatory to begin a critical repair
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle, which had been chasing Hubble since being
launched on Sunday, spent the day closing in on the observatory
from below through a series of rocket firings.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Curtis L. Brown of the Air Force, the mission
commander, and Lt. Cmdr. Scott J. Kelley of the Navy, the pilot,
maneuvered the two spacecraft together until they linked up 369
miles above the Gulf of Mexico. At 7:34 p.m. Eastern time,
Jean-Francois Clervoy, the French astronaut operating the shuttle's
50-foot robot arm, snared Hubble as the craft flew in formation at
17,000 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good capture,'' Clervoy said with enthusiasm, ``We
have Hubble grappled.''
</P>
<P>
   Clervoy slowly lowered the 25,000-pound, 43-foot-long
observatory to a rotating cradle in the Discovery's cargo bay,
where it was latched in place by three clamps for a critical period
of inspection and repair. Hubble has been out of operation for more
than six weeks, since four of six stabilizing gyroscopes failed,
making it impossible for the telescope to lock onto celestial
targets for scientific studies.
</P>
<P>
   If the much-delayed repair mission, originally scheduled for
October, is successful, scientists hope to have Hubble back in
operation sometime next month.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing the telescope begins an intensive three days of work
for the seven-man shuttle crew, focusing on three work-packed
spacewalks. The shuttle's weather-delayed launching forced the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration to drop plans for a
fourth spacewalk and compress the original 10-day mission into
eight. NASA wants the shuttle on the ground and all mission
equipment powered down by the end of the year to avoid any computer
problems associated with the year 2000 date change.
</P>
<P>
   During the first spacewalk, scheduled to begin on Wednesday
afternoon and last six and a half hours, the astronauts Steven L.
Smith and John M. Grunsfeld are to perform the primary repairs of
the mission. The astronauts, one perched at the end of the
shuttle's robot arm, will open the telescope and replace three Rate
Sensor Units, enclosures that each contain two of the critical
gyroscopes needed to point and steady the telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Working within the close quarters of the telescope, the
astronauts must be careful not to bump or jostle Hubble's delicate
optics and other instruments while making the equipment switches.
</P>
<P>
   Also, insulating material inside and outside the telescope is
aging and becoming brittle, posing the risk of debris that could
get into the observatory and damage instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't want to rub up against it because it would
create little particles,'' Smith said before the flight.
</P>
<P>
   After replacing the six gyroscopes, the astronauts are to
install voltage regulator kits on Hubble's six aging batteries to
keep them from overcharging and overheating in periods of low power
use. They will also service a valve on an instrument cooling
system.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, C. Michael Foale, a NASA astronaut, and Claude
Nicollier, a European Space Agency astronaut, are to take more than
six hours for several tasks, including the replacement of Hubble's
central computer with a new model, which is more than 20 times
faster and has six times the memory of the current one. The
spacewalkers then will swap one of the telescope's three Fine
Guidance Sensors with a refurbished unit. These devices allow the
telescope to remain locked on a target for hours or days at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ham, the lead flight director for the mission, said NASA
could call the mission completely successful if the astronauts
completed the tasks planned for the first two spacewalks.
``Anything after that is added value,'' Ms. Ham said.
</P>
<P>
   On the third spacewalk, set for Friday, Smith and Grunsfeld are
to replace a failed radio transmitter and install a new data
recorder, which stores information on computer chips instead of the
tape reels of the unit it replaces. Unlike other Hubble parts, the
transmitter was not designed to be replaced by astronauts, and the
spacewalkers will have to use small bolts and cables that could be
difficult for their stiff, gloved hands to work with.
</P>
<P>
   The last planned task of the third spacewalk involves putting
new metallic covers over some of the worn, torn insulation covering
the observatory. A decade in space, during which Hubble was exposed
to sunlight and other harsh elements, has weathered the exterior of
the observatory, designed to operate in space for 20 years with
periodic upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   The canceled fourth spacewalk was to involve more work on the
exterior insulation and numerous smaller jobs. In an interview from
space on Monday, the astronauts said it might be possible to do a
few of the minor jobs planned for the fourth walk on earlier
excursions if they finished more important work ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery is due to release Hubble back into space on
Christmas, and to land back at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida
on Monday.
