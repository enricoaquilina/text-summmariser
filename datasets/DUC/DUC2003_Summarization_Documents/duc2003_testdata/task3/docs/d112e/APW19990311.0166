<HEADLINE> NASA To Fix Hubble Telescope </HEADLINE>

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Astronauts will rush to the Hubble  
Space Telescope this fall -- eight months early -- to fix its 
deteriorating pointing system. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA approved the emergency repair mission on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are one failure away from losing all science on the Hubble  
Space Telescope,'' said Ed Weiler, head of NASA's space science 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	By splitting the originally planned June 2000 mission into two  
parts -- one in October and the other in late 2000 or early 2001 -- 
Hubble's science program hopefully will be preserved and the 
astronauts' chores will be more manageable, Weiler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had waited until June 2000, there is a very reasonable  
chance that we could lose three, four or even more months of 
science,'' Weiler said. ``This is a rather good insurance policy 
we're buying here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The extra mission will cost NASA $75 million more than what's  
already been budgeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Hubble's six gyroscopes, needed for pointing and  
stability, have failed since astronauts' last service call, in 
1997. And a third gyroscope suffered a partial breakdown a month or 
two ago and is considered unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomers need at least three perfect gyroscopes to conduct  
observations throughout the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the $2 billion telescope would be safe in orbit without  
any working gyroscopes, NASA does not want to risk losing any 
valuable science time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a so-called spacecraft emergency where we're in  
danger of losing the entire mission or the entire spacecraft,'' 
Weiler said. ``You can think of it more as a science emergency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubble -- NASA's so-called crown jewel of observatories -- was  
launched in 1990 with a misshapen mirror. Spacewalking astronauts 
corrected the telescope's vision in 1993, restoring Hubble to a 
world-class instrument able to see to the fringes of the universe, 
and returned in 1997 to add or replace 11 major parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides replacing all six gyroscopes in October, spacewalking  
astronauts will install a new computer, radio transmitter, guidance 
sensor and data recorder, and fix peeling insulation. 
</P>
<P>
	During their second visit, the same astronauts will equip Hubble  
with new solar panels, an advanced camera and a newfangled cooling 
unit for an infrared camera that has run out of the frozen nitrogen 
needed for observations. 
</P>
<P>
	The four astronauts who will do the repairs have been training  
since last summer and can easily accommodate the early flight, 
officials said. One of the four worked on Hubble in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA will have to rearrange the shuttle flight schedule to  
squeeze in the Hubble mission. Those details have yet to be worked 
out.
