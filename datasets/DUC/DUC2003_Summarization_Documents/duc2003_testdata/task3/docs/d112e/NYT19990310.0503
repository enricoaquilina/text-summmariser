NASA SHUTTLE MISSION IS MOVED UP TO REPAIR HUBBLE TELESCOPE

   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to avoid a ``science emergency'' with the
Hubble Space Telescope, NASA officials announced Wednesday that
they would launch a space shuttle to repair failing parts on the
orbiting observatory in mid-October, eight months ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said the
shuttle Discovery and a team of spacewalking astronauts would be
dispatched to replace malfunctioning gyroscopes that stabilize
Hubble and allow the 12.5-ton telescope to point accurately at
targets across the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Edward J. Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for science,
said at a news conference that the $2 billion telescope itself was
not in danger, but its scientific mission was threatened by the
malfunctioning pointing devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a spacecraft emergency,'' Weiler said, ``it's more
of a science emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubble, which has regularly uncovered the mysteries of the
cosmos since its launching in 1990, ``is the crown jewel of NASA's
space observatories,'' said Weiler, and every reasonable effort
must be made to keep it functioning. While the telescope is now
operating normally, he said, only three of its six gyroscopes are
working properly, the minimum needed for it to perform its
observations.
</P>
<P>
   Two gyroscopes have failed and a third is acting so abnormally
that it cannot be relied upon as a backup. If one of the three
functioning gyroscopes fails in coming months, Weiler said, Hubble
will have to cease its science mission and go into a protective
``safe mode'' until replacement parts are installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are one failure away from losing all science from the
Hubble Space Telescope,'' Weiler said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the risk of losing months of invaluable Hubble
data, wasting about $20 million per month budgeted for these
observations, made it worth spending extra money for an early
service mission. The October shuttle mission will add an extra $25
million to Hubble program costs over two years and $50 million to
shuttle program costs over the same period, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, the Hubble service mission scheduled for
June 2000 will be split into two parts, with about half of the
planned modifications and equipment changes being carried out in
October during a nine-day flight. In addition to replacing all six
of Hubble's gyroscopes, astronauts are to exchange the
observatory's central computer with a faster, new model; add a new
fine-guidance sensor; replace an old-style data tape recorder with
a digital model, and change a backup radio transmitter.
</P>
<P>
   A second mission to upgrade Hubble's scientific equipment,
during which a powerful new camera will be added to look at small
objects and the solar power arrays will be replaced, will be flown
between December 2000, and March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   William Readdy, an astronaut who is the shuttle program
director, said the same four astronauts who were training to do
spacewalks for the original service assignment would fly on both
segments of the divided mission. They are Steven L. Smith, C.
Michael Foale, John M. Grunsfeld and Claude Nicollier. The
remaining crew members, a commander, a pilot and a flight engineer,
will be announced by the end of the week, Readdy said.
</P>
<P>
   It normally takes more than a year to plan a shuttle mission,
Readdy said, but the flight to Hubble can be put together quickly
because most of the crew is far along in training for it.
