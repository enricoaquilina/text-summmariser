YICHANG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The Dalaoling State Forest Park in
central China's Yichang, the city nearest to the Three Gorges
Project, is now completed after two years of development, and has
won the approval of expert appraisers.
</P>
<P>
The park, 45 km from the dam site, has an area of 1,967
hectares covered with about one thousand plant varieties,
including 52 listed by the state as precious and rare. Sixteen of
these rare plants were transplanted from the Three Gorges
Reservoir Area and nearby areas at a high elevation.
</P>
<P>
China has been constructing a giant dam near the Three Gorges
at the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the country's longest,
and the project is expected to be completed by 2009.
</P>
<P>
According to several surveys, the Three Gorges Reservoir Area
is home to 3,014 types of plants, 1,630 of which are found only in
China. The area is also home to 5,000 large and very old trees.
</P>
<P>
However, the areas where many of the plants are concentrated
will be inundated, and could possibly be lost for forever upon
completion of the Three Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
While organizing activities to protect this plant diversity,
the office of the Three Gorges Project Construction Committee of
the State Council was lavish with funds for the creation of the
park to reduce as much as possible the negative impact on plants
in the dam area.
