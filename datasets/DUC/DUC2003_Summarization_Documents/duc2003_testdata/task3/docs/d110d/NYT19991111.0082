 WELLS FARGO, BOFA LIMIT USE OF ATMS  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a pointed warning to San Francisco about ATM surcharges,
California's two biggest banks announced that they will stop
letting noncustomers use their cash machines in Santa Monica when a
law barring the fees takes effect there Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America said it will take similar action in San
Francisco next month, when the city's voter-approved surcharge ban
is set to begin, unless the law is blocked in court. Wells Fargo
said it hasn't yet decided what it will do if the San Francisco ban
takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   The moves represent an escalation in the increasingly bitter
dispute between consumer groups and city officials on one side and
banks on the other side  &LR; over the practice of charging a fee for
ATM cash withdrawals to people who keep their accounts at other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No business should be expected to provide free service to
noncustomers,'' said Gene Taylor, the top retail banking official
in the West for North Carolina's Bank of America, in a statement
announcing the bank's decision to cut ATM access to noncustomers
unless it can collect a surcharge.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, San Francisco and Santa Monica officials
described the banks as sore losers unwilling to accept the will of
voters or their elected representatives. ``Here are these enormous
institutions behaving like an 8-year-old boy who says, `If I can't
win, I'll take my marbles and go home,' '' said San Francisco City
Attorney Louise Renne.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Golinger, consumer program director of California Public
Interest Research Group, co-sponsor of San Francisco's ballot
measure banning ATM surcharges, called the cutoff ``a desperate act
by fee-addicted bankers attempting to scare off ATM laws in other
cities.``
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Second Fee at Issue
</P>
<P>
   At issue is one of two fees that consumers usually pay when they
use a cash machine not belonging to the bank, thrift or credit
union where they keep their money.
</P>
<P>
   The first fee is what financial institutions charge their own
customers for using an outside ATM, typically $2 in California. The
second fee is the ATM surcharge, the fee the outside ATM owner
charges noncustomers who use their machines, typically $1.50 in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Only that second fee, the ATM surcharge, is banned under the San
Francisco and Santa Monica laws.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco voters approved Proposition F banning ATM
surcharges by a 2-to-1 ratio November 2. Santa Monica's City
Council enacted a similar measure October 12.
</P>
<P>
   The two cities are the first in the country to ban ATM
surcharges by referendum or legislation. State officials in Iowa
and Connecticut have barred the fees through administrative action,
and the Pentagon has proposed banning surcharges in installations
under its jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   BofA, Wells Fargo and the California Bankers Association filed
suit to overturn the two laws in a San Francisco federal court last
week, the day after the election. District Judge Vaughn Walker has
scheduled a hearing for Monday on the bank's request for an order
halting the surcharge bans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the San Francisco and Santa Monica bans have prompted
officials in cities from New York to San Diego to consider similar
prohibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Moves by banks to prevent noncustomers from using their cash
machines could run afoul of rules set by the big ATM switching
networks _ such as the Star System and Visa's Plus and MasterCard's
Cirrus networks _ which connect machines owned by different
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Star System rules let banks remove a small fraction of their
ATMs from the network, a Star spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The small number of cash machines in Santa Monica are presumably
well within that limit. But any widespread moves by BofA and Wells
Fargo to deny noncustomers access to ATMs would violate network
rules, industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some serious implications,'' said Jeffrey Cheung,
executive vice president of California Bank &AMP; Trust, a unit of
Utah's Zions Bancorporation.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo consulted with network officials before cutting
noncustomers off in Santa Monica, spokesman Lance Berg said. ``This
decision does not violate the network rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of their statewide networks of thousands of cash machines, only
the 21 BofA ATMs and 12 Wells Fargo ATMs in Santa Monica are
cutting off access to noncustomers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ATM surcharges are big income producers for the two banks. The
188 BofA ATMs and 174 Wells Fargo machines in San Francisco
generate about $5.5 million in yearly revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, Wells Fargo has said it takes in about $50 million
annually in surcharges. BofA won't say what it makes from ATM
surcharges, but if the bank's usage rates are comparable to Wells
Fargo's, the figure is probably between $125 million and $150
million.
</P>
<P>
   At a San Francisco news conference Wednesday, BofA officials
played down the revenue issue and stressed the principles of the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly about this issue,'' said former
California Treasurer Kathleen Brown, now an executive in BofA's
private bank, which provides banking services to the wealthy. ``Is
it fair for consumers to demand products and services for free?''
she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups accuse banks of double-charging noncustomers,
since they already get a portion of the fee consumers pay their own
financial institutions for using an outside ATM. These so-called
interchange fees charged by the ATM owner to the customer's bank
are typically 50 cents for each withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   BofA officials declined to answer questions about other income
in addition to surcharges the bank gets when noncustomers use its
ATMs, such as interchange fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The claim that ATM service is being given away for free is
nonsense,'' said Santa Monica Deputy City Attorney Adam Radinsky.
``The banks are already well compensated for every ATM
transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kathleen Shilkret said the surcharge
bans are unfair because machines not owned by financial
institutions _ including many of those installed in supermarkets,
convenience stores, gas stations and casinos _ will still be
allowed to levy surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns against ATM surcharges ``are deliberate moves by
consumer groups to upset people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of small and midsize banks were torn by the BofA and
Wells Fargo moves.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, many small banks also levy ATM surcharges, and
officials support the right of the big banks to impose fees. At the
same time, they fear that customers will move to the big banks if
they can no longer use their ATM cards widely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a positive for our customers,'' said Steven
Barlow, executive vice president of Mechanics Bank in Richmond.
``It means fewer machines and less convenience for them.''
