 ATM Fees Cash Cows for Wells, BofA  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
ATMs don't just provide money to customers. They're cash machines
for the banks as well.
<P>
   For the first time, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, San
Francisco's largest banks, have spelled out exactly what they take
in locally from fees levied on noncustomers who use their ATMs.
It's not chump change.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents connected with their lawsuit filed Wednesday
to overturn the city's just-approved ballot measure banning ATM
surcharges, BofA said its 188 San Francisco ATMs collect about
$245,000 per month from the surcharges. Wells Fargo said its 174
ATMs in the city take in $210,000 monthly.
</P>
<P>
   That's annual revenue for the two banks of about $5.5 million a
year from ATM surcharges in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   BofA and Wells charge noncustomers $1.50 for using their ATMs.
In most cases, consumers also have to pay a separate fee to their
own bank for using an outside ATM. It's the first fee, the
surcharge levied by the ATM owner, that is banned under the San
Francisco measure.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a key U.S. bank regulatory agency said it will
support the banks in their federal suit against the San Francisco
ATM ban. The California Bankers Association is also a plaintiff in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Garsson, a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, said the agency will file a friend-of-the-court brief
backing the bank's argument that local governments don't have
jurisdiction over nationally-chartered banks.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will argue that its authority pre-empts San
Francisco's in the case of banks that operate under U.S. charters,
including BofA and Wells Fargo, Garsson said. The figures disclosed
in the banks' suit show why they are fighting so hard to block fee
bans in court. BofA and Wells Fargo ``derive significant revenues
from their ATM non-account holder usage charges,'' the banks said
in a court document. ``These charges could never be recouped'' if
San Francisco's ATM surcharge ban and a similar law recently
enacted in Santa Monica are allowed to stand, the banks noted.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, BofA and Wells Fargo have about 14,000 and 6,500
ATMs, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer Richard Kovacevich, speaking
yesterday at a Boston conference of Wall Street analysts, said the
bank collects about $50 million annually from ATM surcharges.
That's less than 1 percent of its $15.4 billion in total revenue
last year.
</P>
<P>
   A BofA spokesman declined to say how much it collects in ATM
surcharges. But if each of BofA's cash machines generated surcharge
revenue at the rate of their San Francisco ATMs, the bank would
collect more than $200 million nationwide. BofA may actually  &LR; take
in less because ATM usage levels may be lower in other places than
they are in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, banks have been striving to boost their income
from fees to compensate for the slow growth of their basic business
_ taking deposits and lending money.
</P>
<P>
   BofA and Wells officials said their ATM networks are expensive
to maintain. Without income from surcharges, the banks will have to
retool their ATM strategies, they said.
</P>
<P>
   That might mean boosting the ATM fees charged to the banks at
which noncustomers keep their money, which could prompt the
customer's own bank to pass along the increase by raising the fees
it charges for using an outside bank's cash machine.
</P>
<P>
   BofA and Wells Fargo are also threatening to cut off ATM access
for noncustomers. BofA ``has determined that it may become
infeasible to serve non-account-holder customers in San Francisco
and Santa Monica without being able to assess a convenience fee. If
so, it will discontinue access to non-account-holder customers,''
the bank noted in a court filing.
