<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court on Monday struck
down President Clinton's controversial proposal to use a
statistical formula to complement the traditional head count of the
U.S. population in the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, stung by the decision, might try to
conduct two counts of the U.S. population next year to ensure a
true result, Commerce Secretary William Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   That would depend on whether the Republican-led Congress, which
opposes statistical sampling, provides enough money for the Census
Bureau to conduct two counts.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, whose department conducts the census, said he was
``obviously disappointed'' with the court's decision. He said that
enhancing the head count with a statistical sampling is the best
way to prevent a repeat of the 1990 census, when 8 million people
were not counted.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said an additional survey, independent of the
constitutionally required Census, would be more accurate and ensure
that federal aid to the poor will be spent in the most needy areas.
</P>
<P>
   In its 5-4 decision, the high court ruled that Clinton's effort
to achieve a truer count through statistics runs afoul of the
federal Census Act, which the court said prohibits the federal
government from using statistics in addition to the standard
head-count census of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Census is conducted every 10 years to determine how the 435
seats in the House of Representatives will be apportioned among the
50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, seizing on the court's finding that statistics may not be
used for apportionment, said the justices held open the legality of
using mathematical formulas for other purposes, such as finding
poor people who qualify for federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``A census based upon the old method will produce tremendous
undercounts,'' Daley said. ``We (at the Census Bureau) are
committed to having the most accurate census.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, assailed the high court's ruling,
saying statistics are the most effective way to prevent a repeat of
the undercount of Houston's population in 1990. That undercount, he
added, cost the city much needed federal assistance for social
programs.
</P>
<P>
   More than 66,000 people in Houston were not counted in the 1990
census.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to redouble our efforts to count everyone
in Houston,'' Green said. ``We pay the tax dollars, and we should
receive the benefits from them. If we're undercounted, those tax
dollars will go someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision marked a victory for the House and
16 people who sued the Clinton administration. The private citizens
wanted to force the president to abandon his proposal to use
statistics in addition to the traditional head count of the U.S.
population.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., hailed the court's
decision as an affirmation of the constitutional principle that
people should be counted, not scientifically polled. ``The
administration should abandon its illegal and risky polling scheme
and start preparing for a true head count,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Government Reform
Subcommittee on the Census, also praised the high court's decision
for ensuring that ``no administration would be permitted to
manipulate the census for its own political gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans have said Clinton wants to curry favor
with minorities and poor people, groups that are historically
undercounted and a traditional Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration expects 67 percent of the U.S.
population to return completed census forms, which will be mailed
nationwide next year. The population would then be divided into
census tracts of about 4,000 people that have ``homogenous
population characteristics, economic status and living
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau agents would then visit a randomly selected sample
of the housing units that did not submit census forms. The sample's
population numbers and characteristics would be added based on the
statistical results.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration argued that a statistical estimate is
needed for an accurate count. But the House Republicans and the
individuals countered that the Census Act and the Constitution
permit only an ``actual enumeration,'' or head count, for the
census.
</P>
<P>
   Federal district courts in Washington and eastern Virginia
agreed that the act prohibits statistical samples. The courts,
having decided the case on statutory grounds, did not reach the
issue of whether the Constitution permits statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, agreed
with the lower courts and said Congress has prohibited the use of
statistics ever since the first census in 1790, when lawmakers
required census takers to swear to make ``a just and perfect
enumeration'' of every person in their districts. While federal law
permits statistics to be used to measure demographic data at other
times, the Census Act expressly prohibits their use for ``purposes
of apportionment'' of House members, O'Connor added.
</P>
<P>
   The high court, like the district courts, did not address the
issue of whether the Constitution bars statistics in calculating
the census, having resolved the legal issue based on the federal
law. Joining O'Connor's opinion were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In a vehement dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said Congress
in 1976 amended the Census Act to permit the type of statistical
sampling the president wants to use next year. Stevens derided as
``an unusual tour de force'' the court's conclusion that the 1976
amendment did not change the federal government's authority with
regard to the census.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the court is correct, prior to 1976 the commerce secretary
could have used sampling for any census-related purpose except
apportionment, and after 1976 he retained precisely the same
authority,'' Stevens wrote. ``Why, one must wonder, did Congress
make this textual change in 1976?''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Stevens were Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and David H. Souter. Breyer also wrote separately to say
the Census Act permits statistics to be used to complement a
traditional head count but not to substitute for one.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, in her majority opinion, alienated Scalia and Thomas
in one part of her decision where she examined the legislative
history of the Census Act. O'Connor, in further explaining why the
Census Act bars statistics, wrote that no member of Congress during
the debate on the 1976 revision to the law ever said the amendment
would allow statistics to be part of the decennial population
survey.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia, an outspoken opponent of the use of legislative history
to determine what Congress intended, said such silence is
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I join the opinion of the court, excluding, of course, its
resort ... to what was said by the individual legislators and
committees of legislators _ or more precisely (and worse yet), what
was not said by individual legislators and committees of
legislators,'' Scalia wrote in comments that Thomas joined.
