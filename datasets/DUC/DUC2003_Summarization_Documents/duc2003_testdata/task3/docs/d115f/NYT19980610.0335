 &HT;    POLITICAL BATTLE OVER CENSUS SAMPLING HAS A DATE IN COURT
 &HT;    Not for Atlanta

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A political dispute masquerading as a legal issue
makes its first appearance in federal court Thursday as Republicans
try to prevent the Clinton administration from using statistical
methods in the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of three federal judges will decide whether the
Constitution requires a head count of every American, or if the
statistical method known as scientific sampling _ favored by the
administration and the National Academy of Sciences _ can be used
to round out the picture of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau wants to use sampling because it does not
believe it can count every American, particularly minorities,
recent immigrants and transient populations. These groups were
prominent in the 8.4 million people the 1990 Census failed to
count, according to the bureau's estimates. In addition, another
4.4 million people were counted twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamental to our democracy is the principle of one person,
one vote, and vital to that is getting the most accurate census
possible,'' said James Hahn, the Los Angeles city attorney. ``And
we know how to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, fear that a
statistically adjusted census would be a boon to Democrats because
it would add predominantly Democratic-voting people to the
population and because they believe the administration will
manipulate the count for partisan advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' said Rep. John Linder, R-Ga. ``We think they'll
cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the census cannot be overstated in political
terms. It is used to apportion the 435 seats in the House of
Representatives among the states and to determine each state's
share of $100 billion a year of federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich favored sampling after the 1990 census, when Georgia
complained that it had been undercounted.
</P>
<P>
   After the judges rule, probably sometime within the next two
months, the Supreme Court will have the final say over sampling, a
method that uses intense surveys of some census tracts to determine
the population of other, similar tracts.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans and the White House agreed last year
to take the matter to the High Court while the Census Bureau
prepares for the 2000 Census on two tracks, one that employs only
the traditional head count and another that includes sampling.
</P>
<P>
   A separate lawsuit, filed by the Atlanta-based Southeastern
Legal Foundation, also is making its way through the federal
courts. In that suit, individuals in counties that expect to be
hurt by sampling as well as the counties themselves are challenging
the constitutionality of sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and a host of other big cities
and urban counties as well as New Mexico have joined the Commerce
Department, which includes the Census Bureau, in defending the
lawsuit filed by the House. Wisconsin, which would have lost a
congressional seat had sampling been used in the 1990 Census, is
siding with the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lesson that Wisconsin learned during the 1990 census was
the tremendous disincentive created by statistical estimation to
voluntary census participation,'' said Wisconsin Attorney General
James E. Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe, a supporter of
sampling, said he believes courts will throw out both lawsuits
because the plaintiffs lack the grounds to bring a challenge before
the census is conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Potemkin Village,'' Tribe said. Until sampling is used
and the government translates census results into congressional
seats and federal funds, House Republicans and the Southeastern
Legal Foundation ``are not in a position to demonstrate that they
are concretely injured,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe said he believes the Supreme Court would apply the same
standard it used in throwing out a constitutional challenge to the
line-item veto on the grounds that, at the time of the challenge,
the members of Congress who sued had not suffered any harm.
</P>
<P>
   Linder, however, said Republicans will not give up their fight
even if the courts rule against them. So long as they control the
House, he said, they will refuse to provide funding for statistical
sampling in the 2000 Census.
