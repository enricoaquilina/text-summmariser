As flood threat recedes, China worries about killer diseases
</HEADLINE>

	   BEIJING (AP) _ With the Yangtze River's latest flood crest
weakening Wednesday, Chinese officials warned that diseases
threatened to spread in crowded refugee camps.
	   Dikes protecting major cities were holding, but the surge this
week from rain-swollen upper Yangtze River tributaries would likely
keep floodwaters high for weeks, state media reported.
	   The heavy flooding in the northeast and in the Yangtze basin
this summer has killed more than 3,000 people nationwide and left
millions homeless, according to government statistics.
	   Along the Yangtze, China's longest river, the floods are the
worst since 1954, when 30,000 people died, about 90 percent of them
from contagious diseases after floodwaters receded.
	   Health officials are closely monitoring diseases and have not
reported any epidemics, the China Daily on Wednesday quoted Wang
Zhao, the Ministry of Health official in charge of disease control,
as saying.
	   Conditions along the Yangtze are ripe for diseases to spread.
The weather is still hot, flood victims and livestock are crowded
together in refugee camps, and drinking water is limited.
	   So far intestinal diseases are spreading in flooded areas along
the Yangtze, and to a lesser extent in the northeast, Wang said.
	   In the far northeast, the biggest worry for the million homeless
flood victims is cold weather. Frosts are expected this month, and
winter brings daily temperatures well below zero.
	   Meanwhile, a group of 80 scientists issued an open letter
calling for protection of wetlands as a means of flood control, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported late Tuesday.
	   The letter called for a halt to exploitation of wetlands along
rivers.
	   Many homes and factories have been built in wetlands along the
Yangtze River that once soaked up floodwaters. The storage capacity
of huge freshwater lakes along the river has dropped by as much as
50 percent because of reclamation and silting caused by erosion,
Xinhua reported.
	   Wetlands also have been destroyed along the Nen and Songhua
rivers in the northeast, where flooding as severe as this summer is
rare, the scientists said.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji, who visited flooded areas in the northeast
on Tuesday, said environmental laws were not being enforced. Like
other officials in recent weeks, Zhu said the floods were due in
part to rampant deforestation and the soil erosion and silting of
riverbeds it brings, state media reported Wednesday.
	   The ruling Communist Party and central government ``attach great
importance to afforestation and conservation of soil and water,''
China Daily quoted Zhu as saying. ``Unfortunately, implementation
of related policies has been far from satisfactory.''
