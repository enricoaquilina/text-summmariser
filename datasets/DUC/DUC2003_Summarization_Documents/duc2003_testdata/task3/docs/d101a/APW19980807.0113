	   BEIJING (AP) _ China was evacuating 330,000 people Friday from
land along the raging Yangtze River that officials were preparing
to sacrifice to flooding to safeguard cities downstream.
	   With the Yangtze at record levels and threatening to rise
further, officials were preparing to divert floodwaters along a
section of the 6,300-kilometer- (3,900-mile-) long river described
as the most dangerous. Under the plan, floodgates on the Yangtze
would be opened to divert water away and, if that failed, a dike
would be blown up, officials said.
	   The decision whether to deliberately flood towns and villages at
the Yangtze's Jingjiang section, in badly flooded central Hubei
province, would require the approval of China's State Council, or
Cabinet.
	   ``The worst moment of the year's flood control efforts is
probably coming,'' the official newspaper China Daily quoted
unidentified Yangtze River officials as saying.
	   The crisis was precipitated by a surge of floodwaters headed
down river Friday that officials feared could cause sodden levees
weakened by weeks of rain and floods to collapse.
	   To reduce pressure on the levees that protect cities and
millions of people downstream, officials have already begun
abandoning smaller dikes and were preparing for the possibility of
deflecting waters into the Jingjiang flood diversion area, where
more than 500,000 people live.
	   The last time the Yangtze was this high was in 1954, during
floods that forced officials to divert water three times. More than
30,000 people died in the flooding that year.
	   So far this year, more than 2,000 people have died in summer
floods that began in June. The death toll continues to rise as
reports are received from flooded areas. The floods have affected
240 million people, a fifth of the population, to varying degrees,
the government says.
	   More than 330,000 people in the Jingjiang flood diversion area
south of Hubei's Shashi city were being moved out, said Chen
Zhichao, director of the Jinjiang Flood Diversion Management
Bureau.
	   Of those, 230,000 had already been moved and another 100,000
should be moved out by Friday evening, officials said. The
remainder of the 520,000 people who reside in the area live on high
or protected ground and are safe, Chen said.
	   He said they were waiting for an order from the State Council
before diverting the river.
	   If the order was given, officials first would raise floodgates
to deflect water from the Yangtze to the diversion area. If that
proved insufficient, a three-kilometer- (1.86 mile- ) long dike
that borders the river would be blown up to let the floodwaters
through, said Chen.
	   One method already being employed to lower the Yangtze was
breaking open or deliberately abandoning smaller, secondary dikes,
flooding farmland and taking pressure off the major embankments
that hem in the river.
	   Hubei, one of worst-hit provinces that declared a state of
emergency Thursday, has already sacrificed at least 104 levees,
forcing 270,000 people to move and inundating swathes of farmland,
the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily said Friday.
	   Among the cities protected by these ``selfless'' acts was Wuhan,
with 7 million people, the newspaper said.
	   Should officials decide to divert the Yangtze at Jingjiang too,
then Gong'an county, south of Shashi, would bear the brunt of the
flooding, the China Daily said.
	   ``The Jingjiang section is facing the worst flood challenge in
its history,'' the newspaper said, quoting Ge Shouxi, a Yangtze
River chief engineer.
	   The Yangtze at Shashi reached a record 44.68 meters (147.4 feet)
Thursday, a centimeter (0.4 inches) higher that in 1954's deadly
floods, the China Daily said. As the fourth flood crest this year
bore down, the river was expected to rise Friday to 44.95 meters
(148.3 feet), the paper said.
	   Officials first disclosed that they were considering diverting
the Yangtze at Jingjiang at a government news conference Thursday.
	   ``The possibility of flood diversion cannot be discounted,''
said Zhao Chunming, a deputy director at the State Flood Control
and Drought Relief Headquarters. ``Preparations have already been
made.''
	   ``We will try our best not to divert water unless it is
absolutely necessary,'' he added.
	   However, other officials at the news conference were more
hopeful.
	   ``According to the situation now, it doesn't look like we need
to divert water,'' said Zhou Wenzhi, a vice minister of water
resources. ``But we have to make these preparations.''
