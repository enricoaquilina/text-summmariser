	   BEIJING (AP) _ Water levels upstream on the Yangtze River rose
Sunday to their highest of the year, threatening more flooding
downstream where soggy dikes have begun to crack.
	   The government, meanwhile, announced a ban on logging in western
Sichuan province along the upper reaches of the river to curb
severe soil erosion.
	   Excessive logging of hillsides is partly to blame for the worst
floods on the Yangtze in 44 years. Heavy rains this summer have
washed off the denuded hills instead of soaking in, causing rivers
to choke up with silt and rise.
	   River levels dropped slowly on the lower and middle reaches of
the Yangtze on Sunday after another crest passed. But another flood
peak was headed downriver toward the flood zones, state radio
reported.
	   It said the Yangtze on Sunday was at its highest level yet
upstream at Chongqing, a main industrial hub in southwestern China.
	   Torrential rains hit the upper reaches of the river last week,
and flooding occurred on five major rivers of the Yangtze River
system in Sichuan province. The five rivers flow into the Yangtze
at Chongqing.
	   Downriver in the city of Jiujiang, in south China's Jiangxi
province, 300,000 soldiers and armed police patched up embankments.
Officials warned dikes protecting Jiujiang and other cities were
softening and cracking after weeks of pressure from high water
levels.
	   The heavily populated Yangtze River basin has been hardest hit
by the summer's floods. At least 2,000 people have died nationwide,
but the toll is expected to rise. Millions have fled their homes.
	   The state-run Xinhua News Agency on Sunday reported
``thousands'' have died in the floods, but gave no updated figure.
The agency reported at least 19 people died and three were missing
in Sichuan in floods started by rainstorms Wednesday through
Friday.
	   The government more than two weeks ago said more than 2,000 had
died nationwide. Since then officials have not disclosed an updated
toll.
	   Flooding along the Yangtze has affected 240 million people,
about one-fifth of China's population, according to government
estimates.
	   In a bid to turn the tide against Yangtze floods in the decades
ahead, the Sichuan provincial government banned logging effective
Sept. 1 in the Chuanxi Forest Area, 4.63 million hectares (11
million acres) spanning 54 counties, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported.
	   Because of heavy logging, the area in western Sichuan where soil
erosion is a problem has nearly doubled from 60,000 square
kilometers (24,000 square miles) in the 1950s to 110,000 square
kilometers (44,000 square miles), the report said.
	   Grazing and fuel gathering were also banned on some slopes so
that they could be reforested.
	   The Public Security Ministry on Sunday ordered its bureaus in
flooded areas to punish theft of relief supplies, break-ins at
homes of people out fighting the floods and other crimes, Xinhua
reported.
	   The Songhua River at Harbin, in northeast China's Heilongjiang
province, remained at record levels on Sunday, state media said.
	   The army sent reinforcements to Harbin over the weekend to
strengthen the 24-kilometer (15-mile) levee protecting the center
of the city from the Songhua.
	   But the government allowed villages on the opposite shore to be
engulfed by a brown sea of river water to divert the flow away from
Harbin. Throughout flooded regions, farms have been allowed to be
inundated to protect cities.
