<HEADLINE> Floods Recede at Middle &AMP; Lower Reaches of Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Water levels at the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze River, China's longest, started to recede
today after the largest flood peak this year passed Wuhan, capital
of central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains in areas along the Yangtze River basin and water
from the upper reaches of the Yangtze have combined to form the
third and highest flood peak this year, pushing water levels at
the middle and lower reaches close to the record high of last year.
</P>
<P>
Devastating floods along the Yangtze and in northeast China
provinces killed more than 3,000 people last year, and resulted in
economic losses of 264.2 billion yuan (about 31.7 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The flooding scale and the water levels are close to the record
floods of last year, said Wang Jun, an official with the Yangtze
River Water Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
In spite of surging water levels, the floods have flowed past
areas along the Yangtze without causing great damage, even in the
most vulnerable points such as Jingjiang and Honghu.
</P>
<P>
However, Premier Zhu Rongji said in a speech made public today
that the flood-control situation along the Yangtze is not
optimistic and called for redoubled anti-flood efforts.
</P>
<P>
Since the catastrophic floods last year, the central government
alone has earmarked 8.775 billion yuan to consolidate dikes and
dredge the river's course.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the receding flood is that some areas along
the river have resettled residents to make way for the flood
waters, thus easing flood-control pressure and reducing the cost
of flood-control.
</P>
<P>
In the hardest-hit provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and
Anhui, the central government has injected 3.5 billion yuan into
projects including the resettlement of residents for flood
diversion.
