<HEADLINE> AIOC's Coles Urged To Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian International Olympic  
Committee member Phil Coles should resign after being implicated in 
the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, the head of Melbourne's 
Commonwealth Games bid said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the interests of all Australia and indeed the sporting  
community, Mr. Coles should do the right thing and step down after 
the revelations of the $60,000 that was spent by Salt Lake City 
entertaining him,'' Ron Walker told Australian Broadcasting Corp. 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker said the International Olympic Committee's guidelines  
were obscene. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're prepared to exonerate people that accept the  
largesse of the bidding city to the tune of $60,000, obviously Salt 
Lake City weren't doing that because they love Phil Coles ... 
obviously they were doing it for a reason,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For them (the IOC) to say the guidelines were met is  
ludicrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles flew to Lausanne, Switzerland last weekend to speak with a  
special IOC panel investigating the cash-for-bribes scandal 
involving Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC will recommend to either expel, reprimand or exonerate  
him for allegedly accepting money from Salt Lake officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the investigation are expected in the next few days.  
</P>
<P>
	Coles is one of the most influential sports officials in the  
host country of the 2000 Olympics. He has always maintained he 
acted within the IOC guidelines, and threatened court action 
against the Salt Lake investigators.
