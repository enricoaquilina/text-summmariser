Swedish bid official says Salt Lake should pay losing cities

	   LONDON (AP) _ Salt Lake City should be ordered to pay dlrs 14
million in compensation to its competitors for having ``cheated''
in the race for the 2002 Winter Olympics, the leader of a rival bid
said Friday.
	   Christer Persson, who led the 2002 bid from Ostersund, Sweden,
said Salt Lake should reimburse the three losing cities for the
millions they spent on their failed campaigns.
	   Comparing the case to Ben Johnson's drug scandal at the 1988
Olympics, Persson said it was impractical to strip Salt Lake of the
games but that financial sanctions should be imposed.
	   ``When Ben Johnson fooled the others in Seoul, he lost his gold
medal,'' Persson told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview. ``This time, when we were cheated by a competitor, they
will keep the gold medal due to practical reasons.
	   ``I think it would be appropriate that they compensate their
competitors for the loss of money which we spent in vain. That is
about dlrs 14 million altogether.''
	   Persson said Ostersund spent dlrs 2 million on the bid, while
Quebec City spent dlrs 8 million and Sion, Switzerland, dlrs 4
million.
	   Salt Lake City won the 1995 election in a landslide, getting 54
votes on the first ballot. Sion and Ostersund each got 14 votes,
while Quebec City received seven.
	   Salt Lake is currently under investigation by a high-level
International Olympic Committee panel over a scholarship fund
operated by the bid group which landed the games.
	   The program provided nearly nearly dlrs 400,000 in aid to 13
people, including six relatives of IOC members.
	   The case has snowballed into the biggest corruption scandal in
the IOC's 104-year history.
	   Persson described Salt Lake as ``the best bid city for a winter
games in Olympic history.'' But he said the scholarship fund could
have affected the outcome of the vote.
	   ``The question can always remain whether Salt Lake City would
have won in any case,'' Persson said. ``Anything can happen in the
voting rounds. If you lose 13 votes to another city, the other will
have 26 more. You never know what can happen.''
	   Persson said he never suspected any wrongdoing by Salt Lake City
or the other cities during the bid.
	   ``I have no reason to think anything else,'' he said. ``I was
naive like most Swedes. We consider people honest until the
opposite has been proved.''
	   Persson said he also was unaware of any unscrupulous agents
operating during the bid. Swiss IOC executive board member Marc
Hodler alleged last weekend that bidding cities have been the
victim of crooked agents who promise to secure IOC votes for
payoffs.
	   ``This makes me think that maybe that was the reason for Salt
Lake City to enter this type of agreement,'' Persson said. ``If
they were approached by somebody who said, `If you don't take our
offer, we will go to somebody else and that would be the difference
of 26 votes.' They might have been afraid of not taking that
offer.''
	   Persson said he supported calls for changing the selection
process for Olympic host cities by taking the decision away from
the full IOC assembly and putting it in the hands of the executive
board or other small group.
	   ``I think it would be an excellent idea for all bidding
cities,'' Persson said. ``For 2002, there was an enormous spread in
the amount spent by the cities, from dlrs 2 million to dlrs 14
million. The new system would be much less costly and be an
advantage for smaller countries.''
	   Persson, currently doing research on international marketing at
Sweden's University of Lulea, said he would offer the following
advice to any Olympic bidding cities:
	   ``Carefully consider the competitors: Do you expect them to be
fair or not?''
