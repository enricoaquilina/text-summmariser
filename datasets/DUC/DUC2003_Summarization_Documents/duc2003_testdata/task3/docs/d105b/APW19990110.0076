	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Insisting he bribed no one and did nothing  
wrong, Tom Welch contends his organization acted responsibly in its 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, the former president of the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee, is accused of bribing IOC officials in the biggest 
corruption scandal in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Deseret News reported Sunday that Welch acknowledged cash  
payments and gifts to IOC members, but called them contributions to 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never bribed anybody. We never bought a vote,'' Welch said.  
``We made contributions out there as a part of the Olympic family, 
as an obligation we have. ... It was the responsible thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Welch admitted giving $50,000 cash to Jean-Claude Ganga, an IOC  
member from the Republic of Congo. Ganga sought the money to help 
children in the African nation ravaged by civil strife, Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where I think the money went,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He also acknowledged the bid committee made a $10,000  
contribution to the campaign of Chilean IOC member Sergio Santander 
Fantini, who was running for mayor of Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch did not immediately return telephone messages Sunday left  
by The Associated Press at his Park City home. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, who resigned from the Salt Lake Organizing Committee in  
1997 after being charged with spousal abuse, said he will challenge 
the right of the committee to cancel his $10,000-per-month 
consulting contract. The committee also stripped him of his 
$500,000 pension. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said it was revoking the contract Friday, the same  
day senior vice president David Johnson was forced to resign and 
President Frank Joklik said he was quitting for the good of the 
Games. Joklik will remain at his job until a replacement is found, 
possibly for three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch and Johnson are the only Salt Lake Olympic boosters being  
blamed so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Four investigations -- by the Justice Department, the IOC, the  
U.S. Olympic Committee and a Salt Lake ethics panel -- are under way 
into accusations some IOC members accepted lavish gifts and money 
from Salt Lake boosters. The IOC voted for Salt Lake in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported Saturday that Ganga received more  
than $70,000. Welch discussed only the $50,000 payment to Ganga. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch told the newspaper that Joklik and other bid committee  
board members knew about the gifts and payments to IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew everything we were going to do,'' he said. ``I never  
did anything I am embarrassed about, or that I felt was wrong or 
that I felt was hidden or not disclosed to (Joklik) and the 
board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Joklik, who was chairman of the bid board, and the board  
reviewed detailed annual budgets that were purposely not made 
public so competing cities would not match the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as keeping it secret or hiding it? No way,'' Welch  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch also denied a rumor being investigated by the outside  
ethics panel for the SLOC that prostitutes were hired for IOC 
members visiting Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm offended to the core ... at some of the wild allegations,  
like the escort services and that type of thing, which is not 
true,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch said he secured medical care for Ganga when he was sick  
with hepatitis and Ganga's mother when she had an infected knee. It 
was previously reported that Salt Lake hospitals gave IOC members 
free medical care, including cosmetic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never hesitated. Was that wrong? I'd do it again,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Utah Democratic lawmakers called for the Salt Lake  
Organizing Committee to publicly disclose all financial records, 
especially credit-card receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	And The Salt Lake Tribune reported that, contrary to the 2002  
Winter Games' billing as a privately funded event, public money has 
long supported the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City donated $156,960 to the bid effort from 1990  
through 1995, the newspaper reported. The bid committee's tax 
returns showed government grants of only $102,500 in those years, a 
difference that's expected to be scrutinized by the Justice 
Department for possible tax crimes.
