<HEADLINE> Ousted IOC Official Details Scandal </HEADLINE>

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An IOC official ousted in the bribery scandal  
involving Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter 
Olympics insists that gifts and favors he received never influenced 
his vote, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Agustin Arroyo, an attorney and former diplomat from Ecudaor who  
left the IOC in disgrace because of the allegations, said he 
regarded favors by Tom Welch, who headed Salt Lake City's winning 
bid, were gestures of personal generosity. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Tom, it was always with an embrace,'' said Arroyo, the  
first ousted IOC official to detail his side of the story to a U.S. 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1991 visit to Utah -- not gifts or favors -- prompted him to  
vote for Salt Lake City for the 1998 Winter Games, Arroyo said. 
However, that bid was won by Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	After learning that Salt Lake was going to try again for the  
2002 Games, Arroyo said it was impossible to influence him because 
he already believed the Salt Lake area was the best candidate for 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``You try to bribe a person who is either undecided or is for  
someone else,'' said Arroyo, 75. ``Do you believe that during the 
second bid Salt Lake City needed to bribe a person that in the 
first bid ... voted for Salt Lake City?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo, the son of a former president of Ecuador, also said he  
has never seen some of the gifts that investigators say he received 
from SLOC officials, including a $3,000 cashier's check. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a spreadsheet prepared by investigators and  
obtained by the Times, the Salt Lake bid committee spent $33,569 in 
expenses to woo Arroyo and his family, including a $475 ruby pin 
and a $5,077 payment to allow his wife to accompany him to Budapest 
for an IOC trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the biggest expenses was a ``scholarship'' for  
stepdaughter Nancy Rignault de Chezeuil, who was in her 40s and not 
in school at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo met Welch in 1989, when Salt Lake City was bidding for  
the 1998 games at a convention in Puerto Rico. The two men and 
their wives, as well as some of their grown children, became good 
friends, Arroyo said. 
</P>
<P>
	After he was appointed to the IOC at the Mexico City Summer  
Games in 1968, he said he was drawn into a culture of gift-giving 
and lavish perks that were treated as tokens of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo's claims of innocence were merely excuses, said Dick  
Pound, the IOC vice president who headed the commission this year 
that recommended the expulsions of Arroyo and five other IOC 
executive board members. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission and the executive board were collectively  
satisfied that Arroyo's was a case that called for the action that 
was taken,'' Pound said.
