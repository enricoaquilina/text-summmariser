   TOPEKA, Kan. _ New science standards were not on the agenda, but
they were in the spotlight at the Kansas Board of Education meeting
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 18 speakers at the meeting's hourlong forum
addressed the proposed standards, which would guide what Kansas
public school students learned and were tested on.
</P>
<P>
   A set of standards written by a state committee would establish
evolution as a cornerstone of science.
</P>
<P>
   A competing proposal advanced by conservative board member Steve
Abrams of Arkansas City would leave the decision to teach the
scientific theory to local school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four persons who spoke in support of the Abrams proposal,
two were involved in writing it. Half of the 14 other speakers were
University of Kansas researchers and professors who urged the board
to accept the state committee's recommended standards.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Holloway of Shawnee, the 10-member board's chairwoman and
a conservative, has said she favors the Abrams proposal, but she
hopes to find consensus among her fellow board members, who are
split ideologically.
</P>
<P>
   The state board originally was to discuss and possibly vote on
the new standards this month, but the 27-member state committee of
science teachers and professors that wrote the document was told to
revise it.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is meeting today in Salina. Its next draft will be
presented at the board's July meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's standards would declare evolution one of five
concepts that unite all scientific disciplines; the Abrams proposal
would remove the emphasis on evolutionary theory and question its
validity.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's standards say a theory such as evolution paints
a big picture of how the natural world works. The Abrams proposal
casts that theory as conjecture, placing applied science above
theoretical science.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have accused the Abrams proposal of opening the door to
teaching biblical creationism in Kansas science classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Williams of Leon and his wife, Mary, helped write the Abrams
version. He told the board that the differences between the two
came down to a debate about critical thinking and good science.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Williams seconded her husband. She said the proposal she
helped write did not aim to teach creation but aimed to encourage
science students to seek the truth about everything, including
evolution. She said scientists had perpetuated evolutionary theory
by dismissing proof against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't allow teaching lies as truth, as the state
document proclaims,'' Mary Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   John Van Keppel, a Leawood resident and proponent of the
evolution-theory proposal, said courts had supported the teaching
of evolution and banned the teaching of creationism in science
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers focused on the importance of theoretical science.
</P>
<P>
   KU Professor Matthew Buechner told the board he was in the
middle of research seeking a cure for polycystic kidney disease.
His research revolves around roundworms, which do not have kidneys.
But they do have genes, as humans do. Buechner studies what happens
when the genes malfunction because of disease, and he hypothesizes
that the same thing happens in humans.
</P>
<P>
   In his case, Buechner said, that theory could translate into a
cure for an often fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's increasingly important for children to understand we're
related to other species,'' Buechner said.
</P>
<P>
   As the board continued its meeting after the forum, some of the
speakers continued the debate in a hallway near the boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   On the board's agenda today is discussion of new standards for
government, economics, geography and history.
