<HEADLINE> Pulses May Ease Schizophrenic Voices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schizophrenia patients whose medication  
couldn't stop the imaginary voices in their heads gained some 
relief after researchers repeatedly sent a magnetic field into a 
small area of their brains. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of 12 patients studied said their hallucinations  
became much less severe after the treatment, which feels like 
``having a woodpecker knock on your head'' once a second for up to 
16 minutes, said researcher Dr. Ralph Hoffman. The voices stopped 
completely in three of these patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The effect lasted for up to a few days for most participants,  
and one man reported that it lasted seven weeks after being treated 
daily for four days. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman stressed that the study is only preliminary and can't  
prove that the treatment would be useful. ``We need to do much more 
research on this,'' he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman, deputy medical director of the Yale Psychiatric  
Institute, is scheduled to present the work Thursday at the annual 
meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all people with schizophrenia hear voices, and of those who  
do, Hoffman estimated that maybe 25 percent can't control them with 
medications even when other disease symptoms abate. So the work 
could pay off for ``a small but very ill group of patients,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment is called transcranial magnetic stimulation, or  
TMS. While past research indicates it might be helpful in lifting 
depression, it hasn't been studied much in schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
	In TMS, an electromagnetic coil is placed on the scalp and  
current is turned on and off to create a pulsing magnetic field 
that reaches into a small area of the brain. The goal is to make 
brain cells underneath the coil fire messages to adjoining cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure is much different from electroconvulsive therapy,  
called ECT, which applies pulses of electricity rather than a 
magnetic field to the brain. Unlike TMS, ECT creates a brief 
seizure and is performed under general anesthesia. ECT is used most 
often for treating severe depression. 
</P>
<P>
	In TMS, the magnetic pulses are thought to calm the affected  
part of the brain if they're given as slowly as once per second, 
Hoffman said. He and colleagues targeted an area involved in 
understanding speech, above and behind the left ear, on the theory 
that hallucinated voices come from overactivity there. 
</P>
<P>
	The treatment can make scalp muscles muscle contract, leading to  
the woodpecker feeling, he said, but patients could tolerate it. 
Headache was the most common side effect, and there was no sign 
that the treatment affected the ability to understand speech, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	To make sure the study results didn't reflect just the  
psychological boost of getting a treatment, researchers gave sham 
and real treatments to each study participant and studied the 
difference in how patients responded. They also tested different 
durations for each treatment, starting with four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients rated the severity of the voices -- a term combining  
frequency, loudness and the resulting distress -- on the day after 
each treatment. The real treatment did far better than the sham one 
when both were given for 16 minutes, but not when they were 
administered for briefer periods. 
</P>
<P>
	On a scale of zero to 10, with 10 being the severity patients  
had before the study began, the real 16-minute treatments led to an 
average drop of 3.8 points. Sham treatments made no significant 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mark S. George, a TMS expert at the Medical University of  
South Carolina in Charleston, agreed that the results are 
preliminary and must be confirmed by further work. But he called 
them exciting, saying, ``You have to sit up and take notice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman and colleagues have begun another study to see if giving  
more doses of the 16-minute treatment will improve results.
