<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Schizophrenia may be one of the most baffling of mental
illnesses, but the medical profession and society at large could be
making much better use of what we do know about combating the
devastating disorder, a major study has found.
</P>
<P>
   Treatments that are known to work are woefully underused and
support services &UR;  &LR; are often non-existent, the federally funded
project concluded after five years of reviewing the scientific
literature and interviewing patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' said Dr. Anthony F. Lehman, principal
investigator for the Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team
(PORT) study, which discovered glaring disparities between what's
known about the disease and what's provided to patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most patients don't get an adequate treatment package,'' said
Lehman, a University of Maryland professor of psychiatry. ``I think
that outcomes could be better, and people could have a better
quality of life within the limits of what we already know. There's
plenty of room for improvement for many patients.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, hospital and outpatient clinicians failed to provide
effective treatment approaches more than 50 percent of the time,
according to the study that analyzed in depth the care provided to
more than 700 patients in two states, one in the South and one in
the Midwest. While the study did not name the states, to protect
confidentiality, Georgia has disclosed its participation.
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia, which was first described more than 100 years ago
and is characterized by such symptoms as hallucinations, delusions,
and emotional withdrawal, affects up to 2 million Americans. Some
patients become chronically ill; others experience a single
psychotic episode and recover. The disorder usually manifests
itself in adolescence or early adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in response to the PORT study, the National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill, a Virginia-based advocacy group, launched an
initiative to get every state to adopt, by the year 2002, a major
recommendation &UR;  &LR; set forth by the study _ the so-called Program for
Assertive Community Treatment, or PACT.
</P>
<P>
   The PACT program includes intense psychiatric, social work,
nursing, and vocational rehabilitation services to keep those
people at greater risk of serious illness from being hospitalized,
becoming homeless, or of going to prison. The study found that only
10.1 percent of outpatients in the two states examined received
such treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The PACT concept is based on a program that began 25 years ago
in Madison, Wis. It now is offered statewide in Delaware, Idaho,
Michigan, RhodeIsland, Texas, and Wisconsin, and pilot programs are
under way in California, Hawaii, Minnesota, Virginia, and
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Department of Mental Health has taken all the
study's recommendations to heart and expanded upon them.
</P>
<P>
   It plans to require mental health providers doing business with
the state to follow the recommendations on medication use,
psychosocial services, and the other aspects of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty extensive mandate, if you will,'' said Dr. Paul
Barreira, deputy commissioner for clinical and professional
services. ``It's a way to standardize the treatments, so treatments
known to be effective are being used.''
</P>
<P>
   The department expects to wrap up consultations with providers,
patients, and families on the recommendations by the end of the
year, said Barreira, and then it will make copies of the report
readily available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to be a common document that patients and
families and clinicians can use to talk about where the treatment's
at,'' Barreira said.
</P>
<P>
   Other treatment approaches the PORT study found to be underused
include antipsychotic medication for new or relapsed patients,
drugs to combat the depression that some patients experience,
psychotherapy, and family education and support.
</P>
<P>
   Family education and support are most lacking, the study found;
only 9.6 percent of patients and their families getting such
services. That kind of support has been shown to reduce relapse
rates by 50 to 75 percent, especially when used in conjunction with
medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a simple kind of thing. When someone comes into the
hospital and is first diagnosed with schizophrenia, there should be
a systematic way to educate the family about what's going on,''
said William Hargreaves, a professor of psychology at the
University of California, San Francisco. ``It's something we ought
to be able to do on a large scale nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's recommendations on medication use were generally
better followed than those for psychosocial services. Yet more than
10 percent of hospitalized patients in the study did not receive
antipsychotic drugs, and more than 70 percent of outpatients did
not get the appropriate dose of drugs over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   The findings show ``what a chasm'' exists between what is
possible and what is being done, said Gerard Hogarty, a professor
of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh who has done studies
on the effectiveness of family education and other psychosocial
services in treating people with schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   The PORT study is not the first to point out that with the use
of available treatment options many people with schizophrenia can
lead productive lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a societal misperception that people with schizophrenia are
violent or beyond help continues to make difficult efforts to
expand the availability of treatments, say some mental health
professionals and advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The recent headlines about the Capitol Hill gunman and a Yale
law student who killed his girlfriend add to that misperception,
even though a study earlier this year found that people with
schizophrenia who were not also substance abusers are no more
likely to be violent than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``That myth or misconception that people do not recover affects
all research, all treatment, all funding,'' said Dr. Daniel B.
Fisher, a community-based psychiatrist who was diagnosed with
schizophrenia 30 years ago. He is executive director of the
National Empowerment Center, a federally funded mental health
advocacy group in Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article in Behavioral Healthcare Tomorrow magazine,
Fisher identified factors that have helped people with
schizophrenia to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Key among the findings from his federally funded study: A strong
social support network, and the financial resources to help the
patient get through periods when he or she is unable to work.
</P>
<P>
   Also hindering the expansion of psychosocial services, in
particular, is the prevailing belief that the answer to
schizophrenia lies in a drug yet to be discovered, or a
neurobiological secret yet to be unlocked, say some mental health
professionals and advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Research funding is ``very lopsided in favor of neurobiology,''
said Hogarty, who is a social worker by training.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clearly not equity in this. I look around and I ask
myself, `Who in the United States is testing new psychosocial
training for schizophrenia?' and I can exhaust that on a couple of
fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   The names of neuroscientists, however, could fill a phone book,
Hogarty said.
</P>
<P>
   PORT's Lehman also thinks the emphasis on the search for new
drugs or neurobiological clues can work against people getting the
support services _ or the answers _ they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reductionism that goes on sometimes,'' with the
research focus on this brain chemical or that brain chemical being
implicated in schizophrenia, and less so on psychosocial treatments
and other areas, Lehman said. ``We need to think very broadly about
this disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   His views are shared by Fisher of the National Empowerment
Center, who was once a biochemist at the National Institute of
Mental Health. ``We're just too complex a being to narrow down all
of our existence to one or another chemical,'' he said.
