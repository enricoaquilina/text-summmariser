<P>
   By the time most psychiatrists encounter schizophrenia, its
symptoms are already in full flower. But scientists have long
surmised that the illness starts much earlier, the demons beginning
to nibble at the edges of young people's lives well before the most
flagrant psychosis appears.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers are beginning, in a systematic way, to
investigate the earliest stages of schizophrenia, attempting to
find signs that could predict its onset.
</P>
<P>
   Two research groups are adopting a much bolder strategy: They
are identifying young people at risk and treating them with low
doses of anti-psychotic drugs, even though they do not exhibit the
full-blown symptoms of the illness.
</P>
<P>
   By comparing those who take the drugs with other high-risk
subjects who do not, the researchers, at the Yale School of
Medicine and the University of Melbourne in Australia, hope to find
out if such early intervention can keep the illness at bay, and to
learn more about the factors that predict vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are using the newest anti-psychotic drugs,
medications much less likely to produce serious side effects than
their predecessors. Still, the studies are controversial and have
found no shortage of critics.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas H. McGlashan, the director of the Yale study, said he
decided to begin his prevention trial when he became convinced,
after many years of working with patients suffering from
schizophrenia, that ``80 percent if not more of the damage is done
before the disorder appears.''
</P>
<P>
   McGlashan cited the findings of as many as a dozen studies
suggesting that the earlier schizophrenia was treated, the better a
patient's prospects were for recovery. After visiting the site of
the Australian trial, he said, ``I began to think that there might
be a way of preventing chronicity with the treatments we already
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Treating people with drugs for a condition they do not yet have
is a highly unusual approach in psychiatry, though it has precedent
in other areas of medicine _ the trial of tamoxifen as a
prophylactic treatment for women at high risk for breast cancer is
one example _ and is being explored for Alzheimer's and some other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia and other severe mental disorders are so
devastating that few people would object to the eventual goal of
preventive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees, however, that the time is right to attempt
something so ambitious, in large part because, despite researchers'
continuing efforts, there is still no set of indicators that can
predict future illness with any reliability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody yet knows what the early symptoms are,'' said Dr.
Barbara Cornblatt, director of the division of high-risk studies at
Hillside Hospital, part of Long Island Jewish Medical Center. With
the exception of a family history of schizophrenia, she said, ``We
don't even clearly know what the level of risk is; we don't know if
5 percent or 40 percent who are identified with suspected risk
factors are going to become ill.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, critics argue, some of the subjects in prevention
studies will receive treatment unnecessarily, or be treated for
what turns out to be the wrong problem. Behaviors used in the
studies to determine risk, they point out, can also be signs of
normal adolescent crisis, or of other psychiatric problems like
depression that do not require anti-psychotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists also question how researchers will know whether
the drugs are effective in individual cases. ``If people without
convincing symptoms are treated and never develop the illness,
under what circumstances would it be ethical for you to discontinue
the medication?'' asked Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director of the
National Institute of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics say they are concerned about the possible stigma
attached to being labeled at high risk for psychosis, and about the
potential side effects of even the newest anti-psychotic
medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to go slowly and cautiously,'' said Dr. Laura Lee
Hall, director of research for the National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill, an association of family members and some consumers.
``On the one hand, I think it's extremely important for us to
experimentally determine if we can prevent the most disabling
consequences of schizophrenia and bipolar illness. On the other
hand, I certainly have concerns that we not needlessly medicate
children that may not become sick.''
</P>
<P>
   One alternative, Hall suggested, might be to monitor patients
deemed at high risk but provide treatment only as necessary, as is
done in studies conducted by Cornblatt's clinic at Hillside.
Another might be to offer preventive measures that are less
intensive than drugs, like dietary changes or supportive therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Cornblatt were among a group of medical ethicists,
representatives of advocacy organizations and psychiatric
researchers _ including McGlashan and Dr. Patrick D. McGorry,
director of the Australian trial _ who met on Nov. 19 and 20 at a
conference in Washington sponsored by George Washington University,
to discuss the ethical and scientific issues raised by
early-intervention studies in psychiatry. Among the issues
discussed were informed consent, confidentiality and the impact of
anti-psychotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Such issues are pressing, mental health experts say, and not
only because of the studies already under way. In the
not-too-distant future, researchers may finally identify genes that
predispose people to disorders like schizophrenia and manic
depression, opening the way for genetic testing, like that
available for Huntington's disease or breast cancer. Advances in
psychopharmacology are likely to yield a new generation of
anti-psychotic drugs that are more effective and safer than those
now on the market.
</P>
<P>
   These developments will make it easier to determine and quantify
risk, and will offer new opportunities for early treatment. But
ethicists and researchers say they will also raise even more
complicated choices for patients, family members, scientists and
clinicians, who must weigh the costs and benefits in a society
whose attitude toward mental illness and those who suffer from it
is far from neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risks in some sense are different for early intervention
in psychiatry than they are in breast cancer, or other illnesses,''
said Dr. Paul S. Appelbaum, chairman of the department of
psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in
Worcester. ``One needs to raise the question of what the
consequences of labeling a person as preschizophrenic are.''
</P>
<P>
   Those consequences, Appelbaum pointed out, can include negative
reactions from employers, health insurers, schools ``and anyone who
has to decide whether or not to take a chance on a person,'' as
well as from friends and family members.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, the knowledge that one is at high risk for
schizophrenia or another severe mental illness can drastically
affect self-image, particularly in adolescents. A teenager given
such a label, Appelbaum said, might wonder: ``Do I decide that I
shouldn't get married? That I shouldn't go to college? That I
should downgrade my expectations for myself?''
</P>
<P>
   McGlashan, however, said he believed strongly that people had
the right to know if they were vulnerable to schizophrenia or other
severe disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose civil liberties are you talking about?'' he asked. ``If
it is the person who is at risk, it seems they ought to know the
information. They can choose to deny it if they want, but at least
they should be given the opportunity to deny it.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   On the question of informed consent, researchers are equally
divided. The issue of whether subjects in prevention trials are
fully aware of the consequences of accepting treatment is
particularly sensitive, critics say, in studies involving teenagers
or very young children, where parents are the ones who must provide
the consent.
</P>
<P>
   McGorry, the director of the Australian study, said he had no
doubt that the subjects in his study _ the youngest of whom are in
their mid-teens, the oldest in their 30s _ were fully able to give
informed consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the situation where you have a psychotic patient
incompetent to consent to treatment,'' said McGorry said. ``These
patients are very much in touch.''
</P>
<P>
   McGorry, who is the co-author of ``The Recognition and
Management of Early Psychosis'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999),
said his study had aroused little controversy in Australia, perhaps
because that country has a more developed community network for
treating mental illness in adolescents, and because the social
consequences of a diagnosis of mental disorder are not as severe
there.
</P>
<P>
   Yet both he and McGlashan are well aware of the difficult
questions their studies raise, and they have both gone to some
lengths to address them.
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning the prevention trial, the Australian
researchers conducted a preliminary study to test the criteria they
were using to determine high risk. Monitoring patients who met the
criteria, they found that 40 percent went on to develop a psychotic
illness _ a high enough percentage, they felt, to warrant
attempting to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   All the subjects in the study, McGorry said, had come to his
clinic requesting treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Since the study began in 1996, he added, 4 of the 31 subjects
who for six months received low doses of the anti-psychotic drug
Risperdal and a specially tailored form of psychotherapy developed
psychosis in the six months after they were taken off the drug.
</P>
<P>
   In the control group, those who received only psychotherapy, 10
of 28 subjects became psychotic. McGorry said that the difference
between the groups was significant, both clinically and
statistically, but he added that the study was small and more
research needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the participants in the Australian trial, neither
subjects nor researchers in the Yale study know which participants
are on medication _ in this case the anti-psychotic drug Zyprexa _
and which are getting dummy pills. Subjects receive the medication
for a year, then are monitored for another year. The study has
enrolled 22 subjects between the ages of 12 and 45, but the
researchers hope eventually to include 80 participants.
</P>
<P>
   All the subjects, McGlashan said, had been experiencing some
symptoms before they enrolled, including social withdrawal, trouble
concentrating, changes in personality, deterioration of personal
hygiene, decline in academic performance and perceptual oddities,
like seeing lights or shapes that are not there or hearing strange
noises.
</P>
<P>
   The Yale study is financed in part by Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., which
makes Zyprexa, and by grants from the National Institute of Mental
Health and the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashan said that when he told colleagues about his research,
their reactions were divided. ``Some say `How can you put these
people on placebo?' and some say `How can you put them on drugs?'''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he remained convinced that trying to do something to
prevent schizophrenia was better than doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychosis,'' McGlashan said, ``is not a benign state of
mind.''
