<HEADLINE> Yale study examines links between schizophrenia and smoking  </HEADLINE>

   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - A Yale School of Medicine study is
expanding upon what scientists know about the link between
schizophrenia and nicotine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   The study may help scientists develop drugs to treat
schizophrenia and to help people stop smoking, said Dr. Tony
George, the lead author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can develop drugs that act like nicotine but don't have
associated problems, then we might be on to a new family of
antischizophrenia drugs,'' George said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long noticed that almost all schizophrenics are
heavy smokers. They have tried to find out why so they might
understand what is going on in a schizophrenic's brain.
</P>
<P>
   In schizophrenics, cognitive functions in the higher part of the
brain are impaired, leading them to have trouble with memory,
concentration and reason.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the dopamine, or ''reward'' pathways in the
lower part of their brains, are operating on overtime, making them
susceptible to addictions and risky behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that too little dopamine activity is going on in
the front of the brain, where the cognitive functions lie. This
leads to too much dopamine activity in the lower part of the brain,
leading to paranoia, addictions and compulsions, George said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, using rats, showed how both dopamine pathways in the
brain are linked to other reward pathways called opioid pathways.
</P>
<P>
   Both kinds of pathways are receptive to nicotine. By smoking,
schizophrenics may be stimulating activity in those pathways and
improving their cognitive ability.
</P>
<P>
   When rats were injected with a substance that blocks opioid
systems, the nicotine's effects also were blocked.
</P>
<P>
   George said the finding shows the link between the two systems
and raises the possibility that drugs could be developed to exploit
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's a common biological explanation to nicotine
addiction and schizophrenia, related to opiate pathways, maybe a
drug to block opiate pathways would be effective in treating
nicotine addiction and schizophrenia,'' George said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gregory Dalack, who also has studied the affects of smoking
on schizophrenics at the veterans hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich. and
the University of Michigan, said this study adds to the
understanding of the complicated interaction between nicotine and
the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a complicated system,'' Dalack said. ''A great deal of
this still needs to be understood. These animal models are helping
to tease out what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded in part by the National Alliance for
Research on Schizophrenia and Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, what comes out of this is there will be a chemical,
a treatment that will help them maintain a more comfortable
personality,'' said Constance Lieber, president of the group.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Drug Abuse and the National Institute
of Mental Health also helped fund the study, which appears in this
month's issue of the journal Neuropsychopharmacology.
