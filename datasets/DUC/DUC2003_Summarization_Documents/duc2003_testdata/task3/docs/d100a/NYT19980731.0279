   WASHINGTON _ Exploring chaos in a search for order, scientists
who study the reality-shattering mental disease schizophrenia are
becoming fascinated by the chemical environment of areas of the
brain where perception is regulated.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, a region known as the thalamus, a sort of
gateway that filters incoming information and relays it to other
portions of the brain, has attracted growing scientific interest.
</P>
<P>
   For persons such as Russell E. Weston Jr., the diagnosed
paranoid schizophrenic charged with killing two U.S. Capitol police
officers, the sounds, sights, odors and feelings the rest of us
experience almost unconsciously may swell like microphone feedback
into a hellish roar of scrambled perception.
</P>
<P>
   From simple bewilderment to hallucinations, grandiose illusions
and terrifying paranoia, different schizophrenics react in
different ways to what may be similar underlying problems,
therapists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could imagine yourself sort of plopped down in a
country where you don't speak the language or know the customs,
where everybody else's behavior seems peculiar, it's something like
that,'' said Richard Lewine, professor of psychiatry and behavioral
science at Emory University Medical School. ``They have these
mental explanations about what all around them means.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether a court will conclude that this
kind of mental chaos moved Weston to charge past metal detectors,
gun down the two policemen and shoot a female bystander while
terrified tourists fled and scrambled for cover. His
court-appointed lawyer has not said whether he will attempt to show
that Weston was insane at the time of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Converging threads of research into the disease that afflicts an
estimated 2 million Americans are generating insight that in some
ways is hopeful and in others, desperate.
</P>
<P>
   They include the use of scanning technology to watch both normal
and abnormal brains while they work, post-mortem examination of
brain tissues and studies of the ways chemical
``neurotransmitters'' relay impulses between nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous volume of material that has come out in
the past few years,'' said Frank Brown, a psychiatrist who also
teaches at Emory and is medical director of the Wesley Woods
Geriatric Center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some areas we have an extraordinary amount of information,
and in many others we do not,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the deficiencies in the thalamus, where sensations
are processed, may be central to most cases of schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is impaired thalamic filtering of these stimuli, a
lot of that stuff comes through disorganized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that some areas of the thalamus are hypersensitive
to dopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in relaying
the nerve impulses that make the brain work.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than relaying a signal, then disappearing, such a
chemical might continue to stimulate the next nerve cell, like
pushing the play button on a radio or tape player again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said newer drugs now being used to treat schizophrenia
often have a dopamine antagonist effect, meaning they inhibit the
chemical's activity.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish scientists who compared brain tissues of 19
schizophrenics who had died of other causes with tissue from the
brains of persons who had not had the disease found evidence that a
schizophrenic's thalamus lacks much of the natural ability to
inhibit the activity of its neurotransmitters.
</P>
<P>
   They suggested that abnormal brain development, or even damage
to the brain prior to birth, might allow ``unmodulated stimulatory
activity'' to flow through the thalamus to the rest of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Imaging technologies that scan the brain have been used by
researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda,
Md., to show that in many schizophrenics the thalamus starts to
shrink, even in childhood.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, families are shocked when a seemingly normal
teenager or young adult seems to suddenly develop the bizarre
behavior that signals a life of schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it were possible to look back at hours of home movies,
we would probably find signs that some subtle things were going
on,'' Brown said. ``There probably were what we call neurological
'soft signs' that showed something was wrong. There may be some
left-right confusion, some problem with poor coordination and some
very minor physical anomalies.''
</P>
<P>
   Different ``types'' of schizophrenia may be merely the way
different personalities react to the same underlying vulnerability,
Lewine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten people will see the same movie, and some will laugh out
loud or cry and others will be more restrained,'' he said. ``This
is a fundamental dimension of human personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewine said the schizophrenic's psychosis often interferes with
his or her treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their illness leads them to believe nothing is wrong with
them,'' he said. ``Yet sometimes they are amenable to logical
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Paranoid schizophrenics, who tend to be young males, sometimes
receive their first treatment only after a series of fights,
arrests or other confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find we can make the case to them that there is a link
between their disorder and the consequences,'' he said. ``Even in
the midst of their psychosis, there are logical elements in their
thinking. Then if we can keep them on the medicine long enough,
they may see the benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Most anti-psychotic medications have wide-ranging and often
unpleasant side effects, Brown said, including stiffness, tremors
and other symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Also, persons with delusions of grandeur may crave the
experience and not want to give it up.
