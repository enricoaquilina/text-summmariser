	NEW YORK (AP) -- After vowing to combat fraud, online auction  
service eBay Inc. finds itself the subject of a fraud investigation 
being conducted by the city's Department of Consumer Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The department is looking into whether people who use eBay to  
sell items falsely labeled some sports memorabilia as 
``one-of-a-kind,'' a source close to the investigation told The 
Associated Press Tuesday. Specifically, the agency is investigating 
whether baseballs supposedly signed by Babe Ruth, Roberto Clemente 
and Christy Mathewson are authentic, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Department officials confirmed the probe Tuesday but refused  
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe raises the question of whether eBay can be held  
accountable for allegedly unscrupulous sellers and how it could 
monitor claims made in each sale. 
</P>
<P>
	It comes at a time of explosive growth in the Internet and as  
regulators are grappling with how to protect consumers without 
strangling the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the Wild, Wild West, the Internet,'' said Cleo  
Manuel, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based National Consumers 
League, which has been monitoring Internet fraud since 1992. ``It's 
going to take a while for regulations to take place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EBay does not have any inventory for sale. Instead, it allows  
people worldwide to post listings of items for sale, with potential 
buyers placing bids over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	When an auction is completed, the winning bidder contacts the  
seller to finish the deal. eBay collects a small commission on each 
listing and sale. In the three-month span ended Dec. 31, eBay 
hosted 13.6 million auctions. 
</P>
<P>
	According to its Web site, more than 1,000 items -- including  
Beanie Babies, dolls, books and gemstones -- are sold via eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay declined to comment on the investigation Tuesday. On  
Monday, in response to a New York Post story that disclosed the 
investigation, the company issued a statement saying it was 
cooperating fully with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In a message to its customers late Monday, Meg Whitman, eBay  
president and chief executive officer, said the company had zero 
tolerance for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have committed and will continue to commit resources to  
have the most comprehensive programs in order to keep eBay a safe 
harbor for online person-to-person trading,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay receives an average of 27 fraud complaints for every 1  
million auctions, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 15, the company announced its own initiatives to combat  
fraud. These included giving users the option of having their 
identities verified by an outside agency so they can be listed on 
eBay as accredited users and penalizing bidders who win auctions 
but don't collect the goods or pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the rapid growth of its business, eBay separately  
reported Tuesday it earned $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 
1998, sharply above the $189,000 of a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For the quarter, revenue came to $19.5 million, more than seven  
times the $2.6 million of a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, the company earned $2.4 million on revenue of  
$47.4 million, against $874,000 in earnings on revenue of $5.7 
million in 1997.
