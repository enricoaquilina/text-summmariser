 &HT;    Hundreds of sites vying for attention

   ATLANTA _ How much would you pay for this newspaper? The day may
be coming _ thanks to the growing popularity of Web auctions _ when
the consumer sets the price and merchants compete to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of all Web auction sites is eBay, a place where many
Web users first learned of the excitement of an online auction. The
site, www.ebay.com, is still one of the Web's most popular places
to buy and trade. To participate, you'll need to register with the
site, but the process is easy and free. Once registered, you'll be
able to make bids to buy products listed and sell your own items.
The site takes a fee from sellers to help pay the freight.
</P>
<P>
   The fee system is a bit complex and varies based on the value of
the item and other factors. Here's how eBay describes it:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put an item up for auction and set the opening bid for
$5, your insertion fee will be 25 cents. Then let's say that at the
end of your auction, the high bid is $20. The $20 is used to
calculate your Final Value fee (a percentage of the final sale
price). In this instance, it's $1. ... For this example, you would
pay eBay $1.25.''
</P>
<P>
   But eBay was just the pebble that helped to create the Internet
auction avalanche. There are now literally hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of auction sites online.
</P>
<P>
   To give you an idea of just how many, take a look at an
excellent site called Internet Auction List _ Largest Auction
Directory. It's located at www.internetauctionlist.com/. If you
look at the left side of the page, you'll see that the listings of
the various auction sites are divided by category. There are way
too many categories to list, but, as examples, you'll find
groupings of sites for automobiles, aviation, bankruptcy, boats,
clothing, comics, consumer electronics, firearms and farm
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Sites that collect links to the hundreds of auction sites on the
Web are especially valuable, because if you are selling a rare
collectible you are most likely to get a good price for it from an
informed audience of specialists. So you should bookmark another
collection of auction links called BidFind at www.bidfind.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Here as well, the auction pages are grouped according to
category. While the category names differ slightly, it's the same
idea and the same basic categories.
</P>
<P>
   One excellent feature of BidFind is the listing of new auction
sites that appears on the right side of the page. That's valuable,
since new auction sites seem to be popping up with great frequency,
and some of the newest offer special promotional deals as a way of
building an audience.
</P>
<P>
   So be sure to check out the newest sites (but keep in mind that
there are no guarantees of a site's ethics or legitimacy, so you'll
want to be a smart consumer as you try sites without a track
record).
</P>
<P>
   Now that Web auction sites are old hat to most Web shoppers, the
reverse auction site has become very trendy _ such as Priceline.com
(www.priceline.com). The slogan of that site explains the notion of
reverse auctions in just a few words: ``Name your own price and
save.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reverse auction site worth watching is called
NetgenShopper.Com and is located at www .netgenshopper.com. You
simply register (free) and fill out a form telling about the item
you want to buy. Then sellers contact you, offering their best
price on that item.
