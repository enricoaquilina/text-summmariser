	YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- The United States and European countries  
were rebuked Tuesday for passing up an international heroin 
conference because it was in Myanmar, one of the world's biggest 
producers of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants at the 4th International Heroin Conference said the  
boycott by the world's biggest heroin consuming nations ran counter 
to the spirit of international cooperation against drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	``As two of the largest markets for heroin in the world, the  
United States and Britain bear a special responsibility to work 
with the rest of the international community in every way 
possible,'' Home Affairs Minister Col. Tin Hlaing said in his 
opening address. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day conference was organized by Interpol, the Lyon,  
France-based agency that bolsters links among national police 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Other countries boycotting the conference include France,  
Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway. Representatives of 26 other 
countries, including Australia and Switzerland, were listed as 
attending. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington and other critics say the military regime in Myanmar,  
also known as Burma, has failed to seriously crack down on drugs 
and has such a poor human rights record that it does not deserve 
the legitimacy conferred by the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States believes that the Burmese regime could use  
the conference to create the false impression of international 
approval, both by Interpol and by participating countries, for its 
counternarcotics and anti-crime performance,'' U.S. State 
Department spokesman James Foley said Tuesday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Burma's counternarcotics efforts, while improving, are far  
from what is necessary. And Burma, of course, persists in its 
disregard for political and human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based Human Rights Watch likened holding the  
meeting in Yangon to ``holding a convention on weapons of mass 
destruction in Baghdad, on women's rights in Kabul or on terrorism 
in Tripoli.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myanmar officials are especially sensitive to criticism on the  
drug issue because they feel they have made great achievements in 
the fight against drugs -- especially measured by the number of 
seizures -- with almost no outside aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Most foreign aid to the country was cut off a decade ago  
following the bloody suppression of protests against military rule.
