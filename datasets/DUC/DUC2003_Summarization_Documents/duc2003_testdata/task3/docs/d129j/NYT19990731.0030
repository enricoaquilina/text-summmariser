SHIFT

<P>
   Year 2000 problems at U.S. corporations will not affect the U.S.
economy and stock market, but consumer concerns about Y2K could
cause shifts in the market, a new report from Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The financial company said the top Year 2000 issue is emerging
as ``Y2K problem two'' -- worry by both corporate and individual
consumers that the computer bug will result in problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a second Y2K problem which is not based on what is
known, but rather is based on what is feared,'' according to Jeanne
G. Terrile, first vice president of Merrill Lynch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the financial company's second annual report on Y2K, Terrile
said the possibility that Y2K would have a negative effect on the
U.S. economy had diminished. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our surveys show that, based on factual evidence, the risk of
serious economic dislocation from Y2K noncompliance is
diminishing,'' Terrile said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But the turn of the millennium is a big event which will
surely get more and more media coverage, and some of that coverage
will no doubt raise fears,'' Terrile said. ``To the extent that
those fears are acted upon, investment and fund flows could be
altered.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Merrill Lynch report gave U.S. banks high praise for
completing their Y2K projects. However, banks might spark fears if
they borrow to increase their cash reserves in case Y2K-nervous
consumers come to withdraw money at the end of the year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Terrile said there were indications the U.S. economy would heat
up in the fourth quarter as corporations beefed up inventories to
cover themselves for any potential Y2K-related supply chain
problems. That could lead to a slight economic downtown during the
first quarter next year as spending slows, she said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Corporate Y2K ratings
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications, parent of Southwestern Bell, received a
``below average'' rating for Y2K readiness in a survey by Weiss
Ratings Inc., a Florida company that rates the Y2K readiness of
American corporations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Weiss readiness survey, released this week, found that
spending to complete Y2K projects at major corporations jumped as
much as 500 percent in the first quarter of the year, ``indicating
that management may have greatly underestimated the scope of their
Year 2000'' problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications and 21.2 percent of the Fortune 1,000
companies received below-average Y2K readiness ratings from the
Weiss survey. The company's rating was downgraded since the last
Weiss survey, when SBC received an ``average'' rating. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SBC, expected to spent $265 million on Y2K, has so far spent 65
percent of its budget, a Weiss analyst states, which is considered
``low'' as compared to a peer comparison group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Janet Rainford, Y2K communications director for SBC,
criticized the rating given by Weiss, saying the firm was just out
to make a name for itself with its apples-to-oranges comparisons
between Fortune 1,000 firms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She said SBC increased its Y2K budget by $10 million in the
latest Securities and Exchange Commission filings after the recent
purchase of a non-Y2K-compliant company. SBC is 99 percent ready
for Y2K, she said, and will meet the end-of-the-year deadline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farmland Industries received the bottom ranking of ``low.'' The
survey said the company's spending had doubled from $3 million to
$6 million during the first three months of the year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roger Willt, an information technology executive with Farmland,
said the ranking did not accurately reflect the farm cooperative's
Y2K efforts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Willt said Farmland's Y2K budget increase reflected spending for
third-party testing of all Y2K systems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Independent testing is a good thing, Weiss raters say, but
planning for it this late in the game reflects poorly on the firm's
Y2K planning efforts. Farmland calls the move prudent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All along, private industry has been loath to discuss Y2K
efforts publicly for fear of becoming targets for opportunistic
lawyers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I talk with our important customers and explain our
state of readiness,'' Willt said, ``they become more comfortable
with our efforts.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also in the same rankings, AlliedSignal Inc. received a ``high''
rating. Of its $150 million Y2K budget, the firm has left to spend
$28 million, or 19 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What does this all mean? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The information disclosed by the companies to the SEC does not
permit definitive conclusions regarding their current status,''
said Martin Weiss, chairman of the ratings company. ``But it does
give us a pretty good indication upon which we base our opinion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, many firms have failed to disclose even the
basics such as their Y2K budgets and expenditures, despite SEC
guidelines that call for these disclosures.'' &QL;
</P>

Up in the air
</P>
<P>
   Poland's national airline, LOT, said it would ground all its
planes Jan. 1, 2000, to avoid any potential problems. It's
considered to be the first mass cancellation in Europe because of
Y2K worries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be mistake-free and that's why we are taking this
step,'' spokesman Monika Krajczynska told Reuters news agency.
``The management has decided to cancel all flights on this
sensitive day because of the possibilities of complications or
problems.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The state-run airline, which flies to most eastern and western
European capitals and North America, will resume flights on Jan.
2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, Vietnam Airlines has canceled all flights just prior to
Jan. 1. And in Indonesia, airline PT Garuda has said it might not
fly on New Year's Day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Europe and North America, airline officials are confident
their systems will be fine on Jan. 1. A recent report from the Air
Transportation Association of America says 95 percent of all U.S.
air carriers are Y2K ready. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And a host of Y2K luminaries say they will be in the sky when
2000 arrives. They include John Koskinen, chairman of the
President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion; Jane Garvey, head of
the Federal Aviation Administration; and Peter de Jager, the
Canadian computer guru who first alerted the world to the potential
for problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But will they find their luggage when they land? &QL;
