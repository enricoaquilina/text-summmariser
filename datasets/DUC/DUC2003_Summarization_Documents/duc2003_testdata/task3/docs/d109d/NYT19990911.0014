   Health officials said they believe that a 79-year-old man who
died at a hospital in Albany Friday may have been the second victim
of an outbreak of E. coli that has already sickened more than 600
people in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday y, state health officials had reported 611
suspected cases of E. coli poisoning, up from 497 on Thursday. All
of the victims had attended the Washington County Fair on Aug. 28
or 29.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the outbreak is tied to a contaminated
well. Officials say that heavy rains may have washed cow manure
infected with the bacterium into the underground water supply.
Rachel Aldrich, 3, died last week after drinking a glass of water
at the fair. Another 58 people remained hospitalized. The man who
died Friday , Ernest Wester, attended the fair on both days and
drank coffee that was made with contaminated water, said Linda
Blumenstock, a spokeswoman for the Stratton Veterans Administration
Medical Center, where he died.
</P>
<P>
   Health department officials could not confirm late Friday night
whether Wester's death was caused to the fairground's water supply.
