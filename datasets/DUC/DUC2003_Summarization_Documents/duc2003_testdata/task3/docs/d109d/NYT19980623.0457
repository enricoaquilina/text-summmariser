 &HT;    Chlorinated water called an odd source for E. coli bacteria
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna

<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the link between this week's cluster of E. coli
cases and the White Water themepark in Marietta, Ga. is proved, it
will mark only the second time that chlorinated swimming water is
believed to have transmitted the sometimes-deadly bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Disease detectives at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention are aware of only one other such cluster, which was also
in Georgia: Eleven children infected by a neighborhood pool in
south Georgia in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most waterborne transmission has been through drinking
unchlorinated water _ there was one large outbreak from well
water,'' said Dr. Larry Slutsker of the CDC's foodborne and
diarrheal diseases branch. ``And it has been transmitted from
swimming in unchlorinated water such as lakes and ponds. But
chlorinated water is an unusual source; one would suspect either
that the chlorination wasn't working properly or the chlorination
system wasn't able to keep up with the bacterial burden in the
pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Though O157:H7 have now been found in three states _ Georgia,
South Carolina and Tennessee _ there is still no guarantee that
disease detectives at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention will become involved in the investigation. Their
mandatory involvement is triggered when an infectious material,
such as a food, is carried across state lines; otherwise, they must
be invited in by a state government, and by Tuesday evening, none
of the three states had issued such an invitation.
</P>
<P>
   But E. coli experts at the Atlanta-based agency are informally
advising the Georgia Division of Public Health, which also has
former CDC scientists on its staff.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking down the ways in which E. coli is transmitted has
become an increasingly important task. The O157:H7 strain is only
the third most common foodborne organism, trailing salmonella and
campylobacter; though no one has estimated the total number of
infections it causes, about 20,000 Americans seek medical care for
its effects each year. But it causes a much more serious disease
more frequently; about 10 percent of the infected develop hemolytic
uremic syndrome, a potentially fatal complication.
</P>
<P>
   And it's become an increasingly difficult task. Since it was
identified in 1982 as a cause of disease, the bacterial strain has
hitchhiked on ground beef, cured meat, unpasteurized fruit juice
and raw vegetables - so many routes of transmission that the usual
measures of pasteurizing liquids and cooking foods well hasn't
provided enough protection.
</P>
<P>
   (A second strain currently being blamed for an outbreak in the
Midwest, enterotoxigenic E. coli _ known as ETEC _ is believed to
have been transmitted by potato salad. So far, it has sickened
4,000 adults and children with less serious ``travellers'
diarrhea.'')
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the problem is that E. coli O157:H7 (named for two
proteins on the bacterium's surface) has unique characteristics,
said CDC epidemiologist Dr. Paul Mead. At some point before it
emerged as a threat, the bacterium became infected with a virus
that changed its genetic material, giving it the ability to produce
a virulent toxin that can destroy red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``(O157) has a relatively low infectious dose; from
10 to several hundred organisms are all that are necessary,'' Mead
said. ``For comparison, it takes more than 100,000 salmonella
bacteria to make someone sick. And the other feature that makes it
a particular problem is that it is fairly resistant to acid, so it
can survive in foods such as cider that we previously thought were
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Most outbreaks of O157:H7 have been linked to cow manure or
human feces. Recent research has shown that up to 1 percent of
commercial cattle have the strain - though deer, sheep and goats
may also carry it - so that any large lot of cattle taken to a
slaughterhouse is likely to contain infected animals.
</P>
<P>
   Using information from a laboratory technique called
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, which allows scientists to
isolate a unique ``DNA fingerprint,'' the CDC has been building a
national E. coli information network. It allows state health
departments to electronically compare strains found in outbreaks as
a way of pinpointing a common source. E. coli O157:H7 is the only
foodborne organism for which the CDC has done this, a measure of
how seriously the agency takes the bacterial threat.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, E. coli is so widely distributed that some
national action such as the proposed federal Food Safety Initiative
_ which includes intensive monitoring as well as the use of food
irradiation - may be necessary, Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're dealing with multiple sources, you need multiple
methods of prevention,'' he said. ''Cleaning up the meat supply
won't stop it if it's coming from fruits and vegetables as well.''
