   IQALUIT, Nunavut _ A bold attempt to right past wrongs and bring
hope to an entire region was launched as Thursday began and the map
of Canada was redrawn to make room for the new territory of
Nunavut.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight, with the wind chill here hovering around 45 below
zero, Ottawa divided the old Northwest Territories in two, and
Nunavut, which means ``our land,'' was created from the eastern 60
percent of the region, with this remote city of 4,500 residents
becoming the capital of the new territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we affirm today, with the stroke of a pen, is the end of
a very long road,'' said Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who came to
Iqaluit Thursday morning from Newfoundland, which is celebrating
its own admission to Canada 50 years ago _ the last major change in
the country's map before Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While Chretien called Nunavut a ``rare and precious
opportunity,'' other Canadians criticized it as a waste of money
and, worse, a dangerous precedent for fostering racial tribalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-fifth of Canada will be put under a government whose
purpose it is to represent one ethnic group,'' The Ottawa Citizen
said in a recent editorial. ``Canada will have its first Bantustan,
an apartheid-style ethnic homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Nunavut (NOO-na-voot) caps a notable
transformation not only for northern Canada's residents but for all
Eskimos in polar regions around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   With Nunavut firmly in the hands of Eskimos, a people also
called Inuit, roughly two-thirds of the estimated 150,000 Eskimos
on earth, including about 7,000 in Alaska, have won some degree of
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now like a chain stretching from Greenland to the
Russian Far East,'' said Oran R. Young, director of the Dickey
Institute of Arctic Studies at Dartmouth College, ``and Nunavut is
a huge link in this chain.''
</P>
<P>
   What is even more remarkable about Nunavut is that by
conventional measures of political influence, like the votes they
control or the funds they have access to, the new territory's
27,000 residents _ 85 percent of them Eskimos _ would have been
considered almost powerless.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, over a generation, using a mixture of patience and
compromise that reflected traditional Eskimo ways, they have made
notable strides that are being watched by indigenous groups around
the world. And what they accomplished they did without the court
battles, angry protests or sporadic violence that has marked
movements for American Indian rights throughout North America.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to suggest the process of creating Nunavut was
easy or painless. The first Eskimo call for a new territory came in
1976, and the law creating Nunavut was not enacted until 1993.
</P>
<P>
   That law also settled the largest native land claim in Canada's
history, giving the Eskimos _ who had never signed a treaty with
the Canadian government _ outright title to 135,000 square miles of
their traditional territory, with mineral rights in about one-tenth
of that space.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, the Eskimos surrendered claim to all other
land in the north and accepted a financial settlement that will
exceed $1 billion over 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nunavut encompasses 770,000 square miles of ice and snow that
becomes a riot of mud and color in the brief spring and summer.
Roughly equal in size to the land mass of Mexico, its southern
boundary roughly follows the tree line above the province of
Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   It stretches north to the very top of the world. On the east it
is bounded by Quebec's Ungava Peninsula. Nunavut's uneven western
boundary was drawn to exclude the city of Yellowknife and the newly
opened diamond mine near Lac de Gras.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Nunavut is a territory like Yukon and the Northwest
Territories, which have smaller populations and fewer taxing powers
than Canada's provinces. Nunavut's nonpartisan government is open
to every resident, Eskimo or not. But demographics make this an
Eskimo territory now and will see that it stays that way for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   In the first local Parliament, sworn in Thursday at the local
high school, 15 of the 19 legislators are Eskimo. And although some
critics worry that Nunavut will exclude non-Eskimo, the first
premier of Nunavut, Paul Okalik, a 34-year-old Eskimo lawyer, made
clear Thursday that that would not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have established a public government that will represent
all the people of Nunavut equally and democratically,'' Okalik said
during a ceremony introducing Nunavut's new flag.

<P>
   Other critics question the need for one more layer of
government. ``The federal government has committed $1 billion to
Nunavut,'' said Mike Scott, an opposition member of the federal
Parliament from British Columbia and Indian affairs critic for the
Reform Party. ``That is a staggering price-tag for some
questionable gains.''
</P>
<P>
   The rump state that remains in the West will continue to be
called the Northwest Territories. Its population is more racially
mixed than Nunavut's. After division, 52 percent of its 40,000
residents are nonindigenous, 10 percent Eskimo and the rest from
various Indian nations.
</P>
<P>
   Nunavut's challenges are enormous. It starts out with some of
Canada's highest rates of unemployment, alcohol and substance
abuse, and suicide. More than 90 percent of its annual budget comes
from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   There are few industries and even fewer roads. At least at the
beginning, Okalik, the new premier, believes the government itself
will be the engine of economic growth, the contemporary equivalent
of the transcontinental railroad that brought opportunity to the
West a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the 56 percent of Nunavut's people who are under 25 years
old, Nunavut represents a new world. ``Inuit power!'' said Darcy
Kablalik, 23, who came to attend the ceremonies from Rankin Inlet.
``We've been waiting for this for a long time.''
