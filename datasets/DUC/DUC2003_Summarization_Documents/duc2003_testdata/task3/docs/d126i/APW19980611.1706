	   YELLOWKNIFE, Northwest Territories (AP) _ It's intended to be a
cheerful, no-fault divorce: the upcoming division of Canada's vast
Northwest Territories into two separately governed pieces of
tundra, rocks and ice.
	   But across one of the world's least-populated regions _ 65,000
people in an area bigger than India _ anticipation of the breakup
is mixed with apprehension.
	   In the eastern half of the Territories, to be named Nunavut,
Inuits' pride at gaining self-governance is tempered by poverty,
unemployment, crime and substance abuse rates that far exceed the
national average.
	   The Inuits _ formerly known as Eskimos _ will make up 85 percent
of a population of 26,000.
	   The western half is groping for an identity: It doesn't even
have an official name to distinguish it from Nunavut, though
residents use the term ``Western Arctic'' while awaiting a final
decision.
	   And while the west faces less daunting economic problems than
the east, it faces a more complex political struggle: After the
split on April 1, 1999, its population will be divided almost 50-50
between aboriginals and whites, raising questions about how to
allocate political power.
	   ``It's not a source of friction, but it's a concern,'' said
Charles Dent, a white member of the territorial Cabinet in
Yellowknife. ``One way or another we'll have to find a way for all
of us to work together.''
	   Native leaders voice similar sentiments.
	   ``It's exciting, it's difficult,'' said Bill Erasmus, chief of
the region's biggest Indian tribe, the Dene. ``We need to have
patience and understanding of each other.''
	   A committee is drafting proposals for a new constitution that
eventually will be put in a plebiscite.
	   The basic choices are to form separate governments for
aboriginals and for the territory as a whole, or combine the two.
All the parties are reluctant to create any government body
specifically reserved for non-aboriginals.
	   The Western Arctic's Indians, plus the one Inuit community that
will remain after division, insist their self-government rights
cannot be diminished by any new constitution. They note that in the
Northwest Territories, unlike the rest of Canada, aboriginals have
rights to huge tracts of land instead of small reservations.
	   ``This is Dene country,'' Erasmus said. ``Some non-native people
bring baggage from the south, but they soon realize it's different
here. They can't do things they might do in the south, in terms of
neglecting us.''
	   Stephen Kakfwi, a former Dene chief who is now territorial
minister of economic development, recalled how some uneasy whites
formed a ``white brotherhood'' in the 1970s to counter what they
perceived as excessive native militancy.
	   ``We've come a long way since then,'' Kakfwi said. ``I see
aboriginal and non-aboriginal people really having made the
commitment to listen to each other.''
	   Though the Northwest Territories' breakup was endorsed by voters
in both halves, the logistics occasionally have been contentious.
	   For example, Nunavut leaders favor creating their own power
company, rather than sharing the one now serving the entire
territory. There also has been sparring over who gets the
territory's distinctive polar bear-shaped license plates.
	   Nunavut is claiming the plates because most of the territory's
real polar bears live in the east. Westerners aren't ready to give
up easily.
	   ``People here are very fond of those license plates,'' said
Cooper Langford, editor of a Yellowknife-based magazine called ``Up
Here.''
	   Within the Western Arctic, residents and politicians must decide
what name they want for their soon-to-be-shrunken territory. An
informal poll two years ago showed strong sentiment for keeping
Northwest Territories, while the joke name ``Bob'' was a distant
runner-up.
	   Many Indian leaders favor calling the region Denendeh _ ``our
land'' in the Dene language. Kakfwi, for one, scoffs at the idea of
retaining Northwest Territories as the name.
	   ``It's a colonial name,'' he said. ``We have to get a name that
identifies us as a people.''
	   A task force of Western Arctic legislators is deliberating
issues related to the breakup, ranging from whether to keep the
Northwest Territories flag, to how to celebrate the division next
April.
	   Langford said some westerners are unsure whether they should be
celebrating at all.
	   ``Nunavut is in the process of building something,'' he said.
``Here in the Western Arctic, it's more like a corporate
downsizing. ... There's a lot of uncertainty.''
