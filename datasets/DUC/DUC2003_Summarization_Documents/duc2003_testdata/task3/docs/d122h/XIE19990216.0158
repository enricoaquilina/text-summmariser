<HEADLINE> Joint Indo-Lanka Venture to Expand Cashew Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- India and Sri Lanka will soon
set up a joint venture to expand cashew exports of both countries,
the official Daily News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the Indian Cashew Manufacturers'
Association T. Pillai who was in Sri Lanka recently agreed to
collaborate in this venture when he met Internal and International
Commerce Minister Kingsley Wickramaratne, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a great demand for cashew in the world. But both
India and Sri Lanka have failed to meet the demand," Wickramaratne
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although Sri Lanka's cashew trees grow luxuriantly their yield
is not very satisfactory. When India harvests four tons of cashew
from an acre, Sri Lanka harvests only half a ton.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka hopes to benefit from India's technological expertise
to increase production, Wickramaratne said.
</P>
<P>
"The joint venture will help us develop our cashew industry to
generate employment to about 500 people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indian hopes the proposed joint venture will help develop the
cashew industry in both countries to earn foreign exchange,
according to Pillai.
