<HEADLINE> Vietnam Expects to Produce More Cashew Nuts This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is expected to harvest
120,000 tons of raw cashew nuts this year, 10,000 tons more than
last year, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's cashew growers have already begun harvesting the 1999
crop. The price for raw cashew nuts is rising sharply in Vietnam's
markets.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Cashew Association forecasts that if its processors
were permitted to import 40,000 tons of raw cashew nuts and run at
their full capacity, the country would be able to export 40,000
tons of processed nuts for 180 million U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
However, in the first two months of this year, Vietnam exported
only 14 million dollars of cashew nuts, an 8.3-percent drop
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
As prolonged droughts badly affected the cashew crop, Vietnam
exported only 27,000 tons of processed cashew nuts in 1998, a
28-percent decrease from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, Vietnam's southern provinces have been growing
cashew, which has become a high-export value industrial crop of
the country. Vietnam increased cashew acreage from 30,000 hectares
in 1980 to 250,000 hectares in 1997 when it exported 33,300 tons
of processed cashew nuts, becoming the world's second biggest
cashew exporter after India.
</P>
<P>
VNA said that Vietnam's cashew nuts have been highly
appreciated in the world market for their high quality. Vietnam
holds 20 percent of the world market share, exporting to 20
countries, with China, Europe and America being its major markets.
