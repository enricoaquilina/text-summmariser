Vietnam floats cashew nut price
</HEADLINE>

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam has floated the price of cashews
due to a shortage of nuts to keep processing plants running, an
executive of the Vietnam Cashew Nuts Association said Friday.
	   Cashews have been trading at 8,000 dong to 10,000 dong (62-80
cents) per kilogram (2.2 pounds), well up from the ceiling price of
6,500 dong (50 cents) set by the government, the executive said.
	   The executive, speaking on condition he not be identified, said
foreign sellers have raised their offer for raw nuts to more than
dlrs 700 per ton from dlrs 650 earlier.
	   He said the price has been pushed up because there aren't enough
cashews available to run the 60 nut-processing plants, which have a
capacity of more than 200,000 tons per year.
	   Vietnam produced about 110,000 tons in the February-May crop,
down from the average of 150,000-180,000 tons, largely because of
the country's worst drought in a century.
	   Cashews are planted only in southern Vietnam, which was
particularly parched.
	   Vietnam never has imported cashews for processing for re-export
but plans to import 30,000 tons this year to fill the shortfall.
	   Vietnam exported 33,000 processed cashew nuts last year,
fetching dlrs 133 million. About 4.5 kilograms of raw cashews can
produce one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of refined nuts.
	   The cashew association has 50 members.
