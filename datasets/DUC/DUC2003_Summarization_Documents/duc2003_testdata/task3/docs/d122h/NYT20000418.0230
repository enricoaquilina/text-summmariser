COMMENTARY: A REAL NUT CASE, OR IS THE WORLD BANK A VILLAIN? 
</HEADLINE>

   When Seattle Man went to Washington, his activities were
coordinated in large part by a Web site, www.a16.org. Browsing the
site, I was struck by the critique of the World Bank, written by
Robert Naiman _ the activist who threw a pie in the face of Michel
Camdessus, the former International Monetary Fund chief, a few
months ago. Naiman's favorite _ indeed only _ example of how
bank-imposed policies inflict economic damage is the way the bank
``destroyed Mozambique's cashew nut processing industry, by forcing
Mozambique to remove export tariffs on raw cashew nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashew nuts? It turns out that this is one of those stories that
anti-globalists tell over and over, part of the canon that
supposedly proves the righteousness of their cause. Such tales
rarely get fact-checked; nobody asks whether the moral of the story
is really as clear-cut as it seems. So let's look at the truth
behind this particular legend.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique's cashews are grown overwhelmingly by small farmers.
The great majority of the country's 19 million people live on the
land; at least a quarter of them grow cashews. Until 1995 farmers
were forced to sell those nuts to a state monopoly at artificially
low prices; the state company then processed the nuts, employing
about 10,000 workers. In 1995 the processing plants were
privatized, bought mainly by foreigners, and the state monopoly was
eliminated. But it was replaced by a stiff export tax levied on
raw, but not processed, nuts. This in effect prevented the farmers
from selling their product on the world market, and forced them to
continue selling cheaply to domestic processers.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank demanded, as a condition for new loans, that this
export tax be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this demand is familiar to anyone who knows
something about the political economy of the Third World. In poor
countries, organized urban workers (and factory owners) typically
have far more political clout than much more numerous but
illiterate and unorganized farmers; the result is an often extreme
policy bias against the countryside. Governments frequently tax the
rural poor to subsidize urban industries _ industries whose workers
are very badly paid by Western standards, but nonetheless receive
much higher wages than most of their compatriots. This case _ in
which peasants were forced to sell their crops cheaply in order to
protect the jobs of 10,000 processing workers _ fits right into the
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   You might try to justify the cashew tax on the grounds that it
promotes industrial development, and will eventually make everyone
better off. (Did someone say ``trickle-down economics''?) But _
again characteristically in such cases _ while processed nuts do
command higher prices than raw nuts, Mozambique's nut-processing
industry requires imported machinery and other inputs, and the tax
on exports discourages raw-nut production. On balance the export
tax almost certainly subtracts from, rather than adds to, the
country's miserably low income.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank is evil, then, because it tried to end a policy
that not only made Mozambique as a whole poorer, but directly hurt
millions of impoverished small farmers. Its high-minded critics
want to keep the prices those farmers receive low, on behalf of
10,000 politically influential workers and a handful of foreign
factory owners. No doubt the faithful will say it ain't so, that
farmers aren't hurt by the export tax because the burden falls on a
mysteriously invisible class of rich middlemen. But why should so
morally dubious a case _ one in which the bank was defending the
interests not of multinational corporations but of starving
peasants _ be a touchstone for the opponents of globalization?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, I believe, is that anti-globalists, though they are
quite sure that international trade hurts poor countries, have an
annoying problem: Most people in those countries want to export
more, not less. So the anti-globalists trumpet one of the few cases
in which a Third World group actually advocates export
restrictions. Somehow nobody notices that this group actually
represents a small, relatively privileged minority, and that its
demands would directly harm a much larger group of even poorer
people.
</P>
<P>
   And thus Seattle Man maintains his comfortable sense of moral
superiority.
