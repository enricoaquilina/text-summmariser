<HEADLINE> Cashew Nut Industry in Mozambique May Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 1 (Xinhua) -- If the Mozambican government
continues the policy of exporting raw cashew nut without
processing, the country's cashew nut industry will stop
production this June, warned Secretary-General Soares Mhaca of
the Central-Sindical Mocambicana here today.
</P>
<P>
To export unprocessed cashew nuts will greatly reduce raw
materials for domesitc cashew nut processing industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mhaca made the remarks today at the International Labour Day
rally. Due to lack of raw materials, the cashew nut processing
industry virtually came to a standstill, thus making 1,800 people
jobless, he said, adding that by June this year, an extra 7,000
people will join the army of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
To liberalise cashew nut prices has been one of the
requirements of the World Bank which imposed many preconditions
on Mozambique in support of its reform of the economic structure
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has implemented strict restrictions on raw cashew
nut exports and used to levy a 20 percent export tax in order to
protect domestic cashew nut processing industry. However, under
the pressure of the World Bank, the raw cashew nut export tax was
reduced to below 14 percent last year, giving an impetus to
export to the detriment of domestic cashew nut processing
industry.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique once recorded an annual cashew nut output of
210,000 tons and there were as many as 12 cashew nut processing
plants. However, it produced only 60,000 tons of cashew nut
last year.
