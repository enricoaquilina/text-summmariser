<HEADLINE> UNDP Designs Emergency Plan for Displaced Landmines in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and the National Institute for Mine
Clearance (IND) in Mozambique Tuesday announced an emergency plan
in response to the problem of landmines displaced by the severe
flooding in the southern African country, UNDP officials said here.
</P>
<P>
The first step of the three months is to identify densely
populated areas at risk of the displaced landmines. Teams of
deminers will be redirected from their regular tasks to collect
data on minefields affected by the floods, and to promote mine
awareness among people in camps for the displaced population.
</P>
<P>
A special team of experts on unexploded ordnance will also be
dispatched to determine the effect of the floods on other
explosives. UNDP and IND will design a new mine action program for
Mozambique, based on the new circumstances caused by the flooding.
</P>
<P>
"The flooding has changed the whole basis for our demining
work in the affected areas," said UNDP Resident Representative
Emmannuel de Casterle.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, mines that were previously marked have been
washed away. Areas that were safe, located downstream from
minefields may now be littered with mines. "They could be one
kilometer downstream, or perhaps 20 kilometers, we just don't know,
" de Casterle said.
</P>
<P>
In Moamba in southern Mozambique, deminers are already
clearing land where the water has receded in order to allow for
reconstruction of a power line and a bridge that was destroyed by
flooding of the Incomati River.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that there are still between one and two
million landmines in Mozambique, hit by the worst floods in 30
years. Last year, 12 people were killed and 48 injured by the
explosives. The landmines were planted during a two-decade civil
war, which ended in 1992.
