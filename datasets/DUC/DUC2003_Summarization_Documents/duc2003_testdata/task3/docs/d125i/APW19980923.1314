	   INSIDE MOZUMI MINE, Japan (AP) _ Researcher Christopher Mauger
admits that doing cutting-edge physics from the end of a mine shaft
deep inside a mountain has its drawbacks.
	   First, there's the unsettling sight of water seeping through
fault lines that crisscross the entrance tunnel. Then there's the
lunches interrupted by the rumbling of dynamite blasts in another
section of the mine.
	   ``That certainly keeps things exciting,'' he says.
	   But to scientists around the world, the real exciting stuff has
been what the international team working out of this old zinc mine
in the Japan Alps north of Tokyo has discovered about one of the
universe's most fundamental components.
	   In June, the 120-person team from Japan, the United States and
Poland stunned their colleagues with strong evidence that subatomic
particles called neutrinos have mass.
	   To the surprise of many researchers here, the announcement was
front-page news around the world. Even U.S. President Bill Clinton
hailed the work at a commencement speech at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology the very next day.
	   ``These kind of findings have implications that are not limited
to the laboratory,'' Clinton said. ``They affect the whole of
society _ not only our economy, but also our very view of life.''
	   Heat of the moment, maybe.
	   The research at Super-Kamiokande certainly has some very broad
implications and marks a major breakthrough in a very, very
difficult game of quantum hide-and-seek.
	   Neutrinos are about as infinitesimal a thing as could be
imagined.
	   They have no electrical charge, can pass through just about
anything and, according to the standard model of particle physics,
should have no mass at all.
	   The Super-Kamiokande experiment research team has shown that
assumption may be wrong. And though the mass of the neutrino is
believed to be extremely tiny, any neutrino mass at all would have
some truly weighty implications.
	   ``If you believe in the Big Bang, a large number of neutrinos
must have been created _ about 300 in every cubic centimeter
throughout the universe,'' said Tokyo University professor Yoji
Totsuka, director of the cosmic ray observatory here.
	   Because of their sheer number, Totsuka said, even a tiny bit of
mass per particle could thus combine to account for a significant
amount of the total weight of the universe.
	   If there is enough mass in the universe, it must at some time
collapse under its own gravity, which has some wild ramifications
for such basic concepts as time and causality. If there isn't
enough mass, the universe could continue expanding forever.
	   ``Particles have the potentiality to determine the fate of the
universe,'' Totsuka said.
	   The earth is constantly showered by neutrinos raining down from
the sun, from collisions with each other particles in the
atmosphere or from the occasional explosion of a distant star. But
scientists are still unable to detect them directly.
	   At Super-Kamiokande, this problem has been resolved in a
virtuoso blend of physics and engineering.
	   Set in the heart of Mount Ikenoyama under 1 kilometer (0.6 mile)
of rock, the center of the facility is a 50,000-ton, cylindrical
tank filled with possibly the purest water in the world and lined
with 11,146 light collecting sensors.
	   Each sensor is so sensitive it can detect a single proton _ the
equivalent of being able to detect from the Earth the light of a
candle on the moon.
	   The mountain's rock barrier blocks virtually everything,
including most subatomic particles, from reaching the detectors.
But neutrinos are so minute they pass right through and enter the
tank at roughly the speed of light.
	   That is how they lose their cloak of invisibility.
	   Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light when light is
traveling through a vacuum. But when light hits the water in the
Super-Kamiokande tank, it is slowed down.
	   The tiny neutrinos keep right on going as fast as before, which
creates a Cherenkov cone, an effect something akin to the shockwave
created by a plane breaking the sound barrier.
	   Researchers, usually grad students like Mauger, of State
University of New York at Stony Brook, pull shifts watching for
these cones on a large screen in Super-Kamiokande's on-site control
room.
	   Each ring-shaped ``hit pattern'' lights up the screen in a
splash of red, orange, green and blue.
	   Fewer than a dozen neutrinos hitting the tank on the average
day. But from each particle, researchers can glean enough
information to determine its direction, how fast it was moving and
other clues to its behavior and composition.
	   Enough neutrinos had been observed since the dlrs 100 million
facility opened in April 1996 for an odd pattern to become clear _
they were oscillating, or changing type, as they moved through
space.
	   And if something oscillates, according to a widely accepted
theory, it must have mass.
	   ``Our results are very firm,'' Totsuka said. ``the response to
them has been very favorable.''
	   Still, researchers don't claim to have really figured out the
neutrino _ or the mysterious world of subatomic particles _ just
yet.
	   ``We are certainly learning more, but the more we learn the
foggier it all gets,'' Mauger said. ``Fortunately, our job isn't to
worry about all the consequences for reality. That is so much more
difficult a question.''
