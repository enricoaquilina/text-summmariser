<P>
   Seven years ago Dr. Yared Kebede Haile worked as a well-paid
physician for an American oil company in his native Ethiopia. He
remembers his American patients with amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would come in with a cold or a mild laceration and demand
antibiotics,'' he said, chuckling over the national idiosyncrasy of
self-treating even the most minor disorder with an array of
over-the-counter medications.
</P>
<P>
   Kebede Haile found his work uninspiring. So he did what most
American doctors would never do: He traded his air-conditioned
office for a volunteer physician assignment that took him to
makeshift clinics and hospitals in war-ravaged Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told how difficult it would be for an African expatriate
who was Christian to work in Afghanistan, a Muslim country,'' said
Kebede Haile, now 32 and studying for his Master of Public Health
(MPH) degree at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead I found the Afghanis were very polite, very friendly
and respectful,'' he said, speaking Tuesday at the Montefiore
Medical Center in New York to promote the work of Medecins Sans
Frontieres (MSF), the Paris-based volunteer organization that
recruited him.
</P>
<P>
   After his three-month assignment in Afghanistan, Kebede Haile
worked for MSF in Uganda and later volunteered in Bangladesh,
Liberia and Ethiopia. His experiences of living in different
countries have been 100-percent positive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt I was not accepted and respected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of MSF's assignments last for a minimum of six months, but
this is a career path that does not come with job security. Last
year, volunteers were expelled from Kabul in Afghanistan, where MSF
had been providing medical services for eight years. And earlier
this month volunteers were evacuated from southern Sudan after
reports that pro-Sudanese government militia were raiding villages
and killing civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Many MSF assignments involve a precarious balancing act of
placating governments that resist volunteers' presence, maintaining
political neutrality and speaking out when atrocities are witnessed
without jeopardizing continuation of programs.
</P>
<P>
   Kebede Haile insists it is not difficult to remain politically
impartial. Nevertheless, the organization has frequently wrestled
with the dichotomy of maintaining neutrality while condemning
injustices. When the group was founded in 1971, its charter forbade
members to talk about what they had witnessed during missions. But
the group has subsequently spoken out about human rights violations
in Cambodia, Afghanistan and Ethiopia, and has even carried out
secret missions in countries where its presence was not welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 MSF established a United States headquarters in New York
with the name Doctors Without Borders. A second office was opened
in Los Angeles, and a drive for donations and volunteers was
initiated. Last year the organization recruited 110 volunteers from
the United States to work in countries as diverse as Sri Lanka,
Guatemala, Bosnia, Vietnam, China and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   But in the four-and-a-half years Kebede Haile has been with MSF
he has been surprised by the fact that American volunteers are
overwhelmingly white.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I have never seen an African-American involved
in [overseas] volunteer work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Kebede Haile this is a statistic that undermines overseas
humanitarian efforts. Doctors Without Borders needs multiracial
teamwork to have credibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without the participation of minority groups, it could be argued
that Doctors Without Borders is vulnerable to misperceptions that
it is just another attempt to alleviate the ``white man's burden.''
</P>
<P>
   With the spotlight on trouble spots like Rwanda, Zaire and
southern Sudan, Kebede Haile is hoping that more black Americans
will consider volunteering in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience with MSF has changed my whole way of thinking. I
have learned so much from other people and other cultures. I
believe everyone can benefit from this experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kebede Haile also wants black Americans to discover the
``other'' side of Africa, a continent ``with a rich culture and
civilization.'' For the most part, Americans' only exposure to
Africa is images of war, famine and devastation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors Without Borders is seeking specialists in internal
medicine, emergency medicine and infectious diseases, general
surgeons and practitioners, anesthesiologists and nurses. A
background in public health is especially desirable. Social
workers, psychiatrists and clinical psychologists are also required
for some assignments. Volunteers with non-medical backgrounds are
also invaluable to operations, especially civil engineers, people
with experience in finance, administration and accounting and those
with expertise in water and sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   The six-month minimum is waived for general surgeons and
anesthesiologists, who are allowed to work for six-week periods.
All volunteers receive paid expenses including accommodation and
modest allowances.
</P>
