   PARIS _ Doctors Without Borders, which sends medical personnel
to some of the most destitute and dangerous parts of the world and
encourages them not only to save lives, but also to condemn the
injustices they see, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Founded here in 1971 as Medecins Sans Frontieres, by a band of
French doctors disillusioned with the neutrality of the Red Cross,
the volunteer group now has more than 2,000 personnel who are
treating the wounded, the sick and the starving in 80 countries,
including 20 war zones.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the group has been expelled from several
countries for denouncing what it saw as wrong. In 1985 it was
banned from Ethiopia for saying the government had diverted aid and
forced migration. In late 1994, the group withdrew from Zaire and
Tanzania and denounced the operation of the refugee camps, because,
it said, the camps were being controlled by Hutu leaders who had
been responsible for the genocide in neighboring Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   In recognizing the work of the organization, the Norwegian Nobel
Committee highlighted the willingness to send volunteers quickly to
scenes of disaster, no matter what the politics of the situation.
It praised the group for drawing the world's attention to the
causes of catastrophes, which ``helps to form bodies of public
opinion opposed to violations and abuses of power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In critical situations marked by violence and brutality, the
humanitarian world of Doctors Without Borders enables the
organization to create openings for contacts between the opposed
parties,'' the citation said. ``At the same time, each fearless and
self-sacrificing helper shows each victim a human face, stands for
respect for that person's dignity, and is a source of hope for
peace and reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the group's modest headquarters here, dozens of workers
gathered to drink Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Phillipe Biberson, the president of the group in France, said
the award was an occasion to shine some light once again on those
his group tried to help: the starving, those living in battle
zones, those suffering from diseases like malaria that rarely get
the world's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are not sure that words can save,'' Biberson said, ``We
do know that silence kills.''
</P>
<P>
   One in four of the doctors who travel with the group to trouble
spots each year are French, though in recent years volunteers from
45 other countries have taken part.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors and nurses, who get a stipend of about $750 a month,
often work under extreme conditions. For instance, in Angola this
year they have maintained a clinic in Kuito, a town that has been
repeatedly cut off by rebel fighters. While some of the work is in
hot spots like Kosovo, many of the projects are far out of the
limelight: family planning in Armenia, basic health care in Haiti,
care for the homeless in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the agency has also pulled off some logistical
triumphs. In 1995, for example, in response to a meningitis
epidemic in Nigeria, staff members vaccinated 4 million people in
just three months.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Nobel Peace Prize was first awarded in 1901, 18 other
organizations have been named as winners or co-winners. These have
included the International Red Cross, International Physicians for
the Prevention of Nuclear War and Amnesty International. The most
recent was the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which
shared the award in 1997 with its coordinator, Jody Williams of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel officials said there were 136 nominees for the prize this
year, of which 101 were individuals and 35 were organizations. The
committee members are highly guarded about their deliberations and
rarely let slip any advance word on the winner. But nominees for
the prize are often identified publicly by the individuals and
organization that put the candidates forward.
</P>
<P>
   On that basis, Norwegian newspapers have reported the
nominations of President Clinton, President Ezer Weizman Israel and
two Chinese dissidents, Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Oslo newspaper Dagbladet claimed it had learned
that the 1999 prize would be shared by the Chinese dissidents. The
false report spurred Chinese officials here to protest the supposed
choice with the Norwegian government, though the government has
nothing to do with the selection.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Doctors Without Borders is not expected to help
along some delicate peace process. But Francis Sejersted, the
chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said the committee hoped
it would inspire this and similar organizations to step up their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is growing need for humanitarian organizations of this
kind in today's world,'' he said, singled out the group's
commitment to Africa because the misery there often fades from
public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the agency, like many others, has complained of
growing difficulty in raising funds. On Friday officials there said
they would probably simply put the prize money _ nearly $1 million
_ into their budget.
</P>
<P>
   It is also more difficult to find volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many doctors today are facing economical constraints,'' said
Dr. Marc Gastellu Etchegorry, the group's medical director.
``Taking six months off when they have school bills to pay is hard.
And, yes, some of them are thinking more about playing golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The group grew out of the frustration of a group of young
doctors who worked for the Red Cross and treated the starving in
Biafra at the end of the 1960s. But Red Cross confidentiality
prevented them from speaking out. They organized themselves in 1971
in the aftermath of severe flooding in Bangladesh (then East
Pakistan). Poorly equipped and perhaps a little too media-hungry,
they were dismissed by some aid agencies as cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   That criticism is long gone now. But some aid agencies still
scorn Doctors Without Borders for its cozy relationship with the
news media and its sometimes glitzy image of attractive young
doctors in the field. It is sometimes cattily referred to by its
rivals as ``Publicite sans Limite'' (Publicity Without Limit).
</P>
<P>
   But many of the group's founders insist that speaking out about
atrocities would help prevent them. Bernard Kouchner, one of the
founders and now the senior U.N. representative in Kosovo, said
Friday that agencies like Medecins Sans Frontieres would help make
massacres impossible in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important that MSF does not offer shelter for
disgraceful acts and suffering,'' Kouchner said. ``We need to
convince people that the suffering of one man was the
responsibility of all men. This work is not done, far from it.''
