   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three weeks ago, when someone started stalking
homeless people here, bending over them as they slept in the alleys
and doorways and slashing their throats, a grim joke began making
the rounds on the streets: the killer had been hired by the city.
</P>
<P>
   After all, didn't the mayor call the city's homeless problem
``intractable'' and vow in his State of the City address last month
to clear the homeless from public places?
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured the slasher was the one way to get us off the
sidewalks,'' said Donald Behr, one of two homeless men leaning
against the wall of a downtown Subway delicatessen early Thursday
morning. He and his friend slapped their knees at the humor of it.
</P>
<P>
   At least they can afford to laugh. Early Tuesday, the police
arrested a man in connection with a knife attack on a homeless man
who had been sleeping in a Chinatown alley, and they say they have
linked the suspect to the three other attacks on homeless people in
the city, including the killing of a longtime homeless woman named
Shirley Dillahunt, whom, it is said, everyone loved.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrest of the suspect, a 21-year-old Oakland man named
Joshua Rudiger, who was said to have told the police that he was a
vampire who drank his victims' blood, is unlikely to cool the
debate that the slashings have rekindled in this live-and-let-live
city over what to do about all the people with no place to call
home.
</P>
<P>
   The gallows humor that the slashings have inspired reflects the
magnitude of the homeless problem and how it has emerged as a major
issue for Mayor Willie Brown, particularly as the homeless have
become increasingly visible.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was considered one of the last of the liberal mayors
when he was elected three years ago, has enraged advocates for the
homeless with his policies, starting with a decision last year to
have the police forcibly remove hundreds of homeless people from
Golden Gate Park. The anger was refueled with the city's latest
plan to divert homeless people from four tourist zones into
shelters and to arrest those disobeying the law.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, the mayor was bombarded with three pies by a group
calling itself the Bionic Baking Brigade, which said it wanted to
call attention to the city's lack of solutions to the homeless
problem. Meanwhile, members of the Coalition for the Homeless say
that this city, of all cities, should know that the homeless need
treatment programs, jobs and housing, and that sweeping them off
the streets and giving them jail time is no solution.
</P>
<P>
   One point on which all agree is that there are incredible
numbers of homeless people on the city's streets. They huddle in
doorways near the fanciest hotels of Nob Hill, sleep on the benches
near all the big department stores on Union Square, camp out by the
hundreds in the plaza by the Civic Center and crowd the corners of
Haight-Ashbury. Some panhandle politely, rudely, quietly, loudly.
Some talk to no one, or to everyone, or to themselves.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On any night, there may be 16,000 people on the streets here,
twice as many as 10 years ago, giving San Francisco, the 13th
largest city in the country, the third-largest population of
homeless people, after New York and Los Angeles, according to the
Coalition for the Homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The common wisdom is that the city's weather and its reputation
for tolerance have brought homeless people here from elsewhere. But
the weather is not always great. It rains three months a year,
starting now, and the rain is not soft and sunny, as it is in
Southern California, but mean and cold, the kind that sends the
tourists packing and the commuters straight home from work. Paul
Boden, director of the Coalition for the Homeless and a board
member of the National Coalition for the Homeless, said the notion
that people moved to a place to be homeless was a myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of one city in the country that doesn't say that
it's a magnet and that homeless people come from somewhere else,''
Boden said. ``Fargo, N.D., was calling itself a magnet. It's kind
of sad, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's homeless, like the homeless everywhere, Boden
said, are usually longtime residents. About a third are mentally
ill, a third are drug addicts (or some mixture of the two) and the
rest have been displaced from their homes through a series of
personal misfortunes _ rising rents, loss of income and the like.
While the numbers of homeless are increasing all over the nation,
largely because of a decrease in federal benefits and public
housing, Boden said, San Francisco's problem is exacerbated by its
soaring housing prices, the highest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the worst I've ever seen it, and I've been
doing this 16 years,'' Boden said. ``We have 62 detox beds in the
city and 1,200 people on the waiting list. We have 1,800 shelter
beds and 140 families on the waiting list. The city doesn't even
keep waiting lists for singles.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, with $60 million budgeted for homeless-related services,
has introduced job training programs and put into effect an $11
million on-demand drug treatment program. But waiting lists are
long for that, too. Meanwhile, last Friday, the city began a police
crackdown on those caught drinking, urinating, defecating or
sleeping on the sidewalks, a mandate that would include just about
all the homeless. Those arrested for public drunkenness three times
within 60 days will face 30 days in jail unless they enroll in a
substance abuse program. But there is no guarantee that they will
get a bed in such a program if they want one, in which case they
will simply be cited and released.
</P>
<P>
   The city's homelessness coordinator, Terry Hill, said he was
working on a range of solutions, both short- and long-term, for
people in dire straits.
</P>
<P>
   Behr, who has lived on and off the streets in Oakland and San
Francisco for five years, said he was one of that group. He said he
became homeless when his wife kicked him out of their apartment in
Oakland after he developed a cocaine habit and was dismissed from
his job. ``Half the people you step over have the same problem,''
he said. ``And there are more of us today than there used to be _
that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend, who would not give his name, said he was a drug
addict with ``mental problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I need help,'' he said. ``But when I'm feeling good and go to
get help, they tell me I don't need it. Then, when I go crazy, I'm
too crazy to get help.'' At that, he and Behr laughed and laughed.
