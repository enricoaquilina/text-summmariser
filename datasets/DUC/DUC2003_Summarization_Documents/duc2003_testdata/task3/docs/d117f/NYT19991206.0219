HOMELESS PROBLEM IS ACUTE IN SAN FRANCISCO

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Perhaps no city offers a more public example of
the problems of homelessness than San Francisco. The biggest
complaint visitors lodge about the city concerns the aggressive
panhandling and other manifestations of homelessness that they
experience, say city tourist officials. The No. 1 problem in the
city, according to a recent poll by The San Francisco Chronicle, is
homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Why? In the last three years, an overflow of Silicon Valley
professionals has moved in, sending the demand for housing, and
prices, to record levels. The average price of a three-bedroom
house is $720,000; the average rent on a small two-bedroom
apartment is $2,000, and rooms in single-room occupancy hotels are
$450 a month and up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 90,000 households here earn less than $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the city has lost more than 1,200 units
in single-room occupancy hotels to fires and conversions to
apartments. Several hundred more apartments have been lost to
landlords who have evicted all tenants under a state law that
allows them to do so if they take the buildings off the market for
at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   With the housing vacancy rate at 1 percent, finding a place to
live is extremely difficult even for those who can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, with a population of 750,000, has an estimated
12,000 to 15,000 people who are homeless and 1,500 shelter beds.
More than 1,200 people are on a waiting list for drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, with a population of about 7.5 million, city
data show that more than 80,000 different people use the city's
shelter system in an average year. About 23,000 homeless people use
the shelters on any given night.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco says it spends $60 million a year on the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Of 10,000 people who were on a waiting list last year for
housing vouchers from the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 5,000 to 6,000 received them, but 44 percent had to
return them when they could not find apartments they could afford
within four months. More than 14,500 people are on a waiting list
for public housing.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown blames the homeless situation on years of
cutbacks in federal money for housing and mental-health services,
and many homeless advocates agree.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Congress approved $1.02 billion for homeless
programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development for 2000, up from $975 million this year and $823
million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget marked the first time that financing for homeless
programs had reached $1 billion since 1995. The budget that year
was $1.12 billion, the highest since Congress enacted the Stewart
B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act in 1987 in response to a public
outcry over homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the agency's overall budget for housing is far less than it
was 25 years ago. In 1978 the department's budget was $38 billion
and about 400,000 new families received housing subsidies each
year. But by 1995, when housing subsidies were eliminated
altogether, the department's s budget was $20 billion. The
subsidies were restored this year.
