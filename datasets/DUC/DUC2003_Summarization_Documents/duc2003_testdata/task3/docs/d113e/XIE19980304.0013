<HEADLINE> Clinton's Close Friend Testifying in Lewinsky Matter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Vernon Jordan, a close friend
of U.S. President Bill Clinton, Tuesday appeared before a federal
grand jury investigating accusations that Clinton asked former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky to deny their alleged affair.
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the U.S. District Court Tuesday morning, Jordan
refused to answer reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
White House Press secretary Mike McCurry said "luckily, someone
who knows the facts" will be testifying. He described Jordan as
a "truthful and honest man."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the truth will help the president, McCurry said,
"Absolutely."
</P>
<P>
McCurry denied the Lewinsky case had strained the friendship
between Clinton and Jordan, but he said they no longer discuss it
for legal reasons.
</P>
<P>
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr is investigating why Jordan
helped Lewinsky get a job while she was providing an affidavit in
Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Jordan had said Clinton and Lewinsky assured him there
was no sexual relationship between them, and that Clinton's
private secretary, Betty Currie, asked him to help Lewinsky find a
job.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's attorney, William Ginsburg, reportedly said his
client sought Jordan's help in early November, before she knew she
would be a witness in the Jones case.
