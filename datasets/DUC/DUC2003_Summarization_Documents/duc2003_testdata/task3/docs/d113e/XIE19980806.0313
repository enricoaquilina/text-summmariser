<HEADLINE> Monica Lewinsky Reportedly to Testimony Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky is prepared to testify to grand jurors -- probably
on Thursday -- in the White House scandal, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Security at the courthouse where the grand jury meets was
notably heightened in preparation for the expected testimony of
Lewinsky, who is at the center of the sex and perjury allegations.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky, who has been preparing for her testimony with her own
lawyers and members of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's legal
team, was to meet with prosecutors on Wednesday. She will testify
under a grant of immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
News reports quoted unidentified sources as saying her
testimony, though not absolutely confirmed for Thursday, was "99
percent" sure to be on that date.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky is the star witness in the investigation that has even
brought talk of possible impeachment, particularly over
suggestions that U.S. President Bill Clinton obstructed justice by
trying to hide an affair, allegedly carried on in the White House.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky reportedly is prepared to testify that she and Clinton
had a sexual relationship and that, while she was never explicitly
told to lie about it, it was understood that the affair would be
kept quiet.
</P>
<P>
Both Clinton and Lewinsky have denied the affair under oath in
statements in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, and Clinton
has said publicly he never asked anyone to lie.
</P>
<P>
One piece of evidence -- a dark blue dress -- provided by
Lewinsky allegedly has a stain that was being analyzed by FBI
technicians for physical evidence that could link it to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton, who is scheduled to testimony by video to
the grand jury on August 17, is keeping a busy political agenda
and met with the House Democratic Caucus to discuss Social
Security, health care and education. The scandal was not mentioned
and Clinton was warmly received.
