<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Rejects Live Testimony from Monica Lewinsky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate moved
Thursday to bring President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial to a
prompt conclusion, rejecting a last-ditch request by House
prosecutors to summon former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
for live testimony.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senate Republicans also shrank from a plan to
declare Clinton guilty without ousting him from office.
</P>
<P>
With 25 Republicans joining Democrats, the Senate rejected,
70-30, the prosecutors' request to issue a subpoena requiring the
young woman at the center of the impeachment drama to testify in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
With support from several Democrats, however, Senate
Republicans approved the House prosecutors' request to show at the
trial this weekend "all or portions" of the videotaped depositions
of Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon Jordan and White House
adviser Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and White House lawyers would have up to three
hours each to show portions of those videotapes on Saturday before
the two sides begin closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in the two
articles of impeachment in connection with his relationship with
Lewinsky. The two articles were approved by the House along
partisan lines on December 19 last year.
