<HEADLINE> Clinton Taped Testimony Aired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Television stations in the
United States Monday began broadcasting a four-hour videotape of
President Bill Clinton's testimony before a grand jury on August
17.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee released
the videotape in the morning, along with over 3,000 pages of
Monica Lewinsky case evidence. Transmission of Clinton's
testimony began 12 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Clinton gave the testimony from the Map Room of the White House
by video link to a court house.
</P>
<P>
People who have seen the testimony say that investigators from
the office of special prosecutor Kenneth Starr rile the president
with repeated requests for details of his sexual activities with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary Committee simultaneously released thousands of
pages of written evidence from the Lewinsky case, including
Lewinsky's own account of her sexual encounters with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Republicans, who dominate the House of Representatives, say the
American people have the right to see the tape, to judge for
themselves whether Clinton lied to the grand jury. Many Democrats
say that the motive of the Republicans is to embarrass the
president.
