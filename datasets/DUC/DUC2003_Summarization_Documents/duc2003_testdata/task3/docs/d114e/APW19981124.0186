British minister warns Czech army not yet compatible with NATO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Britain's defense minister praised
the Czech Republic on Tuesday for progress toward NATO membership,
but said its army has a long way to go to match up to alliance
standards.
	   ``Full interoperability will take some time after accession,''
George Robertson told journalists after talks with his Czech
counterpart, Vladimir Vetchy.
	   Robertson said Britain, as one of the Czechs' closest allies,
has prepared an ambitious program designed to assist the Czech army
with such tasks as language courses and training exercises.
	   The Czech military has often been criticized for being
underequipped and having low prestige. Other shortcomings include
inadequate knowledge of foreign laguages and corruption.
	   The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary this year became the
first former Soviet Bloc nations to be offered membership in the
alliance. Expansion likely will take place in 1999, pending
expected ratification by the parliaments of all current NATO
members and the parliaments of the future members.
