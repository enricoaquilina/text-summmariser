   WASHINGTON _ FBI Director Louis Freeh, believing his agency's
credibility is in question, wants someone from outside the bureau
to examine whether his agents helped set the deadly blaze at the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco in 1993, an agency spokesman
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh believes the FBI cannot credibly investigate itself
following the agency's belated admission that it might have used
pyrotechnic devices in storming the cult's facility after a 51-day
standoff with group leader David Koresh and his followers, said
spokesman Tron Brekke.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who had denied for six years that
the FBI used incendiary material, has called for an investigation
to ``get to the truth'' of what munitions the FBI fired during its
April 19 raid on Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has met with Freeh regarding how the Branch Davidian
probe should be conducted, has not decided if someone inside or
outside the Justice Department should handle the inquiry. Brekke
declined to say whether Freeh had made his position clear to Reno,
his superior at the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be better to have an outside group do the investigation
so there can be no question of conflict of interest or
impartiality,'' Brekke said in describing Freeh's opinion. ``We
understand the need to do a complete, thorough and impartial
investigation .... Our interest here is in getting to the bottom of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between Reno and Freeh followed the FBI's
acknowledgment last Wednesday that its agents might have used a
``very limited number'' of flammable military gas canisters to
penetrate the roof of an underground bunker away from the main
Branch Davidian building. These canisters ``may have contained a
substance that is designed to disperse the gas using a pyrotechnic
mixture,'' the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 75 cult members, including Koresh, were killed by
gunfire and the fire that erupted during the raid. An earlier
federal investigation concluded that some Branch Davidians shot
fellow members and deliberately set the fire during the siege, but
leading Republican lawmakers say that investigation is now tainted.
</P>
<P>
   House Government Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Dan
Burton, R-Ind. and a vocal critic of Reno, plans to subpoena the
White House, Justice Department and Pentagon on Wednesday for any
documents and evidence related to the FBI's possible use of
pyrotechnic devices at Mount Carmel, committee spokesman Mark
Corallo said. Burton, who plans to hold hearings this fall on the
siege, has already subpoenaed the Texas Rangers and the U.S.
attorney's office in Waco for information, Corallo added.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon will be asked for information related to reports
that members of the Army's elite Delta Force anti-terrorism unit
were at the scene of the raid, Corallo said. The Defense Department
has said three military observers were at Mount Carmel but had no
operational involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah and a
presidential candidate, agreed with Freeh that an independent
investigation is needed. The senator said he expects to hold
hearings on the siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must determine whether this was a cover-up or a negligent
oversight,'' the senator said. ``There must be an independent
inquiry of this matter because the credibility of this Justice
Department is at an all-time low.''
