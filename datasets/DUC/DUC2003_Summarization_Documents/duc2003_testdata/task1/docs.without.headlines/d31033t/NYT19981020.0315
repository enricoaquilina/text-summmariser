   WASHINGTON _ Stinging from the government's opening statement, a
defiant Microsoft Corp. forcefully defended its chairman, Bill
Gates, in federal court on Tuesday, asserting that the
no-holds-barred tactics of his company are not only common in the
computer industry but also good for economy.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's opening salvo in the sweeping antitrust suit was
crafted as much for public opinion as for the court. The company
faces weeks of being portrayed as an alleged commercial predator in
a highly publicized trial, which could badly tarnish Microsoft's
reputation even if it wins.
</P>
<P>
   The government's case, which opened on Monday in the U.S.
District Court here, amounts to a litany of episodes of Microsoft's
having used its market power to bully and bend competitors,
business partners and corporate customers to its will.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Microsoft's legal team sought to frame these
episodes as part of rough-and-tumble capitalism. While the way
Microsoft does business may not be to everyone's liking, they
suggested, it is certainly not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The antitrust laws are not a code of civility in business,''
said John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In his two-hour opening statement, Warden angrily accused the
government of trying to ``demonize Bill Gates,'' whom he described
as ``a man whose vision and innovation have been at the core of the
benefits that society is reaping from the information age.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft, Warden
said, are misinterpreting routine business meetings in the computer
industry as anticompetitive conspiracies. The government's case
focuses largely on the Internet software market and the business
practices Microsoft used in its fight against the Netscape
Communications Corp., the early leader in the browser software used
to navigate the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   A key charge in the suit, for example, is that Microsoft prodded
Netscape to illegally divide up the browser market in a June 1995
meeting _ a charge based mainly on the accounts of Netscape
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape's account of this meeting was fantastical,'' Warden
said. ``None of the histrionics, shouting and table pounding
occurred. It's fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Microsoft's view, the government's case is wrongheaded
because it does not understand the computer industry, especially
the necessity of cooperation among companies so that sophisticated
technology products work with each other. Just as the line between
one software product and another often blurs, the company argues,
so does the line between competition and cooperation; rivals in one
area routinely cooperate in another.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will attempt to cast doubt on several of the
government's allegations by characterizing meetings as efforts at
cooperation by companies that, understandably, do not always agree.
</P>
<P>
   The government, for example, has alleged that Microsoft tried to
pressure both the Intel Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. to back off
Internet software efforts than conflicted with Microsoft's plans _
and to support Microsoft in the browser war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those proposals and threats claimed by the government,''
Warden said, ``will be shown by evidence to have been
garden-variety commercial discussions between companies developing
complementary products. They are of no antitrust consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   As the defendant, Microsoft does not have to prove that it
behaved innocently or even ethically. Instead, the role of
Microsoft's legal team is to cast considerable doubt on the
government's case _ both its specific allegations of bullying
tactics and its broad theme that the economy and consumers are
ultimately harmed by Microsoft's behavior.

<P>
   In the afternoon court session, the Microsoft defense moved to
the cross-examination of the government's lead-off witness, James
Barksdale, the president and chief executive of Netscape. To speed
up the trial, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has ordered that direct
testimony from witnesses for both sides must be submitted in
writing beforehand. So all the courtroom questioning of witnesses
begins with cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   With Barksdale on the stand, Microsoft's legal tactics soon
became apparent. Warden, a detailed, methodical interrogator,
sought to portray Netscape as a Microsoft rival that went running
to the Justice Department as a business tactic.
</P>
<P>
   His questions also tried to lead Barksdale into admitting that
all software makers are constantly adding new features to their
products and that many companies have large shares of their markets
without being branded a monopolist _ central themes of Microsoft's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   A lean, craggy 55-year-old executive who speaks with the accent
of his native Louisiana, Barksdale proved an elusive and often
entertaining witness. Warden asked Barksdale about the early years
of his career when he worked as a salesman for the IBM Corp. from
1965 to 1972, years when IBM faced the kind of antitrust scrutiny
Microsoft faces today.
</P>
<P>
   Warden asked Barksdale if he believed the then-dominant IBM was
a monopolist. ``I don't know if I believed it,'' Barksdale replied,
``but we were trained to behave as if we were a monopoly because we
were operating under a consent decree,'' as Microsoft is today.
</P>
<P>
   Warden then asked Barksdale if he did not believe that the
dominant product of that day _ the IBM mainframe computer _ was not
a so-called bundled product of hardware and software that customers
had to buy together.
</P>
<P>
   The question relates to the current case because the government
alleges that Microsoft's Windows operating system and its Internet
Explorer browser are in fact two products bundled together for the
purpose of forcing customers who want its industry-standard
operating system to also take its browser. Microsoft says the
browser is a feature of its Windows operating system, and thus a
single product.
</P>
<P>
   To the mainframe question, Barksdale replied that IBM mainframe
hardware and software was sold as a bundle but that a 1968 consent
decree forced IBM to also sell them separately _ very similar to
the unbundling remedy that the government is seeking in the current
Microsoft case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That forced unbundling gave rise to a whole new industry of
hardware companies like Amdahl that made mainframe machines that
run IBM mainframe software,'' Barksdale said.
</P>
<P>
   To try to show that Netscape viewed a government suit as a
competitive tactic, Warden repeatedly questioned Barksdale about
his meetings with Justice Department officials including Joel
Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust
division.
</P>
<P>
   Warden produced a document for presentation at a Netscape
strategy meeting, titled the ``Project Rocket Launch Plan.'' At the
meeting, held early this year, one of four items under the heading
``The Situation'' was ``DOJ and court actions create opportunity
for Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden then asked Barksdale whether he viewed a Justice
Department suit as a ``key'' opportunity for his company. Not a key
one perhaps, Barksdale replied, but he did view a government
antitrust suit against Microsoft as ``a way of protecting an
opportunity to keep the playing field open for Internet software.''
