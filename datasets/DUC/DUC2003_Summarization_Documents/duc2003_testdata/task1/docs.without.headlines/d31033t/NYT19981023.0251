   WASHINGTON _ The New Economy is on trial here along with
Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the company is the one in the dock. But the outcome of the
case against Microsoft will establish the ground rules for how the
doctrine of antitrust will apply to high-technology fields like
computer software. And the software industry is seen as being at
the forefront of new patterns of behavior by workers, companies and
markets that define the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the New Economy, people live on Internet time and product
cycles are measured in months, not years. It is the slice of the
economy driven by entrepreneurs, stock options and network effects.
Silicon Valley is its headquarters, with subsidiaries in Seattle,
Austin and elsewhere. It is the future, its proponents insist,
coming to your home soon.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft wins, the digital age will unfold as a free-fire
zone of let-'er-rip capitalism, for better or worse. If Microsoft
loses, courts or the antitrust watchdogs may be getting their oars
into such complex matters as product design, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Let the courts decide. But for an analytic examination of
struggle and competition at the edge of the New Economy today, a
new book, ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and
Its Battle with Microsoft'' (The Free Press), offers some
intriguing insights. The book, written by Michael A. Cusumano, a
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan
School of Management, and David B. Yoffie, a professor at the
Harvard Business School, was placed in evidence at the Microsoft
trial last week.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, Microsoft points to passages in the book in
which executives of Netscape Communications are quoted speaking
candidly about their missteps. Microsoft calls these statements
proof that Netscape's travails in the Internet browser market were
its own doing, not because Microsoft was acting like a nasty
monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the book as a whole reads as a coming-of-age account of the
triumphs and setbacks of a fast-moving Internet pioneer daring or
foolish enough to take on the dominant company in computing.
Netscape's experience teaches as much about what hasn't changed as
what has.
</P>
<P>
   A fundamental lesson is that even revolutionary technologies
take time to cause a revolution. No matter how great the tail wind
of hype and venture capital, the Next Big Thing takes time to
change the practices and habits of companies and people. ``Netscape
got too ambitious and too wedded to the belief that the Internet
revolution would change everything tomorrow,'' Yoffie explained.
</P>
<P>
   The threat Netscape posed to Microsoft was that its browser
could serve as an alternative ``platform'' to Microsoft's Windows.
In other words, the browser could take the place of Windows as the
first thing users see when they start their computers and as the
departure point from which applications could be started.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes a long time for a new computing platform to catch
hold, as thousands of software programmers gradually become
converts and write applications that work with the new platform. By
often and publicly declaring that it was going to challenge
Microsoft head-on, Netscape aroused the software giant, which
trailed in Internet software. ``Netscape had the perfect Trojan
horse,'' Yoffie said. ``But it woke up the enemy before it was
entrenched.''
</P>
<P>
   As it matured, Netscape also found that while the speed of
product development was important, so was traditional product
quality. Netscape's freewheeling ``hacker culture'' fostered
flexibility and creativity _ one Netscape manager quoted in the
book described its development style as ``slightly out of control''
_ but also led to buggy software, a nuisance that became
problematic with more sales to quality-conscious corporations.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year or so, the authors note, Netscape has made
strides in quality, hiring testers and increasing its use of
automated testing software. Netscape has increased its ratio of
testers to developers from one-to-five to one-to-three, though it
still trails Microsoft's one-to-one ratio. ``You can be fast and
flexible in software development, but you have to pay the price in
testing,'' Cusumano said.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape's future is by no means assured. But for all the talk
at the trial about Microsoft trying to crush it, Netscape has done
a good job of changing its strategy to avoid tackling Microsoft
head-on whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   What Netscape, the Internet pioneer, has learned _ setting aside
the legal issues _ is precisely what the pioneers of the
personal-computer revolution learned. They declared that their
technology would change the world, but the process works in the
other direction, too. For a breakthrough technology to move into
the mainstream, it must become more mainstream _ easier, more
reliable and more useful for the workaday chores of the economy. It
does not change everything overnight.
