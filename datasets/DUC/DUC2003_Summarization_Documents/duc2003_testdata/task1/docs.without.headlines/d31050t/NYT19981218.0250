   BEIJING _ In a pointed speech delivered to Communist Party
members in the Great Hall of the People, President Jiang Zemin made
clear Friday that China's economic reforms were not a prelude to
Western-style multiparty democracy and that those who challenged
the party's supremacy would be quashed.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the speech was intended to commemorate the 20th
anniversary of the Communist Party meeting that marked the
beginning of the reforms. But it also provided a vigorous, if
indirect, defense of the government's recent decision to try three
of the country's most prominent democracy activists on criminal
charges for their efforts to organize an opposition political
party.
</P>
<P>
   The trials of Wang Youcai and Qin Youming opened on Thursday.
They are accused of inciting subversion of the state, charges that
carry a minimum prison sentence of five years on conviction,
although neither trial has come to a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday the family of China's most senior dissident, Xu
Wenli, another organizer of the opposition party, was told that he
would stand trial on Monday, facing an even more serious charge of
subverting state power, which could bring a sentence of life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Xu has been detained since Nov. 30, after the police raided his
house and confiscated documents about the new opposition group, the
China Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   While vowing to move ahead with economic reforms, Jiang's speech
was more conservative politically than others he has made this
year. Again and again he invoked Communist Party dogma, using
phrases rarely uttered in the last year, like the ``four cardinal
principles.'' Those state that the leadership of the Communist
Party, adherence to the socialist path and the upholding of Mao
Zedong Thought and of Marxism-Leninism must serve as the foundation
for the country.
</P>
<P>
   During President Clinton's state visit in the summer, the world
saw President Jiang, agile international political leader, in
action. Friday he was once again General Secretary Jiang, Communist
Party stalwart.
</P>
<P>
   China's current political system ``must not be shaken, weakened
or discarded at any time,'' Jiang said, adding, ``The Western mode
of political systems must never be copied.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he said, ``We must be vigilant against infiltration,
subversive activities and separatist activities of international
and domestic hostile forces.'' China must ``fight against factors
disrupting social stability and nip them in the bud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's remarks on these topics echoed points made two weeks ago
by Li Peng, the former prime minister who now heads the National
People's Congress, in a rare interview with the German business
newspaper Handelsblatt.
</P>
<P>
   Li is usually associated with the more conservative faction of
the party. But Friday, as China is facing harsh criticism from
human rights groups and Western governments over its treatment of
the China Democratic Party's leaders, the same admonitions came
directly from Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang also said China should not rely too heavily on foreign
countries to boost its economic development, and he acknowledged
that the party had made some ``mistakes'' that had left citizens
dissatisfied. Presumably that was a reference to the millions of
layoffs caused by a shift toward a market economy, and to the
resulting demonstrations that have become commonplace in smaller
Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
   But it was, at heart, a back-to-basics talk, a reminder that
even though many of China's citizens wear tailored suits and tote
cellular phones, and even though its billboard-lined thoroughfares
resemble streets in the West, the country remains a one-party
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the founding members of the China Democratic
Party, a small, loose network of activists from all over the
country, hoped that there might be room for political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Heartened by the relatively open discourse that surrounded the
Clinton visit and later by China's decision to sign the
International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, the
dissidents have repeatedly tried to register their fledgling party
as a government-recognized social organization.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, the official response has moved quickly
from neglect, to polite rebuff, to detention, to this week's
trials.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what will happen to the three men being tried or
the many other Democratic Party members who have been detained as
they have sought to protest the criminal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   At the trials of Wang in Hang-zhou and Qin in Wuhan, neither man
was represented by a lawyer, although allowed by Chinese law,
because prospective lawyers were intimidated or detained by local
officials, their families said.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-and-a-half-hour court session Friday, Wang defended
himself. No defense has yet been presented for Qin.
</P>
<P>
   Xu, who will go on trial on Monday in Beijing, has been given a
court-appointed lawyer, his wife said. Xu has already spent more
than 10 years in prison. His indictment accuses him of organizing
the China Democratic Party, accepting money from abroad, calling
for independent trade unions and making subversive statements in
interviews with foreign news organizations.
