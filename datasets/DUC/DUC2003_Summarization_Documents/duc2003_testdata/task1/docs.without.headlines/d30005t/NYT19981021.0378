   NEW YORK _ Several months after the bombing of the World Trade
Center in February 1993, one of the suspects tried to bargain with
federal prosecutors in New York, offering inside information about
the bomb plot in exchange for a lighter sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The deal never materialized, and the defendant was eventually
found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. But the details he
offered in that secret meeting about his Brooklyn-based circle of
Arab militants are resonating today in another terrorism case.
</P>
<P>
   The accused bomber told prosecutors that he had twice turned to
a Texas acquaintance named Wadih el Hage to buy weapons for his
Brooklyn associates. Last month, el Hage was arrested on charges of
being part of the Osama bin Laden terror network that is suspected
of the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug.
7.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how federal investigators followed up the tip
about el Hage that they received in 1993. But after the embassy
bombings, it is evident that they are ascribing new significance to
el Hage's contacts with the Brooklyn militants who figured not only
in the World Trade Center case, but also in the assassination of
Rabbi Meir Kahane in 1990 and a conspiracy to blow up the United
Nations and other New York landmarks in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the government recently asserted for the first time that
the roots of bin Laden's organization could be traced, in part, to
a sparsely furnished office on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn that was
called Alkifah Refugee Center and had for many years been a
gathering place for that same fringe group of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not said what role, if any, bin Laden is
supposed to have played in the activities of Alkifah Center. Nor
have they said how the center, which has been closed for about five
years, relates to his global campaign to attack Americans overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But in the government's version so far, bin Laden's far-flung
network is presented as a tapestry of personal relationships
between men of different nationalities and backgrounds who share
his determination to rid the Islamic world of American influence.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, prosecutors now suggest, such
relationships evolved from Alkifah Refugee Center.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s the strip of Arab restaurants and Islamic
bookstores on Atlantic Avenue, between Third and Fourth streets,
was the first port of call for many immigrants from the Middle East
and North Africa. Notices posted in the shops advertised jobs,
rooms for rent and religious activities for Arabic-speaking
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   Alkifah Center, in those years, was a neighborhood hub. It
started out as a desk in Al Farooq Mosque around 1986 and then
moved into a small apartment in a building a few doors away at 566
Atlantic Ave., above what is now a perfume factory, with just
enough room for a desk, a few chairs, a phone and a fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   The center's stated purpose was to raise money and recruit
fighters to help the U.S.-backed Afghan mujahedeen, who rebelled
against the Communist government in Afghanistan after an invasion
by the Soviet Union in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   People in the neighborhood who remember Alkifah Center say it
appeared to be a shoestring operation, although court papers
suggest that tens of thousands of dollars flowed through its bank
accounts in its heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   It was this ramshackle office that the government says evolved
into the American outpost of bin Laden's international terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The center was set up by Mustafa Shalabi, an Egyptian immigrant.
As his former neighbors recall him, Shalabi was infused with the
same religious fervor for the Afghan cause that galvanized many
young Muslims who regarded it as a holy war to liberate a Muslim
country from Communist domination.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who answered the call to fight in Afghanistan was
Mahmud Abouhalima, who was active in militant Islamic movements in
his native Egypt before moving to West Germany in 1981 and to New
York four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Abouhalima would later become a well-known figure in New York as
one of the men accused in the World Trade Center bombing. Shortly
after his arrest in that case, he met with government investigators
without his lawyer and provided a detailed account of Alkifah
Refugee Center and its internecine rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   He recounted his brief stint with the mujahedeen in Afghanistan
and told of traveling with a Palestinian man he knew as Mohammed
Odeh to Peshawar, in northern Pakistan, the staging area for the
Afghan rebels. Abouhalima said they had spent two and a half months
in separate training camps, learning how to use AK-47 assault
rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.
</P>
<P>
   Later, they joined a militia unit and fought against Soviet
forces with the American-financed mujahedeen.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that remain unclear, prosecutors rebuffed
Abouhalima's offer of cooperation. But his mention of Odeh is
intriguing in light of more recent events.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian man with a similar name and background, Mohammed
Saddiq Odeh, has been charged with driving the truck that delivered
the bomb in the attack on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. He has
pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials declined to say whether the Odeh charged in
the embassy attack this year is the same Palestinian whose name
surfaced five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his 1993 statement to investigators, Abouhalima made no
mention of bin Laden, although bin Laden is known to have worked in
Afghanistan and Pakistan during the war years distributing official
Saudi aid money for the mujahedeen.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Abouhalima returned to New York in late 1988, the
Afghan war began to wind down. The Soviet Union withdrew the last
of its troops in 1989. Two years later, the United States agreed to
stop supplying arms to fractious Afghan warlords, and Afghanistan
descended into civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Arab men who had gone to fight, including bin Laden,
stayed on but turned their religious fury against secular Arab
governments and, ultimately, the U.S. military presence in the
Persian Gulf and in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil in postwar Afghanistan echoed in Brooklyn, where
Shalabi kept Alkifah Center open. With the arrival in Brooklyn in
1990 of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric who was
later convicted of conspiring to blow up New York landmarks,
Abouhalima said, the regulars at Alkifah began to quarrel over
money, political direction and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   It was around that time that Abouhalima said he had first met el
Hage, a Lebanese-born naturalized American citizen, at an Islamic
conference in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Just how close the two men became is not clear. Abouhalima's
lawyer in his World Trade Center trial, Hassen Ibn Abdellah, said,
``That case is over, and I know nothing of the government's
information or their sources.''
</P>
<P>
   But el Hage was familiar with several of the Arab immigrants
associated with Alkifah Center, say prosecutors and the account
that Abouhalima provided investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, said in court last
month, for example, that el Hage had a relationship with El Sayyid
A. Nosair, the Egyptian immigrant convicted on federal charges in
slaying of Kahane. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Abouhalima, who told investigators that he had been in charge of
protecting Sheik Abdel Rahman during the cleric's stay in the
United States, told investigators that he had gone at least twice
to el Hage to buy guns. Abouhalima said he obtained a 9-millimeter
handgun from el Hage in 1990 for use by the cleric's bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Abouhalima also told investigators that he later gave el Hage
$4,000 to buy handguns and AK-47s to defend his associates from the
Jewish Defense League in New York, an organization founded by
Kahane. Abouhalima said el Hage had been unable to obtain the
weapons and returned most of the money.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the transaction was not made clear.
</P>
<P>
   The government cited the weapons transaction in a court hearing
last month to persuade a federal magistrate to deny bail to el
Hage. Fitzgerald, the prosecutor, said el Hage had acknowledged
dealings with Abouhalima.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant has admitted that while in Texas he made efforts
to obtain firearms for Mahmud Abouhalima,'' Fitzgerald said. ``His
claim is that after purchasing the firearms, Mr. Abouhalima failed
to pick them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Abouhalima told investigators of other contacts with el Hage. He
said that el Hage called him from Texas in early 1991 and said
Shalabi wanted him to come to New York to help resolve a conflict
within Alkifah Center. At the time, Shalabi's leadership was under
fire from dissidents within his circle, including Abouhalima.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage did come to New York. A short time later, Shalabi was
found slain in his Brooklyn apartment. No one has been charged, and
the crime remains unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   Abouhalima said he and el Hage had met one more time in Al
Farooq Mosque on Atlantic Avenue, a few doors from Alkifah Center.
The topic of discussion, he said, was Shalabi's troubles and his
recent killing.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that by 1994, el Hage moved his wife and
children to Sudan, where neighbors said they knew him as the
director of Africa Help, a private aid organization. But the
government said he was the private secretary to bin Laden, who by
then had relocated from Afghanistan to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, the government said, el Hage moved to Kenya,
where he shared a house for a time with a man named Haroun Fazil
and helped bin Laden set up some of his front companies in Africa.
Fazil is accused of playing a role in the August embassy bombings
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The government appears to have been tracking el Hage for at
least a year before the embassy bombings. In September of last
year, he was pointedly questioned by federal agents investigating
bin Laden's group.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage, who moved back to the United States in 1997, has
pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to kill Americans and
of lying to federal agents. In court his lawyer, Bruce McIntyre,
denied that his client had any connection to terrorist activities.
McIntyre could not be reached for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Arab immigrants still congregate along the little
strip of shops on Atlantic Avenue, where Arab food and novelties
are sold alongside Islamic books. A few thousand pray at Al Farooq
Mosque at the main Friday prayers, but it no longer has a
reputation as a hotbed of radical Islamic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men who were drawn to Alkifah Center in its
turbulent days have melted quietly back into their communities, say
people in the neighborhood familiar with the center's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994 this mosque finally settled down,'' said Abdulhakim
Ali Mohamed, the American-born religious scholar who became the
imam, or leader, of the mosque three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   No one is permitted to misuse the mosque to preach politics or
hate, he added. ``If there's anything to say,'' Mohamed said,
``I'll say it.''
