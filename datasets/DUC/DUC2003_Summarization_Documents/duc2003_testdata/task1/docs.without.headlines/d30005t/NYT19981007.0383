   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Wednesday that
one of the men accused of conspiring to bomb the U.S. Embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania in August had met earlier with Osama bin Laden,
the suspected mastermind of the attacks, and ``asked him for a
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The reported meeting between bin Laden and the accused man,
Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al'Owhali, which had not previously been
described, is the strongest allegation offered so far to link bin
Laden to the attacks, in which more than 250 people died.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which prosecutors said took place in 1996, is
reported in a new 48-page indictment of Al-'Owhali and three others
that a federal grand jury in Manhattan returned Wednesday. It shows
how prosecutors are continuing to build the circumstantial case
that bin Laden, a Saudi businessman in exile, was behind the
embassy bombings and other attacks against Americans stationed
abroad in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors did not indicate bin Laden's response to the
offer; he is not charged in the new indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment does not indicate whether prosecutors have any
evidence that bin Laden directly ordered the bombings, or whether
they may argue that he inspired a group of followers to carry out
the attacks. Bin Ladin has called for attacks on U.S. and other
Western interests.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in issuing the new charges against men suspected of
being bin Laden's associates, the government also declared more
concretely than previously that bin Laden has been a major backer
of terrorism groups worldwide. Its list of terrorist groups
includes Al Jihad in Egypt and the Islamic Group, which is led by
Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who was convicted in 1996 in the plot to
blow up landmarks in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment asserted that bin Laden's organization, Al Qaeda,
worked on its own and through Al Jihad, Islamic Group and others,
which ``operated under its umbrella.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also gave their first account of what they
called bin Laden's network of businesses and front companies in
Sudan that he allegedly used to raise money to support terrorism
and to provide cover for the acquisition of explosives, weapons and
chemicals, and the travel of his associates.
