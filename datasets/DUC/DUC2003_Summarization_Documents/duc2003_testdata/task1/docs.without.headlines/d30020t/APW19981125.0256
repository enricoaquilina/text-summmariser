	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese swimmers, missing some of their stars,
are eyeing Japan as the team to beat at the Asian Games in
Thailand, an official report said Wednesday.
	   China's formidable table tennis team, also missing some veteran
champions, is bracing for a challenge, too, and aiming for just
four to five gold medals at the games next month, another report
said.
	   Chen Yan and Wu Yanyan, world record holders in the women's
400-meter and 200-meter individual medleys, respectively, are
leading hopefuls in the pool, the China Daily said.
	   Other hopefuls are Shan Ying in the women's 50- and 100-meter
freestyle and new team member Chen Hua in the women's 800- and
1,500-meter freestyle, the newspaper said. Han Xue, a breaststroke
short-course world record holder, also has medal chances, it added.
	   But world record holders Le Jingyi and He Cihong will miss the
games, the newspaper said. Top butterfly swimmer Liu Limin also has
left to study in the United States, it said.
	   ``We excel in freestyle and relay events, but we are weaker in
backstroke and butterfly than Japan,'' the newspaper quoted Zhang
Xiong, the national team's head coach, as saying.
	   ``The competition this time will be hard because two-thirds of
our swimmers are new,'' Zhang said. ``We won't let any hope of
winning slip through our hands although it appears Japan may
dominate.''
	   In the men's events, China is aiming to win five of 14 swimming
titles, the newspaper said.
	   The table tennis team, meanwhile, will be doing without veteran
players Deng Yaping, Ma Wenge and Wang Tao, the China Youth Daily
said.
	   ``This indicates that the Chinese table tennis team has already
completed the handover from old to new,'' the newspaper said. Head
coach Cai Zhenhua said the team was aiming for just four to five
golds, the newspaper said.
	   To prepare for the games, the team went to northern Hebei
province outside Beijing for three weeks of training starting Nov.
8, the newspaper added.
	   Meanwhile, China's gymnastics team is aiming for 8 to 10 of the
14 gold medals at stake, the China Sports Daily said.
	   China, the overall gold medal leader at the past three games,
will send 596 athletes to Thailand and compete in 32 of the 36
sports. Sports officials have said China hopes to win more than 100
golds.
	   China won 137 _ or 41 percent _ of 337 gold medals at stake at
the last games in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994.
