 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with swimming world record holder in training in grafs

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China hopes to win its first Asian Games gold
medal in the martial art of taekwondo next month in Thailand, the
official newspaper China Sports Daily said Tuesday.
	   The team of six women and three men will be China's first to
compete in taekwondo at the Asian Games, the report said.
	   China only began developing taekwondo in 1995, a year after the
last Asian Games, the newspaper said.
	   China picked up one silver and one bronze medal at the 1997
world championships and won a gold, silver and five bronze medals
at the Asian championships this year, the report said.
	   With South Korea, Taiwan and Iran _ the strongest taekwondo
nations _ all competing in the upcoming games, ``the Chinese team's
goal is to go all out to win one gold medal,'' it said.
	   Head coach Chen Liren was quoted as saying that a recent
decision by the sport's international federation to adjust weight
categories for competitions would affect China's women. The team
would not be dominant at any weight, he said.
	   ``Strong competitors at the Asian Games will be as numerous as
trees in a forest,'' Chen was quoted as saying.
	   Meanwhile, world record holder Wu Yanyan has been swimming an
average 11 kilometers (7 miles) a day at a camp in southwest China
where she is in training for the games, the official Xinhua News
Agency said.
	   But the 20-year-old Wu, who shattered the 200-meter individual
medley record at China's national games in October 1997, said it
would be difficult for her to reach her peak at the Asian Games
because she has recently had stamina problems, Xinhua added.
