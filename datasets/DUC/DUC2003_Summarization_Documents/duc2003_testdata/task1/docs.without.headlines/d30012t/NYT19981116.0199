   By the time the earth collides with a dense swarm of meteoroids
Tuesday night to unleash what may be the heaviest meteor
bombardment since 1966, many orbiting satellites will have
maneuvered into positions facing away from the storm to avoid
damage.
</P>
<P>
   But scores of instruments on the ground and aboard airplanes
will be aimed right at the blazing trails left by the meteors,
gathering information about these visitors from space and what they
do to the upper atmosphere as they burn up.
</P>
<P>
   Astrophysicists, atmospheric scientists and others have been
readying their experiments for a year or more in preparation for
Tuesday night's expected Leonid Meteor storm, so named because the
meteors appear to be coming from the direction of the constellation
Leo. The meteors are fragments, most of them microscopic in size,
of Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Although the earth encounters Leonid meteors every year on about
this date, only once in approximately every 33 years does the earth
intersect the swarm at a crowded point in the wake of the comet
after the comet has made its closest approach to the sun.
</P>
<P>
   This year scientists expect many Leonid meteors to be made of
fresh material knocked loose from the comet, making them better
indicators of the comet's composition than fragments that have
aged.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966 the Leonids put on a spectacular show, with tens of
thousands of meteors blazing through the sky each hour. Many
astronomers believe there is a good chance that this year's display
will be just as spectacular, at least for viewers in East Asia,
which will be in nighttime darkness during the few hours when the
swarm is at its peak.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts, including Dr. Donald K. Yeomans of the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., guess that the storm
will be much more modest, producing only 200 to 5,000 meteors per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, meteor experts from several countries have
converged on Asia to measure and study the Leonids as they hit the
atmosphere at speeds of about 45 miles per second.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are teams of specialists who will fly aboard two
airplanes _ a prop-jet Electra owned by the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and an Air Force KC-135
jet.
</P>
<P>
   Both are modified with upward-looking windows permitting
photography, spectroscopy, laser probes and other types of
observation.
</P>
<P>
   For about eight hours starting before midnight in East Asia, the
two airplanes, temporarily based in Okinawa, will fly in formation
with each other. The NCAR Electra, the slower of the two, will fly
back and forth along a straight track at about 25,000 feet, while
the Air Force KC-135, flying at about 40,000 feet, will fly an
elliptical course around the Electra's path.
</P>
<P>
   Instruments aboard both planes, a known distance apart, will
measure the angles between their respective views of a given meteor
trail, and triangulation will allow them to calculate the altitude
of the trail.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists are not worried about being hit by meteors, most
of which burn up in the mesosphere far above them, 50 to 65 miles
high. Most of the fragments are smaller than grains of sand, and
only very rarely is a meteor large enough and dense enough to
survive its white-hot trip through the air all the way to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The lead experiment on the Electra, conducted by Dr. Chester S.
Gardner and his team from the University of Illinois, will seek to
measure the amount of iron dumped into the atmosphere by meteors,
and to measure the temperatures of meteor trails.
</P>
<P>

   The group has developed a new type of lidar (which stands for
``light detection and ranging'') for the experiment. A lidar
instrument, similar in principle to a radar except that it uses
light instead of radio waves, sends a powerful laser beam directly
upward, where it excites target atoms in the thin atmosphere
sensitive to the laser's wavelength.
</P>
<P>
   They emit light, and a telescope, aimed at exactly the spot
where atoms excited by the laser are glowing measures and analyzes
the light.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's group has built a pair of lidars based on crystals of
alexandrite, a mineral that can lase at any of a range of
wavelengths, depending on how it is ``seeded'' by a small diode
laser of the desired wavelength.
</P>
<P>
   Using a complex optical system, the University of Illinois group
has tuned its lidars to two of the wavelengths of ionized iron _
the form that iron assumes at very high temperatures. By sending up
beams of ultraviolet light at 372 and 374 nanometers, the group
expects to excite iron ions to fluoresce in visible light that can
be detected and measured by the two telescopes aboard the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of fluorescence triggered by the two laser beams will
reveal the temperature of the high-altitude iron atoms and
therefore the meteor trail. This laser thermometer is expected to
improve understanding of the chemistry of the upper atmosphere and
the effects of meteors on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't aim the lidars in the plane. They always point
straight up,'' Gardner said in an interview, ``so we have to wait
for a meteor trail to pass directly overhead through out beam. On
an ordinary night we have to wait five hours or more for a single
trail, but during this storm we hope the intervals between overhead
meteors will be much shorter and give us much more information.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is in charge
of the airborne study, which is also supported by the National
Science Foundation and the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   One of the objects of the program is to determine how a meteor's
mass is related to its brightness. In another part of the program,
spectrometers will analyze light from meteor trails (which often
persist for several seconds) in terms of their chemical
composition. Meteoroids are broadly classed either as silicates
(especially olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase) or metallic
meteorites made mostly of iron and nickel, but there are many
variations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the experiments aboard the Electra is a wide-angle camera
that can record images of the glow emitted by excited sodium atoms
in the atmosphere. The sodium content of the atmosphere is expected
to be significantly increased by the arrival of meteors, and sodium
at high altitude reacts with ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists hope to learn whether meteor storms degrade the ozone
shield protecting life on earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the operators of scores of scientific, military and
commercial satellites have prepared the best they can for the
sand-blasting the meteor storm may produce. Solar panels have been
turned edgewise to present small targets to meteoroids, and some
electrical systems have been shut down to minimize the chances of
destructive short circuits triggered by impacts.
</P>
<P>
   A satellite regarded as particularly endangered by the Leonids
is the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) designed and built by
the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to study
charged particles coming from the sun and beyond the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Launched last year, ACE is now one million miles from the earth
in the direction of the sun _ a very vulnerable position close to
the center of the comet's wake. NASA is reorienting the spacecraft
to present a small target, but Dr. Mary Chiu, ACE's program
manager, said ``we're crossing our fingers in hopes of an
uneventful day on the 17th.''
