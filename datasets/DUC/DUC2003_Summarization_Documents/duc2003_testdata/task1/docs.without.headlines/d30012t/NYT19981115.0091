<P>
   Chicken Little would love this one. The Earth is hurtling into
the path of a comet called Temple-Tuttle.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Earth will enter Temple-Tuttle's debris-strewn
backwash and will then, according to many scientists, witness the
most intense meteor shower in more than three decades. The
scientists who track Temple-Tuttle do not even call it a shower,
they call it a meteor storm. (While visible in Asia, the storm will
be obscured by the sun in North America during its peak hours.)
</P>
<P>
   And in the midst of the storm, among millions of particles
moving at roughly 160,000 miles an hour, will be 600 or so man-made
satellites, which most people in the industrialized world have come
to rely on, wittingly or not, for entertainment, communication and
spying on one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in the life of our
communications-oriented world that we have faced an environmental
threat of this scope,'' said Ian Rowe, chief executive of Crestech,
a nonprofit group based in Toronto that will track the storm for
the Canadian and U.S. governments.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe said the only previous instance of a satellite's being
disabled by meteors occurred in 1993 during a shower about
one-3,000th the density of the storm predicted for Tuesday.
American consumers felt the impact of a single satellite's
malfunctioning in May, when the failure of Galaxy IV disrupted
pager service in much of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   If Tuesday's storm seriously damages any satellites, the effects
could be even more daunting. The spy satellites that are peering
down at Saddam Hussein could lose their ability to spot movements
of his troops. Television channels could become static. Those
relying on satellite navigation could become lost. Corporate
networks could shut down. Even the international telephone system,
which mostly relies on undersea cables, could be crippled. AT&AMP;T
Corp. says there are at least 14 countries, mostly in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, that can be reached by
telephone only by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite industry, however, and some of the companies that
rely on it, have a different reaction: no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think this will be much of an issue,'' said Daniel
Marcus, a spokesman for Panamsat, the world's largest private
satellite company, which is controlled by the Hughes Electronics
unit of General Motors Corp. ``It should be a nonevent.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stephen Stott, director for satellite engineering at
Intelsat, the international satellite consortium, said, ``Most of
the industry is of the opinion that we do not expect any major
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, the odds say that the meteors _ known as the Leonids
because they seem to come from the direction of the constellation
Leo _ have about as much chance of seriously damaging the world's
satellites as Mark McGwire does of smashing the windshield of the
sole car in an otherwise empty parking lot with a blast from inside
a Major League ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a physical threat, though, the Leonids, generally
smaller than grains of sand, also pose the risk of creating strong
electrical charges on satellites, potentially damaging sensitive
components.
</P>
<P>
   So while the big satellite companies play down the threat, they
are still taking steps to protect their property. Deploying a
commercial communications satellite can cost around $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The companies plan to turn solar arrays so that their edges face
the oncoming meteors, presenting a smaller target. They plan to
shut down some systems, to keep operations simple.
</P>
<P>
   But Alastair Hamilton, who is responsible for distributing Cable
News Network as Turner Broadcasting System's senior vice president
for worldwide distribution technology, said some viewers still
might lose their signal for a few minutes Tuesday as satellites
recover from short circuits. He added, however, that he could not
get too agitated because there is so little he can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, the satellites are up there and there
is no way to hide them,'' he said. ``So we're going to really see
what happens. And the prevailing opinion is that this is not really
something that we should be losing a huge amount of sleep over.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not quite how Col. Mike Kelly is handling the situation.
That is because he works for the owner of about a quarter of the
world's satellites: the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   As deputy commander of the 50th Operations Group at Schriever
Air Force Base near Colorado Springs, Colo., Kelly helps run about
60 Air Force satellites worth about $40 billion. Kelly's charges
provide navigation services, communications for officials including
the president, and help in detecting missile launches.
</P>
<P>
   While Marcus of Panamsat and Gregory Clark, president of Loral
Space Communications, another big private satellite company, said
they expected no impact on their services, Kelly is more
pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very unlikely that we'll lose a spacecraft on the
17th,'' he said. He added, however, ``I think it's probable that
we'll see some electrical problems that we'll have to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that could take anywhere from a few minutes to several
days. (Kelly's group does not manage any of the optical spy
satellites, he said. Those are generally handled by the
ultra-secretive National Reconnaissance Office, which refused to
comment.)
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the private satellite companies, however, the Air
Force, according to Kelly, has decided not to change its normal
operating procedures substantially, except to be especially
watchful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know ahead of time how serious it will be,'' Kelly
said. ``If it turns out to be a nothingburger, I'll be one of the
happiest people in Colorado.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Ken Kirkhart will be one of the happiest people in Virginia.
Kirkhart is vice president for production at USA Today, which uses
33 satellite-linked printing plants in the United States. Each
plant is linked to two satellites, Kirkhart said, but he is still
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crapshoot, you just don't know,'' he said. ``There's
nothing more you can do. There's not time. The only thing you could
do to put yourself in a risk-free situation is to put in a
terrestrial system, and to do that to 33 sites, well, you've dealt
with the phone companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, which uses a satellite to communicate with
eight of its 13 printing plants, has a backup plan to use
terrestrial, or ground-based, communications. But rather than link
directly to all eight sites in the event of a satellite problem,
The Times would link only to some of them and fly film for the
printing plates to the rest, according to Catherine Mathis,
director for investor relations for New York Times Co. She added
that the printing plants could also tune in to a backup satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones &AMP; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, was one
of the few companies to disclose the potential problems posed by
the storm in a filing with federal regulators, though a Dow Jones
spokesman refused to discuss his company's contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Iridium satellite telephone venture, which is controlled by
Motorola Inc., also mentioned the Leonids in a recent federal
filing, though the company declined to discuss the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no relevant experience we can use to base an
assessment of the damage, if any, that the storm might cause to
low-earth-orbit satellites,'' the Iridium filing said, referring to
the sort of satellites it uses. ``But such damage could be
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether the real probability of a satellite's being hit is
one in 5,000, as some industry experts predict, or one in 100, as
Rowe estimates, perhaps the only thing that could provide true
peace of mind would be no meteor storm at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``In theory, you can walk across a freeway in the middle of the
night and get away with it,'' he said, by way of analogy. ``But you
might get K.O.'d by a truck.''
