	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
Wednesday that he is considering a trip to Libya next week that
could close a deal to try Libyan suspects in the Pan Am Lockerbie
bombing.
	   Annan is heading to North Africa beginning Thursday to resume a
visit cut short to deal with the Iraq crisis.
	   A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's
legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the
suspects in the Netherlands, according to Scottish law and using
Scottish judges.
	   Because of some positive developments in recent weeks, ``there
is now a good chance that the suspects might finally be brought''
to trial, a U.N. source said on condition of anonymity.
	   There is ``a sense of optimism,'' he said.
	   Libya had accepted the proposal in theory, but objected to its
call for the suspects to be jailed in a Scottish prison if found
guilty. The Tripoli government has insisted the suspects serve any
prison time in Libya or the Netherlands.
	   It wasn't immediately known if Libyan officials had indicated
some flexibility on that point, which diplomats have said was
Libya's major concern.
	   Annan said he had hoped that there would be some breakthruogh by
the end of November.
	   ``If that doesn't happen, I will be in the region next week and
the question has been raised if it would be helpful for me to go
there and bring the issue finally to closure,'' he said.
	   ``I haven't made up my mind yet, but it has not been excluded,''
he said.
	   Two Libyans, Abdel Basset Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, are
accused of planting the suitcase bomb that ripped apart the New
York-bound Pan Am jet on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people in the
air and on the ground at Lockerbie.
	   For 10 years, the United States and Britain had demanded the two
be tried in the United States or Britain, but agreed in August to a
trial in the Netherlands in hopes of finally bringing the issue to
a close.
	   The Security Council endorsed the plan and agreed to suspend
sanctions once the two men are turned over. Council members also
agreed to consider additional sanctions if Libya didn't produce the
suspects.
	   The sanctions, which include an air embargo, were imposed to
force Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to turn the men over.
	   Annan said his discussions on the proposal had been ``very
constructive.''
	   The U.N. source said Annan wouldn't travel to Libya unless he
had a sense that he could achieve a breakthrough.
