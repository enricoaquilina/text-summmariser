 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL;

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
investigators plan to return to Kosovo and resume their probe of
alleged atrocities in the troubled province, a tribunal official
said Wednesday.
	   Visas that were denied earlier by Yugoslav authorities have now
been issued, Deputy Prosecutor Graham Blewitt told a press
briefing. He did not give details on how many investigators will
return or when.
	   Blewitt declined to speculate on the reason behind Belgrade's
change of heart, nor could he confirm that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has explicitly agreed to total compliance with
the U.N. court.
	   In a statement, Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United
States, the tribunal's president, welcomed ``in principle'' the
recent agreements aimed at averting military intervention. But
McDonald said she had not yet reviewed them to confirm that they
contained ``explicit provisions and mechanisms'' aimed at ensuring
Belgrade's compliance.
	   However, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, speaking on NBC's
``Today'' program, said cooperation with the tribunal was indeed
part of the agreements with Milosevic.
	   ``We had a big argument about the war crimes tribunal,''
Holbrooke said. ``It is embedded in our agreement that he said he
will fully comply with the U.N. resolution and that calls for
(compliance).''
	   Holbrooke said Milosevic had agreed to a doubling of war crimes
tribunal staff in Belgrade and to letting them travel freely in
Kosovo, where the tribunal wants to look into reports of Serb
massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians.
	   The tribunal's chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour of Canada, was at
the United Nations on Wednesday to clarify the scope and impact of
the agreements as they relate to war crimes issues.
	   Blewitt said last week that Belgrade officials had suddenly
begun claiming that the tribunal has no jurisdiction to conduct
investigations in Kosovo.
	   The tribunal, set up by the United Nations in 1993 to prosecute
crimes committed following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia,
has always maintained that it also has jurisdiction in the Kosovo
conflict.
	   Until recently, tribunal staff were allowed to carry out
investigations in the region, examining reports of atrocities by
both sides in the Kosovo conflict.
	   ``Our mandate is quite clear. It is not subject to negotiations
neither by President Milosevic nor Mr. Holbrooke,'' Blewitt said
emphatically.
	   McDonald repeatedly has chastised Belgrade for failing to
surrender indicted war suspects at large in Yugoslavia, in
particular the handover of three men accused of orchestrating the
killings of 260 unarmed people after the fall of Vukovar in 1991.
	   ``The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia continues to flout the law
and the will of the international community'' by refusing to turn
over indicted suspects, she said in her statement.
