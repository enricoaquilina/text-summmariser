<P>
   Congress is playing ``chicken'' with the president and the
American public. The federal government is now running on borrowed
time. The federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. There would have
been a massive shutdown of federal agencies on Oct. 1, except that
Congress voted for a ``continuing resolution'' that supplies
emergency funding until Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the president submits his budget requests to
Congress in January and February. Congress has until mid-September
to consider, fashion and pass the necessary appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   But this Congress is playing special-interest politics with
appropriations bills. As of Oct. 2, only four of 13 appropriations
bills had been passed. And at least three of the bills yet to be
voted into law have been threatened with a presidential veto
because of the anti-environmental riders attached to them.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Congress must pass all the appropriations bills, but
unless the most egregious of the included riders are removed, the
public can expect another government shutdown like the one in 1995
_ with the closure of national parks, national monuments, public
buildings like the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress and the
federal agencies that monitor the federal lands across this nation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, instead of dealing with the issues, Congress can pass
another continuing resolution so that the federal government
doesn't shut down on Oct. 10. More borrowed time. More political
shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs Friday that the GOP leadership in Congress
realizes it might lose in its collision course with the president
and the American people. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, indicated that he is willing to strip off
some of the anti-environmental riders he wrote that impact his
state.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, echoed Stevens, but
predicted that next year the GOP presence in Congress would be even
stronger and Republicans will get what they want then. Presumably,
the public can expect to see a greater emphasis on raping and
scraping the public lands after this election.
</P>
<P>
   But will the GOP leadership swerve enough to avoid a collision
in this session? A number of powerful special-interest groups have
forked over huge donations to see their wishes put into law: the
fishing industry, oil and gas industry, timber and mining companies
and agricultural interests. Approximately 50 anti-environmental
riders remain attached to various appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the arrogance factor: On July 24, Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., wrote a letter to Secretary of the Interior
Bruce Babbitt threatening to defund Babbitt's office, the office of
the Department of the Interior's solicitor, the department's public
relations offices and its congressional relations offices.
Livingston, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, didn't
like what Babbitt had said to the press about his committee's
antics.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston received more than $100,000 in political campaign
contributions from oil and gas, construction and agricultural
industries in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   And on the Senate side of the aisle, the Department of
Transportation appropriations bill contains a provision that would
allow helicopters unrestricted access to national wilderness areas,
national parks and national wildlife refuges in Alaska. Helicopters
are now only allowed in Alaska conservation areas for emergency
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, Babbitt and Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman
sent a letter to Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the
Subcommittee on Transportation in the Senate Committee on
Appropriations, condemning the helicopter section of the bill and
promising a recommendation for a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt and Glickman wrote, in part: ``This provision would
change fundamentally the Alaska experience and undermine wildlife
protections and visitor enjoyment in our `last frontier.' It
clearly hurts Alaska, but also sets a dangerous precedent for
wilderness, park and refuge lands throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the ``whopp, whopp, whopp'' of copter blades somewhere
just above your head as you try to enjoy the deep and beautiful
silence of the great wilderness areas. In cold, dense air the sound
of helicopter blades carries a long way.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of the blades can have a serious impact on wildlife _
disturbing nesting seabird and scattering caribou herds during
winter when they need to conserve their energy.
</P>
<P>
   And who would use helicopters overflights or dropoffs?
Extractive industries searching for geological formations that
promise oil, gas or coal might be interested in using helicopters;
wealthy hunters or hikers who want to be dropped off at key
locations; and those intrepid sightseers who want to view the
Denali National Park or the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge
from the comfort of a seat in a helicopter, then drop down to put
their feet on the ground for a moment and finally whopp, whopp
away. And, of course, poachers would find helicopter entry and exit
a quick and useful tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Congress isn't satisfied to merely violate the deep silences of
the wilderness areas and thereby diminish the experience _ the
Omnibus National Parks and Public Lands Act (HR 4570) contains a
provision to sell off the people's park lands.
</P>
<P>
   Section 411 of the omnibus bill authorizes the secretary of the
Interior to sell, lease, or issue use-permits for parcels of land
or structures within the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National
Historical Park.
</P>
<P>
   Section 604 authorizes the sale of wilderness land with the
Cumberland Island National Seashore. The bill also would also allow
vehicles to drive through this designated wilderness area.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, GOP leaders in the Senate pulled the Interior
appropriations bill off the floor after lengthy debate because they
didn't want Sen.
</P>
<P>
   Max Baucus, D-Mont., to be successful in adding an amendment
that would remove a number of anti-environmental riders.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is talk in the Senate of rolling the Interior bill in
with several other appropriations measures to create a gigantic
funding bill that President Clinton could not veto without serious
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   And the political games continue.
