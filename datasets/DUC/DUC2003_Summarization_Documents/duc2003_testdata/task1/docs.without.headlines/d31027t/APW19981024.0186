	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Conservative Muslim clerics were leading in
national elections for a key assembly that elects and oversees
Iran's supreme leader, according to partial results Saturday.
	   The trend offered no surprise since most of the 167 candidates
in Friday' elections were hard-liners who want to maintain the
authority of the supreme leader, the country's top Shiite cleric
who has the final say in all matters.
	   The Election Committee announced the names of winners for 17 of
the 86 seats in the Assembly of Experts. Their affiliations were
not given but judging by their background it was clear that at
least 11 of the victors are hard-liners and four are moderates. Two
are believed to be independents.
	   The committee said the 17 victors represent 12 of the country's
28 provinces. It said counting is underway for 69 remaining seats
in 16 more provinces. Final results are not expected until Sunday.
	   The elections were marked by a low turnout, and many Iranians
said they stayed away to protest the lack of choice: a conservative
council that vetted a list of 396 prospective candidates had
rejected all but about 30 moderate candidates.
	   The moderates, led by popular President Mohammad Khatami, want
to make the supreme leader more accountable to people by installing
an assembly that is more balanced in its composition.
	   They also favor greater social, political and media freedom than
allowed by the established clergy owing allegiance to supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   These theologians, who control state institutions such as the
judiciary and security agencies, cite the ideals of the 1979
Islamic Revolution that was led by Khamenei's predecessor,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Saturday that 51
percent of eligible voters cast their ballot in 12 provinces where
counting has been completed.
	   Nationwide, 40 percent of the 38.5 million electorate voted, the
independent Salam newspaper said quoting sources the Interior
Ministry. The official media on Friday claimed an ``unprecedented''
participation by voters.
	   The Election Committee said a record 64.35 percent voter turnout
was noted in Golestan province. Golestan residents, contacted by
telephone, disputed that.
	   ``The stations were empty. How those ballots got there, I have
no idea,'' said Parvin, who would only give her first name. She was
reached by telephone in Gorgan, capital of Golestan.
	   She said she visited several polling stations and found very few
people voting. Associated Press reporters who toured polling
stations in Tehran Friday also found many of them deserted.
	   An opposition Iranian group in exile, the National Council of
Resistance in Iran, claimed that only about 10 percent of the
electorate voted.
	   ``So extensive was the boycott that the ruling clerics were
speaking of religiously sanctioned rigging,'' the NCRI said in a
statement issued in Washington and faxed to The Associated Press in
Cairo, Egypt. It said authorities stuffed ballot boxes and the
regime planned to announce a turnout several times the actual
figure.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the claim and voters in
Iran did not openly complain of rigging.
