	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators
rallied in a Tehran park Sunday to protest the rejection of scores
of candidates for the election of a powerful assembly.
	   The Council of Guardians, which is dominated by political
hard-liners, has rejected 214 candidates out of 400 who wanted to
run in Friday's election to the 86-member Assembly of Experts.
	   Many of the disqualified candidates were supporters of President
Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate. Twelve candidates withdrew
their names in protest against the screening.
	   The move by the 12-member Council of Guardians is seen as part
of the struggle between conservatives and reformists in Iran.
	   Khatami went on national television late Saturday to criticize
the selection of the candidates for the assembly, which has the
power to appoint or dismiss Iran's supreme leader.
	   ``There is no doubt that the number of wise and learned scholars
suitable for membership of the Assembly of Experts is greater than
the 400 or so candidates who have registered,'' the president said.
	   In a reference to expectations of a low turnout, Khatami said
that greater variety among the candidates would have increased
public enthusiasm for the polls.
	   Khatami said the council could be criticized for ``not creating
the climate and conditions which would have attracted eligible
individuals to enter the scene.''
	   ``We should not prevent people from criticizing the components
of the system, the institutions, the president, the Council of
Guardians, the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the judiciary,''
Khatami said.
	   The council has rejected criticism, saying its sole criteria for
judging candidates was the law. Candidates have to take a test on
Islamic theology.
	   In Tehran's Laleh Park on Sunday, thousands turned out to hear
Heshmatollah Tabarzadi, a fiery student leader who spoke of the
councilors that vetoed his own candidacy in Friday's polls.
	   ``They have created a situation where a section of society will
not be taking part in the elections because qualified candidates
have been rejected, depriving a section of society from exercising
their rights,'' Tabarzadi said.
