	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's official media boasted about a huge
turnout in elections Friday for the council that oversees the
country's supreme leader. But many polling stations were nearly
empty in Tehran, the capital and largest city and where some voters
complained that hard-line clerics had already decided the outcome.
	   State-controlled Tehran radio reported ``unprecedented and
unique'' voting levels for the 86-member Assembly of Experts.
	   The radio said long lines of voters queued at polling stations
across the country, and electoral officers expected to run out of
ballot papers.
	   But correspondents who visited a dozen polling stations around
the capital found turnout to be minimal. Only two polling stations
had voters waiting in line.
	   The electoral authorities twice extended closing the polls for a
total of three hours. Interior Minister Abdolvahed Lari also said
late voters would not be turned away.
	   Candidate Majid Ansari, a moderate cleric, blamed the low
turnout in Tehran on the lack of choice as most of the 167
candidates _ all clergymen _ were hard-liners. The candidates were
selected by a Council of Guardians that is controlled by
conservatives.
	   ``Unfortunately, the procedures were such that competition was
limited and a group of revolutionaries were prevented from taking
part in the elections,'' Ansari told The Associated Press.
	   Ordinary people were blunt about their reason for boycotting the
polls.
	   ``It makes no difference. They have already selected the people
they want to put in the assembly,'' said Siavash Mohseni, 24, a
university student who didn't vote.
	   A young woman who gave only her first name, Arezou, said she was
also alienated from the polls.
	   ``The behavior of the Council of Guardians was very insulting
because they did not give us a chance to choose the candidates of
our choice,'' she said.
	   Although voting was supposed to be secret, there were no private
booths for voters and it was easy to see whom a person voted for.
	   An election observer in western Tehran said many voters had cast
empty ballot papers and many more had voted for supporters of the
moderate President Mohammad Khatami.
	   However, a voter in Tehran's Enqelab Square, Saeid Kazami, 41,
said he had cast his ballot mainly for hard-line candidates because
they ``are protectors of the (Islamic) revolution.''
	   ``We know that the revolution will have no problem if they are
in charge,'' he said.
	   Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a hard-liner, has
the final say in government, and conservative clerics want to keep
it that way. But moderate clerics, led by Khatami, are calling for
a more accountable leader.
	   Khatami's efforts to ease the revolution's social, political and
media restrictions are popular. But they are opposed bitterly by
hard-liners who are loathe to give up control of key institutions
such as the judiciary and the security agencies.
	   Khatami urged people to vote after casting his ballot at the
Husseinieh Jamaran mosque in northern Tehran.
	   ``Definitely, there could have been more qualified people than
were allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose our
favored candidates,'' Khatami told reporters.
	   Official results are not expected until Saturday, and Tehran's
results could be announced as late as Sunday, electoral authorities
said.
