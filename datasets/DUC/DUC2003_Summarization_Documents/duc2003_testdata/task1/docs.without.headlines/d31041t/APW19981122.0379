	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The number of labor strikes and
lockouts in the Philippines has declined this year despite business
difficulties caused by Asia's financial crisis, the labor
department said Sunday.
	   The department said 712 strikes and lockouts have occurred so
far, a drop of 14 percent compared to 827 in the same period last
year. The number of workers who joined the strikes also declined by
20 percent from more than 210,000 to 175,500.
	   Early mediation by labor officials contributed to an easing of
labor unrest in the country, the department said in a statement.
	   The country, however, suffered one of its worst labor problems
when flag carrier Philippine Airlines was forced to shut down Sept.
23 due to disputes with its largest labor union and mounting debts
and losses, partly caused by the regional financial turmoil.
	   PAL laid off more than 3,000 employees at the height of its
labor and financial troubles this year, the biggest single
retrenchment in the Philippines.
	   PAL resumed domestic flights Oct. 7 and started restoring
international flights last month after settling its labor problems.
It has since accepted an investment offer from Hong Kong's Cathay
Pacific and the two airlines are drawing up a plan to rehabilitate
the Philippine carrier.
