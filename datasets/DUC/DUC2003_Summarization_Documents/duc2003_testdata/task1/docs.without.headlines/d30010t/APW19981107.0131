	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The father of one of the Islamic militants who
died in the suicide bombing of a crowded Jerusalem market said
Saturday he was sad about his son's death but proud of what he had
done.
	   Friday's bombing at the open-air Mahane Yehuda market killed the
two assailants, injured 21 Israelis and jeopardized the 2-week-old
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat promised to track down the
masterminds of the bombing and urged that it not be allowed to set
back the new land-for-security agreement.
	   ``We must work together, Israelis and Palestinians, to confront
these terrorist acts that aim to destroy the peace process,''
Arafat said after the attack on the market, which was swarming with
shoppers readying for the Jewish Sabbath.
	   In a rare direct statement to the Israeli people, Arafat
appeared on Israeli TV and promised to ``exert 100 percent effort''
to catch and punish those who had planned the bombing.
	   The radical group Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack,
but Palestinian security officials blamed members of the militant
Islamic Jihad.
	   One of the dead bombers was identified as Yusef Ali Mohammed
Zughayar, who lived in an Israeli-controlled area north of
Jerusalem. His family said he was 22 and acknowledged he was active
in Islamic Jihad.
	   Palestinian security officials said the other was Suleiman Musa
Dahayneh, 23, from a village outside the West Bank town of Jenin.
	   At Zughayar's house near the Anata refugee camp, dozens of
friends and relatives gathered Saturday to mourn, although they
could not hold a funeral because the body had not been handed over
by Israeli authorities.
	   ``I didn't raise him to lose him like that,'' said Zughayar's
54-year-old father, Mohammed. ``I'm proud, but I'm sad because I
loved my son.''
	   Friday's attack was the second suicide bombing since the signing
of the peace accord on Oct. 23.
	   On Oct. 29, an activist from Hamas killed himself and an Israeli
soldier when he tried to ram an explosives-rigged car into a bus
carrying Jewish schoolchildren.
	   Arafat called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express
sorrow over Friday's bombing, but the Israeli leader told him that
for the peace process to continue, the Palestinians would have to
significantly step up their war against terrorists.
	   Israel's Cabinet, which was meeting at the time of the attack,
cut short its debate on ratifying the accord, and did not set a
date for resuming it.
	   The Palestinian Cabinet condemned the attack following its own
meeting Friday night, but said Israel should not use it as an
excuse to halt the peace process.
	   The toll from the attack at the Mahane Yehuda market was far
lighter than might have been expected because the explosives
apparently went off prematurely. Many shoppers in the crowded
market saw smoke and flames coming from the car and fled moments
before the main blast.
	   Suitcases were found in the car's wreckage, Israel radio
reported, suggesting the attackers may have intended to carry
separate parcels of explosives deep into the crowd.
	   That method was used in an attack at the market 16 months ago
that killed the two suicide bombers and 16 others.
