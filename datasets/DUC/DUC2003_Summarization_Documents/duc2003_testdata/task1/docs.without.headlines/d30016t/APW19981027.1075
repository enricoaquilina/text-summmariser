	   TORONTO (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of pieces of Swissair
Flight 111, representing 60 percent of the plane, have now been
retrieved from the ocean floor, but an explanation for the Sept. 2
crash remains far off, investigators said Tuesday.
	   Benoit Bouchard, chairman of Canada's Transportation Safety
Board, predicted it would take longer than the normal 12 months to
complete a final report on the crash off the Nova Scotia coast that
killed all 229 people aboard the New York-to-Geneva flight.
	   ``It's a very complicated and complex investigation,'' Bouchard
said. ``But I remain optimistic that we will identify any safety
deficiencies that may exist.''
	   As of two weeks ago, only 10 percent of the wrecked MD-11 jet
had been recovered. Then a barge equipped with an underwater crane
was brought in to scoop up large pieces of the plane.
	   Vic Gerden, the chief crash investigator, said the operation was
a success, retrieving all three of the engines, parts of the
fuselage and cockpit, as well as electronic circuit boards and
bundles of wiring that will be examined for possible clues into the
source of smoke that the pilots detected 16 minutes before the
crash.
	   Some debris from the cockpit area shows signs of extreme heat,
but investigators have yet to establish any details about the cause
or extent of a possible fire on board.
	   ``We're really just now at the stage where we have quite a bit
of aircraft to examine,'' Gerden said.
	   He said investigators still don't know at what angle the plane
hit the water and hope that digital controls in the engines may
give an indication of the plane's speed at impact.
	   The impact was so severe that all the victims' bodies were badly
fragmented, complicating the identification process.
	   Dr. John Butt, Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, joined
investigators at a news briefing in Halifax on Tuesday to report
that remains of 134 people have now been identified, mostly through
matching with DNA samples provided by relatives.
	   He said 228 distinct DNA patterns have now been detected from
the remains, indicating remains from all but one of the people on
board has been found.
	   Gerden said the heavy-lifting barge, the Sea Sorceress, has
completed its work, and will be replaced this week by a boat
normally used to drag up scallops. Its task will be to retrieve the
smaller debris that remains on the ocean floor, about 180 feet (55
meters) below the surface.
	   Though the final report is probably more than a year away,
Bouchard said the safety board would issue provisional
recommendations at any point when investigators felt they had
detected a safety hazard,
	   ``We will do everything we can to reduce risks associated with
flying,'' he said.
