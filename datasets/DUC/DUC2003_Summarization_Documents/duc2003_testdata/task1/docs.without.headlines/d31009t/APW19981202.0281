	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish President Suleyman Demirel planned
to meet with Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit on Wednesday, stoking
speculation that he'd ask the center-left leader to form a new
government.
	   Ecevit is said to have the support of Turkey's all-powerful
military and most analysts say he is the is the most viable
replacement for Mesut Yilmaz, who was ousted in a no-confidence
vote last week over a mafia scandal.
	   Daily Milliyet said Demirel was likely to announce his choice
before leaving Thursday for a one-day trip to Romania.
	   By tradition, the leader of the largest party in parliament
would get the nod. But the largest party is Islamic Virtue, which
is opposed by the military. Last year, the military ousted Turkey's
first Islamic-led government.
	   Ecevit said he didn't want Virtue in the government and
reiterated his proposal for a new secular coalition combining his
Democratic Left party with Turkey's two center-right parties. The
coalition would have a large majority in Parliament.
	   He said Wednesday that he opposes joining forces with Virtue
because of ``our commitment to secularism without concessions.''
	   The veteran politician could act as the glue between Yilmaz and
former premier Tansu Ciller, whose long-standing political rivalry
led to a government collapse in 1996. Ecevit is said to have
Yilmaz' support, but there are doubts about Mrs. Ciller.
	   General elections are scheduled for April 18.
