	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Solemn-faced Kenyans whose relatives were
killed in the terrorist bombing of a U.S. Embassy collected
benefits on Friday they said failed to compensate for their losses.
	   ``It's not enough, nothing could be enough,'' Beatrice Akoth
Yongo, a widow with four young children and another due in
December, said in the shade of a flowering jacaranda tree.
	   Attorney-General Amos Wako, representing the government at the
gathering of 100 in downtown Uhuru Park, acknowledged with regret,
``This is peanuts for someone who has died.''
	   Yongo was one of 31 relatives paid 100,000 Kenyan shillings
(dlrs 1,667) each from donations that have reached 228 million
Kenyan shillings (dlrs 3.8 million).
	   They came, some from days away, and wore their Sunday best.
Several shed tears as they accepted checks from smiling officials
offering condolences.
	   In the coming days, more of the 213 Kenyan families who lost a
relative will be compensated, said Charles Njonjo, chairman of the
National Disaster Emergency Fund.
	   Many families previously received an immediate payment of 50,000
Kenyan shillings (dlrs 833) for burial expenses. Additional
payments will be made, if money becomes available, Njonjo said.
	   A total of 248 people, including a dozen Americans, were killed
in the Nairobi bombing on Aug. 7. A twin attack on the U.S. Embassy
in neighboring Tanzania killed 11 people, all Africans.
	   Compensation later will be paid to the most seriously injured
among more than 5,400 people who were hurt in Kenya, mostly
passersby sliced by flying debris, Njonjo said. Amounts have not
been determined.
	   Nearly two months after the bombings, many people still need
physical and psychological help, and not enough is being provided,
aid agencies say.
	   ``The needs are very serious and we keep identifying more and
more as the days go by,'' said Amimo Agola of the Bomb Relief
Support Unit, an umbrella group for all nongovernmental agencies
assisting bomb victims.
	   A total of 17 people remain in hospital for treatment of serious
physical injuries, including broken limbs and backs and
amputations, the National Disaster Operations Center said.
	   Another 200 people need reconstructive surgery, Agola said.
Meanwhile, mangled eyelids are failing to protect otherwise
undamaged eyes, hands with severed tendons are turning into useless
claws.
	   Patients, although unable to work and lacking medical insurance,
must now pay for treatment that initially was free.
	   Most rehabilitation programs need money, too, Agola said.
	   For example, 97 people were fully or partially blinded by flying
glass and debris, and need training that the Kenya Society for the
Blind can't always afford to provide. Many patients can't afford to
buy the powerful eyeglasses they need.
	   ``The greatest need is that many, many of us have been
psychologically traumatized, and very, very few are receiving
help,'' Agola said.
	   Businesses have started to fire people who have not yet returned
to work because they are still upset by the bombing, she said.
	   Especially heartbreaking are the pleas from people who say
they've lost the family's only breadwinner.
	   In Kenya, as in much of Africa, strong ties of the extended
family _ and the enormous disparity between earnings in the city
and the countryside _ make it common for one urban breadwinner to
be the main source of support for dozens of other family members.
	   The government's social welfare system is hopelessly inadequate,
and life insurance is a luxury of the rich.
	   Some people were angry at the paucity of assistance.
	   ``This is nothing,'' Esther Dalizu said, waving a compensation
check. Her dead sister was a senior bank employee who had earned
the same amount in just a few months. ``The loss cannot be
compensated.''
	   Dalizu said she planned to save the money for the education of
her sister's 11-year-old daughter.
	   Yongo, 32, said without her husband's salary the family now must
live on her earnings of less than half as much. After she pays the
rent on a government-subsidized apartment, she has just 1,200
shillings (dlrs 20) per month to feed her brood, pay utilities and
school fees.
	   ``It has been so difficult,'' she said, blotting away a tear.
Relatives cannot afford to help her.
	   Yongo is afraid her husband's dream of university educations for
their children has died with him. ``This makes me even sadder,''
she said.
