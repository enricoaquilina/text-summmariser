	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ About 10,000 Turkish soldiers have crossed
into northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebels, and the government
said it might send forces into Syria to eradicate guerrilla bases
there, news reports said Saturday.
	   Turkey's incursion into northern Iraq on Friday followed two
days of airstrikes against suspected rebel bases, the daily
Hurriyet said.
	   Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in southeastern
Turkey wage cross-border raids from camps in Iraq, Iran and Syria.
The Ankara government accuses Syria of aiding the rebels, a charge
Damascus denies.
	   In an effort to ease escalating tension between Syria and
Turkey, Egypt said Saturday that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
will travel to Damascus and Ankara for talks.
	   Necati Utkan, the Turkish foreign ministry spokesman, told the
Anatolia news agency that Mubarak was expected to arrive in Ankara
on Monday. He did not elaborate.
	   The military did not return calls for comment.
	   The rebels, fighting for an autonomy in southeastern Turkey,
stage hit-and-run attacks from bases in Syria, Iraq and Iran.
	   On Friday Turkey strongly warned Syria that its ``patience was
running out,'' and Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was quoted Saturday
by the daily Hurriyet as saying, ``the soldier is awaiting an
order.''
	   But an intelligence official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Saturday that the troop deployments were not
targeting Syria, but infiltrations of Kurdish rebels.
	   Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, chief of the general staff, has
described the mounting tension with Syria as ``an undeclared war''
amid unconfirmed reports of troop deployments along the
Turkish-Syrian border by both sides.
	   According to daily Cumhuriyet on Saturday, the military has
reinforced its units near the border town of Reyhanli, with an
artillery, an engineer and an infantry battalions.
	   On Saturday, Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said Turkey would
soon carry out an exercise near the Syrian border, private NTV
television reported.
	   Turkey has never conducted wargames along the Syrian border. The
exercise was expected to follow current NATO maneuvers, running in
an area close to Syria through Oct. 21.
	   In a show of force, Turkish jets buzzed along the Syrian border
on Friday, daily Radikal reported Saturday.
	   Hurriyet newspaper said the Turkish units also sealed the escape
routes of the rebels along the Syrian-Iraqi border inside northern
Iraq.
	   Sezgin said Turkey was still trying to use diplomatic means to
solve the problem. ``But there is a limit of patience,'' NTV quoted
him as saying. ``Then we will do whatever necessary.''
	   Damascus denied the allegations and accused Turkey of plotting
with Israel to create a crisis with the aim of undermining Syria.
	   In Jerusalem, Defense Ministry spokesman Avi Benayahu said
Israel is not involved ``in any way'' in the Turkey-Syria
confrontation.
