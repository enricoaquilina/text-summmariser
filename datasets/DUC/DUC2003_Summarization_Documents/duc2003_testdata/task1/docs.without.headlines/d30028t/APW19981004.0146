	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The Turkish government, which sent about
10,000 soldiers into northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebels, has
said it might send forces into Syria to eradicate guerrilla bases
there, according to news reports.
	   Turkey's incursion into northern Iraq on Friday followed two
days of airstrikes against suspected rebel bases, the daily
Hurriyet said Saturday.
	   Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in southeastern
Turkey wage cross-border raids from camps in Iraq, Iran and Syria.
The Ankara government accuses Syria of aiding the rebels, a charge
Damascus denies.
	   Turkey warned the Syrian government Friday that its ``patience
was running out,'' and Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, chief of the
general staff, has described the mounting tension with Syria as
``an undeclared war.''
	   Fueling tension between the two countries are Turkey and
Israel's expanding military and diplomatic ties. Syria claims the
ties are a threat to the Arab world, and on Saturday, Damascus
again accused Turkey of plotting with Israel to undermine Syria.
	   In Jerusalem, Israeli Defense Ministry spokesman Avi Benayahu on
Saturday denied his country was involved ``in any way'' in the
looming Turkey-Syria confrontation.
	   In an effort to head off a military conflict, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak flew to Damascus on Sunday for talks with Syrian
President Hafez Assad and was expected to visit Turkey on Monday.
On Saturday, he traveled with Foreign Minister Amr Moussa to Riyadh
for talks with Saudi officials.
