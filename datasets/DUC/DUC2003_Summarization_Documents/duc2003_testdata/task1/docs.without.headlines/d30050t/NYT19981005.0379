<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As several of its members observed, Monday's debate
and votes in the House Judiciary Committee marked only the third
time in the nation's history that impeachment of a president has
been formally considered on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In that limited sense, the approval of a full-scale impeachment
process was historic. But it was by no means decisive, no matter
how much the legislators huffed and puffed.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a first short step along a rocky road whose length
is not known _not by President Clinton, not by the public and not
even by committee members (although the chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., said this weekend that he hoped the House of
Representatives could finish its work before year's end).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution provides our compass,'' said Rep. Edward
Pease, R-Ind. ``I intend to follow it.'' But neither he nor his
colleagues could say for sure where it would ultimately point.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in the same room where Richard Nixon's fate was sealed a
quarter-century ago, Republicans stressed parallels to that era.
This case is about law-breaking, they said, and not about illicit
sex. To which Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the committee's
senior Democrat, retorted: ``This is not about Watergate. It is
about an extramarital affair.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the fault line, so far unbridgeable, between the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
   People in Washington universally assume that the House as a
whole will vote later this week to ratify the committee's decision.
The Republicans have the votes to prevail. But if only Republicans
support the procedural plans set out by their leadership, as was
the case in the final vote Monday night, the decision will be seen
by many in the country as a purely partisan proposition.
</P>
<P>
   That next roll call will help set the tone for what lies ahead.
If only a half-dozen Democrats join the Republicans, the image of
trench warfare will be reinforced and the subsequent inquiry will
begin under something of a cloud; if 50 or 75 do so, the vote will
confer a greater degree of legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   The more the average voter thinks that the Republicans are
ganging up on the president, his strategists believe, the better
his chances of surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, consensus or something approaching it may develop
later. Only well into the final stages of the committee's 1974
hearings on the impeachment of Nixon did significant numbers of
Republican members join the Democrats in concluding that Nixon had
committed impeachable offenses. The fact that they finally did led
people on both sides to judge its actions fair.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case of presidential impeachment, Andrew Johnson
survived a Senate trial because just enough members of the
opposition party broke ranks and voted to back him.
</P>
<P>
   Once this week's votes have been taken, attention will shift to
the midterm elections on Nov. 3. The conventional wisdom in
Washington has shifted rapidly in recent days, from a belief in the
days before the release of Kenneth Starr's report that changes
would be minimal, especially in the House, to a suspicion that
Democratic losses would be large, which took hold in the days
before the tape of Clinton's grand jury testimony was released.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a growing conviction that the Republicans erred by
releasing the tape, creating a backlash that could help marginal
House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Two caveats seem in order, however. While the president's
troubles seem less likely to influence Senate races, Democrats were
in big trouble in those without any drag from Washington. A number
of independent analysts see Republican gains of four to six seats.
Major losses in the House are still possible, too, perhaps 20 or
more seats if Republican voters turn out en masse and Democrats do
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astonished,'' said a senior Republican senator on Capitol
Hill, who comes from the Sun Belt. ``Differential turnouts aren't
really very common, you know. But this year, Democratic voters seem
to be in a sulk, and the Republicans act like they'd turn out even
if it snowed on Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Big gains might embolden Republican legislators in their pursuit
of Clinton. But the political terrain is tricky. After November,
both parties will have to play to the 2000 electorate _ larger,
spread more broadly across the economic scale, and less intensely
partisan _ and that might have a tempering effect on the zeal of
the Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed terms of the case developed by the inquiry, and how
it is developed, will have an impact as well. Unshakeable as the
preconceptions of many committee members sounded Monday, experience
suggests that over a long period, some of them and some others in
the House will change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton and Monica Lewinsky are called as witnesses, their
deportment will certainly influence some representatives. How they
and their interrogators behave will influence voters as well.
Clinton is a formidable persuader, and any attempt to break down
his testimony would run the risk of alienating people who would
sense disrespect for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A foreign crisis _ a genuine foreign crisis, as opposed to one
that the administration was suspected of inventing _ could
radically change the context of the inquiry, too. Republicans might
find themselves under fire for distracting the commander in chief
from important security responsibilites.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the topics other than Ms. Lewinsky that Starr has
investigated? Hyde insisted Monday night that the independent
counsel was still pursuing the original Whitewater matter and other
controversies; one of the committee's ranking Democrats, Rep.
Barney Frank of Massachusetts, insisted that no more would be
forthcoming from Starr. Ambiguity keeps the pot boiling; wrapping
up the other cases would take some of the steam out of the House
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   All of those ideas, all of those possibilities will be in the
air as the House debates impeachment in November and December.
Depending on how they coalesce, the Republican leadership might or
might not be receptive to a compromise, either before a committee
vote or after a committee vote to approve articles of impeachment,
before ratification by the House as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   At any time, of course, Clinton could change his mind and decide
to resign. Nixon's decision to quit came after the committee had
voted. But it was motivated by the emergence of new evidence (the
``smoking gun'') more than the vote itself, plus the belief he
could not win in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides say he would rather be a second Andrew Johnson,
surviving in the Senate by a tiny margin, than a second Richard
Nixon. As things now stand, he would appear to have a good chance
of getting the 34 votes he would need (one-third of the total plus
one) to win a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not chiseled in stone, either. The Republicans could
have 60 seats by the time the case reached the Senate. In that
case, if they lost none of their own partisans, a switch of only
seven Democrats would doom Clinton. A remote possibility,
certainly, but then so much of what has happened so far in this
case seemed highly improbable until it happened.
