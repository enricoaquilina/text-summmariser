   CHICAGO _ She says he is ``duplicitous,'' a ``wolf in sheep's
clothing'' who has resorted to ``scuzzball'' campaign tactics in
the past. He has described her as ``shrill,'' claims she ``has
nothing positive to say about her own record'' and that her career
has been ``obscured by numerous scandals and controversies.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate race between the incumbent Democrat, Carol
Moseley-Braun, and state Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, a conservative
Republican, has become one of the most tensely watched campaigns in
the country. And with less than a month to go, the candidates have
dropped all pretense of keeping the gloves on.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll, published last week in The Chicago Tribune,
suggests that Ms. Moseley-Braun, elected in 1992 as a radiantly
rising star, is in serious election trouble. She lagged behind
Fitzgerald by 10 percentage points, with more voters saying they
believed Fitzgerald was the more honest and trustworthy candidate.
The poll, which had a margin of error of 3 percentage points, also
suggested that she has lost considerable support among suburban
women, one of the main groups that swept her into office six years
ago in what became known as the ``Year of the Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Dogged by a series of missteps and poor judgments in her
personal and political life, Ms. Moseley-Braun, 51, who was
catapulted from an obscure Cook County office to become the
nation's first black female senator, has had trouble getting voters
to focus on her legislative accomplishments. And she has been
soundly outspent by Fitzgerald, a 37-year-old multimillionaire from
the Chicago suburbs who inherited his family banking fortune and
spent $7 million of his own money on the Republican primary alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I not handled my own publicity and image making as well
as I could have?'' Ms. Moseley-Braun said in an interview.
``There's no question about that. Have I not handled the politics
as well as I could have? No question. But I certainly have worked
as hard as I can. I've got a great legislative record. And with all
the things that have been thrown at me, none of them has stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, considered so conservative that most Republican
leaders supported his moderate opponent in the bitterly contested
primary, has wasted no opportunity to try to make Ms.
Moseley-Braun's mistakes stick and to deflect her characterization
of him as an extremist by painting her as an ineffectual liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although her career has been somewhat obscured by numerous
scandals and controversies, those who have noticed her voting
record have noticed it is very extreme,'' Fitzgerald said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, these are tough times for Illinois Democrats.
In the hotly contested race to replace Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican
who is retiring, Glenn Poshard, a Democratic congressman from
downstate Illinois, trailed George Ryan, the Republican Secretary
of State, by 22 percentage points in The Tribune's poll.
</P>
<P>
   Poshard has alienated liberal Democrats with his opposition to
abortion rights and some gay rights issues, as well as his past
votes against gun control and environmental measures. And he has
tried without much success to tar Ryan with a scandal in which
employees of the secretary of state's office are accused of taking
bribes in return for granting truck licenses, and using some of the
bribe money to support Ryan and other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats running for other offices, even those in heavily
Democratic Cook County, are running into trouble, too. This year,
the state legislature eliminated straight-party voting in Illinois,
long considered a boon to Democrats. And although Democrats are
hoping that the efforts of congressional Republicans to impeach
President Clinton may spur Democrats to the polls in a kind of
backlash, so far the president's problems have not helped matters
and could lower turnout among Democratic voters. ( Poshard even
stayed away from a Chicago fund-raiser on his behalf which Clinton
attended).
</P>
<P>
   All of that is making things harder for Ms. Moseley-Braun in a
race that has her looking more like a challenger than an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought she was going to be in a tough race, even
against Fitzgerald, but I didn't think it was going to be this
tough,'' said Dawn Clark Netsch, a Democrat who ran for governor in
1994.

   The senator had to press hard to get Fitzgerald to agree to a
debate, which was held on Sunday. After it was over, she said she
had not expected him to try to ``paint himself as a centrist'' and
said, ``I could have made him show his true colors better.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, for his part, said the senator sounded ``shrill'' in
the debate and that she ``wasn't even able to understand what I was
talking about when I was talking about Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had hoped Fitzgerald would win the primary because
they believed his conservative views would make him easier to
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, who started running for the state legislature soon
after he finished law school, believes his wealth has allowed him
to be more independent in his political views. He opposes abortion,
even in cases of rape or incest, sponsored a bill signed into law
by Edgar that bans same-sex marriages and would screen gay people
out of the military. He would use the federal budget surplus to
provide tax cuts, while Ms. Moseley-Braun would use it to shore up
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun, who sits on the Senate Finance Committee, has
concentrated on cleaning up polluted industrial sites in cities,
fixing decrepit school buildings, improving pension laws for women
and fighting for tax breaks on airline tickets and ethanol, issues
important in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   But from the start, she has also had to fend off accusations
that she misused an inheritance instead of reimbursing Medicaid for
her mother's care, ignored accusations of sexual harassment against
her 1992 campaign manager and former fiance, Kgosie Matthews, and
that she and Matthews spent tens of thousands of campaign dollars
on personal travel, clothes, jewelry and stereo equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Although no investigation found any criminal wrongdoing and Ms.
Moseley-Braun has acknowledged making mistakes in judgment, she has
not been able to shake what she calls her ``negatives.'' A few
weeks ago, when George Will raised these issues in his column, the
senator lost her temper, used a racial slur to portray herself as a
victim of racism and compared Will to a member of the Ku Klux Klan,
forcing her to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows that she's in a dogfight. Most incumbents don't want
to debate,'' said Paul Green, a professor of political science at
Governors State University in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In the remaining weeks of the campaign, Ms. Moseley-Braun, a
charismatic campaigner, said she will work hard to reach
disaffected supporters. Her campaign has raised about $6 million
(compared to the $10 million Fitzgerald has already spent) and has
scheduled fund-raisers with Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago, Clinton
and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked myself already into bad health,'' said Ms.
Moseley-Braun, who was treated last week for bronchial pneumonia at
a Texas hospital after she fell ill on a flight to Dallas. ``I'm
doing everything I know how.''
