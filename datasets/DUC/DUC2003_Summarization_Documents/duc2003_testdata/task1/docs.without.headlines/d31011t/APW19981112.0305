	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The price of cooking oil in the
Philippines has risen drastically this month because of retailers
speculating on a shortfall in copra production, the government said
Thursday.
	   Norberto Boceta, deputy administrator of the Philippine Coconut
Authority, said the price of cooking oil has jumped by as much as
50 percent this month from prices posted in the first quarter.
	   Boceta said in a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry
that the increase was spurred by retailers speculating on a
``perceived copra production shortfall due to the effects of El
Nino and the two super typhoons.''
	   Coconut oil is the main ingredient in cooking oil manufactured
in the Philippines. It is extracted from copra, the dried white
meat of the coconut.
	   The country's copra production is expected to drop below 2
million metric tons this year as a result of the drought brought by
the El Nino weather phenomenon, which hit coconut farms during the
latter part of 1997.
	   The two typhoons that recently hit the country, Zeb and Babs,
have also hurt coconut crops. Babs, in particular, ravaged the
Bicol region, a large coconut-producing area.
	   With hefty 1997 carry-over stocks gradually depleting, the
losses brought by El Nino and the typhoons are now affecting the
supply of copra.
	   Boceta said speculator activity also takes into account that the
last quarter of the year ordinarily is a lean harvest season.
	   But Boceta is confident that the inflated market will soon give
way to supply and demand dynamics.
	   A spokeswoman for the coconut administration office said the
price increase only affects local consumers and that the situation
is likely to normalize in a few weeks.
