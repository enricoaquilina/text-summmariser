WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic Friday formally joined NATO at a ceremony held in the
city of Independence, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
At the Harry Truman Library in Independence, the three foreign
ministers of Bronislaw Geremek of Poland, Janos Martonyi of
Hungary and Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic signed formal
documents of accession.
</P>
<P>
In speeches before the signing ceremony, the ministers said
their countries saw NATO membership as an assurance of security
and recognition of their rightful place in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Kavan said the Czech Republic would no longer become "the
powerless victim of a foreign invasion."
</P>
<P>
Martonyi called Hunragy's admission in NATO "returning to her
natural habitat," saying: "It has been our manifest destiny to
rejoin those with whom we share the same values, interests and
goals."
</P>
<P>
And Geremek said it was "a great day for Poland and for the
world."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright accepted admission
papers from the three countries' foreign ministers, marking their
formal entry into the 50-year-old Western alliance. "Hallelujah,"
exclaimed Albright, a daughter of Czechoslovakia, who as a child
fled her native land and later became a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the ceremony, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
said that the accession of the three countries..."is perhaps the
clearest demonstration of the fact that Europe is growing closer
together."
</P>
<P>
"Extending membership to these three democracies helps to
stabilize a region that historically has been the staging ground
for many of the disasters of this century," Solana added,
referring to the two world wars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department has said the three new members
"enhance NATO's ability to fulfill its core mission of collective
defense, respond to a range of security challenges and reduce the
possibility of another major conflict in Europe of the kind that
has claimed so many American lives."
