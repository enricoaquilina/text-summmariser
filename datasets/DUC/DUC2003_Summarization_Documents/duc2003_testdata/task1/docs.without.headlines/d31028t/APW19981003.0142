	   Things could have been worse. Georges flirted with catastrophic
150 mph (240 kph) winds over the Atlantic, but entered the
Caribbean near Guadeloupe in a somewhat diminished state.
	   Still, by the time Georges left Cuba four days and 1,200 miles
(1,900 kilometers) later, even the usually stoic National Weather
Service was calling Georges ``the hurricane that just won't die.''
	   A high pressure system dubbed the Bermuda High kept Georges on
its destructive east-to-west track, said meteorologist Jim Lushine
at the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   So instead of striking an island or two and then spinning
northward out of the region as hurricanes generally do, Georges hit
again and again.
	   It smashed public housing in Antigua, swamped the beaches of
Guadeloupe and splintered the glass walls of St. Kitts' new airport
terminal.
	   ``Hurricane mash up my life,'' Verna McHenry said through tears
while she picked through the soiled, sodden remains of her home on
Antigua.
	   In Puerto Rico, where three people were killed, the squatter
community of Diamond Point kept its dazzling hilltop view of the
sea but little else. Georges smashed its dozens of squatter homes.
In its wake, strangers and neighbors banded together to clear
debris, stand in tedious lines for ice, water, propane and
batteries and carry food to the needy.
	   Crossing the Mona Passage, Georges bore down on Hispaniola, an
impoverished island of 15 million shared by Haiti and the Dominican
Republic. Its substandard housing proved no match for 110 mph (177
kph) winds, and emergency officials seemed unprepared for the
disaster.
	   Fed by up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, rivers swelled
into mile-wide (1 1/2-kilometer-wide) torrents that swamped
villages, entombed dozens of people under tons of mud in a
Dominican shelter and left thousands stranded for days. Helicopters
had to drop food rations to survivors.
	   In Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital, officials opened some
shelters only after Georges was pelting the city with sheets of
rain and dangerous flying debris.
	   ``They were overconfident,'' said Hugh Parmer, head of disaster
relief for the U.S. Agency for International Development. ``When
the thing hit, they were totally unprepared to respond.''
	   The United States shipped more than dlrs 500,000 of supplies,
including plastic sheeting to roof thousands of homes. U.S.
helicopters are helping deliver supplies to victims.
	   Authorities also seemed unprepared in Haiti, where heavy rain
flooded the Artibonite Valley, the country's breadbasket.
	   ``We're trying to save what we can,'' said farmer Jean Roberto
Jean-Baptiste, working in a flooded rice paddy.
	   Georges left Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation,
utterly dependent on foreign aid to help storm victims. The
Dominican Republic, considered one of the region's up-and-coming
economic and political players, suffered a blow to its development.
	   Fidel Castro seemed relieved in Cuba, where only five people
were killed after evacuations to safe zones. ``The first victory
was to reduce the losses,'' Castro proclaimed.
	   The same can't be said for the Dominican Republic.
	   Asked how many people died in his country, the Dominican health
undersecretary, Victor Terrero, replied: ``I'll confess something
to you. I have no idea.''
