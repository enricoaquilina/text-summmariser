shadow over Caribbean sugar - The region, faced with high costs and low
productivity, relies on guaranteed market access

THE COLLAPSE of Barbados' sugar industry late last month is the latest
indication of the sometimes terminal difficulties which beset Caribbean
producers. The region is faced with high production costs and often low
productivity, and is unable to survive without guaranteed access to markets
such as the European Community and the US, and which pay higher than
prevailing world market prices.
The problems caused by inefficiency and indebtedness are exacerbated by what
many producers see as a threat to current preferential market arrangements.
Many are worried by the recent reduction in US import quotas, and are
uncertain how they will fare if the North American Free Trade Agreement is
implemented and Mexican production becomes a market factor.
In the case of Barbados, the island has been unable to produce enough even
to meet its quota obligations to these guaranteed markets. Efforts are under
way to jump-start the industry after the state-owned Barbados National Bank,
exercising tighter credit control as part of a government austerity
programme, and which is owed Dollars 50m by the industry, suspended all
further loans.
This followed production of 55,000 tonnes from the 1992 harvest, the lowest
in 60 years, according to official figures. In order to make use of its
opportunities on the EC and US markets the island has had to import sugar to
meet domestic demand. Ironically, the collapse of the industry came after
indications that it was being put under new management by Booker Tate, a
subsidiary of Booker, the UK food and farming group.
The company has become an important factor in the region's troubled sugar
industry, and has been called in to help the industries in Guyana, Belize
and St Kitts-Nevis, and to run two of Jamaica's nine mills. Trinidad and
Tobago is the only producer in the Commonwealth Caribbean in which Booker
Tate is not involved. In all cases the company contracted to give corporate
management and technical services to sugar industries in the five countries.
It provides engineers, technologists, agriculturalists, economists,
marketing specialists and support staff.
The industries in both Guyana and Jamaica have attracted financial
assistance from multilateral institutions as a result of the management
contracts given to Booker Tate, But assessments to the company's
effectiveness differ in the two countries. Jamaican officials say the
performance of the two mills managed by the company since 1985 has been
'disappointing'.
Yet the case of Guyana shows that the regional sugar industry is not beyond
redemption. From output of 330,000 tonnes a year in the mid-1970s, Guyana's
production, plagued by labour unrest and poor weather, slumped to 135,000
tonnes in 1990. The industry declared shortfalls on its European Community
quota for three years, and shipped none of its quota to the US. Booker
Tate's takeover of the management of the industry has been followed,
however, by a decisive turnaround. Production is up this year and export
quotas have been met.
In the Dominican Republic, the region's second largest producer after Cuba,
the problems of financial viability have been compounded by a shortage of
labour. Foreign criticism of the treatment of workers from neighbouring
Haiti, and the subsequent expulsion of thousands of Haitian workers, has
resulted in the state-owned producer suffering a painful drop in output.
Production this year is 8 per cent less than the 326,000 tonnes of last year
and sugar has had to be imported to meet domestic demand.
The outlook for the industry, like that of others in the region, has been
depressed by the recent reduction in global imports by the US. The
Caribbean's cumulative quota has been reduced by 11 per cent to 276,341
tonnes, causing an estimated Dollars 15m reduction in earnings. It is the
second consecutive cut for the Caribbean holders of US quotas, which were
allowed to supply 471,710 tonnes in 1991.
Sugar industry officials in the region say one area of uncertainty is
Mexico's future access to the US market under the Nafta. They say Mexico's
current and modest US quota of 7,500 tonnes a year can be increased 20-fold
in seven years, at the expense of existing suppliers.
Cuba's troubled industry has received a fillip with a new trade agreement
between the island and the Russian republic. Cuba will receive 23m barrels
of Russian oil a year for 2m tonnes of sugar - significantly less than the
country had sold in past years to the former Soviet Union. But the island's
economic problems have depressed output this year to just over 6.9m tonnes.
