  [Text] Havana, 14 Jan (NOTIMEX) [dateline as received) -- 
The Cuban Government has affirmed that in 1994 there will be a 
solution to the current economic crisis overwhelming the country 
and expressed its hopes for a reactivation of a greater 
sugarcane harvest. 
  Politburo members of the ruling Communist Party of Cuba 
(PCC) 
have felt the recession will bottom out in the middle of the 
year, but they urged the people to work more efficiently and 
save the scant available resources. 
  "Cuba has the perspective of recovery, and the current and 
next sugarcane harvests will be decisive in this endeavor," 
Carlos Lage, Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers 
secretary, has stated during a meeting with leaders of the sugar 
sector. According to the strategy of the current economic 
reforms, only the sugarcane harvest will provide the necessary 
resources to come out of the "special period in peacetime," as 
the crisis and the measures to alleviate it are called. 
  During the past season of its main industry, Cuba registered 
the lowest production in three decades (4.2 million tons), 
something President Fidel Castro has publicly called a disaster. 
According to Lage, the 1994 to 1995 harvest will be greater 
than this year's. Castro estimated in late December that the 
current harvest will be a few hundred tons greater than the 1992 
to 1993 harvest. 
  Since the disappearance of the Socialist Bloc and the Soviet 
Union earlier this decade, Cuba has been going through a 
profound crisis, with shortages of food, fuel, medicine, 
transportation, and other basic consumer goods. Havana has 
blamed the heightened U.S. economic and commercial embargo as 
the other cause of its woes. 
  The last session of the National Assembly has indicated that 
the surplus of money in circulation--estimated at more than 12 
billion pesos--and the budget deficit of approximately 4.2 
billion pesos constitute the two crucial problems to be resolved 
immediately. In government books, the Cuban peso is at par with 
the U.S. dollar, but in the flourishing black market the dollar 
sells from between 70 to 80 pesos. The surplus of money in 
circulation has led to a greater drop in efficiency, 
productivity, discipline, and interest in work. 
  According to an official report, during 1993 almost 40 
percent of the disciplinary measures applied against workers 
were prompted by unjustified absences and an interruption of 
working hours, something that has been compounded by 
"negligence, disobedience, and borderline criminal conducts." 
With the state coffers almost without hard currency, without 
international sources of credit, the alarming government 
statistics also show that only 31 percent of the state 
enterprises are profitable. 
  "During the second half a favorable change must be 
noticeable 
in the improvement of internal finances," and the amount of fuel 
will be greater, Politburo member Jorge Lezcano has stated. 
Cuba will exchange 1.5 million tons of sugar for 4 million tons 
of oil, according to an agreement signed with Russia. Lezcano 
has said there are greater possibilities of moving ahead in 
1994, although he admitted that in essence the same economic 
programs of 1993 will be maintained. These programs caused a 
deterioration in the people's lives. 
  Meanwhile, the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC) is apparently 
going to claim the responsibility for the new economic 
adjustment measures that have a high social cost, which the 
assembly will adopt to improve internal finances. The CTC is 
holding meetings at labor centers where speakers have suggested 
actions to reactive the shaky economy. 
  The sale of "bonds for the fatherland" (without interest), 
ceasing gratuities and subsidies, taxes, higher electricity 
rates, and the confiscation of wealth obtained "in an illicit 
manner" are some of the proposals. Economists say the true 
solution to the money surplus in the hands of the people is to 
increase production and offer industrial, farming, and service 
goods. 
  "This process of consultation will make it possible to bring 
a consensus to the next meeting of the National Assembly," CTC 
Secretary General Pedro Ross has said on state-owned television. 
Analysts feel the government expects that out of these meetings 
will come the major guidelines of the adjustment program, which 
includes a reduction of the bloated state apparatus and 
inevitable quota of greater unemployment. 
  Government officials recognize the priority of some of the 
proposals but say the achievements of the Cuban socialist 
system, such as in the health field and free education, will be 
maintained at any rate. The new measures will give continuity 
to the reform package begun in August 1993 by the government 
passing a law that will allow the free circulation of foreign 
currency, allowing self- employment and creating cooperatives 
for inefficient state farming.
