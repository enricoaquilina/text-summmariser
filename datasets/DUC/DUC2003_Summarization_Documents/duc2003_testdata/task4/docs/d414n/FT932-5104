on the run

THE LONDON Metal Exchange copper market this week staged its first
substantial rally since it went into free-fall in mid-April.
The upturn, which began after an initial post-holiday dip to Dollars 1,785 a
tonne for three months metal, was stalled for a while by resistance around
the Dollars 1,850 area; but when this barrier was breached on Thursday fresh
momentum was provided as investors who had gambled on further falls
scrambled to cover their short positions.
That pattern was continued yesterday morning, when the three months delivery
position peaked at Dollars 1,940 a tonne, but as bearish fundamentals were
underlined by another rise in LME warehouse stocks to a fresh nine-year high
profit-taking pared the price back to Dollars 1,855 a tonne at the end of
after-hours trading, down Dollars 10 on the day and up Dollars 60 on the
week. The sterling quotation, which was given an extra boost by the pound's
weakness, had closed afternoon ring trading at Pounds 1,262.25 a tonne, up
Pounds 101.75 on the week.
Dealers said the market's strength had been bolstered by concern about
possible supply disruptions in the US and Chile. Labour contracts at Phelps
dodge's Chino mine, Asarco's Ray mine and RTZ Corporation's Bingham Canyon
all expire at the end of this month; while in Chile, unions at Chuquicamata,
the world's biggest copper mine, on Wednesday rejected the first offer of a
new two-year contract from Codelco, the state-owned mining corporation.
Meanwhile Asarco and Phelps Dodge executives told institutional investors in
London this week that a sharp increase in US copper demand was far
outweighing the downturn in Europe.
Mr Richard Osborne, Asarco's chairman, predicted that, as a result of this
and of modestly reduced exports from former Soviet bloc countries, stocks in
LME and New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) warehouses would begin to fall
in the second half of this year.
He was less hopeful about the outlook for zinc as stocks were so high that
it would take a long time for price-induced production cuts to make a
significant impact on them.
Nevertheless copper's more bullish sentiment spilled over into the LME zinc
market this week and the three months price, which dipped to a six-year low
of Dollars 937 a tonne on Tuesday, recovered to touch Dollars 970 yesterday,
before closing at Dollars 968.50 a tonne, up Dollars 2 on the week.
Lead's slide to record lows in real terms was halted in mid-week after two
more smelters announced production cuts. Nuova Samim, the Italian
state-owned group, said it would close its Portovesme smelter for two months
at a production cost of 30,000 tonnes, while MIM Holdings of Australia
revealed that it planned to reduce output by 3,000 tonnes at its Britannia
Refined Metals plant in Northfleet, UK, by shutting secondary (recycling)
furnaces. These cuts take recently announced output reductions to between
160,000 and 200,000 tonnes a year.
Although analysts thought a retrenchment of this order was bound to
influence market sentiment before long the market's initial reaction was
hesitant, with the price slide being halted rather than reversed. On
Thursday, however, LME quotations started to move upwards and at yesterday's
close three months lead was at Pounds 275.75 a tonne, up Pounds 8 on the
week and Pounds 10.25 above Tuesday's low.
Aluminium put in a robust performance, shrugging off the continuing flow of
metal into bulging LME warehouses and news early in the week that labour
contracts had been agreed at Aluminium Company of America, the world's
biggest producer, and Reynolds Metals, also of the US, the third biggest,
thus averting the threat of serious supply disruptions.
Tuesday's price decline was reversed on the following day and Thursday saw
the three months price break through resistance above the Dollars
1,150-a-tonne mark. That allowed buyers to get the upper hand yesterday,
when three months metal closed at Dollars 1,169.25 a tonne, up Dollars 17 on
the day and Dollars 19 on the week.
At the London bullion market the gold price retreated to just above Dollars
370 a troy ounce in mid-week and traders were talking of a test of support
in the Dollars 366 area. But continental buyers were back in the market on
Thursday and by yesterday's after noon fix the price had recovered to
Dollars 377.60 an ounce.
At that point traders were looking forward to a successful test of
resistance at Dollars 378, but in the event the price slid back Dollars 3 to
end Dollars 5.15 down on the week.
Cuba brought the sugar market back to life yesterday with a force majeure
declaration that pushed the New York market's October futures price, which
had been easing, up by 0.66 of a cent a lb at one stage. In late trading the
rise had been trimmed to 0.55 at 11.33 cents a lb.
The Cuban move, which refers to June shipments, was reported to have been
prompted by the recent torrential rain, which has made extremely difficult
to move sugar to the ports.
Bad weather had already hit the Cuban sugar-cane crop, as had shortages of
inputs and fuel caused in part by the break-up of the Soviet Union, the
island republic's ally and main customer for sugar. Last week Cubazucar, the
state sugar agency announced that the 1992-93 crop would reach only about
4.2m tonnes, down from 7m tonnes in the previous year.
