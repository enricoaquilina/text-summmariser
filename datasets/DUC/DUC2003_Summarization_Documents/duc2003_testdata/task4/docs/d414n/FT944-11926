sector - A look at problems dogging the mainstay of the country's economy

Cuba's sugar harvest, mainstay of the island's economy, could soon begin to
level out after its recent nosedive, but a return to cruising altitude looks
a long way off.
Just five years ago output was running at a comfortable 8m tonnes a year.
But then it went into a tailspin. The crop fell to a historic low of 4m
tonnes in 1993-94 from 4.2m tonnes in 1992-93 and 7m tonnes the previous
year.
This represented lost export earnings over two harvests of Dollars 1bn, a
heavy blow for a sugar-dominated, recession-hit economy whose total export
revenue in 1993 was an estimated Dollars 1.7 bn.
Faced with continuing severe input shortages and a reduced level of
harvestable cane, the best Cuba can hope for from the 1994-95 season is to
slow the decline in its leading export industry. If it can do this, the
island may be able to lay some foundations for a future recovery. But it
will be a hard slog.
Sugar market analysts, such as London trade house ED &amp; F. Man, have already
predicted that Cuban output will continue to fall in 1994-95. Even the Cuban
authorities, normally loath to make any public pre-harvest forecasts, are
signalling that they expect a crop as low as or lower than last year.
'This is not a time for spectacular results measured in large volumes of
sugar,' the official workers' daily Trabajadores said in an October 10
editorial.
'Sugar production suffers from a syndrome of cycles, either good or bad. . .
if you had a bad previous harvest, recovery is difficult,' said Mr Juan
Triana Cordovi, deputy director of Havana University's Centre for Studies on
the Cuban Economy.
It was the sudden collapse after 1990 of crucial Soviet supplies of fuel,
fertiliser, herbicides and spares that knocked Cuban sugar production off
course. Recent harvests have also been buffeted by unseasonal bad weather
and slowed by declining efficiency.
The antidote proposed by Mr Nelson Torres, Cuba's minister for sugar, is a
short, sharp and above all efficient 1994-95 harvest.
This year's campaign, if it starts this month as usual, will not be allowed
to extend beyond April. In another change of strategy, all of Cuba's more
than 150 mills will be required to join the harvest to maximise production.
Last season, more than a dozen below-par mills did not operate, with the
result that their machinery was 'cannibalised' for other uses and their work
forces dispersed.
The over-extended 1993-94 harvest, which lasted well beyond May, cut into
growing cane reserves and delayed field cultivation and mill repairs. Mill
managers, struggling to meet pre-set production targets and to compensate
for industrial breakdowns and inefficiency, harvested cane that could have
been left for the coming season.
Granma, the official Communist Party newspaper, said in a September 2
article: 'There is going to be once again - it's no secret - a serious
shortage of cane'. That echoed an August, ED &amp; F. Man report warning that
the protracted 1993-94 campaign, continuing input shortages and reports of
delays in the planting programme meant that 'further degradation of (Cuba's)
sugar production cannot be eliminated'.
As the start of the harvest approaches, sugar workers have been the target
of a blitz of official criticism. State media have accused them of ducking
out of eight-hour work schedules, using poor quality seed and failing to
weed growing cane. 'Why is the cane in such poor state. . . so full of
weeds?' state-run Radio Rebelde asked back in September.
Especially targetted for criticism were the cane growing co-operatives, the
so-called basic units of co-operative production (UBPCs), created in
September, 1993 as part of a decentralising reform of Cuba's state-run
farming system. 'Why have these UBPCs still not been able to contain and
reverse the sharp collapse of the nation's greatest resource?' Mr
Trabajadores said six weeks ago.
Reasons cited for poor productivity in the cane co-operatives were the lack
of incentives, delays in obtaining promised benefits like new housing and
even shortages of work clothes like boots. Government officials were
studying the possibility of introducing greater material incentives for
sugar workers - whether in local or hard currency or in access to consumer
goods - like those already available for workers in Cuba's tourist industry.
To offset harvest manpower shortages, Cuba's official trade union
organisation, the CTC, is preparing to mobilise 61,000 cane cutters across
the island, 25,000 more than last year. This manual cutting force will also
help to compensate for cutbacks in machine harvesting resulting from
shortages of fuel, lubricants and spare parts.
On the commercial front, Cuba has maintained a hermetic silence over the
state of its strategic sugar trade contracts with Russia and China. Traders
in London and New York reported as early as June that the country might have
problems meeting all of its export commitments because of the second
consecutive low harvest. The Cubans were expected to have sought to roll
over many of their commitments into the next crop period, a tactic widely
used even when the island was producing harvests of about 8m tonnes.
The roll-over mechanism is considerably less drastic than the force majeure
declared by Cuba in June, 1993, when torrential rains devastated an already
flagging harvest.
