CUBA'S SUGAR crop is at best likely to be 6.5m tonnes in 1991-92, about 1.1m
tonnes less than in 1990-91, according to a group of sugar experts who
gathered together in the Dominican republic under the auspices of the
(moderate) Cuban exile group, Sociedad Economica de los Amigos del Pais.
The experts - who included a senior official from the US Department of
Agriculture, analysts from FO Licht, the German sugar statistics agency,
Scudder Group, Czarnikow, the London trade house, and assorted academics -
believed that Cuba failed to harvest any sugar in the last two months of
1991. This would reduce the seasonal (November-June) harvest by between
300,000 and 1m tonnes.
In January harvesting appears to have been very slow. Even if the weather
holds up, the experts agreed that Cuba would be lucky to produce 6.5m tonnes
this year, given the shortages of spare parts, poor maintenance of
equipment, and problems in the field. The onset of rain would push the
forecast even lower, said Mr Gerry Hagelberg, of FO Licht.
In November the USDA estimated that Cuba's production would reach 7.3m
tonnes. Mr Peter Buzzanell, the official responsible for estimates,
suggested that the department would formally revise its estimate downwards
as early as this week.
The drop of production, if it materialises, will hit Cuba's battered economy
hard - for the first time it is having to sell sugar (usually 75 per cent of
exports) at world, rather than preferential prices. But it will come as
welcome news to the world sugar market, which has been bracing itself for a
flood of sugar after the collapse of Cuba's barter trade with the
former-Soviet Union.
In the nine months to last September, Cuba exported 6.15m tonnes of sugar,
of which 3.7m tonnes went to the Soviet Union, 740,000 tonnes to China,
about 500,000 tonnes to Japan and Canada and the remainder to assorted
countries. In the full year Cuba promised to send the Soviet Union 4m tonnes
of sugar in return for 10m tonnes of oil and other products. (An exchange
that valued Cuban sugar at about 24 cents a lb, compared with a world price
of 8 cents a lb).
This year, however, Cuba has had to renegotiate with ex-Soviet Union states.
So far Russia has agreed to buy (with oil) 500,000 tonnes of Cuban sugar,
with an option to buy another 500,000 tonnes; Kazakhstan will take another
200,000 tonnes, with an option for 200,000 tonnes; and Latvia 50,000 tonnes.
Cuba will thus have to find a home for about 1.5m tonnes of sugar that in
the past went to the Soviet Union, assuming production at the lower 6.5m
tonnes (and exports at around 5.4m tonnes), and the options fully taken up.
Some of this excess sugar will go to other ex-Soviet states that have yet to
sign trade agreements with Cuba, and, says Mr Hagelberg, perhaps as much as
400,000 tonnes to Iran and South Korea.
Nevertheless the world markets could still be expected to absorb about 1m
tonnes of extra Cuban sugar this year - unless Cuba's crop deteriorates
still further.
