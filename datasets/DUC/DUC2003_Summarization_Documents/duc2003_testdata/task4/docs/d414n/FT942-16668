Cuba is to sell an unspecified quantity of sugar to China this year, amid
indications that the yield from the shortened 1994 harvest will be less than
the government had previously expected.
The sale is part of a wider trade agreement between the two countries, under
which Cuba will purchase Chinese food and medicine, according to Prensa
Latina, the official Cuban news agency.
Diplomats in Havana, the island's capital, said this week that the Cuban
government was now estimating sugar production this year at 'no more than 5m
tonnes', following last year's 4.2m tonnes.
They said government officials had spoken at the start of the harvest of a
likely yield of 1m tonnes more than last year.
The current harvest has been shortened by the government, which wants it
concluded at the end of April to allow more time for planting additional
acreage for future harvests, as part of efforts to rehabilitate the
industry.
Zambia's industry is to receive technical and industrial assistance from
Cuba, under an agreement in principle between both countries. Cuba will help
Zambia with sugar production and the development of a range of bi-products,
according to Zambia's foreign minister who visited Cuba last week.
