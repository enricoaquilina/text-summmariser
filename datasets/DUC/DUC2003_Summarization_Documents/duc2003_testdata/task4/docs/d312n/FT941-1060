rescue - Clive Fewins on a business that is enjoying its own green shoots of

In the last days of the second world war 15-year-old John Drew drove a team
of shire horses on the fertile slopes above the village of Little Witley
near Worcester.
Today the same land produces some of the most hi-tech tomatoes in the
country - but the tomatoes never actually see soil.
They are grown in glasshouses in liquid using a system called hydroponics,
and computers control the watering.
In the past 50 years, Drew has grown a variety of vegetables, salad crops
and flowers on the now redundant soil beneath his glasshouses.
But two years ago the outlook turned bleak: a net profit of Pounds 702 on a
turnover of Pounds 336,000 meant something had to change. What changed was
the crop: Drew decided to produce only cherry tomatoes and things started to
look up.
'Last year was the first time for 10 years that our bank account actually
entered the black - for a short period,' said Drew. It soon entered the red
again when Drew, 65, and his partners - wife Mavis and son Paul, 36 -
installed a Pounds 53,000 half-acre glasshouse and a Pounds 5,000 watering
plant to expand their output for one of their three customers, J. Sainsbury,
the supermarket chain. Safeways and William Low, the northern supermarket,
are the others.
The crop is picked and packaged by a staff that varies from seven at this
time of the year, when the tomatoes are just ripening, to 16 in the summer.
The business - still known by its original name of Haven Nurseries - is
barely recognisable from the one that produced fruit, vegetable and salad
crops on two acres at the bottom of the hill in the early 1950s.
'In those days we worked extremely hard taking produce to the Birmingham
market at 5am, three days a week,' said Drew. 'But life was straightforward
then. If you worked hard, and produced good crops, you made a good profit.
As a plain country bloke who left school at 15 it seemed simple to me. How
things have changed.'
John and Mavis built glasshouses and increased the number of crops they
grew. The business expanded naturally from profits.
'It seems amazing nowadays but we managed without borrowing until 1974,' he
continued. In that year, they borrowed Pounds 2,800 to buy the four acres on
the hillside site where their house and main glasshouses now stand.
'We then used our newly-acquired overdraft to add our biggest glasshouse
yet. The price was Pounds 3,900. All seemed well, so we kept on putting in
glass and growing mainly lettuce and tomatoes. In 1975, when we added
another big glasshouse, things were still rosy, and we were sometimes able
to get up to 50 per cent of the glasshouse cost back using government
grants.
'It was when these grants ended, plus the crucial decision to put in heat,
which immediately added to our overdraft by Pounds 30,000, that things began
to get tight. However, we still managed to add another half acre of glass.
'But it was the end of the 1970s and interest rates had begun to rocket. We
were caught repaying borrowed money at rates of up to 17 per cent. To try
and counter this we added chrysanthemums to our list of crops and decided to
grow them in a big way. We planted up to 20,000 cuttings a week. We saw
chrysanthemums as our salvation as they gave us an alternative crop 48 weeks
of the year. There was healthy demand and a good good wholesale market. We
increased our staff and took on five full-timers, which added to the
overdraft.'
By 1980 the Drews had 3 1/2 acres under glass and half an acre under a
polythene tunnel, but things remained far from healthy.
'The Dutch were benefiting from much cheaper fuel, which gave them a big
price advantage, and we found increasingly that imports from Spain, the
Canary islands, Israel and even Colombia were hitting prices,' Drew said.
'Other flower producers - particularly those growing roses and carnations -
were going out of business.'
The Drews first grew a few cherry tomatoes in 1985. John had heard about
other growers' successes, and also of the plant's profitability. However, a
poor 1986 season plus a mounting overdraft stopped his plans to expand. He
was able to stabilise his cash flow when he changed from oil to coal and
negotiated fixed price contracts with British Coal.
Drew went on: 'By 1990 Chrysanthemum prices on the wholesale market were
lower than 10 years previously.'
The decision to switch entirely to cherry tomatoes was made in 1991. They
already devoted 1 1/2 acres to cherry tomatoes and they were showing a
profit. But the overdraft was up to Pounds 120,000 and the bank was not
happy.
'The only way was forward,' said Drew. 'We had been here all our lives, and
nobody would have wanted to buy the business at that time as so many others
were in the same boat.
'However, we urgently needed another Pounds 30,000 to replace a glasshouse
and to computerise all our cherry tomato production processes.
'We got the money. Fortunately we had a few savings, and our main suppliers
agreed to extend their period of credit from 30 to 60 days. We honoured the
new agreements but the upshot was that once all the new equipment was in
place we had to re-establish ourselves as customers. In future we knew we
had to pay up front, which meant another massive cash flow crisis.'
The Drews put their case to the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation which
agreed to advance Pounds 35,000 over 10 years at a fixed rate of 8.5 per
cent.
'We are now back to our agreed Pounds 90,000 bank overdraft, and profit at
the end of 1993 was Pounds 75,000 on a turnover of Pounds 508,000,' said
Drew. 'I don't think it is marvellous as it merely reflects the higher value
crop. But it is a great improvement on the last few years and I am pleased
we had the confidence to invest in the new half-acre glasshouse.'
