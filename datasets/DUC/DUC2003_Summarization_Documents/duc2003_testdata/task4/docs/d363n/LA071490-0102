The three-mile section of the Hollywood Freeway that was closed Friday because 
of the subway tunnel fire will not be reopened this weekend and might not be 
open for the Monday morning commute, California Highway Patrol officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A 150-foot section of the roof over the stricken tunnel collapsed to within 10 
feet of the freeway, and officials are concerned that heat from the fire might 
have weakened the 18- to 20-foot-thick wall of soil directly between the tunnel 
and the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Baxter, head of the state Department of Transportation district 
encompassing Los Angeles, said the agency would not be able to make any 
decisions about reopening the freeway until civil engineers were able to enter 
the tunnel and assess the strength of the soil above it. The fire directly 
under the freeway was extinguished Friday afternoon, but engineers were driven 
back by the heat when they attempted to enter the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
According to Los Angeles Fire Marshal Dave Parsons, engineers were planning to 
enter the tunnel Friday evening, if it had cooled sufficiently, to begin 
shoring it up with a timber frame. By mid-evening, however, the tunnel was 
still too hot for a thorough inspection. 
</P>
<P>
If the freeway segment remains closed Monday or later, it is expected to create 
problems for commuters because the route, U.S. 101, is the main artery linking 
downtown Los Angeles to Hollywood, the San Fernando Valley and Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The El Monte busway that runs adjacent to the Hollywood Freeway in that section 
will most likely be reopened by Monday, according to Dave Roper, deputy 
district director of Caltrans. The busway is 50 feet above the ground and 
officials are not particularly worried about its structural integrity. 
</P>
<P>
They did not reopen it immediately, however, because they feared that 
vibrations from traffic would be transmitted through the soil and cause more of 
the tunnel to collapse. It will not be reopened, Roper said, until the tunnel 
is shored up with timber. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers reported being concerned about the safety of the freeway because it 
is not built on bedrock in that area. Rather, it is supported by compacted 
earth and sand that have been injected with cement-like grouting for bonding. 
The bonded material is not as strong as either concrete or rock, and engineers 
feared that the bonding may have been weakened by the intense heat from the 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures inside the tunnel reached about 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel roof that collapsed had not been reinforced with grouting because 
there were no structures above it. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers took some of the bonded material -- from a section that had not been 
affected by heat -- to a laboratory where they planned to heat it and measure 
the loss of strength, if any. If that test shows little effect from the heat, 
Caltrans officials expressed more confidence about reopening the freeway 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Civil engineer Ed Kavazanjian of Earth Technologies Inc. in Los Angeles said 
that engineers have had little experience with the effects of heat on the 
grouting, but that "most likely" it would not be damaged by the heat. 
</P>
<P>
But the reopening date will not be determined, experts said, until engineers 
can get inside and inspect the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, they will be looking for any evidence of settling, which would be 
an immediate indication that the safety of the freeway is threatened. If no 
visible evidence of danger appears, they are expected to bore holes into the 
compacted material to assess its strength and to remove samples for testing. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway itself is almost certainly not damaged, officials said, because of 
the insulating properties of the soil between it and the tunnel.

METRO RAIL'S TROUBLED HISTORY 
</P>
<P>
September, 1986 -- The Southern California Rapid Transit District begins 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
January, 1987 -- Problems related to contaminated ground water and land 
acquisition delay construction for almost six months and raise cost $3 million 
to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
January, 1988 -- Discovery of contaminated soil at Union Station, apparently 
left behind by old coal gasification and synthetic rubber plants, forces 
realignment and delays construction nine more months. 
</P>
<P>
July, 1988 -- Six members of a DWP work team are injured in an underground 
explosion. The team was trying to reconnect a 4,800-volt line shut down 
temporarily for Metro Rail construction. 
</P>
<P>
July, 1988 -- An 83-year-old man who had walked away from a retirement home 
falls into a 23-foot-deep excavation at a Metro Rail site on 7th Street 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
August, 1988 -- An underground fiber-optic line is accidentally cut by a Metro 
Rail construction crew at 1st and Hill streets. Automatic bank teller machines 
and Inter-Track wagering at Santa Anita Race Track, and other services 
connected to Pacific Bell data lines, are affected. 
</P>
<P>
May, 1989 -- Two Metro Rail construction workers are slightly injured when part 
of a tunnel-digging machine collapses. 
</P>
<P>
June, 1989 -- One worker suffers smoke inhalation in a fire at a Metro Rail 
construction site beneath 1st and Hill streets. The fire began when an electric 
arc welder came into contact with wood and plastic. 
</P>
<P>
July, 1989 -- Dispute over soils data and RTD's construction plans causes a 
contractor to threaten a work stoppage and ends up costing the RTD an 
additional $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
September, 1989 -- An audit report reveals millions of dollars in Metro Rail 
funds had not been accurately accounted for by RTD bookkeepers and managers. 
</P>
<P>
October, 1989 -- Two Metro Rail workers are injured when a cable snaps as a 
construction locomotive hauls a piece of digging equipment. 
</P>
<P>
March, 1990 -- Los Angeles city firefighters rescue a Metro Rail worker who 
slipped and fell in a subway tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
April, 1990 -- Two underground workers are slightly injured when a rubber 
cement chute breaks and hits them at 5th and Hill streets. 
</P>
<P>
May, 1990 -- State Court of Appeal rules it is unconstitutional for RTD to have 
commercial property owners pay part of the construction costs for the first leg 
of the $3.6-billion subway.
