  [Text] Mecca, Saudi Arabia, May 23 (AFP)--Dozens of 
pilgrims were killed in a stampede Monday at the Muslim holy 
site here, witnesses said, as authorities confirmed the incident 
but gave no death toll. 
  The witnesses, who would not be identified, said they did 
not 
know how the tragedy on Monday afternoon occurred. 
  They said pilgrims had been trampled to death and bodies 
littered the site, while religious ceremonies were taking place. 
Saudi security forces were at the scene but ambulances were 
initially barred from access. 
  The incident occurred as the Saudi authorities were 
proclaiming the successful completion of this year's pilgrimage, 
in which more than two million Muslims took part. 
  But a Saudi health ministry statement broadcast by state 
television said later, "a total of 829 people died during the 
pilgrimage season this year, as a result of this afternoon's 
stampede and for other reasons such as heart attacks and old 
age." 
  It also said that 6,400 received hospital treatment as a 
result of sun stroke and fainting. 
  Before news of the stampede, King Fahd had sent a message to 
Pilgrimage Minister Mahmud Bin-Muhammad al-Safar praising the 
"success" of the annual event. 
  The pilgrimage to Mecca, a religious duty at least once on a 
lifetime for all Muslims who can afford it, officially began on 
May 20 this year but pilgrims began arriving several weeks 
beforehand. 
  In July 1990 more than 1,400 people were killed in a 
panic-stricken stampede in a tunnel near here. Most were 
Indonesian or Turkish.
