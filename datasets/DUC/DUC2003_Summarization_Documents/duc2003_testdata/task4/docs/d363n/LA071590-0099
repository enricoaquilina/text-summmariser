As fire smoldered for a second day in an unfinished downtown Los Angeles 
subway, engineers struggled Saturday to shore up the gutted underground tunnel 
in hopes of reopening the Hollywood Freeway by Monday morning's rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
State engineers visually inspected the freeway above the burned-out Metro Rail 
tunnel and judged it to be structurally sound. The roadway -- one of Los 
Angeles' most heavily traveled arteries -- was closed early Friday amid fears 
that the partially collapsed tunnel underneath it would cave in. 
</P>
<P>
Officials cautioned that the freeway, part of U.S. 101, will not be reopened 
until workers finish building braces designed to prevent the tunnel from caving 
in further. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying very hard to see if we can open up the freeway by Monday 
morning," said Steve Leung, traffic systems chief for Caltrans. A decision is 
not expected until tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The separate, elevated El Monte busway that runs alongside the freeway will be 
opened to auto traffic on Monday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said Saturday that they have found no evidence of arson but are 
continuing to investigate what caused the fire to erupt in an uncompleted 
section of tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said a crew may have been working with welding equipment several hours 
before the fire. Earlier this year, a small fire in the same tunnel complex was 
caused by sparks from welding, according to Metro Rail officials. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, about 43 hours after the fire began, it continued to smolder in 
a 200-foot southern section of the tunnel. Firefighters decided to let the fire 
burn itself out. 
</P>
<P>
When the northern end of the tunnel cooled down and was deemed safe to enter, 
repair work began beneath the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Enduring stifling heat, construction workers erected 12-foot sections of 
aluminum scaffolding to shore up a 250-foot portion of the charred tunnel. 
Wooden timbers and steel beams were added to hold the tunnel roof in place. 
</P>
<P>
It was a painstakingly slow process. By Saturday night, only a short section of 
the tunnel had been shored up by a small crew that worked methodically. An 
ambulance and four rescuers waited nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The construction is a temporary, emergency measure designed to strengthen the 
tunnel so it will withstand the weight of freeway traffic above, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire tunnel will have to be reconstructed," said Al Perdon, assistant 
general manager for the Southern California Rapid Transit District. "What we 
are building right now is a temporary structure to allow traffic to be restored 
to the freeway. . . . (The tunnel is) a big hole in the ground that has been 
burned out." 
</P>
<P>
Perdon said the enormous steel bands that encircle the tunnel were distorted 
and twisted by the heat, but retained their strength. 
</P>
<P>
The section of tunnel beneath the freeway, he said, did not cave in because 
soil surrounding it had been injected with chemical grout that bonded the dirt. 
Grouting was not used along the section of tunnel that collapsed because it 
runs beneath a largely deserted maintenance yard, Perdon said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials emphasized that the safety of construction crews and potential 
motorists would not be compromised. They added that they want to complete the 
repair work as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get this freeway open," an engineer close to the project said. 
"That's everybody's major concern." 
</P>
<P>
The stretch of freeway that is closed, a segment known as "the slot" between 
Mission Street and the four-level interchange, averages 210,000 vehicles a day 
and is a principal link into the heart of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're targeting for Monday, but we're not going to push the workers," Perdon 
said. "Our first concern is safety. . . . If we can open the freeway Monday, we 
will. If we can't, then we won't." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Roper, deputy director of Caltrans, said that if the freeway is not 
reopened on Monday, the elevated, single-lane busway will be used for all 
traffic, buses and cars. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials, discounting speculation that the blaze was started by 
transients, said in a news conference Saturday that investigators have not 
found evidence of arson. They said the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing that we have right now would lead us to believe that it's an arson 
fire," city Deputy Fire Chief Reynaldo Rojo said. "It's very slow. . . . Arson 
work is detective work." 
</P>
<P>
No one was working in the tunnel when the fire erupted about 1:50 a.m. Friday, 
officials said. A crew in an adjacent tunnel discovered the fire and escaped 
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to interviewing that crew, investigators said they plan to talk 
with members of another crew that had been working earlier in the tunnel that 
burned. This crew had finished its shift hours before the fire erupted. 
</P>
<P>
Sources told The Times that the crew may have been working with welders while 
installing a plastic lining used to keep toxic fumes out of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a small fire in the same tunnel complex was caused by sparks 
from welding, according to Metro Rail officials. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Ford, the Metro Rail's senior engineer for construction safety, said on 
Friday that a "very small fire" earlier this year in the same tunnel complex 
was started "as a result of a welding operation." 
</P>
<P>
In that case, he said, the embers smoldered for awhile before bursting into 
flames, even though workers had followed proper safety procedures and washed 
the welded area with water to extinguish any sparks after they finished work. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "there was no operation during the day (Thursday) that could 
account for this fire." 
</P>
<P>
Other sources said that workers who finished their shift late Thursday 
afternoon had been installing the plastic liner that blocks gases and moisture 
from entering the tunnel. As part of that work, the sources said, some welding 
does occur. 
</P>
<P>
Fire and Metro Rail officials said there was no indication of what caused the 
fire, whether it was welding or some other source. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a team working on this asking all these questions," said Neil 
Peterson, executive director of the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission. LACTC took over management of Metro Rail from the RTD last week. 
</P>
<P>
The fire represented the most serious setback to construction of the 
$1.4-billion, 4.4-mile Metro Rail subway system, a project already months 
behind schedule and millions of dollars over budget. But officials downplayed 
any effect the damage to the tunnel would have on the start-up date of the 
subway system. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel that burned will not be for passenger traffic, but will be used to 
carry empty trains between Union Station and a maintenance yard beside the Los 
Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
The smoke that billowed from the tunnel was moderately toxic. Scientists at the 
Air Quality Management District who monitored it said the levels of chromium 
and arsenic late Friday reached 20 times the safety exposure levels prescribed 
by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the levels have droped off to well below permitted levels, said 
AQMD spokesman Tom Eichorn. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the fire early Friday, flames had engulfed nearly 750 feet of 
the tunnel, which runs from Union Station, under the Hollywood Freeway and to a 
maintenance yard at the intersection of Center and Commercial streets. Several 
hours into the fire, a middle portion of the tunnel, about 150 feet long, caved 
in, dividing the tunnel into northern and southern sections. 
</P>
<P>
Fire in the northern section was extinguished Friday afternoon. Fire continued 
to smolder at the southern end of the tunnel Saturday evening. Smoke floated 
out of the blackened tunnel's portals, and twisted metal was visible. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically it's out, but it's still smoldering," Battalion Chief Tom Curry 
said as he surveyed the site. "There are little pockets of fire down in there." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters worked to pump out chocolate-colored water. But they did not 
venture inside the tunnel, in part out of fear that the burning sections might 
yet collapse. Instead, they kept vigil outside the southern mouth of the tunnel 
to prevent the fire from spreading. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Fire Chief Rojo said the fire, limited mostly to heavy, slow-burning 
timbers that line the tunnel, would burn itself out. "There is no reason for us 
to risk anyone's life," he said.

Repairing The Tunnel 
</P>
<P>
Temporary repairs to shore up 250 feet of the Metro Rail tunnel under the 
Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
1. The damage 
</P>
<P>
The fire destroyed the wood timbers between the steel ribs. The wood is 
completely gone. The goal of the repair effort now under way is to shore up the 
tunnel to prevent future collapse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2. Temporary repairs 
</P>
<P>
In the center of the tunnel, a 12 foot by 12 foot aluminum brace (with diagonal 
cross bracing) will be installed every 1.5 feet down the tunnel. Steel beams 
will be placed on top of the aluminum braces. And large wood timbers will be 
installed above that to hold the dirt lining of the tunnel in place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steel ribs and timber lagging, installed in four-foot sections, support the 
circumference of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
12-inch-thick concrete liners are used as the finished construction surface. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 1/8-inch-thick, high-density polyethylene plastic liner is used on the inside 
walls to protect against methane gas seepage
