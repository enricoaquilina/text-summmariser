THE FAMILY of a workman killed in a Channel tunnel accident two years ago
was awarded Pounds 50,000 agreed damages against the consortium constructing
the tunnel, Translink Joint Venture, in the High Court yesterday.

Pounds 800 a week as a grouter when the accident happened on May 7 1990. He

was accepted Mr Cartman was 25 per cent to blame for the accident. Half of
the agreed damages will be shared equally by the couple's two children.
