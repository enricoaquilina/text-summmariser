  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on regional health and epidemiology developments 
monitored through 10 December. Source is cited in parentheses 
following each item. 
<H5>  Colombia </H5>
  In the 10 years that AIDS has been reported in Colombia, it 
has officially caused 1,800 deaths. Nevertheless, according to 
the National Survey on Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices 
Related to Sexually Transmitted Diseases, 121,000 people may be 
infected with the virus in Colombia. The survey was carried out 
among 18,000 people and was contracted by the Social Security 
Institute. It found that 20.3 percent of the men tested positive 
while 1.3 percent of the women tested positive. That means that 
out of the total population, 118,093 men and 3,538 women might 
test positive. This would be equivalent to 35 out of every 
10,000 Colombians. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 1 
Dec 93 p 3a) 
<H5>  Costa Rica </H5>
  Alberto Lostalo, director of the health center in 
Puntarenas, 
has reported an outbreak of malaria in Jaco, where 20 cases were 
discovered. The malaria epidemic continues growing in the 
country but at a slower rate than in 1992. Up to 24 November, 
the Health Ministry recorded 4,701 cases, 80 percent of which 
were on the Atlantic coast. (San Jose LA NACION in Spanish 26 
Nov 93 p 8a) 
<H5>  Mexico </H5>
  The Health Secretariat reported on 4 December that there 
have 
been 10,004 cholera cases in Mexico this year. Of these, 180 
people have died. The most affected states are Puebla, Morelos, 
Mexico, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Yucatan, and Queretaro and Mexico City.

  Gerardo Vega, Agricultural Development Ministry director in 
Chepo, has reported that the Ministry has begun the mass 
poisoning of vampire bats in the area of San Martin where there 
has been an outbreak of rabies among cattle and horses. It has 
also restricted the transfer of slaughtered cattle in the area.
