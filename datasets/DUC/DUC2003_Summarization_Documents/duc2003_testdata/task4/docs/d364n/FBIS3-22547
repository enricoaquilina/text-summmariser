  [Excerpts] On 17 September, I was invited by the Public 
Health and Epidemiology Institute, Ministry of Public Health, 
Laos, to participate in a seminar on rabies and hepatitis B. 
Attending the seminar on behalf of Laos was Dr. Somthana 
Tuangmala, the director of that institute. I would like to tell 
you about the rabies situation in Laos. 
  The opening ceremony was held at 0815. Dr. Khemphet, the 
head 
of the Central Office, Ministry of Public Health, whose position 
is equivalent to that of a Thai under secretary, officially 
opened the seminar. A total of 186 people, including doctors and 
public health officials from Vientiane Province and other 
provinces, attended the seminar. [passage omitted] 
  Laos now has a population of 4.2 million people. The number 
of reported rabies cases is much lower than the actual number. 
In 1988, 90 animals were tested for rabies, and 83, or 93 
percent, tested positive for rabies. In 1989, 96 animals were 
tested, and 89, or 93 percent, tested positive. In 1990, 1991, 
and 1992, 107, 112, and 144 animals were tested respectively and 
more than 90 percent of the animals tested positive each of 
those years. 
  Most of the animals tested were dogs. This means that just 
as 
in Thailand, in Laos dogs are the main carriers of rabies. In 
1989, a total of 273 people were bitten by a dog and given 
rabies vaccinations. In 1992, the number rose to 782 people, and 
in the first eight months of this year, 557 people have received 
rabies vaccinations after being bitten by a dog. 
  What is worrisome is that Laos has always used a vaccine 
produced from animal brain tissue. This vaccine is similar to 
that produced by the Saowapha Institute and the Government 
Pharmaceutical Organization here in Thailand. Laos does not 
produce this vaccine itself. It was obtained from the Soviet 
Union, its old mentor. But now, its old mentor is collapsing and 
so Laos does not have any of this vaccine. 
  But there is a new vaccine that is produced from cell 
cultures that is sold at government drug stores. And some people 
cross the river to Thailand to buy vaccine at drug stores in 
Nong Khai Province. They pack it in bottles and take it back to 
Laos. There is also a duck embryo vaccine produced by 
Switzerland. I was told that patrol vehicles provide vaccination 
services. 
  As for preventing and controlling this disease, the [Lao] 
Department of Livestock Development and Animal Husbandry, which 
is similar to our department, is responsible for handling 
things. It vaccinates dogs. But very few dogs are actually 
receiving rabies vaccinations. In 1988, a total of 2,800 dogs 
were vaccinated, in 1989, 2,300 were vaccinated, in 1990, 3,650 
were vaccinated, in 1991, 4,520 were vaccinated, and in 1992, 
7,230 were vaccinated. 
  What Laos must do in order to prevent and control this 
disease is to conduct more studies on this disease and obtain 
anti-rabies vaccines for both people and animals so that there 
is always a supply on hand, particularly vaccine produced by 
cell cultures, which is rather expensive. The rabies monitoring 
and reporting system must be improved, and the capabilities of 
the laboratories in the cities and provinces must be improved. 
The laws concerned must be implemented strictly, and an effort 
must be made to get neighboring countries (meaning Thailand) and 
international organizations to provide technical help in order 
to obtain the technical support and equipment needed. 
  At the seminar, I discussed the broad epidemiology situation 
regarding rabies in various countries in the world and described 
the symptoms of this disease. I told them about the various 
vaccines available and the recommendations made by the World 
Health Organization in giving vaccinations. I also told them 
about my own personal experiences, because I have been involved 
with this disease since 1962. And I am still involved in this. 
  As for hepatitis B, I told those at the seminar that there 
are several types of hepatitis, including hepatitis A, B, C, D, 
and E. These are interesting, because they are encountered 
frequently, with the most common types being hepatitis A and B. 
I discussed the symptoms, secondary infections, and the 
treatment and prevention of this disease using vaccines. There 
are now vaccines to control both hepatitis A and B. In Laos, few 
people are given vaccinations to prevent hepatitis B. This is 
because doctors and other medical personnel do not have much 
knowledge about this disease, and the vaccine is still very 
expensive (one dose costs 9,000 kip). I told them that Thailand 
is now inoculating about 1 million infants a year free of 
charge. Dr. Somthana said that Laos will have to find a way to 
obtain help from international organizations in studying 
hepatitis B. After I ended my talk on giving preventive 
vaccinations, many people asked me questions about this. 
  Dr. Rattanapon, the head of one of the examination 
laboratories, was one of those who was very interested in this. 
He asked me to provide him with documents concerning the various 
strains of hepatitis, because Laos lacks such documents. I told 
him that we do not live very far away and that if he wants 
anything, all he has to do is ask and I will send it to him. 
  I will stop here for today.
