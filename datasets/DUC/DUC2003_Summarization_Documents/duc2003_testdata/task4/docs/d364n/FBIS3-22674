  Rabies/leishmaniosis/cholera -- The Aracatuba prefecture

State. Leme, Andradina, and Aracatuba have already registered 
107 rabies cases. The State Health Secretariat reported that 687 
cases of leishmaniosis were registered in Sao Paulo in 1993. 
Meanwhile, the cholera epidemic continues in Ceara State,
