  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on regional health and epidemiology developments 
monitored through 3 December. Source is cited in parentheses 
following each item. 
<H5>  Colombia </H5>
  Although Health Ministry figures indicate the are no more 
than 60,000 AIDS cases in the country, Social Security says the 
figure totals 120,000. Moreover, 70 percent of the patients 
range in ages from 24 to 44. The largest number of cases are 
reported in San Andres, Quindio, Risaralda, and Antioquia 
Departments and in Santa Fe de Bogota. (Santa Fe de Bogota 
Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1730 GMT 1 Dec 93) 
<H5>  Costa Rica </H5>
  National AIDS Commission Director Guisella Herrera has 
reported 100 cases of AIDS have been registered so far this 
year, raising to 500 the number of persons who have this 
disease. She also noted there are at least 10,000 AIDS carriers 
in the country. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2011 GMT 1 Dec 93) 
<H5>  Cuba </H5>
  Dr. Manuel Santin, national epidemiology director at the 
Health Ministry, has stated there are 970 HIV carriers in the 
country, of which 226 have developed AIDS. He added that 143 
AIDS patients have died. According to this official, the 
incubation period was extended to 10.5 years. The percentage of 
cases in the population is 0.007 percent Santin noted. (Havana 
Radio Havana Cuba in Spanish 0000 GMT 2 Dec 93) 
<H5>  Ecuador </H5>
  Statistics indicate 586 persons have been infected with or 
are ill with AIDS in Ecuador. The most cases are reported in 
Quito and Guayaquil. (Quito Voz de los Andes in Spanish 1200 GMT 
1 Dec 93) 
<H5>  El Salvador </H5>
  Dr. Licida Bautista de Mejia of the Pan American Health 
Organization has revealed that, since the first case of AIDS was 
reported in the country in 1984, 1,345 persons have died of this 
disease. It is estimated that 1,123 may be infected with the 
virus. So far in 1993, 18 persons have died of it. (San Salvador 
LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 2 Dec 93 p 4) 
<H5>  Guatemala </H5>
  According to recent disclosures by the health and social 
welfare minister to a congressional health commission, the 
spread of AIDS in Guatemala is reaching alarming levels. 
According to recent Health Ministry data, at least 31,000 
cholera patients have been reported of which 75 percent have 
received medical treatment. The same data indicate that 249 
cholera patients have died so far. With respect to AIDS, 430 
cases and 420 HIV positive cases have been reported. Most of the 
AIDS cases have been in the 22-29 age group. (Guatemala City 
PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 29 Nov 93 p 4) 
  Miriam Cobar Aguilera, head of the National AIDS Control and 
Prevention Program, PNPCS, disclosed that 1,002 AIDS cases had 
been recorded between 1984 and October 1993. She also indicated 
that this represented a 16.7 percent growth rate with respect to 
1986. The PNPCS official explained that 467 cases have been 
confirmed, while 535 cases are recorded as asymptomatic carriers 
and are virtual transmission agents without being aware of this 
fact. According to PNPCS data, 142 men and 36 women have died of 
AIDS related causes. On the other hand, Mireya Gularte, 
director of the Orientation Center for Sexually Transmittable 
Diseases and AIDS Prevention, CODETS, stated that the number of 
AIDS cases in Guatemala could be greater than 50,000 because 
most men and women evade normal control tests. (Guatemala City 
PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 1 Dec 93 p 8) 
<H5>  Honduras </H5>
  A recent health authority study points out that more than 
3,000 proven AIDS cases, and 60,000 HIV positive cases have been 
recorded in Honduras. The study also reports that for every 100 
Central American AIDS cases recorded, 57 are Hondurans. 
Although Honduran health authorities attribute the spread of 
AIDS to poor information with respect to risks involved in 
contracting the disease, some sectors link the epidemic's rapid 
growth to the presence of U.S. troops in the country. (Paris AFP 
in Spanish 1147 GMT 27 Nov 93) 
  Health official Dr. Felicito Montalvan pointed out recently 
that the number of AIDS related deaths recorded in the country 
could be greater than the 3,193 cases reported to date by the 
Health Ministry. According to Dr. Montalvan, Health Ministry 
data could be underestimated because some AIDS-related deaths 
are not reported. (Tegucigalpa EL HERALDO in Spanish 2 Dec 93 p 
5) 
  Health authorities reported on 2 December that 11 new 
cholera 
cases had been recorded which brings the total number to 3,201 
cases and 81 deaths since first recorded in October 1991. 
According to the health authorities, 2,077 cases were reported 
during 1993 and the most affected regions include Choluteca 
(1,206), San Francisco Morazan (295), and Valle (250). (San 
Pedro Sula TIEMPO in Spanish 3 Dec 93 p 2) 
<H5>  Nicaragua </H5>
  Health Ministry sources in Managua reported that 35 people 
have died of AIDS so far, while 47 others are infected. They 
added that there are 111 HIV carriers and, although there is no 
precise figure, they believe that as many as 15,000 Nicaraguans 
have been infected in all. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1148 GMT 1 
Dec 93) 
<H5>  Panama </H5>
  Health authorities released a report stating that there have 
been 123 cases of AIDS reported this year. Nationwide, since 
the disease was first reported, there have been 587 cases 
treated, 500 of which were men and 87 women. It is believed 
that there are between 11,000 and 14,000 carriers. On the 
sadder side of these statistics, there are eight children who 
were reported as HIV positive during 1993. (Panama City EL SIGLO 
in Spanish 28 Nov 93 p 29) 
  Livestock association leaders have warned of rabies among 
cattle that could be transmitted to humans. There have been 10 
cases of bovine rabies up to now, and Health Minister Guillermo 
Rolla announced that a team of specialists has been sent to 
eastern Panama province to investigate and determine control 
measures. (Panama City EL SIGLO in Spanish 1 Dec 93, p 12) 
  Three new dengue cases were recorded in the San Miguelito 
district which could be the beginning of an epidemic according 
to reports disclosed by Health Minister Guillermo Rolla 
Pimentel. He also stressed the fact that the three new cases 
were recorded in the same area where the first three cases were 
uncovered less than six weeks ago. (Panama City EL PANAMA 
AMERICA in Spanish 3 Dec 93 p 5a) 
  Dr. Marcel Peina, head of an AIDS research group, has 
pointed 
out that the number of AIDS carriers in Panama could range 
between 11,000 and 14,000 persons. According to Dr, Peina, 
these persons represent a real threat since they are unaware 
that they are HIV positive and the health authorities have no 
record of their whereabouts. Dr. Peina also disclosed that AIDS 
has now been recorded in every province in the country but 
mostly in Panama City and San Miguelito district. At least 587 
cases have been recorded in Panama, and 536 deaths. (Panama 
City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 3 Dec 93 p 10A) 
<H5>  Peru </H5>
  According to Health Ministry data, approximately 30,000 and 
40,000 Peruvians are believed to be HIV positive without being 
aware of it. Since 1983, when the first AIDS case was recorded, 
up until October 1993, at least 953 cases have been recorded. 
Of the total number of cases recorded, 84.58 percent are men. 
(Lima Global de Television Network in Spanish 0100 GMT 2 Dec 
93) 
  Aids was first recorded in Peru in July 1983; since then 153 
cases have been reported, but the number of estimated 
individuals believed to be HIV positive totals 100,000. Of the 
total number of cases recorded in Peru, 91.6 percent include 
men, while 8.4 percent are women; nevertheless, considering that 
the contagion index among heterosexuals is increasing 
dramatically, the risk to women is greater with each passing 
day. In 1989, for example, for each 12 cases of AIDS among men, 
only one AIDS case was reported among women. During 1993, the 
proportion increased to such an extent that now there is one 
case among women for each eight cases among men. Of the total 
number of cases, 33.4 percent are in the 20- to 29- year-old 
group, and 36.2 percent are in the 35-year-old bracket. 
  According to the Health Ministry, there are 3,000 AIDS cases 
in Peru, and 73 percent of those cases are in Lima. The 
dramatic spread of the epidemic in the provinces indicates that 
it is spreading rapidly throughout the country. Health data 
show that the following numbers of cases have been reported 
throughout Peru: six cases in Cusco; 16 cases in the Trujillo 
regions of La Libertad and 55 in La Primavera; 23 proven cases 
and eight deaths in Tumbes; 35 cases in Iquitos; 42 confirmed 
cases in Chiclayo; 58 cases in Arequipa. (Lima Panamericana 
Television Network in Spanish 0200 GMT 29 Nov 93) 
<H5>  Venezuela </H5>
  Recent AIDS statistics in Venezuela reveal the following 
trend up until 30 September 1993: total number of cases--3,100; 
number of deaths--1,690; reported cases among men--2,853; deaths 
among men-- 1,556; cases among women--241; deaths among 
women--132. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 1 Dec 93 p C2) 
  According to figures released by Dr. Luis Echezuria, Health 
and Social Welfare Ministry epidemiology director, during the 
current year approximately 7,600 dengue cases and 14 related 
deaths have been reported throughout Venezuela. The most 
affected regions include Tachira, Barinas, Aragua, Miranda, 
Lara, and the Federal District. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in 
Spanish 27 Nov 93 p. 2-16)
