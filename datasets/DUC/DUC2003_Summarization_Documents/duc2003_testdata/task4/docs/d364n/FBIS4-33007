  [Text] Vector transmitted diseases cover more than 
two-thirds of the nation's territory with their threatening 
presence, and most of the population is exposed to contagion. 
  Malaria, yaws, yellow fever, hemorrhagic fever, dengue, 
typhus, bubonic plague, and leishmaniasis cast shadows over 75 
percent of Bolivia's territory and constitute a public health 
problem because of their magnitude. 
<H5>  Malaria: The Bites of the Anopheles </H5>
  The population of the area affected by malaria, the tropical 
disease caused by the bite of the anopheles mosquito, is 2.7 
million, and there has been an increase recently in the number 
afflicted due principally to a halt in fumigation. 
  There were 25,364 cases reported in 1989, 19,031 in 1991, 
24,486 in 1992, and 12,000 in 1993. 
  The risk of contracting malaria is greatest in the district 
of Guayaramerin, where the incidence is 215 cases per 1,000 
inhabitants. Here 42 percent of the known cases are due to the 
presence in that area of an ideal center of larval incubation. 
  Incidence in Pando is 42 per 1,000 inhabitants, and in 
Chuquisaca 10 per 1,000. The endemic zone in that department is 
located in Hernando Siles and Luis Calvo Provinces. The 
incidence of cases in Cochabamba is three per 1,000, in La Paz 
four per 1,000, and in Santa Cruz seven per 1,000. In the 
Provinces of Gran Chaco, Arce, and O'Connor in the department of 
Tarija, the tendency is toward stability at a high level: 30 per 
1,000 inhabitants. 
  The fight against malaria does not seem to be very 
successful. In Pando recently, health authorities admitted that 
200 persons had died, and the church has denounced the lack of 
attention to the problem by national health officials. 
<H5>  Yaws, a Legacy of Bugs and Poverty </H5>
  There are two determining causes of the disease of yaws: the 
presence of the transmitting vector, which determines the 
endemic area, and the severe poverty in which the populace 
lives. This is an area which covers six departments and 25 
provinces where more than a million persons live. 
  A program has been started to improve the precarious 
dwellings of mud and adobe, typical of the area. In the cracks 
of these huts the bugs are able to hide and find shelter from 
insecticides. 
  According to estimates of the National Secretariat of 
Health, 
there are 562,000 dwellings where bugs are almost always 
present, and 90 percent of these bugs carry the microorganism 
that causes the disease. 
<H5>  Human and Canine Rabies </H5>
  Official figures indicate that there were only 32 cases of 
canine rabies during the first two months of 1994, while during 
the same period of 1993 there were 131 cases of canine rabies, 
four in felines, one in sheep, and three cases of human rabies. 
  There is one dog for every 10 persons in Bolivia; there are 
700,000 of these animals, considered by man to be one of his 
best friends. The incidence of canine rabies is 19 per 1,000 
dogs. 
  The incidence of human rabies is .39 per 1,000 inhabitants. 
Its presence is slight but lethal. Several years ago, Bolivia 
pledged to eradicate rabies completely from its nine major 
cities by 1990, a commitment that was not met due to the 
impossibility of obtaining the vaccine or the funds to acquire 
it. 
<H5>  Hemorrhagic Fever </H5>
  This disease, which causes the patient's death in a few 
hours 
due to massive hemorrhaging of the conjunctive tissues and of 
the oral mucous membranes, profuse nasal hemorrhaging, and even 
hemorrhaging through the skin, first appeared in 1959. The 
endemic area is entirely within the department of Pando. 
  The pathogenic agent is the Machupo virus, carried by the 
callomis callosus rat. 
  Until 1975, sporadic outbreaks occurred that were 
characterized by a high degree of mortality. 
  No cases were reported between 1976 and 1992. Recently, a 
reported new outbreak of five cases sounded the alarm for the 
population of Pando, but so far the analyses do not show that 
this dangerous disease is involved. 
  The disease is endemic in areas bordering the Machupo and 
Negro Rivers, and in areas adjacent to the settlements of San 
Ramon and San Joaquin, where an ecological imbalance has 
occurred due to excessive hunting of felines, which has 
permitted the rodents to multiply. 
<H5>  Leishmaniasis, 1 Million Persons Within Its Reach </H5>
  This disease is endemic to the tropical and subtropical 
zones 
of La Paz, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, and Pando, and it infects 
4,500 persons, according to the latest statistics of the 
Directorate of Epidemiology. 
  Almost a million persons run the risk of contracting this 
illness, a deforming disease similar to leprosy that destroys 
the sufferer's face. 
  The disease is caused by the bite of a mosquito, a 
blood-sucker of limited flying range that lives in tree tops in 
mountainous areas. The disease manifests itself in deformities 
of the nasal and oral mucous membranes and of the ear lobe. 
  The bite causes a characteristic spot with an ulceration 
that 
often heals by itself, or else continues to ulcerate. This is 
the first symptom of leishmaniasis, and its timely detection can 
help to avoid deformities. 
<H5>  Yellow Fever </H5>
  The area endemic to yellow fever includes the country's 
entire eastern region, Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, Chuquisaca, 
Tarija, Cochabamba, and La Paz. It covers an area of 400,000 
square kilometers, 36 percent of the national area with 1.2 
million inhabitants. 
  In 1992, there were 22 cases with 18 deaths reported. 
<H5>  Typhus </H5>
  This disease is endemic to areas in the departments of La 
Paz, Potosi, and Cochabamba. In 1991, 34 cases were reported in 
the Province of Mizque (Cochabamba), and one in 1992. No cases 
have been reported since then. 
<H5>  Bubonic Plague </H5>
  Bubonic plague has occurred in recent years only in Franz 
Tamayo Province (La Paz) and in areas of Santa Cruz. There was a 
single case in Franz Tamayo in 1989. In 1990, 10 cases were 
reported, two of which were fatal. No other cases have been 
reported since.
