<F P=106> [Report by M. Antic: "Number of Persons Fallen Ill Growing"] </F>
  [Text] Pristina -- The number of persons fallen ill with 
typhoid fever [trebusni tifus] in Stimlje in Kosovo-Metohija is 
growing daily. The number of diseased yesterday climbed to 28 
and, according to Dr. Komnen Tmusic, director of the Institute 
for Protection of Health, we should expect a further increase in 
the number of patients in the coming days as it has transpired 
that the incubation period lasts longer than the usual two to 
three weeks. It appears that the incubation period in this case 
can even last up to 42 days, since the first persons to have 
fallen ill appeared at the beginning of December. 
  The life of none of the patients is endangered for the time 
being as they have received the necessary medical assistance. 
The source of the epidemic (a well in the Center for the 
Mentally Retarded in Stimlje) has also been sanitized. The 
employees and protegees of this center are now receiving water 
from water tankers. The physicians warn that the residents of 
Stimlje should avoid contacts with the families of persons who 
have fallen ill. 
  Yesterday, Dr. Tmusic warned that the epidemiologic 
situation 
in the province, especially in larger settlements, is very 
grave. Because of dirt in the towns and heaps of rubbish that 
nobody clears away in Pristina and in other towns, the number of 
rats has increased, as well as the number of stray dogs, among 
which some are also infected with rabies. He said that 
municipal governments and incumbent organs have been informed of 
all this, but that for the time being nobody is doing anything.
