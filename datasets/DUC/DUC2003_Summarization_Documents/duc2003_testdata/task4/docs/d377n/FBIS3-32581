  [Text] The Cuban Tobacco Enterprise, Cubatabaco, and the 
Spanish firm Tabacalera S.A. have signed, in Havana, an 
important cooperation agreement aimed at guaranteeing the supply 
of Havana cigars to the Spanish market. The text of the 
agreement establishes that the Spanish firm will finance the 
inputs necessary to guarantee the Cuban tobacco plantations' 
production, while Cubatabaco will supply the Spanish firm with 
91 million cigars up to 1995. The two enterprises will produce a 
new brand of cigars called Mini-Montecristo. The Spanish firm 
will be responsible for marketing the new brand in Spain and 
Cubatabaco for marketing it internationally. It has also been 
learned that the Spanish side will buy, in 1995, approximately 
7,500 tons of rag for cigarette production.
