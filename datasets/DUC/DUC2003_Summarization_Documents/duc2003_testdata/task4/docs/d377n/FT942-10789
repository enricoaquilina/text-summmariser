FT  09 MAY 94 / Observer: A last puff for Fidel?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Has Fidel Castro really given up smoking cigars? And if he has, what will
make him change his mind and light up one of his favourite Cohibas?
These are not the sort of questions that the New York Times or CBS would put
to Cuba's reclusive president. But then they did not get the scoop, and New
Yorker Marvin Shanken, owner of a two-year-old special interest magazine,
Cigar Aficionado, did.
Like most serious smokers, Fidel can remember the day he gave up - August 26
1985. But hadn't he ever lit up in the privacy of his home? No, said Castro,
arguing that it would involve several accomplices - somebody to buy the
cigars, another to hide the ashes. Clearly, Shanken found this hard to
believe. Not even a puff?
Castro: 'No. No.'
Shanken: 'Not even a little puff?'
Castro: 'Not one.'
So under what circumstances would the president smoke his country's most
famous product? He might be tempted to smoke a cigar of peace with US
president Bill Clinton if the US market was re-opened to Cuban cigars. But
he didn't hold out much hope.
For a start Castro didn't want to lose his no-smoking medal awarded by the
World Health Organisation. And even if the WHO gave the OK, there was still
the problem of Hillary Clinton's new no-smoking policy in the White House.
Poor old Hillary gets blamed for everything these days.
