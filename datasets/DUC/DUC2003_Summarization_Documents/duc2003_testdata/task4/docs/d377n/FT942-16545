FT  09 APR 94 / International Company News: A whiff of austerity at
Tabacalera - Chairman Pedro Perez is going back to basics

As secretary of state for the economy Mr Pedro Perez struggled for five
years to reduce the public deficit, to increase Spain's competitiveness and
to curb tax evasion. Since last October Mr Perez has been conducting a
similar battle as chairman of Tabacalera, the government-controlled
manufacturer and monopoly distributor of tobacco.
Tabacalera's balance sheet is not unlike what Spain's has looked like since
the domestic economy dipped into recession two years ago. Profits at the
tobacco group's parent company tumbled by 46 per cent to Pta10.7bn (Dollars
78.6m) in 1993. Mr Perez is thus again fully involved in cutting costs, in
lifting productivity and combatting tobacco smugglers.
If all goes to plan, Mr Perez expects profits at Tabacalera, of which the
government holds 52 per cent and foreign investors 38 per cent, to recover
by 30 per cent this year. Last month the board approved a 45 per cent
dividend cut in line with the 1993 profit shortfall.
'So far Perez is looking good. He is creating a sense of austerity at
Tabacalera and that is new,' says Mr Joaquin Tamames, senior partner at
Axel, the Madrid investment bank. The dividend cut was welcomed as
'realistic'.
Tabacalera expects to reduce operating costs by 10 per cent this year,
partly by slashing sponsorship expenditure and partly by personnel cuts.
Victims of the austerity programme range from the ocean-going yacht Fortuna
(a Tabacalera brand), which was forced to pull out of the round-the-world
race, to a top symphony orchestra festival in Madrid which has been
cancelled following a ruthless cut to Pta250m from Pta1.2bn in the annual
budget of Tabacalera's arts foundation.
Tabacalera's labour force, which stood at 8,000 when Mr Perez took over at
the group, is likely to be reduced by more than 1,300 in the medium-term. By
the end of March almost 500 had accepted voluntary redundancy terms
negotiated by Mr Perez with the unions last November.
Tabacalera's chairman has still not tackled the issue of scaling down the 13
production plants that the group operates in Spain. But he is anxious to
make use of the new labour regulations that permit companies to enforce
geographical and functional mobility on their employees.
The clampdown on tobacco smuggling, following the introduction of
legislation at the end of last year to allow stronger policing and heavier
fines, should have at least as important an impact on the 1994 margin as
will the cost cuts.
Tabacalera estimates that some 20 per cent of the high quality brand tobacco
 -Winston and Marlboro - acquired in Spain last year was smuggled and that
contraband increased by more than 40 per cent between 1992 and 1993.
Tabacalera's sales fell overall by 7 per cent last year and this was not
because Spaniards, who have the highest per capita cigarette consumption in
the EU, were smoking a lot less.
The contraband legislation appears to have delivered startling results. In
January and February this year Tabacalera's sales were up 7.3 per cent on
the first two months of 1993 and sales of Winston and Marlboro shot up by
22.6 per cent.
'If sales continue to climb, by the summer we will be seeing a clear change
in the trend with the smugglers on the retreat,' says Mr Pedro Arbex, a
tobacco industry analyst at Madrid brokers Benito y Monjardin.
The final plank of Mr Perez's platform in his first year as chairman has a
somewhat deja vu air to it, as it has to do with the 'back to the core
tobacco business' strategy that has been promised off and on since 1991 by
his previous two predecessors. This time the chances are that Mr Perez will
succeed in pushing the policy through.
This is in part because Mr Perez inherits Tabacalera's Pta17.25bn disposal
last July of 50 per cent of its food subsidiary, Royal Brands, to RJR
Nabisco of the US. Should the US group take up its option to buy Royal
Brands outright in March next year, Tabacalera will be forced to concentrate
fully on its tobacco business and will have the cash at hand to do so
productively.
It is also because Mr Perez has completed complex negotiations with
Cubatabaco, the Cuban government's tobacco business, which, by virtue of the
Spanish company's partial financing of tobacco processing in Cuba, will gain
Tabacalera a near monopoly of Cuban cigars in Europe.
Mr Perez, who was almost a chain smoker when he was a politician but now
sticks to Havanas, plans several more 'core tobacco business' initiatives
for the European market before the year is out. He is also preparing joint
ventures aimed at eastern Europe and east Asia, but is keeping his cards
close to his chest.
