CUBATABACO, the state company responsible for supplying Cuba's famous Havana
hand-made cigars, is locked in an angry dispute with its largest customer,
Tabacalera, the Spanish state cigar giant.
Tabacalera, which owns the three Havana marques, Upmann, Montecristo and
Larranaga, has withdrawn those brands from several key European markets,
notably France, as a result of litigation started in the 1980s by the three
brands' former owners, Cuban Cigar Brands (Curacao) of the US. Tabacalera
bought the brands from the US group a few years ago and carried the case
forward in the French courts.
The French court ruled last summer that Tabacalera's French counterpart,
Seita, could no longer sell the Cuban-made brands in France. According to
Cubatabaco officials, this has caused a row between it and Tabacalera that
could see the withdrawal of the same three marques from other markets.
Spain last year imported 28m cigars from Cuba, more than a third of its 80m
exports. Mr Francisco Padron, head of Cubatabaco, said in an interview that
Cuba was prepared to resume exporting the same three marques to France but
with different labels 'as early as next year'. It might resume sales to
Spain as well, Mr Padron said, but this would require the setting up of an
independent importing agency in Spain and aggravating already tense
relations with Tabacalera.
Cubatabaco was in discussions with Tabacalera over the impasse. 'They are
being difficult, but they are no longer a complete monopoly. This means we
can be an importer into Spain,' Mr Padron said. 'Tabacalera's profits from
Havana cigar imports are too big for our taste, even though it is our
biggest market, although our supplies have slipped from 34m a few years ago
to 28m last year.'
The nub of the dispute is the fact that the three marques, of which Upmann
and Montecristo are by far the most famous, are produced in other
cigar-manufacturing countries, such as the Dominican Republic (as are
numerous other famous Havana marques such as Partagas and Romeo y Julieta,
though these are not, as yet, subjects of litigation).
This anomaly arose in the 1960s following the Cuban revolution and the
subsequent expropriation of the famous cigar companies. Many cigar company
proprietors switched production offshore but did not have the economic clout
to raise a lawsuit against Cuba over the continued production within Cuba of
the same brands. This only became possible when the US group took control of
some of the offshore brands, which has now moved to Tabacalera. Tabacalera
controls the brand names for all markets outside the US.
The sale side-by-side in some overseas markets of Havana and non-Havana
cigars bearing the same labels is creating market ambiguity, say Cubatabaco
officials, and diverts attention from the acknowledged supremacy of Havana
cigars.
This has prompted Cubatabaco to undertake new strategies in Europe to boost
sales and broaden its revenue base. A few years ago, a Swiss holding company
was established by Cubatabaco to take a minority stake in importing
companies, such as Coprova of France, a small competitor to Seita, and
Hunters and Frankau of the UK, the prime UK importer.
Mr Padron said that strategy was being expanded to include the establishment
of Havana Houses in certain markets. These were franchise retail outlets,
which would be supplied by Cubatabaco-approved suppliers. One had been set
up in Cancun, Mexico, he said, another was planned for next year in Paris
and a so-called Cohiba Divan had been established in Hong Kong. Others were
being considered for Tokyo and the Middle East.
A third element of the strategy is beefing up production of Cuba's
post-revolution 'own brand' the top marque Cohiba cigar, partly to fill the
void created by the departure of Swiss-based Davidoff from the Havana market
into Dominican Republic cigars.
Cubatabaco last week used the occasion of the Fifth Centenary Anniversary
Conference in Havana celebrating Christopher Columbus's discovery of tobacco
(for it was in Cuba that the explorer saw Indians smoking rolled up tobacco
leaves on his first voyage) to display the latest range of Cohiba cigars.
These, at least, will be exempt from brand-ownership disputes abroad,
officials point out.
One official noted that, for its part, Cuba had successfully caused the
withdrawal of 50 brands from the international market place for erroneously
claiming to be Havana cigars.
Mr Padron acknowledged that the Cuban tobacco industry was undercapitalised.
'We are having good crops, but the problems are in the fields (58,000
hectares were under cultivation). We are suffering investment shortages,' he
said, 'some of which have been caused by the collapse of Comecon.'
Cuba, he said, was supplying 10m-11m mainly machine-made cigars a year into
eastern Europe, partly paid for through barter arrangements, but this had
been shaken up. Cuba now was having to reorientate itself to the eastern
European markets, through the setting up of 'joint accounts' in all the
region's capital cities.
Of total sales last year of 250m cigars, 80m were exported. Export revenues
for all Cuban tobacco was Dollars 115m, of which about Dollars 75m came from
cigars, he said.
