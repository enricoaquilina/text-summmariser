THE future of the Cuban cigar trade in Europe has been thrown into doubt
after a French court barred the import of three leading brands because of a
trademark violation. The three brands are Monte Cristo, H. Upmann and Por
Larranaga. According to Seita, France's largest tobacco goods distributor,
these marques comprise about 50 per cent of French Cuban cigar imports of
7.7m.
However, Cuba pledged yesterday that the court ban would not deprive
connoisseur French smokers of their cigars.
Cubatabaco, the state tobacco agency, said it would send other prestigious
Havana brands to replace the three banned names.
Mr Patrick Clayeux, a senior manager for Seita, said yesterday the company
would stop distributing the three brands on August 14. All retail sales must
stop by September 7. Surplus stocks would be withdrawn from retail outlets.
In addition, Seita is obliged to stop production of Mini-Montecristo 'whiff'
cigars, manufactured in France with imported raw Cuban tobacco.
The landmark lawsuit, settled recently in a French appeals court ruling,
stems from a dispute over the ownership of the three famous brands, whose
proprietors fled Cuba following the 1959 revolution. Cuba, under Cubatabaco,
has continued their manufacture since. In 1976, the former owners sold the
marques to Cuban Cigar Brands (Curacao) of the US, which launched the
orginal challenge in various international courts. CCB in the late 1980s
sold the non-US use of the brand names to Tabacalera, the Spanish
distributor, which now controls them for all non-US business.
Mr Clayeux said that officials from Seita, Tabacalera and Cubatabaco had
held a series of meetings to enable the French group to resume sales, but
the dispute remained unresolved.
Cuba's struggling economy earns Dollars 100m a year from tobacco exports.
