The missing bow section of the ferry Estonia, which sank in the Baltic Sea
last month with the loss of 900 lives, was found yesterday lying in 76m of
water about 2km west of the wrecked ship.
The joint Estonian-Finnish-Swedish investigation team is anxious to inspect
the visor-like outer bow door, which caused the Estonia to capsize and
founder when it was torn off in a storm off the south west coast of Finland
during an overnight voyage from Tallinn to Stockholm.
Evidence from video camera inspections of the wreck has shown that all three
locks designed to hold the 55-tonne bow section in place had broken.
Investigators believe the bow section smashed against the hull and inner
vehicle deck door before it broke away, allowing water to enter the vehicle
deck, causing the ship to sink.
They believe it took only 15 or 20 minutes before the Estonia, jointly
operated by Estonian and Swedish shipping companies, rolled on its side and
began to sink.
The bow section will now be surveyed with video cameras in an effort to find
further evidence of why the locks failed. The inquiry team will also hope to
salvage the bow section so they can investigate whether metal fatigue was to
blame. The Swedish government is considering salvaging the main wreck, but
experts say such a complex and costly operation could not be done until the
spring.
So far there has been no definite evidence of human error causing the bow
doors to fail. Surviving crew members have told investigators the inner bow
door, which should have proved watertight, had been closed. But they said
they could not judge whether the ship had been sailing too fast for the
conditions, as some witnesses have suggested.
The International Maritime Organisation wants a complete review of the
design of roll-on roll-off ferries.
