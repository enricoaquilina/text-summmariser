Sweden's government disclosed yesterday that six recent 'near accidents' in
its waters involving roll-on roll-off ferries had come to light since the
sinking of the Estonia on Wednesday with the loss of up to 900 lives.
Details of the incidents emerged as Finland and Sweden ordered widespread
inspections of ferries for bow door weaknesses following the sinking in the
Baltic Sea - the worst maritime disaster in European waters since the second
world war.
The newly reported incidents, which took place over the past few years, were
disclosed through informal contacts between the Maritime Board, crew members
of ships and staff of shipping companies shocked by the Estonia sinking.
Mr Bjorn-Erik Stenmark, Sweden's director of maritime safety, said that in
the worst incident a large ferry of similar size to the Estonia sailing
between Sweden and Finland was only saved by the skilful manoeuvring of the
ship by its captain after water had flooded into the cargo deck through the
bow.
'I am shocked by these findings,' Mr Stenmark said. 'Some ship owners have
neglected to report these near accidents.
'What I see now as a trend is that bow sections can be breached in the high
sea conditions that are to be found in the Baltic Sea.'
Referring to the Estonia disaster, Mr Stenmark said: 'The huge catastrophe
with the sinking of the Estonia perhaps could have been avoided if the
shipowners had followed the law and reported earlier close calls with
ferries of the Estonia-type construction.'
In Stockholm, the technical director of Swedish shipper Nordstrom &amp; Thulin,
co-owner of the Estonia, also said water entering the bow doors may have
caused it to sink.
'There is reason to suspect that this was the main cause of the accident,'
Mr Sten Forsberg said.
But he ruled out the possibility that seals on one of the two doors
shielding the car deck from the water was faulty, as had been alleged by a
Swedish seamen's union leader. Mr Forsberg said the seals had recently
passed an international inspection.
Mr Stenmark said he had ordered that all ferries with opening bow sections
using Swedish ports should be inspected urgently. There is particular
concern about ships with visor-type bows which, like those on the Estonia,
swing open vertically.
Mr Stenmark said he would decide by early next week whether to impose
restrictions on the operation of up to 30 such ferries in high seas pending
a fuller inquiry into their safety.
Announcing its own inspections, the Finnish interior ministry said: 'All
ferries, car, passenger and train ferries which fly the Finnish flag will be
subjected to inspections . . . within a week. Special attention will be paid
to cargo doors, front and back, and to alarm and monitoring systems.'
Meanwhile, the Estonian government said it had been given a list of 1,051
names of passengers who had bought tickets to travel on the Estonia.
Original estimates had put the number of passengers at 960.
Mr Heiki Arike, the home affairs minister, said the list was larger than
previous estimates because it included children under the age of five - but
also passengers who may not have turned up for the voyage.
Rescue officials still appear uncertain about how many people survived the
disaster, but the highest figure was only 147. The Finnish coastguard said
about 90 bodies had been recovered.
A joint investigation involving officials from Sweden, Finland and Estonia
headed by Mr Ande Meister, the Estonian transport minister, will produce the
main report on the Estonia disaster.
Insurers face potential claims of more than a Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m)
following the disaster.
