European Union transport ministers are to ask the Commission to draw up
tighter inspection procedures for roll-on roll-off passenger ferries
operating from European ports. Ferry operators would also be required to
count and record information about the identity of passengers.
The action follows the sinking of the Estonia in the Baltic in September
with the loss of more than 900 lives. The commission will be asked to ensure
that the International Maritime Organisation's safety rules and codes for
ferry working procedures are enforced. The hours and working conditions of
crews will be subject to scrutiny while ferry evacuation procedures will be
reviewed. EU ministers will call for an investigation of the need for 'black
box' recorders as used on aircraft and for the port authorities to be given
powers to prevent ferries leaving port in bad weather. The IMO has also
announced plans to establish a panel of safety experts in December to
recommend action on roll-on roll-off ferries. At the same time tighter
controls have been ordered by a number of countries including the UK, Sweden
and Finland.
