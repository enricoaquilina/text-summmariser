FT  16 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Imperative to modify ro-ro ships
</HEADLINE>

   From Sir WILLIAM BARLOW

<TEXT>
Sir, In the past few weeks two disasters at sea have warranted front-page
headlines in the press. In the sinking of the ferry Estonia, more than 900
lives were lost; following the fire on the Achille Lauro cruise ship, almost
all of the 1,000 passengers were saved.
The reasons? The roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) design of the Estonia caused it
to capsize completely in a few minutes with no time for evacuation; the
Achille Lauro remained upright and afloat for many hours, with ample time
for evacuation.
There must be an overriding objective to design new ships or modify existing
ro-ro ships such that, following a significant ingress of water, an
essentially upright position is maintained for at least 30 minutes to make
evacuation practicable. Passengers on ro-ro ships are entitled to expect the
same standards to ensure survival as those which apply to conventional
passenger vessels.
Engineering solutions are available and cost or operational disadvantages
must not be allowed to stand in the way of this entirely logical objective.
The Royal Academy of Engineering is examining the matter and will be
consulting shipowners among others.
