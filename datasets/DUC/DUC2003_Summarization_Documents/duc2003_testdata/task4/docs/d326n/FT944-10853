Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, last night launched a fierce
attack on the government for failing to impose the same high safety
standards on the ferry companies as it had on Euro-tunnel.
Sir Alastair broke with the tradition that has prevented the ferries and the
tunnel operator from commenting publicly on each other's safety problems in
a speech to the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and
Commerce.
He said: 'The government made us spend tens, even hundreds of millions of
pounds from our own capital - including the vast cost of transverse
bulkheads between every wagon on our shuttles. And yet that government steps
back from burdening the ferries with a few million in essential costs.'
Sir Alastair's remarks came a day after Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport
secretary, announced that a safety review of ferries operating from British
ports had found bow-door defects on one in three ferries.
The review was prompted by the sinking in the Baltic of the ferry Estonia
with the loss of more than 900 lives.
The French and British governments had compelled Eurotunnel to prepare a
300-page 'safety case', describing its safety features and procedures. As a
result it was 20 times safer than an equivalent stretch of railway, Sir
Alastair said.
Other complex industries such as nuclear power generation and aviation also
had to operate by high safety standards.
However, the ferries had only been required to reach 'a very modest and
clearly inadequate level of partial safety' under international rules for
safety at sea, he added.
The government had had several years to work out tough safety standards for
Eurotunnel and at the same time ensure that equal standards were imposed on
its competitors. 'Only now, as we start up, is it possible to confirm that
no equality of requirement has been established.
'We object fiercely and with intensity when we observe cost given by the
ferries as the reason for failing to remedy what appear to be inherently
unsafe ship designs.'
In spite of what in effect is a subsidy provided by the right to make
duty-free sales, the ferries were permitted to avoid relatively modest
investments in safety, Sir Alastair said.
