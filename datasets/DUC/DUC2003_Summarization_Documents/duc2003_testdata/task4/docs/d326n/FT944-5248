Two shipping disasters in the past week have lent fresh urgency to a safety
review which starts today at the London-based International Maritime
Organisation.
The maritime safety committee had already planned to focus on roll-on
roll-off (ro-ro) ferry safety after the sinking of the Estonia in the Baltic
in September with the loss of more than 900 lives. Last week's sinking of a
Philippines ferry, with the loss of more than 140 lives, and a fire on the
cruise liner Achille Lauro, which cost two lives and gutted the vessel, have
increased pressure on the committee to tighten up regulations.
The role of the IMO, a United Nations agency, is to improve maritime safety
and prevent pollution from ships. It works through a number of technical
committees and relies on persuading member nations to adopt the treaties
they devise. The maritime safety committee has representatives from most of
the IMO's 150 member countries.
Prompted by the sinking of the Estonia, Mr William O'Neil, IMO general
secretary, has proposed the creation of a panel of safety experts to
recommend action in the hope of shortening the normally lengthy procedures.
Mr O'Neil said: 'We cannot simply refer to what has been done during the
past few years and claim that there is no need for further action. The only
way of reassuring people that ro-ro ferries are safe is by looking at every
aspect of operations and ensuring any problems are remedied.'
Particular attention will be paid to the strength and watertightness of bow
and stern doors, the advisability of fitting internal bulkheads on the
vehicle deck and the need for guidelines on operations in adverse weather
conditions.
The committee is also to consider far-reaching amendments of the
international convention on training standards and seafarers'
qualifications. The IMO proposes a revised treaty, a lot of it mandatory,
with detailed rules for verifying compliance.
A third area of concern for the IMO is the safety of the world fleet of dry
bulk carriers that move cargoes such as coal, aggregates and ores. The IMO
says: 'There have been many incidents in which bulk carriers have suffered
from catastrophic structural failures.'
