tragedy

Somehow, it has happened again. Seven years after the British vehicle ferry
Herald of Free Enterprise capsized off Zeebrugge with the loss of 193 lives,
the Estonia disaster has focused world attention on a question that
shipowners hoped had gone away: are roll-on, roll-off ships like these
inherently unsafe?
The answer will depend on the conclusions of the various inquiries into the
Estonia sinking, now thought to have cost more than 900 lives. But if the
inquiries decide, as seems likely, that the Estonia sank because water
entered the vehicle deck, the consequences for the ferry industry will be
dramatic.
At the least, public opinion could force governments to insist on expensive
structural changes, making new ships less able to compete with aircraft and
undersea train services like those through the Channel tunnel. At worst,
shipowners could be forced to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on
rebuilding existing ships to tougher safety standards.
That would have serious economic implications, especially in Europe, where
the speed and flexibility of vehicle ferries has made them indispensable to
trade between continental Europe and the outlying economies in the British
Isles and Scandinavia. There are more than 500 ferry sailings across the
North Sea and the English Channel every day; worldwide, the number of such
ferries in use has risen to 2,158 this year from 1,847 when the Herald
capsized. No-one knows how much traffic these ferries carry, but they have
the capacity to carry 9m gross tons of traffic a day - a third more than
seven years ago.
The talk in shipping circles yesterday was of waiting to see what caused the
Estonia to sink, of not jumping to conclusions, of the possibility that the
disaster could have been caused by anything from an engine explosion to a
mine from the second world war. But all the signs point towards a surge of
water entering the vehicle deck through one of the main doors.
Much has been done to improve the safety of roll-on, roll-off ferries since
1987. The International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations agency for
shipping, agreed in 1988 to raise stability requirements for new ferries
from 1990 and in 1992 to phase in tougher requirements for older ships. The
rules also require improvements such as closed circuit television
supervision of vehicle decks, and lighting to help survivors of an accident
reach safety. Some shipowners have also fitted sponsons - stabilising bulges
just above the waterline, to improve stability, although there is no
requirement to do so.
The UK went further, passing domestic legislation requiring all ships
visiting UK ports to meet the full 1990 standards. This forced shipowners to
scrap older ferries that could not be improved, or to transfer them to
countries with less rigid safety standards.
However, neither the UK nor the IMO addressed the biggest danger of roll-on,
roll-off ferries - the open vehicle decks running from one end of the ship
to the other.
The design of such ships dates back to the 1950s, when trade was picking up
rapidly after the second world war. Shipowners realised that cargoes could
be transported more quickly and efficiently if cars and lorries could be
driven straight onto their ships at the dockside and off again at the end of
the journey. The easiest way to do that is provide one or more vehicle
decks, accessible through large doors in the hull, running the length of the
ship. The design works best if the deck is uninterrupted by walls - known to
mariners as bulkheads - which complicate vehicle loading.
The result is that the protection afforded by bulkheads below the vehicle
decks is undermined by a huge and vulnerable open space in the middle of the
ship. The space is perfectly safe while it remains dry. But small quantities
of water entering the vehicle decks can cause the ship to develop a heavy
list and to capsize within a few minutes.
An independent inquiry in the UK, conducted by Mr Justice Sheen after the
sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise, concluded that this problem,
called the free surface effect, was responsible for the disaster. The judge
concluded that forcing shipowners to place vertical transverse bulkheads
across vehicle decks would make roll-on, roll-off ferries uneconomic. The
IMO also avoided any mention of vehicle deck bulkheads in its 1990
standards, preferring to wait for the results of a UK-Danish technical study
on design and construction; the next stage of the report will be released in
November. But if the free surface effect sank the Estonia, the demand for
action is likely to become irresistible.
Pressure for tougher regulations has come from survivors of major accidents,
including the Herald sinking, who have given first hand accounts of the
chaos involved in a capsize. Survivors of the Estonia tragedy have similar
stories.
There is a wealth of expert opinion on their side. The late Professor Dick
Bishop, a leading naval architect who was also vice-president of Britain's
prestigious Royal Society, was a strong supporter of bulkheads. Mr Alan
Gilfillan, vice-chairman of the safety committee of the Royal Institution of
Naval Architects, said yesterday that the Estonia sinking reopened the
question of whether they should be made mandatory.
Most shipowners say that it cannot be done. Inserting transverse bulkheads
would cost up to Pounds 600,000 for each ship, and would probably destroy
their ability to compete with alternative forms of transport. Longitudinal
bulkheads, running from bow to stern, would pose fewer problems, but might
also be less effective, they say.
'These ships are inherently safe until something totally unexpected happens.
They have done a wonderful job for 30 years with very few accidents. It is
important that we wait for the result of the inquiries into the Estonia, and
don't jump to the wrong conclusions about what needs to be done,' said Mr
Jim Davis, chairman of the International Maritime Industries Forum, a
shipowners organisation.
Mr William O'Neil, the IMO secretary general, recognised the depth of
concern yesterday by ordering a review of vehicle ferries by the maritime
safety committee, which can amend international regulations subscribed to by
countries accounting for 97 per cent of world shipping tonnage. There are
many issues before the committee, including the extent to which roll-on
roll-off ferries can turn into death-traps in extreme circumstances.
Swedish and Finnish operators say their crews are regularly drilled to cope
with emergencies. But, as the Estonia showed, even the best-prepared crews
and passengers can be quickly overcome when a ship begins to list and sink.
The horrific reports from the Estonia of panic-stricken and disorientated
passengers clambering over one another are evidence that emergency plans do
not count for much in a ship that is capsizing or sinking rapidly. The
pictures of survivors and dead bodies in semi-swamped rubber rafts bear
testimony to the effectiveness of life boats in those circumstances.
They also add to the pressure on governments and shipowners to restore
public confidence about the safety of shipping. The lesson of the last seven
years, however, is that there are no easy answers.
