Finnish investigators said last night they had detected a large object lying
close to the sunken Baltic ferry Estonia, heightening speculation that the
vessel capsized because of the loss of an outer bow door.
Mr Jouko Nourteva, a Finnish marine geologist, said the object was lying 10
to 20 metres from the bow, but it was not clear whether it was part of the
roll-on roll-off ship.
Swedish officials have said the Estonia's outer bow door may have been
ripped off in heavy seas last Wednesday, causing water to surge into the car
deck and capsize the ferry within minutes. At least 139 of the vessel's
1,050 passengers survived the catastrophe.
The Estonia, operated by the Swedish-Estonian company Estline, was sailing
from the Estonian capital, Tallinn, to Stockholm when she sank in stormy
seas. Mr Nourteva, who located the wreck on Friday using sophisticated sonar
equipment, said: 'The observation of a large object is certain because it
was seen on all four sonar pictures that were taken.'
As memorial services were held at churches throughout Sweden, Finland and
Estonia yesterday, a Finnish search vessel carrying robot-mounted cameras
filmed the Estonia wreck to try to assess why the vessel sank, and the
difficulty of recovering the 800 bodies believed to be inside.
Investigators said the pictures from the search vessel were of 'very good
quality'. But they apparantly did not pinpoint the large object detected by
the sonar survey. The ferry is lying in about 80m of water, 40km from the
Finnish island of Uto.
Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway have all ordered urgent safety checks on
roll-on roll-off ferries sailing in their waters amid reports of
difficulties with the bow doors of other ships.
Sweden's Stena Line, the world's leading ferry operator, has withdrawn one
of its Irish Sea ferries from service because of difficulties with the
bow-door locking mechanism. It said one of the locking pins of the
14-year-old Stena Felicity had sheared off, although there had been no water
penetration.
The fault was discovered last month when the port side outer door was found
to be jammed shut. A Stena spokesman said the problem was caused by a failed
electrical relay. This was corrected, but upon closer inspection a locking
pin was found to have sheared off, requiring dry-dock repairs, he said.
