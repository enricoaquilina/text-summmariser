Baltic ferry operators are to take immediate steps to secure the bow doors
of their ships after investigators confirmed that the Estonia sank last week
because its outer bow door had been ripped off in stormy seas.
Viking Line and Silja Line, the Baltic's two biggest roll-on roll-off ferry
operators, said they planned to weld shut the bow doors of their ferries,
restricting vehicle loading and unloading to the stern of the ship. A
similar move was announced by Nordstrom &amp; Thulin, the Swedish joint owner of
the Estonia.
Nordstrom said it would permanently seal the bow doors of the Vironia, a
replacement ferry which is due to start sailing between Stockholm and
Tallinn later this month. The arrangement would 'totally remove possible
safety risks' at the front of the vessel, a sister ship of the Estonia, it
stated. Securing the bow doors will increase loading and port turnround
times.
Mr Harry Kulovaara, Silja Line executive vice-president, said: 'We think our
boats are totally safe but in this situation it is most probable that we
will weld the outer doors of some of our ferries.'
British ferry companies indicated last night that they were unlikely to
follow the Baltic operators' example. Stena Sealink, UK arm of the Swedish
group, said ferry companies could not act independently but would wait for
directions from the Transport Department.
P&amp;O European Ferries said it was waiting for detailed reports of what had
happened to the Estonia before deciding what to do about its 45 vessels.
The Baltic ferry operators made their move after Finland's transport
minister, Mr Ole Norrback, indicated that he might ban bow doors on ferries.
Investigators said the loss of the Estonia's outer bow door allowed water to
surge through an inner ramp and capsize the vessel within minutes.
The three-nation accident team said video footage of the stricken vessel,
lying in 80m of water, showed a 1m gap along the top edge of the normally
watertight bow ramp. The opening had allowed water to rush into the car
deck, rapidly destabilising the ship and causing it to sink.
More than 900 people died in the catastrophe last Wednesday when the vessel,
which was sailing from the Estonian capital Tallinn to Stockholm, went down
in stormy seas off Finland. Only 137 people survived.
Accident commission members, including representatives from Finland, Sweden
and Estonia, highlighted the failure of a bow door locking device as being
behind the disaster. They said they had seen footage of broken hinges but
had not been able to locate the visor-style outer bow door itself.
'The water inflow through the partly dislodged forward ramp has been of
sufficient magnitude to result in a lack of stability and the capsizing of
the ferry,' investigators said.
The findings confirm eye-witness testimony and expert opinion that only
something as dramatic as the tearing off of the bow door could have caused
the Estonia to capsize so quickly.
Swedish inspectors yesterday stopped a ferry sailing from Sweden to Denmark
after discovering faults in the bow section.
