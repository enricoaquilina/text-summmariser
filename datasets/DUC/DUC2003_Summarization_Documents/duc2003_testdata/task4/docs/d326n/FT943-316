Sweden's senior maritime safety officer yesterday questioned the safety of
roll-on roll-off ferries with opening bow sections and said he was
considering restricting their operations following the sinking of the ferry
Estonia in the Baltic Sea with the loss of as many as 900 lives.
In statements likely to reverberate throughout the shipping industry, Mr
Bengt-Erik Stenmark, the government's director of maritime safety, said the
National Maritime Board had been informed since the Estonia sank of some six
recent 'near accidents' in waters around Sweden, involving the failure of
opening bow sections, which had not previously been reported to the
authorities.
He said 'all the indications' were that water entering the Estonia, jointly
operated by Swedish and Estonian shipping companies, through the bow section
was the 'final cause' of Wednesday's catastrophe - although it may have been
the culmination of a chain of events including the shifting of improperly
secured cargo.
'What I see now as a trend is that bow sections can be breached in the high
sea conditions that are to be found in the Baltic Sea,' Mr Stenmark said.
He said he had ordered that all ferries with opening bow sections using
Swedish ports should be inspected urgently. He was especially concerned
about ships which, like the Estonia, have visor-type bows that swing open
vertically. He said he would decide by early next week whether to impose
restrictions on the operation of up to 30 such ferries in high seas pending
a fuller inquiry into their safety.
He added that he believed the International Maritime Organisation, the
United Nations organisation that sets standards for the shipping industry,
should study the whole issue of the safety of opening bow sections on ro-ro
ferries. 'It is a question of design,' he said.
The IMO confirmed that the danger of water penetrating the bow doors of
roll-on roll-off vessels was one of the most important issues under
consideration in its safety committees. However, it said there was no
evidence that this had proved to be a widespread problem.
The newly reported incidents, which took place over the past few years, came
to light through informal contacts with the Maritime Board made by crew
members of ships and staff members of shipping companies shocked by the
Estonia sinking, the worst maritime disaster in European waters since the
second world war.
'I am shocked by these findings,' Mr Stenmark said. 'Some ship owners have
neglected to report these near accidents.'
A joint investigation involving officials from Sweden, Finland and Estonia
headed by Mr Ande Meister, the Estonian transport minister, will produce the
main report on the Estonia disaster. They began interviewing survivors
yesterday, including a crew member and a passenger who both reported seeing
water rushing on to the car deck shortly before the ship foundered.
Officials at Estline, the operator of the Estonia, said they did not believe
a failure of the bow doors had caused the sinking, but they admitted they
had 'no concrete explanation' of why the ship sank so suddenly.
Confusion continued yesterday over how many passengers were on board the
Estonia when it sank. The main rescue centre at Turku, Finland, said it now
understood more than 1,000 people were aboard, compared with reports of
about 960 on Wednesday. Rescue officials also appeared uncertain about how
many people survived, but the highest figure was only 147.
Insurers face potential claims of more than a Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m)
following the disaster, but it is likely that the loss will be absorbed by
international markets relatively easily. Liability claims are not expected
to exceed Dollars 60m.
