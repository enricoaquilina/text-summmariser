UN targets organised crime
Ministers and senior officials from the world's justice and interior
ministries attend the first United Nations World Ministerial Conference on
Organised Transnational Crime in Naples (to Nov 23). They will attempt to
forge a more coherent global strategy to combat the increasing threat.
UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali, Italian prime minister Silvio
Berlusconi and president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro will be present. See People.
Opec meeting: Saudi Arabia is to ask the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to extend the current production ceiling of 24.52m barrels of oil
a day for the whole of 1995 to underpin soft oil prices.
Ministers from the 12 Opec members are in Bali, Indonesia, to discuss
production levels (until Nov 23). Other Opec ministers want a roll-over, but
some may favour three or six months. Iran says it will consider all options.
European Union transport ministers begin a two-day meeting, and are expected
to agree on a series of measures to tighten up safety at sea. They will also
be looking at the list of big trans-European infrastructure projects in
road, rail and air transport which are on the agenda of EU leaders at next
month's Essen summit.
Reform of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund is the subject
of a conference in Washington which will bring together parliamentarians
from 18 nations.
Speakers will include Larry Summers, Treasury undersecretary, and Stanley
Fischer, first deputy managing director at the IMF. Massachusetts
congressman Barney Frank, who called the conference, hopes influential
parliamentarians will agree to push for an end to secrecy in the
multilateral banks and for linkages between bank loans and environment and
labour practices.
Railtrack sell-off:
Brian Mawhinney, Britain's secretary of state for transport, is scheduled to
announce the multi-billion- pound sell-off of Railtrack, the body that owns
the UK's railway track and stations. New legislation is not required to
privatise Railtrack because the powers are already enshrined in law. But
Labour will launch a fierce attack on the plan, particularly because a
minister promised during the passage of the Railways Bill - which privatised
train services - that Railtrack would stay in the public sector 'for the
foreseeable future'.
FT Surveys: Germany and World Nuclear Industry.
Kuchma meets Clinton
Ukrainian president, Leonid Kuchma, begins a state visit in the US. He meets
President Bill Clinton, other senior US officials, and Michel Camdessus, IMF
director. With new economic reforms on course and the nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty ratified last week, Mr Kuchma expects a warm
welcome from Mr Clinton. He will ask for continued US support to soften the
blow of economic reform, ease nuclear disarmament and promote foreign
investment.
Mr Kuchma will present a new plan to shut down the Chernobyl nuclear power
station. Ukraine will seek western financing of Dollars 6.49bn (Pounds
3.95bn) to fund projects including the decommissioning of Chernobyl and the
building of two western-type units on its site. In turn, Ukraine would cover
up to Dollars 6bn in other costs associated with shutting down Chernobyl.
Finland's president Martti Ahtisaari starts an official visit to Germany (to
Nov 25).
Greek cotton scandal:
European Commission officials hold talks in Athens with Greece's agriculture
ministry on cleaning up cotton farming. Greece is being asked to repay up to
Ecu120m (Dollars 100m) and accept regular EU checks on its cotton gins in
order to prevent a repetition of what local newspapers call the Great Cotton
Scandal of 1991-92. Cotton production figures were allegedly inflated by
about 10 per cent that year so that growers could claim extra subsidies.
Boxing boycott: The Mexico City-based World Boxing Council begins a boycott
of all world title fights in California for four months. The move is in
protest at a recent state initiative that would bar public aid to illegal
immigrants. Mexicans are expected to be hit most by Proposition 187, which
will affect health, education and other social services.
Meanwhile, enforcement of the measure has been temporarily blocked by a
judge in Los Angeles on the ground that it may be unconstitutional.
The Institute of Directors holds its annual dinner at Grosvenor House,
London.
Holidays: Lebanon (Independence Day).
Countdown to WTO
The preparatory committee of the World Trade Organisation meets in Geneva to
take stock two weeks ahead of the implementation conference that is due to
set a January 1 starting date for the WTO and the Uruguay Round global trade
accords. However, nothing will be decided until after next week's crucial
votes in the US Congress on Uruguay Round ratification (Nov 29 and Dec 2).
South Korea and China are due to sign a memorandum of understanding in
Beijing on the possible construction of two South Korean-model light-water
nuclear reactors in China. The two countries also plan to sign a protocol on
co-operation in nuclear safety matters. If the project goes ahead, it will
be the first time South Korea has built nuclear reactors for China, North
Korea's last remaining ally.
German economy: Revised official tax estimates will be published which
German finance minister Theo Waigel hopes will show that he will need up to
DM10bn (Dollars 6.7bn) less than the DM69bn he expected to borrow to round
off this year's budget.
European Union fisheries ministers will try to agree terms for the full
integration of Spain and Portugal into the Common Fisheries Policy. Madrid
and Lisbon made full CFP rights by next year a condition of their approval
of fish-rich Norway joining, along with Austria, Finland and Sweden.
US economy: Durable goods figures for October should show a modest rise.
Although volatile transport orders have caused this indicator to fluctuate
in past months, analysts say a recent survey of purchasing managers
indicates a rise of about 0.5 per cent.
Animal health: The UK parliament's agriculture select committee of MPs
publishes the findings of its inquiry into the effectiveness of health
controls introduced for the traffic of live animals in the European single
market. The report will also consider the UK's anti-rabies quarantine
arrangements for domestic pets.
National Tree Week:
Britain commences a nation-wide festival of trees organised by the Tree
Council (to Dec 4). It aims to highlight the importance of trees in the
environment and to promote tree-planting and good management.
FT Surveys: Mexico.
Holidays: Japan (Labour Thanksgiving Day).
Channel tunnel rail link
Draft legislation for a Pounds 2.7bn (Dollars 4.4bn) rail link between the
Channel tunnel and London is due before the UK parliament. The link should
cut 30 minutes from the three-hour journey between London and Paris. Work is
due to start in early 1997 and end in 2002. The designated route passes
under the river Thames near Gravesend to enter London from the east via
Stratford.
Turkey's foreign minister Mumtaz Soysal travels to Bonn for meetings with
his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel. Germany occupies the rotating
presidency of the European Union and Turkey's fraught negotiations over
customs union with the EU, due to come into force on January 1, 1996, are
likely to feature high on the agenda.
French economy: The recovery should be confirmed in gross domestic product
figures for the third quarter. Economists expect a rise of about 0.8 per
cent, reflecting improved industrial production and consumption and strong
performance by exporters.
Saleroom: A blue teddy bear called Emil, bought two years ago in a German
flea market for the equivalent of Pounds 1.50, is expected to set a record
price for a teddy at an auction of toys and dolls by Sotheby's in London.
The record is Pounds 55,000.
FT Surveys: Italian Banking and Finance.
Holidays: US (Thanksgiving Day).
Last data before Budget
The Confederation of British Industry's monthly survey of UK manfacturing
trends will be about the last piece of UK economic news before Kenneth
Clarke's second Budget on November 29. Although recent CBI surveys have been
bullish in tone, analysts would not be surprised to see signs of some
slowdown in future growth of manufacturing output.
Ro-Ro ferry design: Britain's Royal Institution of Naval Architects sponsors
a one-day symposium in London on recent research into the survivability of
roll-on roll-off ferries, following the Estonia ferry disaster in September
which killed more than 900. The institution believes the open car deck
system of Ro-Ro ships cannot be justified. It has called for changes to
ferry design to allow passengers and crew more time to disembark in the
event of a sinking.
Betty Maxwell, widow of disgraced British tycoon Robert Maxwell, publishes
her book about their marriage, A Mind of My Own.
In September, two Labour MPs failed to persuade Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney-general, to block publication of the book on the grounds that it
could prejudice the forthcoming trials of Robert Maxwell's sons, Ian and
Kevin.
Cricket: The first of five Test matches between Australia and England begins
in Brisbane. England hope to bring back the Ashes when the tour ends in
February.
Uruguay elects a president
On Sunday, Uruguayans indulge in a frenzy of voting, electing a president as
well as both chambers of congress and 19 governors. Of the 21 presidential
candidates there are four front runners: two from the governing Blanco
party, one from the opposition Colorados and another from the Encuentro
Progresista, a broad left-wing coalition. The elections will determine
whether Uruguay pushes ahead with the free-market reforms initiated by
current Blanco president, Luis Alberto Lacalle.
Rugby: Wales play South Africa in Cardiff on Saturday.
Argentina's two main opposition parties, the Radicals and the Frente Grande
coalition, on Sunday nominate who will challenge Carlos Menem in next May's
presidential elections. One of the two Radical pre-candidates is considering
an electoral pact with the Frente Grande, a tactic that might force May's
elections to a second round.
Voting starts in Norway on Sunday in a national referendum on European Union
membership. Norway is the last of the four countries due to join the EU next
year to hold a referendum on its accession treaty. Getting a Yes from
Norway's sceptical voters, who narrowly rejected membership in 1972, is
considered the hardest challenge. Compiled by Patrick Stiles and Ian
Holdsworth. Fax: (+44) (0)171 873 3194.
