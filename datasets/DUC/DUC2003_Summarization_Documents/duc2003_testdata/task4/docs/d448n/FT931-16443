THE COMPANY which operates the Braer, the Liberian-registered tanker which
lies wrecked and spilling oil on the coast of Shetland, last night defended
the master and crew of the ship against criticism of their handling of the
emergency.
Mr Mike Hudner, chief executive of the B&amp;H group, the New York-based
operator, said: 'Suggestions that the crew should have remained on board as
the ship went aground conflict with our belief that human life takes
priority over all other considerations.
'The safety of the crew must come first. The coastguard authorities are in
no doubt that the total evacuation of the ship was absolutely necessary to
guarantee their survival.'
He was speaking after critical comments from the owner of a tug sent to aid
the stricken vessel on Tuesday morning as it was being blown on to the rocks
by force 10 winds. The tug owner, Mr Barry Cork, had expressed anger that
when his tug had reached the Braer no one was available on the tanker for
two hours to try to take a tow line.
Mr Hudner also defended the route taken by the ship on its voyage from
Norway to Canada, which ran through the 22-mile-wide channel between
Sumburgh and Fair Isle where it was hit by storm-force winds.
Oil was continuing to pour from the Braer's punctured tanks yesterday as a
pollution control operation began. The wind had subsided since Tuesday but
it was still blowing from a westerly direction, confining much of the oil
slick to Quendale Bay where the ship lies.
The Braer had shifted slightly since Tuesday and though its stern is
underwater with the bow above the water it appears that its back has not
been broken. About half the oil on board may have already leaked out.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the Marine Accident
Investigation Branch would hold an inquiry. Lord Caithness, shipping
minister, said the inquiry would exceed the usual investigation of
shipwrecks.
Sir Hector Monro, Scottish Office environment and agriculture minister, said
Shetland would not be 'out of pocket' as a result of the disaster. He was
studying possible compensation for farmers for damage to grazing caused by
oil from the tanker showering their land.
Yesterday, five Dakota aircraft of the Department of Transport's marine
pollution unit sprayed dispersant chemicals around the ship and on the
surrounding oil slick which is between four and five miles long.
But the sea was still too rough to deploy booms to prevent the oil entering
coastal inlets.
There was also criticism of the Braer's mixed Greek and Filipino crew,
sailing under a Greek master, after an apparent delay in summoning help from
Shetland coast guards when the tanker suffered engine failure.
Mr Hudner said the Braer was 'blacked out' - losing electrical power when
the engines failed - at 4.40am and was in touch with the coast guards at
5.05am. It ordered up a tug at 5.19am.
The delay between contacting the coast guard and ordering the tug was caused
by the master's need to contact B&amp;H in New York, which would in turn have
contacted the ship's insurance underwriter. But Mr Hudner did not regard
this as a meaningful delay.
Mr Jean Gaulin, chairman and chief executive of Ultramar, the oil company
which owns the Braer's 84,000 tonne cargo, said the ship had Dollars 700m
(Pounds 460.5m) of insurance cover, which he believed was sufficient to
cover the cost of damage.
In order to win awards of over Dollars 83m claimants would need to prove the
owner guilty of gross negligence - breaching the terms of international
conventions limiting owners' liability.
Robert Gibbens in Montreal writes: Ultramar has obtained a writ to seize the
Celtic, a sister ship of the crippled Braer, from B&amp;H Shipping. Ultramar
said it was a protective move to ensure that, as the owner of the Braer's
oil cargo, it would be reimbursed for any loss. It has also filed a Dollars
25m claim against the company.
