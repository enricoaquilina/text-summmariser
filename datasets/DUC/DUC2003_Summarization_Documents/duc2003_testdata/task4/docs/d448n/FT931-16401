AT SPAIN'S north-western port of La Coruna, tankers have twice in the past
16 years been impaled on the harbour's outlying rocks. But by the second
time, when the tanker Aegean Sea ran aground just over a month ago, damage
containment had demonstrably improved.
When the Urquiola created a spillage of some 100,000 tonnes in May 1976, La
Coruna's fishing community heaved oil out of the sea in buckets.
When the Aegean Sea, with a cargo of 570,000 barrels of crude, broke up at
the entrance of the port in thick fog on December 3, within hours 17
platforms were in position to start suctioning the oil.
The Urquiola spillage taught the authorities, for example, not to use
detergents. In 1976 they were used in La Coruna's estuary and all but killed
off the local mollusc industry. Some 15,000 kilos of clams used to be
collected every day, but the total since has rarely exceeded 2,000 kilos.
With the Aegean Sea's spillage, booms were on standby in addition to the
platforms and a series of container lorries equipped with suction apparatus
that were stationed on the shore. Booms, totalling 6km in all, were thrown
across the entrance to the estuary and across those of its adjoining fjords.
The booms broke because of the heavy swell - La Coruna's coastline has
barely 86 days a year of calm seas - but storms there last month helped to
disperse the slick.
The Aegean Sea was carrying, like the Braer, light crude that evaporates
more easily than heavy crude. Unlike the Shetland Islands tragedy, a fire,
which the authorities refrained from putting out, followed the shipwreck.
In all, between 15,000 and 20,000 tonnes of crude out of the Aegean Sea's
79,341-tonne load spilt out to sea. Some 6,500 tonnes were pumped out
directly from the stricken tanker and about 5,000 were suctioned from the
platforms and the shore. More than half the total load burnt itself out.
At the end of last week, with the pumping procedures virtually completed,
work began to clean up the beaches. Learning from the earlier disaster, the
authorities have opted to do the cleaning manually as far as possible, with
workers painstakingly scraping the crude-drenched sand with shovels rather
than using earth-moving equipment, which risks burying the oil more deeply
into the ground.
The rocks will also be scraped. High-pressure hoses employed after the
Urquiola spill were later found to have to have created unnecessary damage
to micro-organisms.
The effects of the Aegean Sea disaster on the surrounding fishing grounds
will take a long time to assess. The slick has already broken up into tiny
particles that are suspended on the surface but will eventually drop to the
ocean floor, where they will stifle plants and crustaceans alike. From the
beginning of this month, the local fishing fleets were authorised to return
to their traditional areas.
