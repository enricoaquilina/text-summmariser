For a company that was in crisis and making heavy losses only three years
ago, Stena Line, the world's biggest ferry operator, has staged a remarkable
comeback. Despite difficult market conditions in both its Scandinavian and
UK markets, it is heading for a record SKr500m profit in 1994 and it is once
again planning significant fleet investments.
The severe difficulties experienced earlier in the decade were caused by the
company's Dollars 570m purchase of Sealink, Britain's second-biggest ferry
operator, in 1990. The move left it with huge debt-servicing costs and a
need to undertake important restructuring in the newly-acquired operation.
The Gothenburg-based company even threatened to close Sealink entirely,
barely 18 months after the purchase in a move to force unions to accept
drastic cost-cutting.
If Stena ever shared the widespread view that it had overreached itself,
these days it has no such doubts. Mr Bo Lerenius, Stena Line president,
says: 'It was a bold move, but strategically it was definitely the right
one.' What has changed is not just the outlook for Stena Sealink, but the
broader financial recovery which the whole group has staged over the past
three years.
It got out of its crisis by hacking back costs, launching a hefty rights
issue and convertible loan, and reigning in investments. Together with
rising profits and increasing cash flow, the group has been able to pay a
substantial part of its debt. It is now confident of getting its
equity-to-assets ratio back to the pre-Sealink purchase level of 30 per cent
by early next year.
Stena today carries more than 14m passengers a year on 15 routes in 32
vessels. The irony is that the UK routes have ended up supporting the group
at a time when its Scandinavian business has suffered from recession and the
weak Swedish krona. Passenger numbers on UK routes climbed 10 per cent in
the first eight months of this year, while Scandinavian routes saw a 1.4 per
cent decrease.
Conditions in both markets have been difficult. In the UK there has been a
price war in the run-up to the full start-up of the Channel Tunnel. In
Scandinavia, consumer spending has fallen and there has been a sharp fall in
travel on some routes in the wake of the Estonia tragedy.
Given that Stena has some 34 per cent of the British passenger shipping
market - second only to P&amp;O - it cannot afford to be complacent about the
Channel Tunnel. Its main UK route, Dover-Calais, will be competing head-on
with tunnel traffic.
Stena is sceptical about Eurotunnel's assumptions that it will eventually
gain some 30 per cent of freight traffic and 50 per cent of cars on
short-sea cross-channel routes, but it is basing its strategy on them
nevertheless.
One solution would be for it to seek an extensive collaboration with P&amp;O,
although this would have to meet with the approval of the relevant
competition authorities. In any case, it expects the overall market to grow,
helped by economic growth in both Britain and France.
Nordic ferry traffic has been hit hard by the sinking of the ferry Estonia,
which capsized in heavy seas in September with the loss of more than 900
lives. Stena has suffered less than other shipping groups, partly because it
does not operate in the Baltic Sea where the tragedy occurred. The company's
passenger volumes in the Swedish and Norwegian markets fell by 12-14 per
cent during October and November, although there are now signs of recovery.
Stena, like other ferry operators, is bracing itself for some tough new
safety regulations in the wake of the tragedy. Although these will add to
costs, it believes the impact will be neutral in competitive terms because
rivals will have to implement the same measures.
The secret weapon in Stena's armoury is undoubtedly its revolutionary HSS
Highspeed Sea Service project, which it has developed with its main owner,
Stena AB. Three fast ferries, which will halve normal travel times, have
been ordered from a Finnish yard and a fourth is planned. 'We are quite
convinced that this will change ferry traffic a great deal,' says Mr
Lerenius. However, some observers regard the project as technically risky,
and at a total estimated cost of SKr3bn, it is certainly an ambitious
investment.
It is the first time that high-speed ferries will be able to carry lorries,
trailers and buses alongside passengers and cars. The boast is that they
will offer a degree of comfort and reliability which present fast vessels,
such as catamarans, can not. The first of the Finnish-built vessels, which
will each be able to carry 1,500 passengers, is due to enter service across
the Irish Sea next September.
A lot is riding on the success of the ships, not least because they are an
element in the group's overall strategy of enhancing the transport-derived
portion of its revenues. The aim is to gradually reduce the company's
dependence on duty-free sales which are due to be phased out under European
Union rules in 1999.
Already Stena has reduced the proportion of on-board income (including
duty-free) as a percentage of total operating income from 55 per cent in
1988 to less than 35 per cent today.
