lead to a review of emergency procedures

The catastrophic failure of lifeboats and life rafts to save passengers in
last week's Baltic ferry disaster is set to bring demands for a review of
emergency procedures on passenger vessels as well as the review promised by
the International Maritime Organisation of the design of roll-on, roll-off
ships.
One of the most distressing sights from the rescue operation of the Estonia,
which capsized and sank with the loss of more than 900 lives, was of dozens
of life rafts discovered either empty, or in many cases swamped by icy water
and containing the bodies of people who drowned or died of exposure despite
managing to clamber aboard the rubber boats. Only a handful of the Estonia's
large lifeboats were even launched.
'I can agree that the equipment was not doing its job since so many died,
but it is up to the rule makers and designers to look into this,' Mr Sten
Forsberg, technical director of Nordstrom and Thulin, the Swedish
co-operator of the Estonia, said at the weekend. 'I am quite sure that the
aftermath of this tremendous tragedy will result in stricter regulations for
life-saving equipment.'
The chilling evidence from the Estonia suggests that in a case where a ship
lists suddenly and heavily, the ordered evacuation of passengers in
lifeboats and life rafts can quickly become virtually impossible -
especially in storm conditions and with panic surging through a stricken
ship. A spokeswoman for the Viking Line, a Finnish-based operator in the
Baltic which used to run the Estonia, said that in the best conditions
preparing and launching lifeboats took 15 to 20 minutes, 'but in conditions
like those faced by the Estonia, the system can quickly break down.'
Ship operators say lifeboats cannot be launched if a ship is listing more
than 15 degrees. But in heavy seas, a lesser list may make launching
impossible. As lifeboats and many life rafts are designed to be loaded with
passengers before being lowered into the water, this means that even in
conditions much less severe than those faced by the Estonia, evacuating
passengers by lifeboat fails.
The Estonia carried rubber life rafts packed in plastic containers. The
rafts were designed to pop up to the surface and self-inflate once submerged
below a depth of four metres - which they did. But most, clearly, were
easily swamped by the high seas, as water washed in through the door in
their weatherproof covers. One survivor said the raft he clambered on to was
upside down.
The Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri on Saturday quoted Mr Jens Peter Bie,
an executive at the Danish company Viking Life-Saving Equipment, which
supplied life rafts to the Estonia, as saying the rafts on the ship were 14
years old. He said newer, self-inflating and self-righting rafts were
available, but ship owners were deterred from buying them by costs 30-40 per
cent greater than standard rafts.
Mr Harri Kulovara, operations chief for the Finnish-run Silja Line, said: 'I
believe the rubber life rafts can be more effective than the traditional
lifeboats - they are much easier to launch and use. But they must be
launched properly.'
Questions have also been raised since the Estonia disaster about the way
ferry operators brief passengers on emergency procedures. The requirement
under IMO regulations falls well short of the obligatory safety
demonstrations made on airlines.
No lifeboat drill is required on the 12-14 hour overnight sailings that are
the common duration on the Baltic routes and none is offered by the
operators.
Swedish and Finnish operators say their crews are regularly drilled to cope
with emergencies. They make public announcements to stress to passengers the
importance of reading the emergency procedure notices and run videos on
passenger TV services.
However, as the Estonia catastrophe showed, even the best prepared crews and
passengers can be quickly overcome when a ship begins to list and sink.
