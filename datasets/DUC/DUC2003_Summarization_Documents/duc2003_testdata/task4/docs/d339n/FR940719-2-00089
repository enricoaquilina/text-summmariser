SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposes to disapprove a new drug application (NDA) for Deprenyl (deprenyl
citrate or deprenyl), submitted by Discovery Experimental and Development, Inc., 29949 S.R. 54 West, Wesley Chapel,
FL 33543 (Discovery). FDA is also providing Discovery notice of an opportunity for a hearing on the proposal. The grounds
for FDA's proposed refusal to approve are numerous. Most importantly, FDA concludes that there is insufficient information
to determine whether Discovery's deprenyl citrate is safe for use or will have the effect it purports or is represented
to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling. Discovery's
deprenyl citrate is intended for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Discovery has submitted an NDA for deprenyl citrate with proposed labeling for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Throughout most of this document, the drug product is referred to as deprenyl citrate or deprenyl. Occasionally,
especially when referring to the active drug substance, the term selegiline is used to be consistent with terms and
claims made in the NDA. An NDA for another deprenyl product, selegiline hydrochloride (Eldepryl
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) held by Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Somerset), was approved on June 5, 1989, for the treatment of Parkinson's
disease. The Somerset product, l-deprenyl, is the levorotatory acetylenic derivative of phenethylamine. Discovery
claims that there are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``four distinct functions of deprenyl in helping curb or delay the effects of Alzheimer's disease, and could very
well delay the onset of disease, if taken as a preventative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Function 1. Deprenyl causes the body to naturally produce more dopamine, which normally depletes with age, which,
in turn, assists in maintaining healthy brain cells.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Function 2. Deprenyl blocks toxic free radicals from breaking down dopamine, which causes further degeneration
of brain cells.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Function 3. Deprenyl revives malfunctioning and dormant brain cells, bringing back lost body functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Function 4. Deprenyl increases the body's hormone content, which improves the body's motorability and the immune
system * * *.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 29, 1991, Discovery submitted NDA 20&hyph;242 with data and information intended to demonstrate deprenyl
citrate's safety and effectiveness in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and proposed that the product be marketed
without prescription. Discovery submitted a minor amendment on December 6, 1991, providing an updated table of contents
and some revised pages in the NDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 17, 1992, FDA notified Discovery by letter that the NDA was not acceptable for filing under 21 CFR 314.101
because the NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. FDA described numerous deficiencies
in an attachment to the letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to FDA's refusal to file, Discovery requested an informal conference with FDA, and this was held on November
16, 1992. In a letter to Discovery dated November 24, 1992, FDA notified Discovery of its option to amend its application
under 21 CFR 314.101(a)(3) and file it over protest, and Discovery did this on December 7, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter dated December 31, 1992, FDA acknowledged Discovery's request to file over protest and stated that the
application would be reviewed as filed. (In a letter dated February 9, 1993, Discovery objected to the advice given
in FDA's letters of November 24, and December 31, 1992, that an NDA filed over protest may not be amended once filed.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter to Discovery dated August 20, 1993, FDA concluded that the information presented by Discovery was inadequate
and that the application was not approvable (21 CFR 314.120). Discovery responded with a letter dated September 1,
1993, requesting a time extension of 180 days, under 21 CFR 314.120(a)(5), to consider its options regarding its application.
FDA granted this request. In a letter dated March 1, 1994, and received by FDA March 7, 1994, Discovery requested the
opportunity for a hearing under 21 CFR 314.120(a)(3) on the question of whether there are grounds for denying approval
of NDA 20&hyph;242.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. The Deficiencies in NDA 20&hyph;242
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Discovery is required to submit, among other things, ``full reports of investigations which have been made to show
whether or not such drug is safe for use and whether such drug is effective in use,'' under section 505(b)(1) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 355(b)(1)), as well as all information required under 21 CFR 314.50.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discovery's NDA 20&hyph;242 provides insufficient information to determine whether Deprenyl gelatin capsules
and liquid are safe, and fails to include adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not
Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid are safe; the NDA lacks substantial evidence that Deprenyl gelatin capsules
and liquid will have the effect they are represented to have; and the methods used in, and facilities and controls used
for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid are inadequate to preserve
their identity, strength, quality, and purity (section 505(d) of the act). In addition, Discovery's NDA 20&hyph;242
fails to include an adequate environmental assessment, fails to include proper labeling and bioavailability data,
and fails to demonstrate compliance with current good manufacturing practice regulations. A detailed description
of these deficiencies follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Safety of Deprenyl
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 505(d) of the act and 21 CFR 314.125(b)(2) and (b)(4), Discovery fails to include in NDA 20&hyph;242
adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid are
safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling, and sufficient
information about Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid to determine whether they are safe for use under the conditions
prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Preclinical Data
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Discovery fails to include either reports of the complete range of studies necessary to assess the pharmacological
and toxicological profile of the drug (21 CFR 314.50(d)) or clinical data to obviate the need for such studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discovery fails to include any of the required toxicology studies such as: (1) Acute and subacute studies in rodents
and nonrodents, (2) chronic studies consisting of a 6-month rodent and a 12-month nonrodent study, (3) a genotoxicity
screen, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) studies that examine the effects of the drug on reproduction, and (5) carcinogenicity studies (21 CFR 314.50(d)(2)).
Examples of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for the Format and Content of the Nonclinical/
Pharmacology/Toxicology Section of an Application.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Clinical Data
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, selegiline hydrochloride (l-deprenyl) is currently being marketed as Eldepryl
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by Somerset for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The exclusivity period for this application expires on June
6, 1994. FDA could only review NDA 20&hyph;242 as an application submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the act because
until the exclusivity period of Eldepryl
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expires, no application submitted under section 505(b)(2) or section 505(j) of the act which refers to Eldepryl
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can be approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In NDA 20&hyph;242, Discovery attempts to use the previous approval of Somerset's selegiline hydrochloride product
as evidence of the safety of its deprenyl citrate product. The mere fact of approval may not, however, be used in this
way. Section 505(b)(1) of the act requires that Discovery submit full reports of investigations that have been made
to show its product is safe. Safety studies of Eldepryl
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are not available to Discovery for use in satisfying this requirement. Moreover, if Discovery's claims that Deprenyl
is ``purer, more potent and more effective'' than Eldepryl
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are true, such differences could reflect, among other things, increased absorption or rate of absorption, with increased
concentration in, or rate of transmission of the drug into the brain, and a greater potential for adverse events. In
NDA 20&hyph;242, no safety study was performed using Discovery's product and there was no study comparing the bioavailability
of Discovery's product to Eldepryl
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Accordingly, FDA cannot assess its safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. The Effectiveness of Deprenyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 505(d) of the act and 21 CFR 314.125(b)(5), Discovery has failed to provide in NDA 20&hyph;242 substantial
evidence, consisting of adequate and well-controlled studies, that Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid will have
the effect they are represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in their
proposed labeling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed labeling in Discovery's application claims that deprenyl citrate demonstrates a ``quantitative and
qualitative improvement in cognitive functions of Alzheimer's patients as a result of the inhibition of MAO&hyph;B
activity.'' To support this claim, Discovery includes reprints from 171 articles in the medical and scientific literature.
Although some of these articles pertain to deprenyl, not one study used Discovery's product or a product with a known
bioavailability relationship to Discovery's product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discovery identified 12 of these 171 articles as evidence of the effectiveness of deprenyl citrate in the treatment
of Alzheimer's disease. This notice discusses the first of these articles in greater detail than the others because
it has many characteristics of a well-controlled study and, if the report submitted were supplemented with additional
information, it might qualify as an adequate and well-controlled study supporting the effectiveness of a deprenyl
drug product in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The remaining 11 studies are inherently incapable of being
regarded as substantial evidence of the effectiveness of deprenyl citrate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease;
these are therefore summarized only briefly below.

i. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Design
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. One hundred thirty-six patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer-type disorders were enrolled in a 3-month randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. They were evaluated at baseline and months 1, 2, and 3. Of the enrolled patients,
17 dropped out following randomization and before the first effectiveness assessment (the article does not report
the number from each group, but if original randomization created two groups of approximately equal size, i.e., 68
in each group, then, based on the number remaining in each group at the end of the study, virtually all 17 drop-outs would
seem to have been from the placebo group). Seven more (three on deprenyl and four on placebo) did not complete 3 months
of therapy. No explanation is given for the 17 early drop-outs or for the apparent imbalance in them. The seven later
patients were discontinued for poor efficacy (two deprenyl patients, four placebo patients) or poor compliance
(one deprenyl patient). There was thus an imbalance in the number of patients treated and analyzed: 65 L-deprenyl
(10 milligrams per day) and 47 placebo patients were included in the final analysis of effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effectiveness measurements were conducted in the following prefixed sequence: (1) Blessed's Dementia Scale, (2)
digit span (Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS)), (3) Raskin and Crook's Inventory of Psychic and Somatic Complaints for
the Elderly, (4) short story (WMS)_immediate recall, (5) simple copy of drawings, (6) Toulouse-Pieron attention
test, (7) facilitated copy of drawings, (8) short story (WMS)_delayed recall, and (9) word fluency. Measurements
were taken at baseline, and at the end of the first second, and third months.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Results
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Based on an analysis of variance between treatments including all four test occasions, statistically significant
differences are reported favoring L-deprenyl over placebo on all measurements except one portion of the Toulouse-Pieron
attention test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Taken at face value, the results in this published study suggest a positive effect of L-deprenyl in patients with
Alzheimer's disease. However, the published report lacks many of the details needed to assess a study. Thus, this
study, as published and without additional information, cannot contribute to fulfilling the statutory requirement
for substantial evidence of effectiveness:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Discovery has failed to provide data from a bioequivalence study demonstrating that the rate and extent of absorption
of its product is essentially identical to the product manufactured by Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. (Parma, Italy)
used in the Mangoni study (21 CFR 320.21 and 314.126(d)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) No protocol is available for review to determine if the design and analysis, including analysis of patients not
completing the study, were performed as proposed (21 CFR 314.50 and 314.126(b)(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Measures and specific procedures to minimize bias (e.g., details of randomization, blinding, maintenance of
patient assignment code) are not described, and no explanation for the large imbalance in initial dropouts is given
(21 CFR 314.126(b)(5)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Case report forms or data tabulations, and individual patient data on safety and effectiveness measures are not
provided (21 CFR 314.50 and 314.126(a)).

C. Methods, Facilities, and Controls used by Discovery
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Discovery's application is not approvable under section 505(d) of the act and 21 CFR 314.125(b)(1). The methods to
be used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, and holding of the drug
substance and the drug product are inadequate to preserve its identity, strength, quality, purity, stability, and
bioavailability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Drug Substance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application fails to contain adequate information concerning the methods used in the synthesis, extraction,
isolation, or purification of the new drug substance to determine its identity, strength, quality, and purity. The
many items of information required under 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1) that are absent from NDA 20&hyph;242 include, but are
not limited to, the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. A full description of the physical and chemical characteristics of the drug substance, including adequate proof
of structure and stereochemistry. This characterization should be for the selegiline base and citrate (claimed
by the applicant to be a unique drug substance), and should include elemental analysis, infra-red spectroscopy,
ultraviolet spectroscopy, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (suitable to determine characterization from
coupling, peak positions, and peak patterns), a specific identity test for citrate and a suitable study to demonstrate
that a 1:1 citrate salt has actually been formed. Examples of the types of material FDA would review are described in
``Guideline for Submitting Supporting Documentation in Drug Applications for the Manufacture of Drug Substances,''
pp. 3&hyph;5. In addition, the NDA does not include all physical data for the selegiline citrate and a certificate
of analysis with completed tests for all proposed specifications. Examples of the types of material FDA would review
are described in ``Guideline for Submitting Samples and Analytical Data for Methods Validation,'' p. 5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. An adequate description of the method of synthesis. The application lacks manufacturing procedures or master
batch formulas with quantities. Examples of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for
Submitting Supporting Documentation in Drug Applications for the Manufacture of Drug Substances,'' e.g., pp. 11&hyph;18.
Discovery's argument that its manufacture of the selegiline base was a patented process that expired in 1985 does
not obviate the need for Discovery to submit complete manufacturing information. This information is required regardless
of whether or not the patent expired.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. A list of in-process controls describing the methods used to determine the completion of each reaction. Examples
of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for Submitting Supporting Documentation in
Drug Applications for the Manufacture of Drug Substances,'' pp. 29&hyph;36.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. A description of the reagents, solvents, and materials used in the synthesis of the drug substance. Examples of
the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for Submitting Supporting Documentation in Drug
Applications for the Manufacture of Drug Substances,'' p. 10.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
v. A description of the container closure system for storage and shipping of the drug substance. The application does
not provide the name of the manufacturer for each component or a letter of authorization to the manufacturer's drug
master file. Examples of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for the Format and Content
of the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Section of an Application,'' pp. 4&hyph;5. See also, 21 CFR 314.420(b).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Components, composition, and formulation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The application does not identify by established name, if any, or complete chemical name, each of the substances
used as components of the drug product including each substance used in the synthesis, extraction, or other method
of preparation of the new drug substance. The specific areas of information pertaining to drug product components,
composition, and formulation required by 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii) that are absent from NDA 20&hyph;242 include the
following: (1) A list of all components used in the manufacture of the drug product, (2) a statement of the composition
of the drug product, and (3) a statement of the specifications and analytical methods for each component.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is even unclear from the application what dosage form Discovery intends to manufacture. Tests absent from the application
include a specific identity test, a chiral identity test, a chiral purity test, an assay for the drug substance, and
a dissolution test. Such tests are necessary to permit FDA to make an assessment of the drug product.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Drug product laboratory methods

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The application fails to include specifications and analytical methods as are necessary to assure identity, strength,
quality, and purity of the drug product (21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii)), and in particular fails to include a full description
of the laboratory methods that will be used to check each lot of the finished drug product. Sampling methods, procedures,
and a rationale for the sampling plan are not provided, and the regulatory specifications and test methods for the
drug product are also not provided. Examples of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Drug product container system, packaging, and controls
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The application fails to provide adequate information with respect to the characteristics of, and the test methods
employed for, the container, closure, or other component parts of the drug package to assure their suitability for
the intended use. A description of the packaging procedures and in-process controls for the drug product are not included,
and the container/closure system used for the drug product is not even described (21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii)). Examples
of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for Submitting Documentation for Packaging
for Human Drugs and Biologics.''

3. Methods Validation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Discovery's application fails to include adequate laboratory test procedures to assure that the finished drug product
(or drug substance) conforms to appropriate standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity. Validations
of the test methods were not performed. Actual samples and full information pertaining to the samples were not submitted
to the NDA at the time of application (21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(i) and (ii). Examples of the types of material FDA would review
are described in ``Guideline for Submitting Samples and Analytical data for Methods Validation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Reference Standard
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application lacks information about the reference standard and a sample of this standard for the active ingredient,
claimed to be selegiline citrate or selegiline base. It is necessary that the physical and chemical properties of
the reference standard be described to ensure its integrity to serve as such (21 CFR 314.50(e)(1)(i)(c)). Examples
of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for Submitting Samples and Analytical Data
for Methods Validation,'' p. 6.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Stability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application fails to include a full description of, and data derived from, studies of the stability of the drug.
The stability of the drug product is not demonstrated in the container closure system proposed for use (21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii);
see also 21 CFR 211.166.) Examples of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for Submitting
Documentation for the Stability of Human Drugs and Biologics.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Establishment Locations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application fails to identify and show the location of each establishment conducting a part of the manufacturing,
processing, packaging, and labeling operations (21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii)). Examples of the types
of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for Submitting Documentation for the Manufacture of and
Controls for Drug Products,'' p. 4. The application lacks a clear delineation of the operations that will be performed
by persons other than Discovery. For example, the contract facility used for encapsulation of the drug substance
solution is not identified in the submission.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A complete and satisfactory environmental assessment is required under 21 CFR 25.22(a)(14) and 314.50(d)(1)(iii),
and failure to submit an adequate environmental assessment is grounds for FDA's refusal to approve an NDA (21 CFR 25.22(b)).
An NDA must contain either a claim for categorical exclusion under 21 CFR 25.24 or an environmental assessment under
21 CFR 25.31a. Discovery's environmental assessment was not a claim for exclusion, and consisted of a one paragraph
statement that is facially unresponsive to the requirements of 21 CFR 25.31a. For example, the environmental assessment
in NDA 20&hyph;242 does not provide an identification of chemical substances that are the subject of the proposed
action.

D. The Labeling of Deprenyl
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application is not approvable under section 505(d) of the act, as well as 21 CFR 314.125(b)(8), because the proposed
labeling does not comply with requirements for labels and labeling set forth in 21 CFR Part 201 and 21 CFR 314.50. The
proposed labeling fails to meet the statutory and regulatory requirements in numerous ways, including, but not limited
to, the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Labeling to be used for the packaged drug product is not provided in the application (21 CFR 314.50(e)(2)(ii)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Labeling to be used for shipment and storage of the bulk drug substance (see 21 CFR 201.122), as well as all labeling
required to demonstrate compliance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations (see, e.g., 21
CFR 211.122), are not provided in the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proprietary name or designation of the drug product is not properly accompanied by the proper established name
of the drug substance in the label or labeling of the drug product (21 CFR 201.10(g)(1)). Furthermore, the name ``deprenyl''
(as the base, hydrochloride, or citrate salt) is not acceptable as the established name of the drug (see 21 CFR 299.4).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. The Bioavailability or Bioequivalence of Deprenyl
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application is not approvable under section 505(d) of the act and 21 CFR 314.125(b)(9) because it does not contain
bioavailability or bioequivalence data required under 21 CFR part 320. The application must contain either of the
following: (1) Evidence demonstrating the in vivo bioavailability of the drug product or (2) information which would
permit the agency to waive demonstration of in vivo bioavailability. Discovery submitted neither and therefore
has not fulfilled the requirements for the human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability section of the NDA as required
by 21 CFR 314.50(d)(3) and 320.21(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discovery contends that it is entitled to a waiver of the demonstration of in vivo bioavailability because the drug
and its metabolites are not measurable in plasma ``at their designated levels.'' This contention is incorrect, as
shown in two articles that provide information on metabolites. (See, Salonen, J. S., ``Determination of the Amine
Metabolites of Selegiline in Biological Fluids by Capillary Gas Chromatography,''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Suppl., 136:44&hyph;59, 1990.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discovery also states in the application that ``[d]ue to the stereospecificity and low [cerebrospinal fluid] concentration
of the L-amphetamine metabolites recovered during this trial, these metabolites do not contribute to the clinical
efficacy of deprenyl, nor do they pose any risk to the patient after extended use.'' This statement is not substantiated
in Discovery's application and, while taken in part from an earlier article by Heinonen (Heinonen, E. H., et al., ``Pharmacokinetics
and Metabolism of Selegiline,'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Acta Neurologica Scandinavia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 126:93&hyph;99, 1989) is at odds with the information described in the 1990 article by Heinonen which, states that
desmethylselegiline may contribute to the pharmacological activity during selegiline treatment.

F. Discovery's Compliance with CGMP's
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application is not approvable under section 505(d) of the act and 21 CFR 314.125(b)(13) because the methods to
be used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, and holding of the drug
substance and drug product do not comply with the CGMP regulations (21 CFR parts 210 and 211). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Between February 25 and March 2, 1993, FDA investigators made an inspection of Discovery's establishment in Wesley
Chapel, FL, and observed numerous violations of the CGMP regulations. The following are among numerous CGMP violations
observed during the February through March, 1993, inspection:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Discovery lacks adequate standard operating procedures with regard to: (i) Responsibilities of the quality control
unit (21 CFR 211.22); (ii) cleaning and maintenance of equipment used in manufacturing products (21 CFR 211.67);
(iii) receipt and handling of components (21 CFR 211.82); (iv) production and process control, e.g., weighing components
(21 CFR 211.101); (v) in-process controls or testing (21 CFR 211.110).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Discovery lacks a written stability program. Additionally, Discovery could locate no records documenting stability
testing of selegiline citrate (21 CFR 211.166).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Discovery could not produce batch production records showing manufacture of the one batch produced, which was
intended by the firm for use in clinical trials (21 CFR 211.188).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until it can be verified in a subsequent inspection that Discovery is operating in compliance with the CGMP regulations
in 21 CFR parts 210 and 211, the agency cannot conclude that the methods, facilities, and controls used for the production
of the proposed drug product(s) are adequate to assure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA proposes to refuse to approve Discovery's NDA 20&hyph;242 on the grounds that Discovery has failed to provide
adequate evidence of safety, effectiveness, proper methods, facilities and controls, environmental assessment,
proper labeling, bioavailability data, and compliance with CGMP regulations. Discovery has failed to submit the
appropriate studies and information necessary for the approval of its product.

III. Notice of Opportunity for a Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (the Director) has evaluated the information discussed
above and, on the grounds stated, is proposing to refuse to approve NDA 20&hyph;242.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, notice is given to Discovery and to all other interested persons that the Director proposes to issue an
order under section 505(d) of the act, refusing to approve NDA 20&hyph;242. The Director finds that, (1) the investigations,
reports of which are required to be submitted pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 355(b), do not include adequate tests by all methods
reasonably applicable to show whether or not Discovery's deprenyl citrate product is safe for use under the conditions
prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof; (2) the results of such tests do not show
that Discovery's deprenyl citrate product is safe for use under such conditions; (3) the methods used in, and the facilities
and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packaging of Discovery's deprenyl citrate product are inadequate
to preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity; (4) upon the basis of the information submitted to the Director
as part of the application, and upon the basis of any other information before the Director with respect to Discovery's
deprenyl citrate product, the Director has insufficient information to determine whether Discovery's deprenyl
citrate product is safe for use under such conditions; (5) evaluated on the basis of the information submitted to the
Director as part of the application and any other information before the Director with respect to Discovery's deprenyl
citrate product, there is a lack of substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented
to have under the conditions or use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof; and (6)
based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, the proposed labeling is false and misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 505 of the act and 21 CFR part 314, the applicant is hereby given an opportunity for a hearing
to show that approval of the NDA should not be refused.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An applicant who decides to seek a hearing shall file: (1) On or before June 20, 1994, a written notice of appearance
and request for hearing, and (2) on or before July 18, 1994, the data, information, and analyses relied on to demonstrate
that there is a genuine issue of material fact to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.200. Any other interested
person may also submit comments on this notice. The procedures and requirements governing this notice of opportunity
for a hearing, a notice of appearance and request for a hearing, information and analyses to justify a hearing, other
comments, and a grant or denial of a hearing are contained in 21 CFR 314.200 and in 21 CFR part 12.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The failure of the applicant to file a timely written notice of appearance and request for hearing, as required by 21
CFR 314.200, constitutes an election by that person not to use the opportunity for a hearing concerning the proposed
action, and a waiver of any contentions concerning the legal status of that person's drug products. Any new drug product
marketed without an approved NDA is subject to regulatory action at any time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must present specific facts showing that
there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of
the data, information, and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that there is no genuine and substantial issue
of fact that precludes the refusal to approve the application, or when a request for hearing is not made in the required
format or with the required analyses, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person
who requests the hearing, making findings and conclusions, and denying a hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All submissions pursuant to this notice of opportunity for a hearing are to be filed in four copies. Except for data
and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C. 331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, the submissions may be
seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice is issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 505 (21 U.S.C. 355)) and under authority
delegated to the Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (21 CFR 5.82).
