Q. My wife has Alzheimer's disease. It breaks my heart to see her losing her 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
When I read about a new drug for Alzheimer's disease, I was excited. But her 
doctor knows nothing about THA. I would go anywhere to get this if it would 
help her stay out of a nursing home. Does THA really work against Alzheimer's 
and where can I get it? 
</P>
<P>
A. THA, also known as tacrine, is being tested by the Parke-Davis Co. Under the 
careful supervision of the National Institutes of Health, 17 centers around the 
country are checking on this drug's ability to slow the mental deterioration 
typical of Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
The scientific grapevine indicates that 30% to 40% of Alzheimer's patients may 
experience some benefit from THA, with a very small subgroup doing extremely 
well. This drug is not a cure, and the best that can be expected is a temporary 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration has come under extreme pressure from desperate 
families to expedite approval or allow people compassionate use of THA under a 
doctor's supervision. But until the study is completed the agency won't permit 
importation or access. 
</P>
<P>
Although Parke-Davis has not yet requested approval for THA, industry insiders 
anticipate that it might become available within a year under the name Cognex. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I have an important deadline coming up, and I can't afford to take any time 
off sick. There are a lot of people in my office out with the flu, and a third 
of my son's class has come down with it. 
</P>
<P>
My doctor says it's too late for a flu shot to do any good. Didn't you write 
about a medicine to prevent flu? 
</P>
<P>
A. Your doctor is right about the vaccine. It takes about two weeks to build up 
immunity. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad he didn't mention the prescription drug amantadine (Symmetrel). This 
antiviral medicine can prevent type A influenza. If someone comes down with the 
flu, it can speed recovery, especially if taken within 24 to 48 hours of the 
first symptoms. Amantadine can cause mental confusion, dizziness, insomnia and 
jitters. It's not for everyone, but it may be worth a try.
