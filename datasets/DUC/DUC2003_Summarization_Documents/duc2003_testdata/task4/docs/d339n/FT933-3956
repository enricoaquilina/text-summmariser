THE US Food and Drug Administration announced yesterday it had given
Warner-Lambert, the US pharmaceuticals concern, final clearance to market
Cognex, the first drug specifically approved in the US for the treatment of
Alzheimer's disease.
The drug, which was developed by the company's Parke-Davis division, could
generate annual revenues of between Dollars 400m and Dollars 500m within a
few years, according to an estimate by Oppenheimer, the New York brokerage
house. Warner-Lambert declined to comment on projected sales, but said
Cognex treatments would cost patients about Dollars 3.50 a day.
Government approval had been expected as Cognex received a favourable
recommendation from an FDA advisory committee in March, after being turned
down twice by the panel in 1991. Even so, Warner-Lambert shares rose sharply
yesterday afternoon, closing Dollars 1 7/8 higher at Dollars 69 1/8 .
The drug was found to be effective in easing the symptoms of patients in the
mild-to-moderate stages of Alzheimer's, an illness characterised by
progressive decline of memory, judgment and ability to reason. There is no
evidence that Cognex alters the course of the underlying dementia process.
An estimated 4m Americans are afflicted with the disease, and the company
estimates that 50 to 70 per cent could benefit from Cognex treatment.
The FDA last night called for new tests on SmithKline Beecham's ulcer drug
Tagamet.
The UK pharmaceuticals group was hoping to receive approval to sell its
best-selling product over the counter in the US as a treatment for
heartburn, writes Peter John in London.
If the drug were approved the potential boost to the company's sales was
estimated at between Dollars 200m and Dollars 300m a year.
