WARNER Lambert, the US pharmaceuticals company, has finally received a
recommendation for marketing approval for its Cognex drug to treat symptoms
of Alzheimer's disease.
An advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) yesterday
unanimously recommended approval of Cognex to treat mild to moderate
symptoms of the disease, which afflicts about 4m Americans.
The panel's findings were a coup for Warner Lambert, which failed in two
previous attempts to get marketing approval for the drug. In two reviews of
the drug in 1991, the committee declined to recommend Cognex because of
unclear evidence of its efficacy. Warner Lambert has since completed two
further trials.
FDA committee members yesterday said the company had clearly met criteria
proving the drug's efficacy, although they also noted that only a small
number of patients received a significant benefit from using Cognex.
Cognex will now need approval by the FDA before it reaches the market. The
FDA generally follows the advisory panel's recommendations.
