  [Text] Matsue, May 12 KYODO -- Fourteen out of 94 
foreigners, most of whom are apparently Chinese, were arrested 
after arriving illegally in Japan aboard a freighter, police 
said Thursday [12 May]. About 50 passengers apparently remain 
aboard the vessel registered in Honduras, while some 30 who went 
ashore are missing, they said. 
  A fishing boat discovered the vessel entangled in fishing 
net 
in the Sea of Japan, four kilometers off Taki, Shimane 
Prefecture, early Thursday and informed police, they said. 
  Investigators arrested 13 men in Taki, as well as a 
Japanese-speaking man aboard the vessel, on suspicion of 
violating the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act, 
police said. The 13 were apparently crew members and had either 
Indonesian or Philippine passports, they said. 
  A 46-year-old Indonesian man who claimed to be the captain 
was quoted as saying the ship left Guangzhou in the Chinese 
southeastern province of Guangdong on April 19 with 13 crew 
members and 81 passengers, including six women, they said. 
  The man told investigators the freighter was caught in net 
Wednesday and sent about 30 passengers, including the women, to 
shore by a small boat early Thursday morning, police said. 
  A 22-year-old detained passenger reportedly said he was 
bound 
for Tokyo and paid 60,000 yuan (about 750,000 yen) as a 
guarantee for smuggling into Japan and was to pay another 
110,000 yuan (about 1.38 million yen) if the attempt succeeded. 
  The Maritime Safety Agency will take the freighter to port 
for investigation, they said. 
  According to the Justice Ministry, some 2,300 foreigners 
illegally entered Japan in 1989 and 1990, and about 1,660 in 
1991. The figure stood at 3,460 in 1992 and 5,000 in 1993, with 
the numbers from China and Vietnam increasing recently, 
officials said.
