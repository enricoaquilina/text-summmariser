AT LEAST eight people died early yesterday morning after a freighter,
believed to be carrying hundreds of illegal Chinese immigrants, ran aground
close to Rockaway beaches in the Queens borough of New York City.
The grounding of the freighter, the Golden Venture, happened shortly after
2am yesterday. More than 100 Chinese passengers plunged into the chilly
waters, and swam about half a mile to the shore.
According to emergency rescue workers, who reached the scene shortly
afterwards, four passengers were known to have died on the beach, and
another two in hospital later. Two bodies were also washed ashore.
By late afternoon officials said that they had accounted for about 300
people. Many of those who swam ashore were said to be suffering from
exposure or hypothermia, and about 20 had been taken to hospital. There were
also growing fears that tuberculosis may have been prevalent on the vessel.
Initial pictures released by the US Coast Guard of the freighter's interior
suggested that conditions had been extremely cramped and squalid. However,
officials still lacked a firm indication of the number of people who had
been aboard the ship.
Interpreters who were called to the scene said that some passengers claimed
to have been aboard the freighter for more than 100 days. They also reported
that it made a number of stops in China before crossing the ocean. This
fuelled rumours that the ship was operated by an Asian 'human smuggling'
ring, which had charged passengers Dollars 20,000-Dollars 30,000 for the
journey.
Mr William Slattery, New York district director for immigration and
naturalisation, said the immigrants were mostly Chinese from Fukien
province.
The 11 crew members were still being questioned by the US authorities last
night, while their passengers were placed in the custody of the US
Immigration and Naturalisation Service. All are understood to have asked for
political asylum.
The vessel itself remained stranded on a sand-bank. However, the local Coast
Guard reported that it was up against a 'rock jetty', and expressed concern
that an oil spill might develop. The ship was carrying about five tons of
diesel fuel.
Illegal Chinese immigration has been on the rise in New York City, but this
is believed to be the first time a vessel carrying such a large number of
passengers has disgorged its load on the city's shoreline.
