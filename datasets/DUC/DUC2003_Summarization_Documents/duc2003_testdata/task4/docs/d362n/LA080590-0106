SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego district of the Immigration and Naturalization Service on Friday 
reported cracking an alien-smuggling operation based in two East San Diego 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
Nine members of the smuggling ring and 16 suspected illegal aliens were 
arrested, INS officials said. 
</P>
<P>
INS officers entered houses in the 200 block of South 36th Street and the 3000 
block of Imperial Avenue at 4 p.m. Friday to make the arrests, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The houses served as staging areas for multinational illegal aliens waiting to 
be transported to Los Angeles and then to final destinations across the 
country, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
INS agents and San Diego police also pulled over a vehicle northbound on 
Interstate 5 near Del Mar Heights that they said contained two principal 
members of the smuggling ring and an illegal alien. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal immigrants paid large fees to the smugglers for guaranteed passage 
to their destinations, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
INS agents infiltrated the smuggling operation several months ago, officials 
said.
