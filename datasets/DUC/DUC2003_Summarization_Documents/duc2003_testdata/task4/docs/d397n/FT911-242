UP TO 1,830 vehicles in General Motors new Saturn line, intended to
demonstrate the US car company's competitiveness against its Japanese
rivals, are to be recalled.
GM's Saturn division, initiated in 1983, says 7 per cent of the vehicles it
has built since it began production last autumn, must be replaced because
they were filled with a faulty coolant which could damage the engine. The
coolant was supplied by a Texaco subsidiary.
This is the second recall of Saturn cars. The first, in February, involved
1,210 vehicles with a faulty seat mechanism, which the company also blamed
on a supplier.
The latest recall is believed to represent the first offer by a large motor
manufacturer to replace an entire vehicle for a problem of this type. It
demonstrates the importance GM attaches to creating an image of reliability
for Saturn.
Saturn, a small car made largely from plastics, is an attempt by GM to
compete with the quality and production standards of the small, imported
Japanese cars which have a big share of the US domestic market.
The project has involved ground-breaking agreements with unions, suppliers
and dealers. GM's investment amounts to about Dollars 4bn.
