THE Saturn subsidiary of General Motors has recalled all 352,767 cars it
built before April 14 because of a wiring problem which has caused at least
34 vehicles to catch fire.
The subsidiary, set up in 1990 to build compact cars so as to compete with
imports from Japan and Europe, said it had written to owners warning them of
the defect and telling them to take their vehicles back to their dealers for
repair.
The modification is expected by analysts to cost the company about Dollars
8m (Pounds 5.3m), although Saturn refused to confirm the figure.
The problem is thought to be small in comparison with the controversy that
has surrounded GM's pick-up trucks with side-mounted fuel tanks, of which
more than 4m have been sold. GM, which has offered owners Dollars 1,000 each
towards the cost of a new vehicle, continues to deny design faults with the
pick-up trucks.
Unlike the pick-up truck case, Saturn said it had received no claims for
death or injury resulting from the fault, and that it had not been ordered
to recall the vehicles by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
The problem is in the wiring leading from the car's generator. It will be
replaced with a fuseable link which will trip in the event of overheating.
