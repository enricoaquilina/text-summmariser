PARIS was the worst hit on the Continent, as other bourses contained their
losses, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS suffered more than other European bourses because of its gearing to
Wall Street. The CAC 40 index fell 67.90 or 3.4 per cent to 1,907.48 as
turnover accelerated to FFr3bn at the close from just FFr1.2bn at lunchtime.
Euro Disney was one of the day's most conspicuous fallers, losing FFr7.40 to
FFr141.50 in trading of 2m shares. The stock has been depressed by an
increasing number of sell notes from brokers and there were also reports
that analysts and fund managers had not been impressed by their visit to the
theme park this week. Worries about Euro Disney's rapid turnover of staff
and fears of industrial action by Parisian RER train drivers and the
domestic airline Air Inter also weighed on the stock.
Alcatel fell back FFr29 to FFr595 after its recent rise. After the close it
reported a 20 per cent increase in net attributable profit to FFr6.18bn,
ahead of expectations of FFr5.9bn.
FRANKFURT was cautious ahead of the result of arbitration in the public
service sector pay dispute. The deadline was due to expire last night.
The DAX index closed down 19.41 or 1.1 per cent at 1,720.01, up from its
intraday low of 1,717.52. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, shed 9.43
to 702.06. Turnover fell to DM5.4bn from DM6.7bn.
News that Volkswagen was recalling 650,000 Golf and Jetta cars in the US to
correct a problem connected with the cooling system pushed the shares down
DM8.50 or 2.3 per cent to DM366.90. Volkswagen is understood to have made
provision for the problem, which could cost up to Dollars 100 per car. Other
car stocks were weaker: BMW was down DM8.5 at DM575 and Porsche DM3 lower at
DM550.
BHF Bank became the latest bank to report strong 1991 earnings results with
group net profit up 11 per cent. Its shares fell 40 pfg to DM433.60 in spite
of news that the first quarter of 1992 had been positive and forecasts of
steady growth for the rest of the year. Other bank shares were depressed:
Deutsche Bank slipped DM7.5 to DM710.50 and Dresdner Bank was DM3 weaker at
DM350.50.
The shipbuilding and engineering group Bremer Vulkan bucked the trend after
it announced that it was to pay its first dividend in 15 years. It closed up
DM1.30 at DM78.60.
MILAN continued to fall, depressed by the overnight declines in Tokyo and
New York, and political uncertainty at home as the parties started
consultations to form a government. The Comit index fell 6.66 or 1.3 per
cent to 496.74 in turnover of around L100bn after L93.4bn.
Among leading stocks, Fiat fell L60 to L4,710, Montedison shed L22 to L1,325
and Generali dropped L480 to L28,300. San Paolo, the recently-listed bank,
dropped L85 to L11,950.
Telecoms showed some resilience. Sip rose L3 to L1,444 after announcing a
rise in the 1991 dividend, which came as a surprise to some analysts. Stet
eased L39 to L2,109. Benetton lost just L30 to L13,320, supported by US
buying.
AMSTERDAM was weakened by Wall Street. The CBS Tendency Index was 1.6 lower
at 125.8 in turnover of Fl 600m.
Philips, which announced that it was to exercise its option to purchase 6m
shares in Blockbuster of the US, the world's largest video rental company,
finished 30 cents down at Fl 36.40.
A forecast of strong earnings in 1992 from Nijverdal-Ten Cate lifted its
shares by Fl 2.80 to Fl 108.50. The plastics manufacturer also said it was
launching a Fl 100m convertible bond. IHC Caland, the
dredging-to-engineering group, put on Fl 1.20 to Fl 66.00 after telling a
London presentation that it expects good 1992 earnings.
ZURICH closed 1 per cent lower with the SMI index down 23.4 at 1,827.1.
Roche certificates eased SFr60 to SFr3,100 and Nestle bearers were SFr70
weaker at SFr9,430.
BRUSSELS closed at its lowest level since mid-February. The Bel-20 index
shed 17.73 to 1,170.54 in turnover of BFr970m.
LISBON bucked the global trend, the BTA index rising 13.8 to 2,094.2.
