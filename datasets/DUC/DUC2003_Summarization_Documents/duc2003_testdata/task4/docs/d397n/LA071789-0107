<P>
Ford Motor Co. will recall almost 1.3 million cars that violate federal 
pollution-control standards due to a faulty part, the Environmental Protection 
Agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said Ford will begin notifying owners of the problem July 24, 
starting with owners in California. Because of the large number of vehicles 
involved, the recall will be conducted in stages through February, 1990, the 
EPA said. 
</P>
<P>
The cars have a faulty part in the fuel injector. Dealers will replace it free 
of charge with an improved fuel injector, the EPA said, and may be required to 
replace the catalytic converter, the exhaust gas sensor and the electronic 
engine control processor. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said it discovered the fault, which causes excessive emissions of 
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, during testing of 1985 and 1986 model Fords. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles to be recalled are 364,000 1985 Ford 2.3-liter Mercury Tempo and 
Topaz; 339,000 1986 Ford 2.3-liter and 2.5-liter Tempo, Taurus, Taurus wagon, 
Topaz and Sable, and 579,000 Ford 2.3-liter, 2.5-liter and 1.9-liter Tempo, 
Taurus, Taurus wagon, Escort, Escort wagon, EXP, Topaz, Sable, Lynx and Lynx 
wagon of the 1987 model year.
