Drugs Last Year--The Drug Seizures of the Police and the Customs 
Guard in 1993"] 
  [Text] Last year, the Customs and Excise Office and the 
police together confiscated 697 kgs and 108 grams of drugs, we 
learned from officials of the two bodies. Significant amounts 
of drugs, namely more than 20 grams, were caught on 35 occasions 
at the border and 27 times inside the country. The police found 
less than 20 grams of drugs on dealers and consumers on 45 
occasions. 
  The police and the Customs Office together confiscated on 62 
occasions 427 kgs of heroin, 253 kgs of hashish (a quarter of a 
ton of this was found in a truck in one consignment), 10 kgs of 
marijuana, and 3 kgs of cocaine. Officers of the Customs and 
Excise Office confiscated a significant amount of drugs on 35 
occasions, significant amount meaning drugs equivalent to 20 
grams of heroin. Drugs were found in railway carriages 13 times, 
six times in trucks, seven times in cars, four times in hiding 
places in buses, and five times in airports hidden in various 
parcels. 
  The 200 kgs of heroin found in a truck at Nagylak in 
December 
was the biggest catch of the Customs and Excise Office. They 
wanted to carry out a detailed check on the truck when the 
driver jumped out of his cabin and escaped; he still has not 
been found. 
  According to officials of the Customs and Excise Office 
national headquarters, in 1993, customs officers learned how to 
recognize the documents of trucks that are very likely to be 
carrying drugs. It is a telltale sign if the driver comes from 
a drug-growing area, or if the consignment was sent from such an 
area. It is also suspicious if the truck is progressing too 
slowly through the Balkans toward Hungary. 
  One-third of all the confiscated drugs were found by the 
customs officers on the basis of police information, police 
experts claim. However, the customs officers say that they would 
be able to discover much more drugs if their work was assisted 
by modern screening equipment. From U.S. aid, Bulgarian customs 
officers started to use such equipment at their Turkish border, 
and their efficiency has multiplied since then. 
  The police caught significant amounts of drugs inside the 
country on 27 occasions--20 times in Budapest--in 1993. They 
confiscated amounts smaller than 20 grams on 45 occasions, from 
drug dealers and consumers, and from burglars of pharmacies who 
stole narcotic materials. Altogether 119 drug smugglers and 
dealers were arrested in connection with 72 cases. 
  On the first day of 1994 at Lokoshaza, 3.9 kgs of heroin was 
found in the double-based suitcase of a German woman who was 
traveling from Turkey to Germany on the Ovidius international 
express.
