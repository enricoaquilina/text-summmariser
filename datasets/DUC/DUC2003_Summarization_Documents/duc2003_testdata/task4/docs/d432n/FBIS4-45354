  [Excerpts] Redoubling the battle against organized crime, 
the Attorney General's Office [PGR] seized three tons and 148 kg 
of dried, packed marijuana at a Sonora highway checkpoint, in an 
operation in which two presumed drug dealers were arrested. 
[passage omitted] 
  The confiscation was made yesterday at the highway 
checkpoint 
located in the Hermosillo-Benjamin Hill section, according to 
Angel Cortes Ibarra, the PGR's state representative. He added 
that Jose Luis Prado Anguiano and Oscar Armando Henriquez were 
arrested in this operation. They were transporting the drugs in 
a shipment of avocados carried on a Federal Public Service 
tractor-trailer truck. 
  The official remarked that the carrier was stopped precisely 
at that checkpoint, located at km 120 of the aforementioned 
highway. Noticing the nervousness of its driver, the agents 
started inspecting the refrigerated "body" being hauled by the 
Famsa tractor-trailer with plates 118-BA9. They found 140 
packages of cannabis completely hidden among the avocados and 
other fruit. 
  The presumed drug traffickers told the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office that they had brought the load from Uruapan, 
Michoacan, and that its destination was the town of Tijuana. 
They were supposed to transport the drugs from there to the 
United States. 
  The Federal Judicial Police are continuing the investigation 
to locate the marijuana owners who make up this drug trafficking 
ring, with involvement in Michoacan and Baja California. 
  It was declared that the battle against the drug traffic and 
organized crime will continue without respite throughout the 
entire country. [passage omitted]
