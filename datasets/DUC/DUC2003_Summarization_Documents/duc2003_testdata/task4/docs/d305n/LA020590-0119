The Chevrolet Corvette has the highest death rate in crashes, while a four-door 
Volvo has the lowest, according to a study released today. 
</P>
<P>
The study shows that 5.2 drivers and passengers die in car wrecks for every 
10,000 1985-87 Corvettes registered in the United States. It also found that 
the Volvo 740-760 four-door had 0.6 deaths per 10,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The figures from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety were released by 
the Michigan Assn. of Professional Insurance Agents. 
</P>
<P>
"Without question the consumer has a better chance of survival when driving a 
larger vehicle," said James Alexander, president of the Michigan association. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 vehicles with the lowest death rates, three were large, six were 
mid-size and only one was a small car -- the Volkswagen Jetta with 1.1 deaths 
per 10,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the 15 cars with the highest death rates are small, and the other 
three are midsize. Several, including the Corvette at the top of the list, are 
high-performance cars. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the association, said high-performance cars tend 
to have higher death rates because of the type of drivers they attract. 
</P>
<P>
"The study shows there's a direct correlation between high-performance sports 
models and a higher accident death rate," he said. "The Corvette, Camaro, 
Mustang, Firebird and Dodge Daytona were all in the top 10 in terms of highest 
overall death rate. 
</P>
<P>
"The average driver in those cars is a man under 30 years old," he said. 
"Industry figures show that cars with a higher percentage of female drivers 
tend to have lower death rates." 
</P>
<P>
Following is a list of the 1985-87 models with the lowest and the highest death 
rates. The figures in parentheses refer to the number of driver and passenger 
deaths per 10,000 vehicles.
