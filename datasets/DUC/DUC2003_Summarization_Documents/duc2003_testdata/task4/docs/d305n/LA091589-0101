New Orleans Saints linebacker Rickey Jackson underwent 3 1/2 hours of 
reconstructive surgery Thursday on the cheekbone he fractured in a car wreck, 
and a team spokesman said he is expected to be out at least four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson narrowly escaped death early Monday when he drove a borrowed Corvette 
under the back of a flatbed truck on U.S. 61 about three miles from his home 
north of New Orleans. Investigators said he was going more than 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The official police report, issued Thursday, said there was no evidence Jackson 
had been drinking. He was charged with reckless operation of a motor vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the St. Charles Parish Sheriff's Dept. said the truck was going 
about 45 m.p.h. when struck from behind by Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
The impact flipped the truck, which landed on its wheels. Neither the driver of 
the truck nor a passenger were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
The Corvette could still be driven, the sheriff spokesman said, and Jackson, 
who was alone, went down the highway to a shopping center to telephone police. 
However, before he could call 911, a deputy saw the car and stopped.
