WHEN the price-only instead of price-plus-cubic capacity tax banding comes
in later this year, business motorists will no longer have to choose between
an under 2-litre car and a hefty financial penalty.
Even so, there will still be every incentive to settle for an under 2-litre
unless the car is a diesel. These need a larger engine to give performance
on a par with that of a petrol-powered car.
The fact of the matter is that unless status means more than a combination
of performance and reasonable economy, a modern, high-efficiency 2-litre
engine is quite big enough.
In the under-Pounds 19,250 category, there are some excellent four-and
five-seat, 2-litre business class cars about.
They have the acceleration and the unusable maximum speed of 3-litre cars of
a few years ago. When motorway cruising they are so refined it is hard to
hear any engine noise over the swish of tyres and rustle of air.
Cars of this class are so good that choosing between makes and models has
more to do with looks, equipment levels, service back-up, warranty terms and
key-in-hand price than actual performance.
Two factors have been concentrating the car makers' and importers' minds.
These were the 2-litre tax break - soon to be swept away - and the effects
of the recession on sales. The makers' and importers' answer was to say
never mind the engine size, get a load of the goodies  - and the price.
There is an embarrassment of choice. Alfa-Romeo's new front-wheel driven 155
has just come to Britain with 1.8-litre and 2-litre engines as well as a
2.5-litre V6 after making an encouraging start in Italy. It is an agreeably
sporty car of individual appearance.
Citroen's XM, with it semi-active, self-levelling gas-hydraulic suspension,
rides like no other car. While not in the least quirky, it could never be
mistaken for anything else. The new XM Premiere 2.Oi has ABS brakes, alloy
wheels, ultrasonic alarm and a stereo system with steering wheel controls
yet it costs only Pounds 16,995.
Another Pounds 2,250 buys the 2.Oi Prestige (Pounds 19,245) which also has
automatic transmission, climate control and leather upholstery.
A similarly equipped, leather-trimmed, automatic version of the Fiat Croma
2.Oie SX - the only model now sold in Britain - is priced at less than
Pounds 18,250.
Its two-pedal Lancia counterpart, powered by the same silken 16-valve engine
with counter-rotating balance shafts, is Pounds 18,575.
These cars have essentially the same chassis platform and are of similar
body size to the Saab 9000 CS and CD saloons which are among the best buys
in class at less than Pounds 19,250. These solidly built, spacious cars have
light-pressure turbocharging which, exploited discreetly, gives them the
flexibility and pick-up of a 3-litre six with the fuel economy of a 2-litre
four.
The Audi 80, recently re-launched with a boot as generous in size as the old
model's was meagre, and the Audi 100 are available in seven versions under
the Pounds 19,250 tax break although, sadly, none of the Quattros with
four-wheel drive squeezes under the barrier. Like the Saabs, they combine
Audi Pro-Con Ten steering column-shortening and seat belt-tightening crash
protection system is unique - with the kind of handling and roadholding to
please the keenest driver.
BMW's super-smooth six-cylinder 2-litre engine can be had in both 3-Series
and 5-Series four-door saloons for less than Pounds 19,250. There is a joie
de vivre about these cars that few other makes can duplicate.
The comfort of the Ford Granada 2.0 LX's ride always impresses. This large
hatchback or saloon is offered with automatic transmission for less than
Pounds 19,250. Until the new Swindon-built 2-litre Honda, currently
code-named Synchro, appears, the only Honda saloon in the under-Pounds
19,250 executive class is the Japan-sourced Accord.
Japanese named cars will have to be taken with increasing seriousness by
user-chooser and fleet manager alike. At the moment, the only British-built,
and thus generally fleet-acceptable, Nissan is the Primera. For mechanical
refinement and build quality it has few if any class rivals and it is an
extraordinarily well-balanced and pleasant car to drive.
Toyota's answer to the Primera is the new Carina E, launched in Britain with
1.6-litre and 2-litre engines in May. For the time being, the cars are being
imported from Japan but in December production starts at Burnaston,
Derbyshire. The Carina E will then be another genuinely British car even
though it has a Japanese name.
Primera and Carina E both look and go remarkably like their Vauxhall
Cavalier (Opel Vectra) equivalents, which still set a European standard
among medium-sized, medium-priced, front wheel-driven cars. The latest
Vauxhall Cavalier Diplomat, leather-trimmed, with heated seats and standard
air conditioning, is a mini-Senator available for less than Pounds 19,250
with manual transmission.
Renault's admirable 25 replacement, the Safrane, is expected to sell in
Britain for a similar figure with a 2-litre engine and automatic
transmission when it arrives in early autumn.
Safrane majors on ride quality and silence.
The Mercedes-Benz 190E with 1.8-litre or 2-litre engines, now nearly 10
years old and due soon for replacement, is unmatched in its price class for
status and sheer merit.
Its bank-vault build quality and conservative styling pay off in high
retained values. The pleasure of driving one is to be equated with the
feeling one gets when upgraded to first from business class.
The Peugeot 605 SLi 2.0, steel sprung but otherwise similar mechanically to
a Citroen XM, is a roomy, quiet and undemanding drive. Rover's 820, restyled
and improved within the past year, has build quality to match that of any
European rival and is a driver's car which passengers enjoy equally.
Volvo's five-cylinder, front wheel-driven 850GLT is an outstanding newcomer.
It may look rather like a mid-1980s rear drive Volvo, but everything about
it is original - except, that is, the styling. Performance is lively, the
ride is good, the handling supremely safe and, should the worst happen, its
crash survivability is probably unmatched.
A feature of the past year has been the appearance on the market of some new
estate cars that are viable and attractive alternatives to the company
saloon for business use. Among them - all available for under Pounds 19,250
 -are the Audi 100, BMW 5-Series Touring, Citroen XM and Ford Granada.
The old days when estate cars were noisier than saloons have long gone. In
none of these would one know there was a massive load space instead of a
boot unless one turned around in the driving seat.
Some business drivers reckon that if the company is going to give them the
choice of any car costing less than Pounds 19,250 it might as well be
exactly what they want and choose a recreational four-wheel drive.
The three contenders are the Land Rover Discovery (from Pounds 18,021 for a
2.5-litre diesel) and the Japanese-made Mitsubishi Shogun (from Pounds
18,809) and Isuzu New Trooper (Pounds 15,149 upwards). Although designed and
built to cope with off-road driving, most spend the majority - and many the
whole - of their lives on tarmac.
They cannot match an executive car of similar price for fuel consumption or
ride comfort and there is a certain lack of finesse about their handling.
Having said that, there is something rather attractive about their high
driving position which gives a commanding view of the road.
Any of them will cruise reasonably quietly at the sort of speeds which
business drivers use. And, of course, at weekends they will tow two-horse
(or one boat) trailers better than any other kind of car. Should the need
arise to tackle mud, snow or flooded roads, they are in a class of their
own.
