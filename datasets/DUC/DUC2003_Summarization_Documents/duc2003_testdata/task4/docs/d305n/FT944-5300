The US government yesterday abandoned its attempts to declare unsafe some 5m
pickup trucks made by General Motors in the 1980s. Instead of recalling the
trucks, at a claimed cost of up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m), the company
will pay Dollars 51m into a research fund on traffic safety - an apparent
victory for GM in a bitter two-year dispute.
The settlement ends an investigation into pickup trucks with side-mounted
fuel tanks made by GM between 1973 and 1987. The US Department of
Transportation had conceded the trucks conformed to safety standards at the
time, but claimed they were not adequate for today's conditions. GM last
month launched a lawsuit challenging the government's right to impose safety
standards retrospectively.
Mr Federico Pena, secretary of transportation, said the deal was a
commonsense outcome. 'Proceeding with the recall process would have taken
years in court. During all that time the trucks subject to this
investigation would have remained on our highways,' he said. The safety
research funded by GM, he said, would start to save lives immediately.
'The alternatives were to proceed with a recall that would have involved
years of litigation, an uncertain outcome and prevented few, if any deaths;
or I could have closed the case, with no public benefit at all,' he said.
In October, Mr Pena had announced a preliminary finding by the Department of
Transportation that there was a safety defect in GM's C/K trucks, which have
externally mounted fuel tanks that could cause an explosion in a side-on
crash. The department had also scheduled a public hearing on the trucks for
Tuesday, which is now cancelled.
Mr Pena had said about 150 people had died in 'otherwise survivable'
side-impact crashes when their GM trucks caught fire, and had accused GM of
deciding to 'favour 'sales over safety'.
However, his position had been undermined by reports that he had proceeded
against the advice of his own safety officials. The issue had also been
bitterly contested by Detroit, with car company chiefs last month writing a
joint letter to President Bill Clinton claiming their entire industry was
threatened.
GM said the deal did not affect private lawsuits still outstanding.
