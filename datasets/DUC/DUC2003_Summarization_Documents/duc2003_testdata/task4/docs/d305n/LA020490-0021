Two men were killed Saturday morning in Inglewood in a fiery four-car collision 
caused by a suspected drunk driver who walked away from the crash with only 
minor injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Ignacio Becerra, 23, of Los Angeles, was booked by Inglewood police on charges 
of felony drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
He was being held at the Inglewood police station without bail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the two victims, a 61-year-old Inglewood man and a Riverside man 
also in his 60s, were not being released, pending notification of their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
The accident at 8:20 a.m. snarled traffic around Los Angeles International 
Airport for most of the morning while emergency crews worked to clear the 
wreckage at the intersection of Century and Crenshaw boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Police Sgt. Thomas Farrell said the crash occurred when Becerra, who 
was traveling west on Century in a 1977 Ford LTD, slammed into a pickup. 
</P>
<P>
The truck, driven by the Inglewood victim, shot forward 300 feet and rear-ended 
a Datsun, Farrell said. Meanwhile, Becerra's car careened into the back end of 
an Isuzu, rupturing its gas tank and sparking a spectacular blaze that 
firefighters said was visible almost a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood fire officials said the Riverside man in the Isuzu was knocked into 
the back seat by the collision and was unable to escape the flames that 
engulfed the car. 
</P>
<P>
The Inglewood man died of internal injuries en route to Daniel Freeman Memorial 
Hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Fire Capt. Dave Herbert said Becerra suffered only "a cut leg and a 
few bumps on his head." The driver of the Datsun was uninjured.
