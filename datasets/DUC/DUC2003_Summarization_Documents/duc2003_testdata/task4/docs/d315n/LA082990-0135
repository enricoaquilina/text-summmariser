An elderly Laguna Hills couple and an Irvine woman were killed Tuesday night in 
a three-car collision that also left a 32-year-old man with minor injuries and 
forced closure of Irvine Center Drive until late this morning. 
</P>
<P>
John Feltman, 75, and his wife, Celia, 73, were traveling along a rural stretch 
of the road from their Leisure World home when the car in which they were 
riding drifted into oncoming traffic, Irvine Police Lt. Bob Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
Their 1988 Mercury Marquis smashed headlong into a 1987 Chevrolet Camaro driven 
by Beth A. Ward, 26, who was traveling eastbound along Irvine Center Drive near 
Valencia Avenue, Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
The Marquis then flipped over and struck a 1986 Ford Bronco II that was being 
driven by Jeffrey Snyder, a computer programmer. 
</P>
<P>
The Feltmans and Ward were pronounced dead at the scene, Leonard said. Snyder 
was taken to nearby Saddleback Memorial Medical Center, where he was treated 
for a bruised knee and a strained neck and later released, Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard said investigators were trying to determine why Feltman was driving on 
the wrong side of the road.
