  [Text] Concept cars and elemental technologies exhibited at 
the 30th Tokyo Motor Show, which was meant to give some idea of 
automobiles of the near future, proved that the preparation of 
material technology required for auto manufacturing had been 
making steady progress. As a result, it was clearer than ever 
that automobile materials would be the key technology for 
simultaneously solving the problems of weight reduction, fuel 
conservation and recycling for automobiles. Effective solutions 
for the urgent issues of weight reduction and fuel conservation 
were shown, while steady progress was demonstrated for elemental 
technologies that seek long-term solutions for the recycling of 
auto materials, including resins for bumpers. 
  This report concerning the Motor Show consists of two parts: 
material technology highlights concerning concept cars and 
elemental technologies shown at the Show are reported in the 
first part, whereas material utilization trends for future auto 
manufacturing are compiled in the second part on the basis of 
interviews with engineers in charge of the material technology 
departments of auto manufacturers. 
  It appears inevitable that the 1993 production for Japanese 
automobile manufacturers will have negative growth for the third 
consecutive year. According to the Japan Automobile 
Manufacturers Association, Inc., the 1992 automobile (four-wheel 
vehicle) production in Japan was 12.5 million, which was 5.6 
percent below the 1991 production, resulting in negative growth 
for the second consecutive year. In 1993, the probable annual 
production figure is not expected to reach the 12 million level, 
and each automaker is struggling to make the production schedule 
adjustment. 
  Under these severe sales and production conditions, the 30th 
Tokyo Motor Show was held for 14 days, from 23 October through 5 
November 1993, at the Japan Convention Center (Makuhari Messe) 
in Chiba City, and auto component makers hoped that the Show 
would spur their sales. Automakers, on the other hand, were 
concentrating on the exhibit of "actual cars" currently on the 
market, in an attempt to ring up more sales. 
  Although the focus was on the exhibit of the real cars, the 
Show presented many other interesting items that hinted at what 
kind of automobiles we could expect in the near future in terms 
of concept cars and technology. These items uniquely reflected 
the current times when R&amp;D outlays must be spent effectively, 
and many of them were still searching for the opportunity to 
commercialize. Compared with the 29th Tokyo Motor Show of 
1991[.sup]1[/] in which several possibilities for near-future 
technologies had been presented, the 1993 Show had many exhibits 
that clearly revealed what automaker R&amp;D or Design 
departments 
thought to be their first choice for commercialization. Thus, it 
was easy for a viewer to clearly understand the philosophy and 
strategy of each auto-manufacturing company. 
  For example, both RAUM of Toyota Motor Corp. and AQ-X of 
Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., were the so-called concept cars with the 
catch phrase of "Compact sedans of tomorrow with roomy interior 
space." Nissan explained that AQ-X was created with the same 
overall length as that of the compact car Primera, the same 
interior space as that of the luxury-class car President, and 
the same fuel consumption rate as that of the popular model, 
Sunny. Both Toyota's and Nissan's concept cars demonstrated how 
a city-driven, near-future sedan should be made. 
  In the first part of this report, the future material 
technologies that were incorporated in concept cars and the 
elemental technologies at the exhibit will be discussed under 
the three categories of "Auto Bodies," "Engines," and "Electric 
Cars." 
<H5>  Auto Bodies </H5>
<H5>  Mazda Adopts Easy-Disassembly Construction, Arranges Various </H5>
Components in Functional Units 
  Mazda Motor Corp. exhibited the HR-X2, with a rotary engine 
using hydrogen gas as fuel. The unique features of this concept 
car included a hydrogen-gas-burning, rotary engine system and a 
design incorporating both easy-disassembly vehicular 
construction and outer and inner panels made of a recyclable, 
"liquid crystal polymer fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) material." 
  Koji Tobita, section chief researcher of the Mazda Technical 
Research Institute, who oversaw the development of this concept 
car, says this: "We developed the HR-X2's body with the idea of 
making the entire car recyclable." The chassis incorporates 
modular design, and each functional module is unitized. 
  The basic vehicular structure for the HR-X2 has the chassis, 
the power train (including the engine and the drive mechanism), 
and the fuel tank arranged together in the so-called 
under-chassis section, which can be readily separated from the 
resin-made "upper body," which is located above the 
under-chassis section. 
  Like the other units, the front functional unit is uniquely 
designed. The front functional unit consists of head lamps and 
wipers that are situated below the front cowl for easy removal 
of a wire harness in disassembly through minimization of 
electrical wiring, plus an instrument panel guard that 
incorporates the steering wheel, a shift lever, and an 
air-conditioner. 
  The rear functional unit is designed in a similar fashion. 
The unit incorporates a high-mount stoplight, speakers for an 
audio system, and an air cleaner. 
  In the center console unit, audio equipment and the 
air-conditioner are controlled by an optically transmitted 
remote system, and light is reflected on interior mirrors to 
eliminate interior lights altogether, in order to circumvent the 
complicated job of removing a wire harness for disassembly. 
<H5>  Adoption of Recyclable Liquid Crystal Polymer FRP </H5>
  Among the unique features of the recyclable, 
easy-to-disassemble auto body construction, perhaps the adoption 
of a liquid-crystal polymer FRP attracted the most attention 
from material engineers. The FRP is used for the outer panels, 
as well as inner panels, of the front hood, both front and rear 
fenders, the trunk lid, the cab, the doors, and the center 
console. As a result, according to Mr. Tobita, Mazda expects to 
be able to recycle "almost 100 percent of the upper body 
section." 
  At the show, however, Mazda exhibited ordinary glass 
fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) outer and inner panels instead. 
There was only one example of the liquid crystal polymer FRP 
exhibited among other components, in the form of a test-produced 
unit combining the rear fender with rear pillars. 
  In 1992, Mazda announced that it had essentially completed 
the development of this particular liquid crystal FRP, in which 
a thermoplastic resin is reinforced with microfine liquid 
crystal polymer fibers. The idea was to reconstitute the 
reinforcement mechanism of the liquid crystal polymer microfine 
fibers by remelting a recycled raw material in a pulverized 
state in the process of injection or compression 
molding.[.sup]2[/] This time, a "nylon-based material (PA, or 
polyamide) was used as the thermoplastic resin to make the 
liquid crystal polymer FRP." 
  Mazda designed the body of the HR-X2 with a lightweight, 
highly rigid structure using a cross-sectional element of 
glue-bonded outer and inner liquid crystal polymer FRP panels. 
This body construction for the HR-X2 was the only change made by 
Mazda from that of the AZ-1.[.sup]3[/] 
  Another feature of the HR-X2 that drew the attention of the 
visitors at the Show was its excellent air resistance 
coefficient, C[.sub]d[/] = 0.3 -- an index of the body's 
aerodynamic resistance -- despite its bulky, box-like shape. 
Mazda's explanation was this: "Air resistance was minimized by 
dividing the air flow that hits the body into the upper and 
lower components by means of troughs attached to the sides of 
the body." 
  The trend of reducing a car's fuel cost through the 
reduction 
of air resistance is also evident in concept compact cars of 
other auto companies. For example, Nissan's AQ-X also boasts 
C[.sub]d[/] = 0.28, and it is equipped with aerodynamic 
parts, including front and rear aero-bumpers, and a CAE-designed 
(computer-applied-engineering) underside of the floor to 
optimize air flow across the underside. 
<H5>  Nissan Solves Contact Corrosion Problem of Aluminum/Steel </H5>
With Aluminum/Steel Cladding 
  The unique feature of Nissan's AQ-X is the adoption of an 
"iron-aluminum hybrid body structure" by using an aluminum alloy 
for certain structural components and for the outer and inner 
panels for its doors, front hood, front fenders, and trunk lid. 
Instead of the aluminum alloy that is not suitable for 
deep-drawing molding, steel sheets are used for the outer and 
inner panels of the rear fender which has a severely curved 
surface. As a result of adopting the iron-aluminum hybrid body 
structure, the weight of the AQ-X is approximately 20 percent 
less than that of previous bodies made of steel outer panels. 
This drastic weight reduction seems to indicate that the 
adoption of the hybrid structure is expected to meet future auto 
specifications, since, according to one official, no matter how 
much a body structure is rationalized, "the weight of the 
existing steel body will be reduced only by several percent at 
best." 
  Generally, whenever sheet-steel and aluminum-alloy parts are 
used together, the joints are attacked by corrosion that results 
from the contact of dissimilar metals. The corrosion is commonly 
called "galvanic corrosion," and such joints have to be avoided 
altogether in auto body construction. Therefore, auto body parts 
in which aluminum alloys can be used are limited to such parts 
as front hoods, trunk lids, and hinged parts that function as a 
lid, such as quickly detachable sun roofs. Otherwise, like the 
NSX sports car of Honda Motor Co., Ltd., all the body has to be 
made with an aluminum alloy, with only the smallest area of 
contact with steel. 
  Nissan solved the problem of contact corrosion between steel 
and aluminum alloy for the AQ-X by inserting steel/aluminum 
alloy cladding pieces in the joints. The steel/aluminum alloy 
cladding pieces are inserted between an aluminum alloy outer 
panel and a steel inner panel when they are to be spot-welded to 
form a monocoque body. The aluminum alloy layer of the cladding 
piece is in direct contact with the aluminum outer panel, and 
the steel layer of the cladding piece is in direct contact with 
the steel inner panel, before the entire assembly is 
spot-welded. As a result, aluminum is welded to aluminum, and 
steel is welded to steel. As a whole, the aluminum outer panel 
and the steel inner panel are bonded to each other. 
  Nissan is using the same cold-rolled steel panel SPCD-SPCE 
as 
that currently in use and the aluminum-magnesium-based alloy No. 
5000, commonly called "30-30" (i.e., tensile strength of 300 MPa 
or 30 kgf/mm[.sup]2[/] and elongation of 30 percent), for the 
inner and outer panels, respectively. Only one spot-welding 
voltage is required for spot-welding steel to steel, as well as 
aluminum to aluminum. Yoshitaka Kurihara, chief researcher at 
the Vehicular Research Laboratory of Nissan's General Research 
Institute, says this: "We chose the ratio of the aluminum alloy 
to the steel in the cladding material in such a way that one 
voltage can do both welding jobs simultaneously." 
  Cladding materials have two atomic layers of dissimilar 
metals arranged tightly next to each other, so no air can 
infiltrate between the two layers; thus, neither oxidation nor 
reduction takes place. As a result, no potential difference is 
generated between the steel and aluminum-alloy layers, and that 
prevents any corrosion process from taking place between the two 
dissimilar metals. 
  Nissan improved the body rigidity of the AQ-X through both 
design and material, and, according to Kurihara, "both bending 
and twisting rigidity are 20 percent higher than those of 
previous cars of the same class." Nissan successfully prevented 
any loss of rigidity despite the incorporation of aluminum. The 
gauge of the aluminum-alloy sheet, like that of previous 
aluminum-alloy parts, was made 1.4 times that of the sheet steel 
to maintain the same tensile rigidity as that of a sheet-steel 
body. 
  The separation of steel from aluminum in an auto body, the 
critical process in the recycling of cars to be disposed of, was 
made technically possible by Nissan for the AQ-X. By heating to 
approximately 500ÎC, "a brittle intermetallic compound is 
formed at the interface of the steel and aluminum-alloy layers 
of the cladding material, which makes it easy to separate the 
two layers with light impact." 
  Nissan believes that the iron-aluminum hybrid body structure 
is a weight reduction technology with a high probability of 
implementation, because the advantage of weight reduction can be 
balanced against the added cost through the optimization of the 
ratio of cheap sheet-steel to lightweight aluminum alloy. 
According to Kurihara, as far as the cost problem is concerned, 
although it is difficult to make a thorough assessment at this 
time, "it appears that a certain cost increase is unavoidable." 
Not only does the aluminum alloy cost approximately three times 
as much as the steel (the ratio of the materials' unit prices x 
the ratio of the densities), but the production cost is also 
high for the aluminum alloy, because the spot-welding 
electrode's life is shorter for the alloy than for steel. 
<H5>  Audi Exhibits Space Frame Car With Aluminum Body </H5>
  Germany's Audi Motor Corp. exhibited an Audi Space Frame 
(ASF) car with a space-frame structure assembled with 
aluminum-alloy outer and inner panels. Audi plans to use this 
ASF model for the mass-test-production of the A8, which is to 
replace the currently sold luxury V8. The A8 is scheduled to be 
introduced to the German market in May 1994. 
  Although the price of the A8 has not been announced, it has 
been rumored that the price will exceed the price of the V8 of 
&yen;11.4 million. It is speculated that the car could afford an 
all-aluminum-alloy body because of its high-priced status and 
the moderate production rate of approximately 2,400 vehicles per 
month. Most of today's passenger cars have a monocoque body that 
functions as the structural material for outer and inner panels. 
In contrast, the frame alone of the space-frame structure 
functions as the structural component for the body, and outer 
panels are primarily used as the exterior partition. Therefore, 
the space-frame structure has the advantage of being able to 
maintain rigidity despite the adoption of materials less rigid 
than steel, such as aluminum alloys and resin, for the outer and 
inner panels. 
  Another important advantage of the space-frame structure is 
that it enables the use of comparatively cheaper extruded 
materials for the frame structural component. Extruded materials 
can be made with heavier gauges for use in spots that require 
high rigidity, or they can be made with thinner gauges for use 
in spots that require low rigidity. Furthermore, even if 
sections with insufficient rigidity happen to be constructed in 
a space-frame structure made of extruded frames, the weakness 
can easily be compensated for with stiffening ribs. 
  For the space-frame structure of the ASF car exhibited at 
the 
show, the lowest-cost extruded material was used in the largest 
quantity, the next-lowest-cost die-cast material was used in the 
next-to-largest quantity, and the highest-cost rolled material 
was used in the smallest quantity. However, based on the concept 
disclosed in 1991 in which extruded frame materials were to be 
connected with a die-cast bonding material for the ASF concept 
model, many observers at the show seemed to get the impression 
that the use rate of the extruded material was less than 
previously announced. 
  Audi used an aluminum-manganese-silicon-based alloy for the 
extruded material, and an aluminum-silicon-manganese-based alloy 
for the vacuum die-cast material. What attracted the audience's 
attention is the use of a press-molded rolled sheet material in 
a complex shape for the part called the "C pillar" of the roof 
section of the ASF car body. 
  The chassis of the ASF car was formed by riveting the roof 
and panels, such as doors and fenders, that were made by 
press-molding of aluminum alloy. The panels were riveted, 
instead of spot-welded to produce bond strength that is higher 
by approximately 30 percent and to eliminate the anti-production 
environment element of sparking, which would be caused by 
welding. Approximately 70 percent of the bonding was done with 
riveting; the rest was completed by a combination of 
spot-welding and clinching. The aluminum-alloy materials for the 
ASF car were supplied by an ALCOA Corp. (U.S.) plant in Germany. 
<H5>  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Modifies Rear End With Elastomer </H5>
  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. displayed its concept car, which was 
a fourth-generation research experimental car -- the HSR-IV. As 
with the HSR-III of two years ago, Mitsubishi adopted an 
all-plastic body for the HSR-IV, primarily for weight reduction. 
  The PPE/nylon 6 (polypropylene ether/PA or polyamide) alloy, 
a thermoplastic resin capable of withstanding an online baking 
finish temperature (140-160ÎC), was used for vertical outer 
panels, including fenders; and a sheet molding compound was used 
for horizontal outer panels, such as the hood, which requires 
tensile rigidity. 
  Mitsubishi has already developed its body aluminization 
technology to a level capable of mass-production through the 
development of the lightweight, experimental SR-17 car. On the 
other hand, the Material Technology Department of the Passenger 
Car Development Division said this: "We again pursued 
improvement of the resin body, since our resin technology was 
relatively behind." 
  Mitsubishi did not quite solve the problem inherent in 
plastic bodies -- i.e., "the usage of a recyclable, 
thermoplastic resin for horizontal outer panels" -- with the 
HSR-IV. Mitsubishi is said to be "experimenting with a 
multilayer, thermoplastic resin outer sheet in which a foaming 
agent is sandwiched between skin layers, in order to increase 
the sheet gauge to gain sufficient tensile rigidity" without 
sacrificing weight reduction. 
  The most unique feature of the HSR-IV was the elastomer 
"elastic aero-tail" that can tailor the shape of the tail-end 
section to the running conditions in order to modify the 
aerodynamic environment. Under normal conditions, the tail end 
is flat. However, under certain running conditions, the tail end 
rises to form a triangular upheaval, i.e., the upheaval 
functions as an air spoiler that generates a downward force to 
counterbalance the buoyancy the car has under high-speed driving 
conditions. Also, when the car is driven in reverse, the spoiler 
remains down so as to maintain good rear visibility for the 
driver. 
  In fact, a similar mechanism had been incorporated in the 
HSR-III, although, this time, the durability of the elastomer 
was drastically improved, to the level of ready implementation. 
At the same time, Mitsubishi improved the design to make the 
upheaved area smaller. The tail section is covered with a 
skin-like material of a stretchable, "special thermoplastic 
elastomer" to form an upheaval that is smooth and seamless. 
Details of this elastomer have not yet been disclosed, although 
it is said to be "a styrene-based elastomer with maximum 
elongation of 600-800 percent." The key for the elastomer is the 
manifestation of the durability for repetitive stretches. A 
polyolefin-based, thermoplastic resin called TPO -- a blend of 
polypropylene and ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) -- had been 
used for the HSR-III,[.sup]1[/] although the resin was not 
durable enough for the tail section to be commercialized. 
  Sachio Miwa, of the Material Technology Department, says 
that 
this time, Mitsubishi, in its experiments, "achieved an 
elastomer durability that could cope with 3,000-4,000 repetitive 
stretches, which is equivalent to the 10 years of use. 
Therefore," he continues, "it will be possible to commercialize 
the tail section in the next few years." An approximately 
100mm-high upheaval can be repeatedly formed on the tail, with a 
stretch of approximately 300 percent for the elastomer. In 
contrast to ordinary thermoplastic elastomers, which show a 
nearly linear elongation-stress relationship, this particular 
elastomer shows a rubberlike, nonlinear elongation-stress 
relationship by requiring small stress when stretched by less 
than 100 percent and then suddenly increasing the stress 
requirement when elongation exceeds 100 percent. Mitsubishi 
coated the tail with a urethane elastic paint that could stretch 
up to 300 percent in order to be able to cope with the 
elastomer's stretch. 
  According to Miwa, Mitsubishi is "planning other aerodynamic 
improvement uses for this elastomer." For example, he continues, 
"it is possible to have deformable body sections that cover the 
upper halves of tires, so that excellent aerodynamic conditions 
are created when moving straight forward; when parts of the 
tires protrude outside the body in turning situations, the body 
sections alter their shape to accommodate the tires' protrusion." 
<H5>  Water-Repelling Windows Under Evaluation by Mitsubishi, </H5>
Nissan 
  Recently, steady progress has been quietly made in the 
development of new glass in various auto body components. The 
progress made in glass development was demonstrated by the 
water-repelling glass adopted by Mitsubishi and Nissan for the 
windshields of the HSR-IV and the AQ-X, respectively. The 
glasses themselves are said to be "not yet in a fully developed 
stage." 
  Each of the test glasses is being developed jointly by a 
team 
of auto and glass makers for improving the windshield visibility 
on a rainy day. This objective is achieved by coating a glass 
plate with a water-repelling material to form spherical drops of 
rainwater on the glass surface to minimize vision distortion. 
  There are two kinds of water-repelling coating material: 
fluororesin and silicone-based. The problem currently under 
study is the coating's durability, and, in order to 
commercialize such a windshield, "it is absolutely necessary to 
have the durability of the coating nearly equal to that of the 
glass itself," according to Kenichi Tange, the head of 
Mitsubishi's Material Technology Department. Since the coating 
must be made on the outside of the windshield, the coating needs 
to be resistant to peeling due to various frictions and must be 
stable against deterioration caused by ultraviolet light. 
  For the HSR-IV, Mitsubishi adopted a new, water-repelling 
windshield with improved durability in terms of effective water 
repulsion. According to Mitsubishi, the wear resistance of the 
new windshield's water-repelling film "was improved by the 
addition to the film-coating material of a special agent that 
undergoes chemical bonding with silica (SiO[.sub]2[/]), the 
major component of glass." 
  Furthermore, Mitsubishi, which had been trying various 
fluororesin-based coating materials, lowered the molecular 
weight of the resin specifically for application to the HSR-IV 
to increase the apparent concentration of fluorine atoms. The 
higher the fluorine content, the greater the water-repelling 
effect and the greater the stability against light. Mitsubishi 
hopes to be able to commercialize the windshield in the next 
several years. 
  On the other hand, Nissan claims that it is "in the process 
of comparative evaluation of fluorine- and silicone-based 
resins," and it has not yet disclosed the latest composition of 
the coating material. 
<H5>  Highly Radio-Wave-Penetrable UV/IR Cut Glass </H5>
  Nissan adopted a UV (ultraviolet) IR (infrared, or heat ray) 
cut glass for the windows of the AQ-X. This was an attempt to 
protect the driver and passengers from sunlight and to alleviate 
the sunlight's heating effect on interior temperature. Another 
aim will eventually be to lessen the load for the air 
conditioner. 
  Nissan has not yet disclosed the specifics of the glass 
surface treatment, although, it explains, a "metallic 
micropowder is coated on the interior side of the glass." The 
reason for coating the inside of the glass is to minimize 
frictions that may promote peeling of the coating material. 
Although the side window glasses, which may be raised and 
lowered, are not completely free of interior frictions, Hiroaki 
Sasaki, an engineer at the Vehicular Research Laboratory of the 
General Research Institute, says this: "We believe that the 
window glass does not require any maintenance work for the 
sun-screening effect, because this window glass has already 
achieved a durability that corresponds to the vehicle's 
durability in terms of number of years." 
  The coating of the window glass screens the so-called UV-A 
light, i.e., ultraviolet light with wavelengths of 400 to 320 
nm. Ultraviolet light with wavelengths shorter than 320 nm are 
either screened out by ordinary glass or unable to reach ground. 
Therefore, those rays were not included in the targets of the 
coating. By cutting the transmittance in half, to 30 percent, 
the coating layer is said to be capable of absorbing more 
ultraviolet light or UV-A than can ordinary glass, which 
transmits approximately 60 percent of the rays. 
  However, the screening effect of this coated glass against 
infrared light has room for further improvement. The IR 
transmittance of this glass has not yet been divulged, although 
Nissan claims that "the transmittance level has been 
sufficiently reduced." Generally speaking, when glass is treated 
for UV and IR screening, it also tends to reflect more radio 
waves. For example, in the past, when a rear window glass with a 
printed antenna was treated for IR screening, the performance of 
the antenna tended to deteriorate. According to Nissan, "the new 
UV/IR cut glass can accommodate a printed antenna because the 
glass has high radio-wave-penetrability." 
<H5>  Adoption of Recycled Resin for FRP Bumper Reinforcement </H5>
  Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd. (FHI), came up with an 
interesting proposal for an exterior part. FHI adopted glass 
fiber-reinforced polypropylene (GFRP) for reinforcing the 
bumpers of its concept car, Jasmine, which was developed with 
the theme of promoting conservation of resources and energy and 
alleviating traffic jams. The idea also produced a weight 
reduction effect of the same level as that achieved by the 
aluminum-alloy bumper reinforcement, which has recently become 
the mainstream for bumper construction. 
  The choice of the GFRP permits us to decipher FHI's 
philosophy on resin recycling. The spokesperson from the Design 
Section of FHI Subaru Technical Headquarters says this: "Resins 
have recently been treated badly because of their implications 
in terms of preservation of the environment. Realistically 
speaking, however, some parts of the auto body have to be made 
of resin. In order to be able to recycle resin, some body 
sections or components must be saved for the use of recycled 
resin. We want to propose the GFRP bumper reinforcement as one 
of the most promising components in this category." FHI's 
thinking was that "the bumper reinforcement, which doesn't need 
a high-quality appearance, would be the ideal spot to use 
recycled resin," since the reinforcement is hidden behind the 
bumper fascia. 
<H5>  Engines </H5>
  Attracting the most attention at the Engine Exhibit were 
Nissan's VQ engine, which the developer hopes will become the 
mainstream engine of the late '90s, and Mazda's rotary engine 
system, which is designed to be used for hydrogen-burning cars 
in the future. 
<H5>  Significant Weight Reduction Through Abundant Use of </H5>
Aluminum Alloys for VQ Engine 
  The VQ engine is expected to be installed in ordinary cars 
as 
early as 1994. It is a V-type engine with a displacement of 2-3 
liters. The engine drew attention because it demonstrated how 
much weight reduction, fuel-cost reduction, and exhaust cleaning 
could be improved for the existing gasoline-burning, 
reciprocating engine. 
  Material technology was fully applied in an attempt to 
reduce 
the weight of the engine. Compared with the current VG engine, 
the weight of the cylinder block was reduced by 29 kg, or 50 
percent, in addition to a weight decrease of 5 kg, or 17 
percent, in the primary moving system and a total weight 
decrease of 9 kg, or 19 percent, for the moving valve system 
plus the cylinder heads. 
  The drastic weight reduction of 50 percent for the cylinder 
block was achieved through the replacement of the existing cast 
iron FC with the aluminum alloy ADC 12. The block was molded 
with a high-pressure die-cast machine installed at Iwaki Plant, 
Nissan's designated state-of-the-art engine plant. Although the 
machine is called a die-cast machine, it is a type of 
high-pressure casting method with a slightly low-casting 
pressure of approximately 100 MPa. Today, Honda and Mazda are 
the only automakers that are adopting a high-pressure cast 
aluminum alloy for cylinder blocks. 
  In 1982, Nissan had adopted a high-pressure cast product for 
the cylinder block of the 1-liter displacement engine for the 
then-new model called March. Subsequently, however, Nissan used 
products (made of aluminum alloys, including AC4B) cast with a 
low pressure of approximately 1 MPa for cylinder blocks in its 
campaign for aluminization of large engines. High pressure could 
not be used for casting, because sand molds had to be used to 
form the cooling-water passages. This problem was solved for the 
VQ engine by adopting an open deck-type casting method without 
using the mold. 
  The cylinder block for the VQ engine had been designed by 
CAE 
for rigid construction, as well as for the installation of 
cooling-water passages. Therefore, according to a spokesperson 
for the First Power Train Design Department of the Power Train 
Development Division, although the block "has an intricate shape 
for high-pressure casting, the casting method was chosen as a 
result of optimization with CAE fluid analysis." 
  The ADC 12 high-pressure cast product was also used to make 
the component that unitized the oil pan and the lower crankcase 
situated under the cylinder block. Unlike previous oil pans that 
were placed below the cylinder block merely as an attachment, 
this component also functions as a structural component to 
increase rigidity of the overall engine. Because of this, an 
extra effort was made to decrease the weight of the cylinder 
block. Moreover, the intricately shaped cylinder block was made 
of a low-pressure cast product from AC4B. 
  The ideal way to reduce the weight of an engine is to reduce 
the weight of the moving parts of an engine. When parts that 
undergo reciprocating or rotary motions are made light, not only 
is less driving energy required, but also the energy loss due to 
sliding is reduced. In addition, the engine's revolution limit 
and responsiveness will also increase. Therefore, says Director 
Kenichi Sasaki, of Nissan, "the VQ engine was developed as the 
basic engine model that will be used for the next 15 years." 
  Nissan also succeeded in achieving a drastic weight 
reduction 
of approximately 20 percent for AC8A-made pistons that were made 
in a rational shape created via the full use of CAE in stress 
and heat-flow analyses. 
  Similarly, connecting rods were also made lighter by 
reducing 
the diameters of the pins at their smaller ends, which are 
linked with the pistons. This weight reduction was possible 
because of the reduction in the piston's weight and because of 
the improved fatigue strength that resulted from the creation of 
an appropriate compression stress layer on the rod's surface by 
hard shot peening. 
<H5>  Hydrogen Gas Rotary Car Achieves 230-km Cruising Distance </H5>
  For the last several years, Mazda has been energetically 
developing a near-future engine in the form of a hydrogen-gas 
rotary engine for low-pollution vehicles. The engine at the show 
drew much attention because it may soon be used in combination 
with an improved version of today's gasoline-reciprocating 
engines if low-pollution cars are required to meet 
exhaust-emission regulations of the state of California, in the 
United States. 
  Mazda's HR-X2 concept car, which carries the rotary engine 
(displacement of 2 x 654 cc), achieved a cruising distance of 
230 km at a constant speed of 60 km/h with 43 m[.sup]3[/] 
[normal] of hydrogen gas stored in a fuel tank, which contained 
a hydrogen-occluded alloy. 
  The mass of this hydrogen-occluded alloy-containing fuel 
tank 
is approximately 300 kg, which is about the same as that of a 
battery for an electric vehicle. However, according to Director 
Takanori Minami, "the hydrogen-gas rotary engine car has the 
edge over the electric vehicle because the cruising distance for 
the former is twice that of the 100 km or so for the latter." 
  The hydrogen-occluded alloy is a misch metal/nickel alloy 
(MmNi[.sub]5[/], Mm is a mixture of rare earth metals). This 
alloy, which weighs 18 kg, is packed in a thin, long cell with 
dimensions of approximately 11x7x68 cm. Arranged inside the cell 
with a grid-like cross-section are fins made of extruded No. 
5000 aluminum alloy. Thin pipes for circulating warm and cold 
water are installed at the intersections of the grid formation. 
Both ends of the cells are welded together by tungsten-inert gas 
welding to form a tank. 
  The hydrogen-occluded alloy is heated or cooled by water or 
cold water, using the engine's cooling water, for the desorption 
or absorption of hydrogen gas. A total of 18 cells makes up the 
tank (with the total weight of the alloy being 250 kg), which is 
located on the trunk floor. 
  The rotary engine mounted in the HR-X2 is an improved model 
of the 13B base. The new engine has a higher output as a result 
of a change in the intake process: instead of the simultaneous 
intake of both air and hydrogen, as in the old engine, hydrogen 
gas is injected into the combustion chamber after air has been 
led into it from a separate port. 
  Mazda is "proud of the new engine's performance level, which 
is equal to that of the existing gasoline reciprocating engine," 
with a maximum output-maximum torque of approximately 96,000 
W/170 N/m (130 PS/17.0 kgf/m). 
  Elsewhere, FHI's cylinder sleeve made of an aluminum alloy 
with excellent wear resistance and machinability was also worthy 
of attention. This aluminum alloy was 3HA with a composition of 
Al-14 weight-percent Si, a product of Australia's Comalco Ltd. 
The unique feature of this alloy is the superfine size of 
precipitated intermetallic compound grains, 10 Êm. 
<H5>  Electric Vehicles </H5>
  At the show, electric vehicle makers exhibited low-pollution 
cars to show their concern for the environment and appeared to 
demonstrate the philosophy that cars of the near future should 
be made differently from current, gasoline-burning, 
reciprocating engine cars. 
  Exhibited at the show were a multitude of electric vehicles, 
including Toyota's EV-50 and Nissan's (Abeniiru) EV, 
representing low-pollution vehicles of the near future. One of 
the factors that have been pushing automakers into the 
development of these electric vehicles is the auto emission 
regulations of the state of California (U.S.) that, starting in 
1994, mandate the step-by-step introduction of low-pollution 
vehicles. 
  According to the regulations, which are the strictest in the 
world, 2 percent of the total number of vehicles to be sold 
must, starting in 1998, consist of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) 
that emit no nonmethane-based organic gas in exhaust. A Toyota 
official says that low-pollution vehicles emerged in force 
because "it will soon be 1998, and we don't have much time to 
evaluate the vehicle's reliability and durability." A 
spokesperson at Honda Technical Research Institute says this: 
"Today, it is the time for us to tell everybody how far we have 
come along technically and how technology can be applied to 
low-pollution vehicles." 
  Today, two types of low-pollution vehicles have been 
proposed: one is an electric automobile that gets its motive 
power from a motor driven by electricity stored in a battery, 
and the other is a hybrid car that is equipped with an internal 
combustion engine to supplement the battery power, so it can run 
with larger output and for a longer cruising distance than the 
electric automobile. From the standpoint of practicality, both 
types require the further development of an efficient battery 
and a motor. At this show, displayed batteries were noteworthy 
for the fact that they seemed to need much further improvement. 
<H5>  Sodium-Sulfur Battery With High Energy Density </H5>
  Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd. exhibited the EE-10, which was 
developed within the concept of the "lightweight, hybrid city 
commuter." Intended for city driving, this car normally runs on 
electricity, as well as on a 660-cc methanol engine for 
high-speed, long-distance driving. According to its 
specifications, this car was equipped with a sodium-sulfur 
battery that was under joint development by Yuasa Battery Co., 
Ltd. (Yuasa) (Tokyo) 
  This battery is unique in that it has the highest energy 
density of all the electric car batteries currently 
commercialized or under development. The energy density is an 
index for cruising distance per charging: the greater the energy 
density, the greater the distance the car can travel without 
further charging of the battery. As of now, the energy density 
of a sodium-sulfur battery is 100 Wh/kg, approximately 2.5 times 
that of a lead battery. 
  Theoretically, a sodium-sulfur battery can attain an energy 
density that is "about 10 times that of a lead battery," 
according to a spokesperson at Yuasa's Tokyo Development 
Laboratory. Moreover, the output density of a sodium-sulfur 
battery -- which indicates a car's acceleration capability, 
hill-climbing capability, and maximum speed -- is 150 W/kg, and 
its charging life (the number of tolerable times for repeating 
charging and discharging) is 1,000 times. Both of these numbers 
are comparable with those of a lead battery. 
  The sodium-sulfur battery with the above-described, 
excellent 
performance is constructed like a sandwich rolled into a 
cylindrical form, with a solid electrolyte of _b_-alumina 
(_b_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]) between the sodium plate 
anode and the sodium-sulfur (Na[.sub]2[/]S[.sub]x[/]) 
plate cathode. It is claimed that the battery "converts energy 
at 100-percent efficiency, because no side reactions occur" in 
the battery's electrochemical process. 
  This battery has the advantage of undergoing no 
self-discharge and being made of materials that come from 
abundant resources. On the other hand, it is not easy to handle. 
According to the Fire Service Law, sodium and sulfur, which are 
used for the electrodes, are classified under category 3, 
"spontaneously ignitable and water-prohibitive substances," and 
category 2, "combustible solids," respectively. Their uses are 
restricted in that registration with the Fire Defense Agency is 
required when more than a given quantity of either of the two 
materials is handled. In fact, a sodium-sulfur battery was not 
installed in the EE-10 at the show. The Fire Service Law 
prohibited the battery from being brought into the exhibition 
hall. 
  In addition to that problem, technical problems still remain 
with the sodium-sulfur battery. For example, because of its high 
operating temperature of above 300ÎC, the battery needs to 
be heated for charging and needs to be protected from cooling 
while the car is being driven. To solve this temperature 
problem, it will be necessary to develop a heat-insulating 
vessel and a heating mechanism that does not interfere with the 
high energy density, i.e., the low weight, of the sodium-sulfur 
battery. According to the Design Department of Suzuki, 
"sodium-sulfur battery development has just begun. From the 
standpoint of resources, we expect more from this battery than 
from the nickel-based battery, and it will eventually replace 
the lead battery." 
<H5>  Long-Life Nickel-Hydrogen Battery; ZEV-Favorite Lead Battery </H5>
  The "nickel-based battery" is the general name for a group 
of 
batteries that use nickel for the cathode. There are four types 
of nickel-based battery, depending on the composition of the 
anode: cadmium, iron, zinc, and hydrogen-occluded alloys 
(including LaNi[.sub]5[/]). Of those, automakers appear to be 
staying away from Niccad batteries, which used cadmium for the 
anode, because of the metal's toxicity. Of the remaining three, 
the nickel-hydrogen-occluded alloy (nickel-hydrogen) battery is 
currently in the position closest to commercialization, because 
of its excellent balance between energy density, output density, 
and long life. 
  For example, Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd. mounted a 
nickel-hydrogen battery in its hybrid car EV Sedan, which has a 
maximum speed of 120 km/h and a cruising distance of 450 km. 
Although details of components of the battery, including the 
hydrogen-occluded alloy, have not been disclosed, its 
performance reportedly includes an energy density of 65 Wh/kg, 
which is 1.5-2 times that of the lead battery, and an output 
density of 170 W/kg, which is 1.5 times that of the lead 
battery. Most remarkable is the battery's life, which is said to 
be "as durable as the car itself, even with daily repetition of 
charging and discharging." 
  Honda also exhibited a nickel-hydrogen battery, which had 
been developed jointly with Matsushita Battery Co., Ltd. 
(Moriguchi City, Osaka Prefecture), and Ovonic Battery Corp., a 
U.S. battery maker. This battery's energy density and output 
density are approximately 60 Wh/kg and 170 W/kg, respectively, 
which are about the same as those for Daihatsu's battery. 
According to Honda's Tochigi Research Institute, however, "the 
battery's life is currently good for only 500 cycles of charging 
and discharging, which we intend to extend to the car's life." 
  Tochigi Research Institute also says this: "It should take 
several more years before this battery can be mass-produced." 
Honda needs to ensure that the excellent performance of a single 
cell will not deteriorate when cells are combined to form a 
module. Furthermore, before the nickel-hydrogen battery can be 
commercialized, "the recovery and re-use technologies for 
hydrogen-occluded alloys must be established," according to 
Tokyo Development Laboratory, Yuasa, and something must be done 
to bring the cost down from what is now approximately 15 times 
that of the lead battery. 
  Still, many problems need to be solved for both 
sodium-sulfur 
and nickel-hydrogen batteries. Automakers, particularly Nissan 
and Honda, seem to have the opinion that "lead batteries are 
suitable for ZEVs from the standpoint of reliability, safety, 
ease of handling and cost, and nickel-based batteries need to be 
developed primarily for the post-ZEV future." 
  Both the EVX -- which Honda is thinking of commercializing 
in 
the future -- and the (Abeniiru) EV -- for which Nissan is 
planning limited sales -- carry a lead battery. A spokesperson 
from the Third Development Center in Toyota says that "for the 
time being, our main effort will be focused on performance 
improvement for lead batteries, such as low-temperature 
performance and life" for electric vehicles. 
  Low-pollution vehicles, including electric and hybrid cars, 
that use a battery as the source of energy generally cost two to 
five times more than existing cars. According to Nissan's 
Technical Vehicle Development Laboratory, in order to reduce the 
cost of an electric car, "it is critical to lower the cost of 
its exclusive components in addition to the batteries." At the 
same time, it may also be necessary to further develop the 
heretofore nurtured weight reduction technology, so that the 
battery's weight can be easily dealt with in the context of the 
reduced weight of the vehicle. 
<H5>  Hybrid Electric Car Charges Battery While in Motion </H5>
  Mitsubishi showed off its hybrid electric car, the ESR, for 
its low fuel consumption and low pollution. This electric car 
carries a compact generator operated by a gasoline engine for 
the purpose of charging the battery. 
  When the battery is sufficiently charged, the car is driven 
by currents from the battery. However, when the capacity of the 
battery becomes low, the generator is actuated to charge the 
battery without the car stopping. This is called the series 
hybrid method, for "hybrid-operating" the car while its battery 
is being charged. The engine for driving the generator is driven 
at a constant revolution that is extremely efficient and 
generates the least emission per output. The idea behind the 
development of the ESR was that, "by installing the generator as 
the power source, less transmission loss can be encountered than 
with power transmitted from a thermal power plant. Therefore, 
from the overall standpoint, less fossil fuel is consumed and 
less carbon dioxide is generated." 
  Based on that idea, minimization of energy loss was stressed 
throughout the development of the ESR, including the design of 
its body and electric components. For example, in order to 
increase the efficiencies of the motor and the generator, 
silicon steel plates that were 0.25-0.3mm thick and had only 
recently been placed on the market were used for their core 
sections. Those plates can reduce eddy current loss, because 
they are 0.5mm thinner than the existing plates. It is claimed 
that "the motor's efficiency improved by 2 percent merely by 
reducing the plate thickness from 0.5mm to 0.25mm."
