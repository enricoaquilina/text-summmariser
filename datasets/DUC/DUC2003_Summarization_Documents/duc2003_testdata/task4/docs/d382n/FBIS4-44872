  [Text] Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo has developed a polymer 
electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) that uses platinum 
catalyst for electrodes. Compared to a conventional phosphoric 
acid fuel cell (PAFC), the maximum electrode output per square 
centimeter has been upgraded to 1.2 watts. This is approximately 
four times more than the maximum output generated by a 
conventional PAFC. Reaction efficiency between hydrogen and 
oxygen under room temperature has been improved by using high 
polymer membranes. The company has succeeded in running a 
commercially available motor scooter using the fuel cell as a 
mobile power supply. The company is still experimenting with 
extending the life of fuel cells and plans to conduct joint 
projects to put the development of this technology to practical 
use with battery manufacturers and automobile manufacturers. 
  The company miniaturized PEMFC and reduced its weight by 
applying a high polymer membrane, [naphion], to electrolyte 
layers in between several layers of cell electrode stacks from 
which power output is maximized. The amount of platinum used 
for the fuel cell is 1 milligram per square centimeter of the 
electrode. The fuel cell drives the motor using 1 liter of 
hydrogen per minute under atmospheric pressure. In principle, 
the fuel cell generates electricity resulting from reaction 
between the hydrogen gas and oxygen in the electrolytes between 
the catalyst layers and produces water. 
  Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo jointly developed the basic 
technology 
with Professor Masahiro Watanabe of the Technology Department of 
Yamanashi University. The company solved a deterioration 
problem with catalyst poisoned by carbon monoxide in the 
hydrogen fuel by developing platinum catalyst to which hydrogen 
occlusion alloys are applied. Another deterioration problem 
with the catalyst's function from deterioration of excessive 
amounts of moisture needed for activating high polymer membranes 
was solved by replacing a portion of the moisture to 
electrolytes and then draining another part to achieve the 
appropriate levels of moisture. 
  The company installed the fuel cell in a 370-watt motor 
scooter. The company has completed 3000 hours of duration 
testing and started developing different types of fuel cells 
with reduced amounts of platinum as an experiment. The company 
predicts that the development will be commercially available for 
home-use mobile power supply and non-pollutant automobiles 
within two to three years. 
  Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo also develops a variety of precision 
processing technologies for semiconductors and catalysts along 
with sales of metals. The company's technology development 
center in Kanagawa Prefecture has been developing catalyst 
electrodes for fuel cells such as PAFC and recently started 
expanding its development to fuel cells itself.
