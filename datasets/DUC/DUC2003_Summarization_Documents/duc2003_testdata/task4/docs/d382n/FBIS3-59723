<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  We seek to expand the use of solar-derived light, heat, 
water 
and wind power and other forms of natural energy in order to 
reduce our reliance on nonrenewable fossil fuel energy in the 
21st century. In a society with this orientation toward energy, 
we believe, as shown in Figure 1, that hydrogen, easily stored, 
transported, and converted to and from electricity, will play a 
crucial role as an energy medium, together with electricity 
produced from natural energy. Hydrogen is also converted to 
water when burned and can be used without disturbance to natural 
biosystems, while its convertibility with water provides a 
virtually limitless supply, as shown in Figure 2. Thus hydrogen 
is of interest as the ultimate fuel capable of providing 
long-term, mass quantity supply. A large-scale project aiming at 
Canadian-European utilization of electricity and hydrogen energy 
is already underway&lt;sup&gt; 1)&lt;/sup&gt;  as shown in Figure 3. 
  As depicted in Figure 3, automobile fuel is considered one 
of 
the main ways in which hydrogen will be used. 
  As one proposal for such, we prototyped the hydrogen rotary 
engine-equipped HR-X concept car (Figure 4) and showed it at the 
29th Tokyo Motor Show held in Fall, 1991. The HR-X attracted 
considerable public interest as a vehicle that will contribute 
to a clean, ecological world and was subsequently shown at other 
events around the globe, including the June, 1992 global summit 
on environmental problems in Brazil. The car is increasing 
awareness and anticipation of hydrogen vehicles. 
  In this paper, we discuss the background and objectives of 
hydrogen rotary engine (RE below) development, the advantages of 
using RE as hydrogen engines, the achievement of high output 
through a system for direct injection of hydrogen into cylinders 
(``direct injection'' below), and the results of our studies on 
emission characteristics, etc.

<H5>    2. Development Background and Objectives </H5>
  During the oil crises of the 1970s, hydrogen engines 
attracted the attention of specialists as alternative energy 
engines, and with the recent criticality of global environmental 
problems, they have again drawn attention from these quarters as 
clean engines. Research towards commercialization is continuing 
both in and out of Japan. 
  According to the basic characteristics shown in Table 1, 
hydrogen has a high calorific value, and if operated with the 
same amount of air and theoretical air/fuel ratio as a gasoline 
engine, the calorific value with a hydrogen engine will be 
15&percnt; 
higher than with gasoline, as shown in Figure 5. However, since 
the minimum ignition energy is a very low one-tenth that of 
gasoline, engine regions not hot enough to cause a problem in 
gasoline engines, such as spark plugs and exhaust valves, as 
well as residual exhaust gas, etc. become igniters and are 
believed to easily cause premature ignition, backfire, and other 
abnormal combustion. 
  Since premature ignition, backfire, and other abnormal 
combustion occurs readily in comparison to typical gasoline 
engines, research on conventional hydrogen engines has reported 
declining output performance or structural complexity caused by 
countermeasures, etc.&lt;sup&gt; 2)3)&lt;/sup&gt; 
  Noting that the distinctive structure of our proprietary RE 
were effective in preventing abnormal hydrogen combustion, we 
began development of hydrogen RE as clean, high-performance 
automobile engines designed to support a 21st century society 
making use of hydrogen energy.

<H5>      3. Studies of RE Suitability For Hydrogen Combustion </H5>
  3.1 Goals 
  In general, reducing the temperature of sources of ignition 
is effective in preventing abnormal combustion in a hydrogen 
engine. For this, the hydrogen supplied and heat produced must 
be reduced in order to lower combustion temperatures, even at 
the cost of output. However, there are also examples in prior 
research on hydrogen engines of suppression of abnormal 
combustion without a reduction in hydrogen supply through the 
introduction of sodium-containing exhaust valves and a system 
for water injection within cylinders to cool sources of ignition. 
  Evaluation of hydrogen reciprocating engines (``CE'' below) 
predating hydrogen RE has shown a decline in output to roughly 
50&percnt; that of gasoline engines used for comparison. In 
hydrogen 
CE we evaluated, the causes thereof were shown to be restriction 
to a lean region with an excess air ratio (&lgr;) of 1.8 or more 
in order to prevent abnormal combustion, and a reduction of 
intake air due to the large volume occupied by the hydrogen gas 
fuel; both of which resulted in a reduction of heat supplied to 
54&percnt; that of a gasoline engine. Consequently, we consider 
these 
2 factors the main causes of the low hydrogen CE output. 
  In contrast, the working chamber in an RE revolves as shown 
in Figure 6, and the location where intake, compression, 
expansion, and exhaust strokes occur differs. We believe that 
the relatively low temperature of the working chamber during 
intake and this unique structure free of high temperature 
exhaust valves and the like are beneficial in preventing 
backfire. We investigated RE suitability for hydrogen based on 
the above theory. This section discusses measures taken against 
abnormal combustion, and the next section discusses measures 
taken against reduction in air quantity. 




    3.2 Experimental Apparatus and Method 
  A Mazda RE, model 13B (1,308 cc) and Mazda CE, model FE 
(1,998 cc) were used in experiments. 
  Figure 7 shows an overview of the RE experimental apparatus 
used. The air intake pipes and chamber were modified for 
hydrogen introduction based on mass production specifications. 
Fuel supply systems studied were a premix system supplying 
previously mixed air and fuel, and an intake stroke injection 
system supplying hydrogen only during the intake stroke, 
reportedly effective in preventing backfire in hydrogen CE. The 
premix system supplied hydrogen through throttle valve flow, and 
the intake stroke injection system supplied hydrogen through a 
dedicated hydrogen port provided in a side housing. Hydrogen was 
supplied to the engines from a commercial high pressure hydrogen 
cylinder (15.7 MPA, 7 m&lt;sup&gt; 3&lt;/sup&gt; ) after pressure reduction 
to 0.5 MPa by a decompression device. As shown in Table 2, 
hydrogen port and air intake port timing initiated hydrogen 
supply slightly after intake began and terminated supply after 
air intake ended, 20 degrees of output shaft rotation later. 
  The CE fuel supply system used was a premix system supplying 
hydrogen through throttle valve flow. High tension cord 
shielding and narrowing of plug gaps (0.3mm) was carried out to 
prevent ignition by induced current, problematic in 
multicylinder engines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  3.3 Experiments 
  (1) Effect of Fuel Supply System 
  We studied the effects of differences in fuel supply systems 
on output limits. Figure 8 shows the results of a comparison of 
a premix system and an intake stroke injection system. Since 
output declines with mixtures richer than the theoretical 
air/fuel ratio (&lgr;=1), evaluation was made up to &lgr;=1. 
  Under full loading and with throttle valves fully open, a 
premix system RE was successfully operated at up to 5,000 rpm 
with &lgr;=1. However, output became unstable at 6,500 rpm, with 
&lgr;=1.4, and the excess air ratio (&lgr;) could not be reduced 
at 
higher speeds. In contrast, an intake stroke injection system RE 
was successfully operated at up to 6,500 rpm near &lgr;=1. We 
feel 
this is due to the production of non-uniform fuel regions with 
the intake stroke injection system, and a resulting weaker 
air/fuel ratio in mixture air near ignition sources than with 
premixing. 
  The following studies were made on the intake stroke 
injection system, superior in output. 
  (2) Effect of Spark Plug Heating Value 
  We investigated the optimum spark plug heating value for 
hydrogen. Spark plugs were those used with ordinary gasoline 
specifications; leading side spark plugs (``L plugs'' below) had 
a heating value of 5 (heating values follow product numbers of 
NGK Spark Plug Co. (Inc.)) and trailing side spark plugs (``T 
plugs'' below) had a heating value of 10. As the hydrogen 
quantity was increased from leanness, which inhibits abnormal 
combustion, premature ignition began to occur at an excess air 
ratio (&lgr;) of 1.6. Figure 9 shows indicator waves for the 
working chamber pressure when premature ignition occurred. 
Premature ignition first occurred noncontinuously, gradually 
occurring sooner and continuously, and finally occurring 
continuously in the migrating working chamber, [beginning] 
immediately after spark plug exposure during compression. From 
the course of this occurrence, we surmised that spark plugs 
become igniters, causing premature ignition which further raises 
spark plug temperature, increasing the frequency and quickening 
the occurrence of premature ignition. To verify this theory, we 
investigated the relationship between premature ignition and 
heating values by substituting spark plugs with effectively high 
heating values for the low temperature spark plugs. 
  As shown in Figure 10, the excess air ratio (&lgr;) at which 
premature ignition began declined after an increase in spark 
plug heating values from the gasoline-specification heating 
value of 5. As a result, we learned that normal operation is 
possible even at &lgr;=1 when heating values are raised to 13. 
Consequently, it became clear that spark plugs were the ignition 
source for the premature ignition in Figure 9, and that abnormal 
combustion can be avoided even at &lgr;=1 through the use of 
spark 
plugs with a high heating value. 
  In supplementary experiments, we found that the heating 
value 
of L plugs affected the occurrence of premature ignition. 










<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-25A>                 Figure 10. Effect of Spark Plug Heating Value on Premature </FIG>




  (3) Effect of Gas Escape From Plug Holes 
  Though the use of spark plugs with a heating value of 13 and 
the adoption of an intake stroke injection system for fuel 
supply allowed operation at &lgr;=1 over nearly all regions, 
instability did at times occur during maximum output at 6,500 
rpm near &lgr;=1. Accordingly, we investigated its cause using a 
pressure indicator diagram. 
  Figure 11 shows changes in the indicator diagram when 
instability occurred. Unlike Figure 9, sudden shifts from normal 
combustion to premature ignition are apparent. The absence of 
any signs of spark plug-induced premature ignition, and the 
passage of apex seals over L plug holes immediately prior to the 
occurrence of premature ignition led us to believe that mixture 
air uncombusted during the compression stroke passes through L 
plug holes, comes in contact with hot, burning gases during the 
expansion stroke, and is ignited. We felt that the size and 
volume of L plug holes would affect the occurrence of this 
phenomenon and therefore investigated the effect of changing L 
plug hole volume by changing L plug ejection quantities. As 
shown in Figure 12, we learned that the excess air ratio (&lgr;) 
during the occurrence of output instability can be reduced by 
increasing the ejection quantity; that is, by decreasing L plug 
hole volume.

  3.4 Combustion Performance 
  (1) Heat Efficiency 
  Figure 13 shows the relationship between net heat efficiency 
and air/fuel ratio at 1,500 rpm and respective loads of 
P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.1 MPa and P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.29 MPa. 
  For P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.1 MPa, a peak was reached near &lgr;=3. 
Where heat efficiency is concerned, the leaner the mixture, the 
better for pumping loss and specific heat ratio, but isochorism 
declines and combustion deteriorates, and we believe that the 
balance of both sets of factors forms the peak. For 
P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.29 MPa, throttle valves were fully open at 
&lgr;=2.5, and a peak net heat efficiency of 28&percnt; was 
reached at 
such time. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-26A>             Figure 13. Heat Efficiency vs. Air/Fuel Ratio </FIG>




  (2) Output Performance 
  Figure 14 compares hydrogen RE and hydrogen CE at 2,500 rpm 
through the relationship of excess air ratio (&lgr;) and output. 
  As the excess air ratio (&lgr;) falls, output increases. 
However the air/fuel ratio in the hydrogen CE could not be 
enriched above &lgr;=1.8 due to backfire. Higher output was 
obtained with the hydrogen RE, which allowed operation up to 
&lgr;=1. As a result, while only 50&percnt; of 
gasoline-specification 
output was obtained with the (premix system) hydrogen CE, 
63&percnt; 
and 75&percnt; outputs were obtained with the hydrogen RE premix 
and 
intake stroke injection systems, respectively.

  (3) Exhaust Gas Performance 
  Figure 15 shows the relationship between NOx and excess air 
ratio (&lgr;) at 1,500 rpm and respective loads of 
P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.1 MPa and P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.29 MPa. 
  For P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.1 MPa, NOx are nearly zero above 
&lgr;=1.5; and for P&lt;inf&gt; e&lt;/inf&gt; =0.29 MPa, nearly zero above 
&lgr;=2.0. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-26C>             Figure 15. NOx Exhaust Characteristics </FIG>




  3.5 Results and Issues in Suitability Testing 
  The following was learned from our studies of RE suitability 
for hydrogen. 
  (1) RE show high performance in preventing backfire and can 
be operated at &lgr;=1 over a broad range if spark plugs with a 
heating value suited to hydrogen are used. 
  (2) While only 50&percnt; of gasoline-specification output 
was 
obtained with a premix system hydrogen CE, 63&percnt; of 
gasoline-specification output was obtained with a hydrogen RE. 
Additionally, 75&percnt; of gasoline-specification output was 
successfully obtained with the structurally simpler intake 
stroke injection system. 
  (3) High heat efficiency and clean exhaust gas is obtained 
under partial loading if operation is pursued at &lgr;=2-3. 
  From the above results, we found that hydrogen RE require no 
structural changes or attachment of special devices to prevent 
abnormal combustion near the theoretical air/fuel ratio capable 
of drawing maximum output; merely switching to spark plugs with 
a heating value suited to engine requirements is sufficient. It 
is thus demonstrated that RE possess a structure which is 
fundamentally easily adaptable to hydrogen engines, for which 
preventing abnormal combustion is the most important concern. 
  Nonetheless, the 75&percnt; of gasoline-specification output 
obtained even through operation at the theoretical air/fuel 
ratio is low. Likewise, since air and hydrogen are 
simultaneously injected by the intake stroke injection system we 
studied, air quantity during intake is reduced approximately 
30&percnt; by hydrogen volume, and volumetric efficiency is low. 
Accordingly, we report our study of a direct injection system 
designed to solve this problem by supplying hydrogen directly to 
cylinders immediately after completion of the intake stroke. 
<H5>  4. Development of Hydrogen RE Direct Injection Systems </H5>
  4.1 Goal 
  The decline in the volumetric efficiency of air that is the 
second cause of reduced hydrogen CE output depicted in Figure 5 
stems from the low density that is one hydrogen characteristic 
indicated in Table 1, and this characteristic is likewise a 
cause of reduced output in hydrogen RE. Specifically, low 
density gaseous hydrogen occupies a large 28&percnt; volume of 
total 
gas mixture in the theoretical air/fuel ratio, in contrast to 
the mere 1.7&percnt; occupied by gasoline vapor. And even when 
the gas 
mixture naturally input to a premix system, in which hydrogen is 
mixed in the intake pipes, is considered quantitatively the same 
as that in a gasoline engine, the amount of air therein is far 
less, as shown in Figure 16. Counteractive methods for direct 
injection of hydrogen into the working chamber after completion 
of air intake have been researched&lt;sup&gt; 4)5)&lt;/sup&gt; , and we 
investigated their effectiveness in hydrogen RE. Since the 
volumetric ratio of air to hydrogen in the theoretical air/fuel 
ratio is 72:28, mixed gas volumetric efficiency might be raised 
to a maximum 138&percnt; if direct injection raises the 
volumetric 
efficiency of air alone to near 100&percnt;, as shown in Figure 
16. 
  We also studied the exhaust characteristics of hydrogen 
fuel, 
reported to be completely free from conversion to noxious 
substances. Water is essentially the only combustion product of 
hydrogen, but a certain amount of lubricating oil carried into 
the working chamber in an actual hydrogen engine is burned and 
produces trace amounts of HC, CO, and CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; . 
Additionally, atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen bond in the high 
temperatures of the working chamber, forming NOx. Our studies of 
hydrogen RE included exhaust characteristics of these emissions. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-27A>             Figure 16. Quantitative Differences in Supply By Hydrogen </FIG>




  4.2 Experimental Method and Apparatus 
  In systems for direct injection of hydrogen, both low 
pressure direct injection (roughly 1 MPa or less) early in the 
compression stroke and high pressure direct injection (roughly 
8-10 MPa) late in the compression stroke have been researched. 
In low pressure direct injection, the long duration from 
injection to spark provides superior mixing with air, however 
high pressure direct injection allows injection immediately 
before the spark and prevents premature ignition. As clarified 
in the previous section, the basic structure of the RE easily 
allows prevention of premature ignition, thus the need for high 
pressure injection is slight, and we felt that low pressure 
injection involving a simpler apparatus was appropriate. We 
therefore prototyped a hydrogen RE with a low pressure direct 
injection system and studied improvements in output performance. 
  Figure 17 shows the structure and operation of the 
prototyped 
hydrogen RE with direct injection system. Atop a side housing 
where gasoline specifications locate an intake port is an air 
port for intake of air alone, and above that is an added 
hydrogen port. A poppet-type hydrogen valve opened and closed by 
the cam shaft is located in the flow of a hydrogen port opening 
on the wall of the working chamber for the intake stroke. As 
shown in Figure 18, hydrogen is injected into the working 
chamber for the compression stroke for an interval of 
approximately 90 degrees (main shaft angle) starting immediately 
after the end of air intake through the air port. In the left 
drawing of Figure 17, air is being drawn into the working 
chamber during the intake stroke, and the hydrogen valve is 
still closed. The right drawing depicts a point during the 
compression stroke at which the air port has closed, the 
hydrogen port opens, and hydrogen is being injected from the 
hydrogen port towards the air in the working chamber. The 
pressure of the injected hydrogen is 1.0 MPa or less. 
  To discern the effect of the direct injection system, we 
jointly studied a premix system supplying hydrogen to an intake 
manifold.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-28B>             Figure 18. Timing of Air and Hydrogen Supply </FIG>




  4.3 Volumetric Efficiency 
  Figure 19 shows a comparison of a direct injection system 
and 
a premix system through the relationship between excess air 
ratio (&lgr;) and volumetric efficiency. 
  In the direct injection system, only air is input naturally 
from the intake port, while in the premix system, an air and 
hydrogen mixture is input naturally. The volumetric efficiency 
in both is roughly equivalent. The slightly lower air quantity 
in the direct injection system is ascribed to the effect of 
residual hydrogen in the channel from the hydrogen valve to the 
hydrogen port which is carried in during the intake stroke. When 
volumetric efficiency for hydrogen-air mixtures are compared, 
the difference between the direct injection system and the 
premix system grows with the richness of the mixture, and the 
direct injection system is approximately 20&percnt; greater at 
the 
theoretical air/fuel ratio. Thus we see that conversion to 
direct injection more strongly affects the premature ignition 
and abnormal combustion-determined operating threshold in 
hydrogen RE, where this limit extends to richness close to the 
theoretical air/fuel ratio. 
  Figure 20 shows volumetric efficiency for an air-hydrogen 
mixture versus engine speed under full loading. Conversion to 
direct injection increases volumetric efficiency 20-30&percnt; 
at all 
speeds. The volumetric efficiency of a hydrogen-containing 
mixture in a direct injection engine thus exceeds 100&percnt; at 
2,000 
rpm and above.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-29B>             Figure 20. Volumetric Efficiency vs. Engine Revolution </FIG>




  4.4 Heat Efficiency 
  Figure 21 shows changes in net heat efficiency versus excess 
air ratio (&lgr;) during wide open operation at 2,000 rpm. 
Compared to the premix system, the net heat efficiency of the 
direct injection system is seen to deteriorate roughly 2&percnt; 
in 
the lean region near &lgr;=2, and approximately 1&percnt; near 
&lgr;=1. 
These results are thought to show deteriorating combustion due 
to conversion to direct injection. To compare practical heat 
efficiency, Figure 22 shows changes in net heat efficiency 
versus net mean effective pressure. The direct injection system 
is somewhat worse than the premix system under low loading, but 
conversely better under high loading. The reason is that the 
direct injection system, with its high volumetric efficiency for 
air, operates leaner than the premix system under an identical 
load. We therefore feel that the decline in heat efficiency due 
to richness becomes a benefit in the large range of high loading.

  4.5 Output Performance 
  (1) Excess Air Ratio Characteristics 
  Figure 23 shows changes in net mean effective pressure 
versus 
excess air ratio (&lgr;) during wide open operation at 2,000 rpm. 
Net mean effective pressure peaks near &lgr;=1 for the premix 
system and near &lgr;=0.8 for the direct injection system. The 
excess air ratio (&lgr;) at which net mean effective pressure 
peaks is thought to be affected mainly by volumetric efficiency, 
air utilization, and thermal dissociation. In a premix system, 
as shown in Figure 19, a decline in net mean effective pressure 
at &lgr;&lt;1 is thought to result from a reduction in the 
volumetric efficiency of air. Since there is no decline in the 
volumetric efficiency of air at &lgr;&lt;1 in a direct injection 
system, we felt that a rich mixture benefiting thermal 
dissociation and air utilization would obtain peak values. In 
results, we obtained a 28&percnt; higher output with the direct 
injection system than the premix system at &lgr;=1, and 
35&percnt; 
higher at &lgr;=0.8. In conversion to direct injection under 
these 
conditions, there was likewise no occurrence of abnormal 
combustion such as backfire and premature ignition, problematic 
in hydrogen combustion in recipro engines.

  (2) Revolution Speed Characteristics 
  Figure 24 shows the relationship of net mean effective 
pressure to engine revolution speed during wide open operation 
at the theoretical air/fuel ratio. As shown in Figure 20 on the 
previous page, the volumetric efficiency of the entire mixture 
in a direct injection system was highest, exceeding 100&percnt; 
at 
revolution speeds of 2,000 rpm and above and approaching 
120&percnt; 
at 6,000 rpm. This indicates that in engines adopting a fuel of 
a low density gas akin to hydrogen, conversion to direct fuel 
injection has an output-improving effect akin to that of 
supercharged systems using turbochargers, etc. That supercharge 
status is not achieved at 1,000 rpm is laid principally to the 
fact that air port timing in this engine is designed for high 
revolutions, and not enough air is taken in at low revolution 
ranges to achieve supercharging. Thus supercharging may be made 
possible at all revolution ranges if a variable timing air port 
is subsequently developed and incorporates timing matched to low 
revolution ranges. 
  The above-discussed studies showed that volumetric 
efficiency 
is increased by conversion to direct injection, and as shown by 
net mean effective pressure in Figure 24, that wide open output 
is greatly improved. As a result, the 63&percnt; output of a 
hydrogen 
RE with a premix system, as compared to gasoline specifications, 
was improved to 87&percnt; by a direct injection system, as 
shown in 
Figure 25.

  4.6 Exhaust Gas Characteristics 
  We ascertained that HC, CO, and CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  produced by 
the combustion of lubricating oil carried into combustion 
chambers is a nearly constant, extremely low level of 1/100 or 
less that of gasoline engines regardless of the excess air ratio 
(&lgr;). Since a similar, dramatic reduction in CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  in 
particular is impossible as long as gasoline or other fossil 
fuels are used, this is one of the most valuable benefits of 
hydrogen engines. 
  Conversely, characteristics similar to those with gasoline 
engines were revealed for NOx, with an exhaust peak exhibited 
near &lgr;=1 and sharp reductions on the lean and rich sides, as 
shown in Figure 26. On the lean side, favorable for heat 
efficiency, NOx decline to a near zero level soon after an 
excess air ratio (&lgr;) of 1.6 is exceeded. In typical gasoline 
engines, a practical operating threshold at these regions due to 
unstable ignition and combustion, torque variation, and rapid 
increase in HC and CO exhaust makes operation in lean regions of 
very low NOx problematic. With hydrogen RE, however, there is no 
risk whatsoever of increased HC and CO exhaust even in operation 
at very lean regions, and the experiments described below 
revealed that stable combustion can be maintained. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-31A>             Figure 26. NOx Exhaust Characteristics </FIG>




  The relationship between the excess air ratio (&lgr;) and 
combustion fluctuation rate was determined and the combustion 
stability of a hydrogen RE evaluated under operating conditions 
of 1,500 rpm and Pe=0.1 MPa. Combustion fluctuation 
rates were determined through calculation by equation (1) using 
pressure data measured within combustion chambers. 
  CFR=&sgr;Pmax/PmaxM (1) 
  CFR: combustion fluctuation rate 
  &lt;sup&gt; &sgr;&lt;/sup&gt; max: standard deviation of Pmax 
(350 cycles) 
  PmaxM: mean of Pmax (350 
cycles) 
  As shown in Figure 27, the combustion fluctuation ratio 
increases slightly as the excess air ratio (&lgr;) grows, there 
is 
no sudden deterioration as in a gasoline engine, and 
commercially viable levels are achieved in a range of excess air 
ratio 1.6 through 5.0. We believe that such ignition and 
combustion stability in lean regions results from the fact that 
hydrogen ignites very easily and burns quickly, as shown in 
Table 1, Basic Properties of Hydrogen. Consequently, vehicles 
equipped with hydrogen RE allow lean combustion with an excess 
air ratio (&lgr;) of 1.6 or more over a broad operational range. 
  Results of the above studies indicate that HC, CO and NOx 
emissions may all be expected to reach very low levels in the 
emissions of hydrogen RE-equipped vehicles. 
  Figure 28 shows a comparison of NOx exhaust characteristics 
in a premix and a direct injection system. Peak NOx values were 
approximately 30&percnt; higher for the premix system, but NOx 
exhaust 
was somewhat greater for the direct injection system on the lean 
side and the rich side, where exhaust quantity was minimal. We 
believe that this narrowing of differences in NOx exhaust 
quantity versus excess air ratio (&lgr;) after conversion to 
direct injection results from increased non-uniformity of the 
excess air ratio within combustion chambers due to incomplete 
mixing.

<H5>    5. Conclusion </H5>
  Here we summarize the benefits held by RE when hydrogen is 
adopted as an automobile fuel. 
  (1) RE have a structure suited to hydrogen combustion and 
allow prevention of abnormal combustion through the mere use of 
spark plugs with a high heating value for operation at the 
theoretical air/fuel ratio. 
  (2) Wide open output can be increased 20-30&percnt; by 
conversion 
to direct hydrogen injection. A direct injection system hydrogen 
RE can thereby provide approximately 90&percnt; of gasoline RE 
output. 
  (3) HC CO, and CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  quantities in hydrogen RE 
emissions are all extremely small. NOx are also minute in lean 
combustion, and automobiles with quite minimal exhaust can be 
produced through fine control of the air/fuel ratio during 
operation. 
  The results of our investigations have shown that fine fuel 
control, methods for mixing hydrogen and air, and other 
unrealized improvements to gas fuel for hydrogen RE hold 
adequate performance for automobile engines supporting a 
hydrogen-using society of the 21st century.
