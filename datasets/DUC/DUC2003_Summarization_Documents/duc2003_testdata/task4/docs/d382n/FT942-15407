They have been used in space travel and on the moon, in submarines and small
power stations. Invented more than 150 years ago, they have recently been
heralded as an answer to some of the world's most severe environmental
problems and as the power-generating technology of the future.
So why have fuel cells - which produce electricity without serious pollution
of the atmosphere - remained mostly in the laboratory and failed to make any
impact on the commercial market? The answer lies not so much in the
technology itself as in the cost of the process and the cumbersome nature of
the equipment needed.
Yet this week, in its austere white research headquarters near Ulm in south
Germany, Daimler-Benz demonstrated that it was well on the way to solving
these problems. Germany's largest industrial concern showed off a white van
packed full of pipes, valves and cables and with a big yellow cylinder for
the hydrogen used to produce energy by reacting with oxygen from the air.
Daimler-Benz's chairman, Edzard Reuter, keen to show that the industrial
group's expensive diversification into electronics, aerospace and other
non-motor sectors was producing results, spoke enthusiastically of a
'milestone on the road to ecological mobility'. Hartmut Weule, research and
technology director, said: 'We are at the very beginning of a new phase of
technology, comparable with the days when Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz
were constructing their first vehicles powered by internal combustion
engines.'
But Weule was careful not to get carried away by this grand historical
analogy. Much work remained to be done before fuel cell vehicles could be
brought to the series production stage, he said. Daimler was also working to
perfect further the internal combustion and diesel engines on which the
fortunes of its Mercedes-Benz car and truck subsidiary still depend.
Weule left no doubt, however, of Daimler's determination to succeed in the
technology of fuel cells, in which the group says it is ahead of automotive
rivals such as General Motors of the US and Mazda of Japan. 'We do not
intend to wait until our Japanese or American competitors gain the upper
hand in technology,' he said. Already, the group - including AEG
(electronics and energy generation), Dornier (aerospace and materials) and
Deutsche Aerospace - has spent more than DM100m (Pounds 40m) on research
into fuel cell technology.
The electric transporter van, shown off for the first time in Ulm on
Wednesday, certainly does not look revolutionary. Inside, though, it
contains the elements of a technological advance which enables Daimler to
claim that it is the first motor company in Europe, and probably the world,
to develop a fully working vehicle powered by fuel cells. Called Necar (new
electric car), it has a more efficient propulsion system than any other type
used in the industry while producing no harmful exhaust gases and far less
carbon dioxide than emitted by conventional engines.
The energy conversion efficiency achieved by Daimler is up to 30 per cent
compared with up to 20 per cent in internal combustion engines. Fuel cells,
which work at low temperatures and do not rely on the burning of fossil
fuels, produce no oxides of nitrogen or sulphur (the causes of acid rain),
need no batteries which would have to be recharged or recycled and can
obtain hydrogen from such different fuels as natural gas, methanol, biomass
gas, methane and other gases.
With all these advantages, it is not surprising that research into fuel
cells is taken seriously in the US and Japan, both of which have costly
national programmes aimed at making the technology viable for transport and
power generation.
A German project group, including Daimler, Siemens, the electrical and
electronics group, the chemical industry and the federal research ministry,
has just been set up to keep the country in the forefront of fuel cell
developments. Weule would also like to see greater interest at European
Union level - 'they should be more active in Brussels'.
To develop its fuel cell-powered vehicle, Daimler went into partnership with
Ballard Power Systems, a Canadian specialist in this technology. Ballard has
installed fuel cells in a bus in Vancouver and is working to extend its
range and reduce its weight. Firoz Rasul, Ballard's president, is in no
doubt that Daimler has taken fuel cell technology a considerable way towards
commercial viability, despite the remaining problems. 'This demonstration
shows that it's here, it's real and the trick is to get the cost down.'
Cost and weight are the big hurdles still to be overcome. Weule reckons the
present cost of some DM10,000 for each kW of electricity needs to come down
by a factor of at least 50, to around DM200 or less, before fuel cells can
be installed in vehicles for private customers. This could take 10 or 20
years. Rasul, speaking from close knowledge of California's tough new
pollution laws, which stipulate 10 per cent of cars should be zero-emission
producing in 2003, is more optimistic. 'I would say less than 10 years.'
Rasul believes industry and governments are now waking up to fuel cells'
potential. 'The market is pushing it now and there is a new interest from
the auto players.' Ballard's contribution to the Daimler vehicle was the
proton exchange membrane fuel cell, a thin polymer foil coated with a
catalyst material containing platinum; this encourages hydrogen to ionise
and react with oxygen to produce the electricity.
Weule says Daimler's electric vehicle will in future use widely available
methanol to obtain the hydrogen instead of a pressurised gas cylinder. In a
few years' time, Daimler aims to develop a fuel cell drive system far
smaller than that in its Necar. Success would be a further step towards
fulfilling Weule's belief that fuel cells will be 'the propulsion technology
of the next century'.
