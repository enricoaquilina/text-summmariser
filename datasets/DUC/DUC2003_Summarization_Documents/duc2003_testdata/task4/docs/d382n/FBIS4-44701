  [Text] Daimler-Benz is looking for an alternative form of 
energy for the automobile. At its research center in Ulm, the 
company yesterday presented a vehicle with an electric motor 
which gets its energy from a fuel cell. 
  Speaking at the company's research center in Ulm, the 
Chairman, Edzard Reuter, stated that Daimler-Benz AG was well in 
front of the international field with the car driven by a fuel 
cell instead of a petrol or diesel engine. The prototype 
vehicle has already done 2,000 km without any problems. The 
task now is to reduce the size and weight of the fuel cell by 
using new materials and technology, and to develop the system at 
a marketable price. Research Chief, Prof. Hartmut Weule, is 
confident that this can be done within a period of 20 to 30 
years. 
  In addition, Daimler-Benz is continuing the development of 
electric vehicles with the Zebra battery, a high-performance 
battery with sodium and nickel chloride. This is one of several 
possible solutions developed by the Daimler subsidiary AEG. 
  Daimler-Benz runs the fuel cell with methanol from which the 
hydrogen is obtained in the vehicle. Methanol is produced from 
natural gas and is a widely available chemical substance. A 
vehicle could fill up in the normal way from a pump at service 
stations. The vehicle's range with one tankful matches that of 
today's vehicles. The advantage of the fuel cell is the greater 
efficiency of 30 percent compared with 17 to 20 percent of 
conventional car engines. 
  Hydrogen is generated in the automobile by means of an 
ion-permeable-polymer electrolyte membrane. The car travels 
with virtually no harmful exhaust gases, since no nitrogen oxide 
is produced during cold combustion. The only exhaust gas is 
water vapor. Consequently, the car already complies with the 
Californian zero emission requirement. Moreover, only half the 
amount of carbon monoxide is produced. This alternative form of 
power is a joint achievement of Dasa and AEG, who developed the 
project jointly with Daimler's automotive engineering division. 
Daimler is cooperating with the Canadian company Ballard Power 
Systems on the development of fuel cells. According to Reuter, 
"We have gained an important lead with synergistic effects 
within the company and in international cooperation." Daimler 
has invested hundreds of millions so far. The technology costs 
15,000 German marks per kilowatt of output. 
  Weule thinks there will be numerous potential applications 
for the fuel cell in the future. It could power railways and 
ships, provide satellites with electricity, or provide hospitals 
with an emergency power supply. 
  At present, there are five competing technologies: 
  -- Proton-conducting fuel cells operate at [a temperature 
ranging] between 20Î and 100ÎC, and require hydrogen, 
which Daimler obtains from methanol; 
  -- Alkaline fuel cells have the greatest efficiency but 
require pure hydrogen and oxygen; 
  -- Phosphoric acid fuel cells operate with phosphoric acid 
at 
200ÎC and are suitable as decentralized combined heat and 
power plants; 
  -- Fused carbonate fuel cells requiring temperatures of 
650ÎC, are also suitable for coal gas and are likely to come 
on the market in a few years' time; 
  -- Solid oxide fuel cells are particularly efficient at 
1,000ÎC but the high temperatures cause problems. 
  Daimler-Benz is going for the proton-conducting system. The 
present unit still weighs 800 kg and fills the cargo space of a 
delivery van. There will be a second version by 1996 which, at 
one eighth of the size and weighing only 200 kg, will also fit 
into a passenger car. 
<H5>  How Fuel Cells Work </H5>
  Fuel cells convert combustible liquids or gases directly to 
electricity by electrochemical means with a relatively high 
efficiency of up to 60 percent. The reaction takes place via 
hydrogen and oxygen to water. The fuel cell is made of an anode 
and cathode which are separated by an electron-impermeable 
electrolyte or a membrane. Pure hydrogen or a 
hydrogen-containing gas is passed to the anode where the 
hydrogen molecules are split into ions, and electrons are 
liberated. These flow via an external conductor to the cathode. 
At the same time, oxygen from the air is supplied to the 
cathode. The oxygen takes up electrons and the oxygen ions 
combine with the hydrogen ions to form water. 
  The hydrogen in the technology presented in Ulm is separated 
from methyl alcohol. The fuel cells operate silently and 
without vibrations, and do not develop any environmental 
pollutants. Various types of fuel cells are being developed all 
over the world, and some are now undergoing practical tests. 
Buses powered by phosphoric acid fuel cells are already 
operational in Vancouver (Canada). Fuel cells do not only 
provide power for electric cars, however: If designed on a 
larger scale, they provide an alternative to conventional power 
stations. Due to their compact, modular design, their output 
ranges from 50 kW to several megawatts.
