Does getting wet, cold and generally miserable in the countryside help you
to become a better manager? Supporters of outward bound courses believe it
does, but critics question the value of having highly-paid and specialised
executives tramping around the woods honing boy scout-level skills.
Is outdoor training not just a way of keeping ageing physical exercise
teachers, sadistic ex-corporals and overpaid consultants employed? And is it
just an expensive fad in training, no better or worse than classroom
teaching?
Cynics demand proof of success in the form of a cost-benefit formula.
Finding none, or at least nothing that satisfies them, they reject the
notion of outdoor training altogether.
Some sceptics argue that the more realistic the training in terms of what,
where and how you learn skills, the more effective it is. And because
outdoor training is hardly a simulation of business life, it cannot really
work.
So what is the philosophy of outdoor training? Essentially there are three
good arguments:
Experimental versus theoretical learning. Since the 1960s, when encounter
groups thrived, trainers have claimed that real learning occurs when people
are put in difficult, novel and problematic situations and not when they
study elaborate theories or abstract ideas.
In trainer jargon, 'unfreezing' needs to take place before people really
learn about themselves and others.
The philosophy of outdoor training is that people learn most about
themselves, their teams, and their limitations, by 'doing'.
'No gain without the pain' is the catchphrase, and the pain is not the cold,
damp and discomfort but dealing with performance issues in an unfamiliar
setting.
Emotions not ideas. Most training courses are about ideas, concepts, skills
and models. They involve brain work and traditional classroom activities.
But outdoor trainers claim that modern management is as much about
self-confidence and courage.
Most training, they point out, aims at the head but not the heart, whereas
outdoor training is unashamedly about emotional learning.
Anyone who has been on an outdoor training course will tell you immediately
about the emotions they experience: from blind fear to anger and fury; from
depression and self-doubt to tension-releasing humour.
An important aim of outdoor training is to teach people that when pushed to
the limit of their ability, they can call on extra reserves of commitment.
The great Victorian virtues of self-reliance, fortitude, even stoicism, can
be, and need to be, learned if you are to be a successful manager.
This does not take place with the cold learning experience of the classroom
but in the stressful experience of physical discomfort or even danger.
Team membership not leadership. There are plenty of leadership courses but
not too many for those who have to follow. Despite mouthing platitudes about
teams and team work, Anglo-Americans come from an individualistic, not a
collective, culture. Team work does not come easily or naturally.
But learning to sail a yacht in choppy seas or to cross a gorge using a
pulley, sling and ropes requires real co-operation. Teams engaged in
difficult physical tasks need to be inter-dependent: you need your
colleagues and they need you. You cannot survive on your own.
Managers also need to learn how to be effective members of a team but this
is rarely learned in the classroom, making paper models or being
video-taped.
Of course, not all outdoor training provides all the benefits. And certainly
outdoor training is not always appropriate. Indeed, it can backfire in
unusual ways.
Rather than gaining self-confidence, some people can experience nothing but
self-doubt. They can return broken, not built-up. Others, discovering
new-found strengths and abilities, pack up their briefcases and go to other
organisations believing they can improve their career prospects.
The problem lies in measuring the effectiveness of training. How can one
show conclusively that the time and money spent on outdoor courses is well
spent?
That is a fiendishly difficult question because although one can easily
think of many possible measures, nearly all have problems.
But more importantly, perhaps, any training is unlikely to succeed if the
organisation is not prepared to allow employees to apply in everyday
practice the lessons they have learned.
For example, if a risk-averse organisation sends managers who it has
rewarded for their caution and prudence on a course designed to make them
more adventuresome and then punishes them for the very behaviour they learn,
it is no wonder the course is seen as a waste of time.
Outdoor training is, however, neither a panacea nor a total waste of time.
If, as a company, you know what you want and what a good course can offer,
you may be able to provide for your employees an enriching, even invaluable
experience.
A bad course with no planned outcomes may result in increased employee
cynicism, let alone colds, scratches and occasionally very badly bruised
egos.
It should not be dismissed as nonsense nor embraced as the only solution.
Chosen judiciously, and run well, outdoor training can provide a unique
learning experience.
