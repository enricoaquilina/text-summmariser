FERNGULLY: THE LAST RAINFOREST (U) Odeon West End
THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE (PG) Barbican
MASALA (18) Metro, Edinburgh Film Festival
LIFE IS becoming so confused and congested in the modern rain forest, at
least according to the modern movie, that I suggest the publication of a
special Yellow Pages telephone book. This would allow our fingers to do the
walking as we search out, say, M for mad biologist (Sean Connery in Medicine
Man), P for priest in crisis (John Lithgow in At Play In The Fields Of The
Lord), L for lost boy gone native (The Emerald Forest) or in the new
animated feature FernGully: The Last Rainforest, F for fairy, T for tree
spirit and U for unidentifiable slithery things.
The film is a trades fair of rain-forest archetypes and stereotypes. It
strengthens the Andrews Theory that the next big movie genre will be films
about people trying to escape the overcrowded jungle to find peace in the
inner cities. FernGully is presented as a last, lost haven of Disneyish
greenery, where trees grow to 500 ft, rain-drops sparkle prismatically on
each leaf, lizards sing, pixies dance and insects ride aerial surfboards.
Only - yes - the roar of the not-too-distant bulldozer threatens the perfect
serenity of this teeming Eden.
If it is destroyed, what will happen to the world's oxygen? How many million
rare species will be wiped out? Will we lose our chance to cure cancer? Has
humanity any chance of surviving into the next fashionable Doomsday
scenario?
Directed by Bill Croyer and scripted by Jim Cox from the FernGully stories
of Diana Young (unfamiliar to me), the film is far merrier than these hints
of rhetorical self-importance suggest. Chief thanks go to Robin Williams,
who voices Batty the bat. Williams suggests that 20th century comic despair
has already pierced and pixillated the jungle. Wearing a crumpled radar
antenna and wilting smile, he wisecracks his way from tree to tree,
occasionally missing his branch and frequently missing the propagandist
points made by the eco-conscious fairy heroine in her no doubt
bio-degradable bikini; not to mention, but if we must, her wise old teacher
Magi Lune.
But even without Williams, the environmentalist cliches are prettily clad in
botanical baroque. The demon-king roarings of the bulldozer, doubly
amplified after it has been hijacked by the evil tree spirit (hiss]), set
the eco-pantomimic tone, and the non-stop scenic transformations complete
the picture. Never mind the more brutish aspects of jungle life: no creature
actually eats any other in this fragrant vegetarian Arcady. Just swoon at
the canopied richness of the trees, the trilling of the waterfalls and the
sunlight's golden spears showering down into a world that, far from being
endangered, never existed outside the cinema in the first place.
* * * Luis Bunuel's The Discreet Charm Of the Bourgeoisie, his gloriously
envenomed 1972 comedy (revived as part of the Barbican's Bunuel season), is
also about endangered life forms. But the fauna in this fable about survival
are busy designing and then defying their own historical auto-destruct
devices. The six characters in search of a square meal are a group of
guilt-edged gourmet friends - a drug-trafficking ambassador (Fernando Rey),
his elegantly corrupt cronies (Paul Frankeur, Jean-Pierre Cassel) and their
chic consorts (Stephane Audran, Bulle Ogier, Delphine Seyrig) - who spend
the film processing from one eating appointment to the next, unable to start
or complete their repasts. A dead body in a restaurant; army manoeuvres in a
host's garden; a dining-room turns out to be a stage set . . .
At some point the six are joined by a seventh: a worker-bishop (Julien
Bertheau) who goes unrecognised and insulted whenever he swaps his robes for
a gardener's overalls. The film is all about ceremony and expectation and
the imbecility of allowing ourselves to be fooled or programmed by either.
Every time a new carpet is laid under the filmgoer's feet, it is whipped
away. Scenes reveal themselves as dreams; a complete stranger accosts the
three women at a cafe to tell his life story; terrorists burst through the
windows of Cassel's villa to ruin the gigot d'agneau course.
Imperturbably, the sextet pursue their next and then their next epicurean
sit-downs. The film's only fault, as it polishes each comic image to a
gleam, is that rather than condemning the rascally sextet we identify with
their gracious pursuit of the simple-turned-impossible. Was stoicism ever
funnier and more winning? Was eating ever lent so Homeric, so hieratic a
resonance?
* * * Srinivas Krishna's Masala is something inedible from Canada. Did you
know that there was a thriving Indian community in Toronto? Well, you do
now. And Masala might have been a Canadian My Beautiful Laundrette. Instead
it is more like two hours of watching undersize story ideas spin around in a
greyish lather. The young hero, played by the writer-director, has girl
trouble, uncle trouble (Saeed Jaffrey in one of three roles),
religious-fantasy trouble (Saeed Jaffrey as the god Krishna), priceless
stamp trouble (Saeed Jaffrey as another, philatelic uncle) and mad grandma
trouble (not Saeed Jaffrey).
The battle between youthful Westernised energy and domineering Eastern
culture should have carried and harmonised the story. But the film, a chaos
of themes and styles unyoked by any inner authorial voice, only proves the
old Hindu proverb that fools rushdie in where angels fear to tread.
* * * Never mind east versus west: if you are a southerner coping with
celluloid deprivation in or near London you may wish to flee north. The
Edinburgh Film Festival begins at the end of next week and shows that a city
dubbed the Athens of the North can also pass itself off as the Cannes or
Berlin of those climes.
Though under new management, with Penny Thompson succeeding David Robinson,
this year's EFF combines the traditional choice pickings from the year's
European festivals with the best of British and American cinema. Istvan
Szabo, Hans-Jurgen Syberberg, John Boorman, Michael Apted, Hal Hartley;
feted new actor-directors Tim Robbins and John Turturro; and older
luminaries landing in Auld Reekie to give masterclasses. These include
director-cameraman Freddie Francis (Glory, Cape Fear) and that living legend
of the low-budgeters Samuel Fuller (Run Of The Arrow, Pickup On South
Street, The Big Red One). Fuller, who at age 80 is now cinema's answer to
the Ancient Mariner, will be holding forth to festivalgoers and TV cameras
on August 22. Before that, on Saturday, he talks cigar-wavingly to me and
the Weekend FT.
If you want to mark your cards for specific films at Edinburgh, here are my
top five. Tim Robbins's Altmanesque political satire Bob Roberts; John
Turturro's autobiographical Mac, which won the Camera d'Or for best first
feature at Cannes; Jean-Claude Lauzon's likewise autobiographical and very
funny Leolo; Leos Carax's bizarre Parisian romance Les Amants Du Pont Neuf;
and Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, starring Harvey Keitel in a barking,
blazing, B-movie-style thriller that even Mr Fuller might be proud of.
