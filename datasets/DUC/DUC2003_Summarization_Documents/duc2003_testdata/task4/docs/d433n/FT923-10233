power - Tradition of stoicism cushioned West Yorkshire from recession

LEEDS, Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield, Dewsbury and Wakefield are the
cities and towns of West Yorkshire, a county of deceptive power. This is
where the brass is made, or money as it is called elsewhere. The figures
prove it.
With 40 per cent of the 5m population of Yorkshire and Humberside, West
Yorkshire contributes 43 per cent of the region's gross domestic product of
about Pounds 34bn, itself about 8 per cent of the UK's total.
The county is deceptive in that it never seems this powerful. Topography and
geography are the reasons. The communities are scattered in dales, separated
by Pennine mountains and hills that have never allowed their coalescence
into a large conurbation, as has been the case with Greater Manchester, West
Yorkshire's bigger neighbour.
Yet the two counties, straddling the Pennines and joined by the spinal M62,
are the twin main engines of the northern economy. The war of the roses -
red against white - is mainly between these two nowadays. West Yorkshire may
be 20 per cent smaller - perhaps because its communities never coalesced -
but it is the giant of the east Pennine region and underpins the Yorkshire
and Humberside economy.
South Yorkshire accounts for 23 per cent of regional GDP, Humberside for 19
per cent and North Yorkshire for only 15 per cent. West Yorkshire dominates
and provides the regional capital in Leeds, a city of 750,000 people showing
little sign of serious population decline. Its full range of financial and
professional services now competes nationally.
The region has more than 120 quoted companies, nearly two-thirds of them in
West Yorkshire. In Leeds alone, there are 14,000 businesses - about one for
every 50 people. Industry and commerce in the county as a whole is spread
through a wide range of sectors, such as engineering, textiles,
construction, retail, chemicals, electricals, food and miscellaneous
industrials.
It also houses Britain's most powerful concentration of building societies.
The Halifax, the Bradford and Bingley, the Leeds and Leeds Permanent are not
so named by accident, but after their places of birth.
Recession is not absent from West Yorkshire, but it arrived late and has had
nothing like the impact it had in 1980 - 82. 'I still have plenty of clients
who ask, 'What recession?',' says Mr Peter Bancroft of the Leeds office of
Haines Watts, the national accountancy firm specialising in small and
medium-sized unquoted businesses.
Variety, spread, diversity - and a relatively small service sector when
compared with the south-east - cushioned the economy, says Mr John Siddall,
Leeds' economic development officer.
Not everything has survived. Mr Siddall says Leeds' clothing manufacturers
are 'evaporating', but he points to Leeds having the lowest unemployment
rate - 9 per cent - of any city in the UK.
Lessons have been learned since 1982. Companies knew not to overborrow, but
to build cash reserves and spread their customer base. Mr Peter
Coles-Johnson, chief executive of Leeds chamber of commerce, says the region
accounts for a disproportionately high 11 per cent of UK exports. Practiced
West Yorkshire companies chased sales abroad as soon as southern English
markets started to falter.
There is also considerable intra-regional trading, says Mr Ken Denton of the
Huddersfield-based Kirklees and Wakefield chamber. He says there is also a
tradition of stoicism among older companies, whose owner-managers never
spend to the limit of their corporate income, or borrow heavily against it,
and save profits from good times to tide them over the bad.
This is seen locally as prudence, however much it was criticised as
unadventurous by some London analysts when the national economy was booming.
West Yorkshire also has something else on its side - location. It is at the
nexus of the M62, M1 and A1, and is only 50 minutes from Hull. Nowhere has
this advantage been better exploited than by Wakefield, the metropolitan
borough through which all three roads pass. This is now one of the most
attractive places for high value-added manufacturing and distributive
industries.
Wakefield suffered from pit closures in the 1980s and still has a residue of
unemployment from them, but the most recent job losses - about 300 at Asda -
are more the result of that company's reorganisation than national economic
factors.
In any event, Procter &amp; Gamble is bringing in 350 new jobs in the autumn,
relocating its Cover Girl cosmetics business from Bournemouth. This is not
even unusual: Mr Richard Fung, principal inward investment officer, says
Wakefield has won 50 large investments in the past four years.
The biggest were a Pounds 50m Coca Cola canning factory and a Pounds 20m
plant built by Pioneer to allow the Japanese consumer electronics company to
attack European markets. Two big inquiries - each involving 400,000 sq ft
factories are nearing completion. They will join such businesses as Netto,
Superdrug and Safeway. Del Monte's presence is a large banana ripening
centre.
The borough council also expects Wakefield to house the region's 20-acre
Channel Tunnel terminal, a joint venture with Amec and Railfreight
Distribution, offering rail-road flexibility on a 400-acre site called Port
Wakefield on the M62 between the M1 and A1.
Apart from some relatively minor steel and coal closure money from the EC,
Wakefield has achieved all this with no help from the public purse.
There are some parts of West Yorkshire that need such support, however.
Leeds' inner city has the most pressing case, although the city's image of
general prosperity has prevented its getting all it needs.
Mr Martin Eagland, chief executive of Leeds Development Corporation, a
government agency, says the organisation is now constantly short of funds
because the scale of the job it had to do was initially underestimated.
'The estimation was when the market was in a much more confident state,' he
says. The view was that Leeds would not need so much, but infrastructure
improvements, such as basic drainage on some sites at Pounds 1m a time, were
not foreseen at all. Mr Eagland only needs Pounds 10m a year to operate as
effectively he would like, but has to make to do on Pounds 8m.
Generally, Leeds gets only two-thirds of the level of funding of comparable
urban development corporations in Sheffield or Manchester - Pounds 65m over
its lifetime against about Pounds 100m for the other cities. It has given
good value, levering Pounds 4 from the private sector for every Pounds 1
from the taxpayer and creating 6,000 jobs.
Leeds' great coup - with Mr Eagland and Mr Siddall both active - has been
the capture of the Royal Armouries from the Tower of London. They will move
to a purpose-built museum in 1995 in the heart of the city, but Mr Eagland
worries lest his underfunding prevents the right incentives attracting
associated developments.
Mr Jon Trickett, leader of Leeds City Council, says West Yorkshire's general
prosperity should not be allowed to mask the problems of an emergent, inner
city underclass. 'We have new tower cranes going up, but I fear the emotions
building up in the inner city. People need jobs, but they can't get them
without training. And of course they need better housing.'
Leeds failed to get City Challenge urban funding because it did not involve
the inner city community closely enough in its bid.
Mr Trickett says: 'We genuinely feared what might happen if we failed and
they felt let down. They are surrounded by success and affluence. It could
well have sparked off something.'
