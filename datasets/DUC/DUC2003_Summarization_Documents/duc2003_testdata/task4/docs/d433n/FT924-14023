THREE US vice-presidential candidates will take to the stage in Atlanta
tonight set on besting each other in political debate and, above all,
avoiding any disastrous gaffes, writes George Graham in Washington.
It is safe to predict the most surprising candidate will be Mr James
Stockdale, the retired admiral running alongside Texas independent Mr Ross
Perot, because voters know almost nothing about him.
But the stakes are higher for Vice-President Dan Quayle and Senator Al Gore,
the Republican and Democratic candidates. Both men know their ability to
help their respective running mates - President George Bush and Governor
Bill Clinton - is less than their ability to hurt them.
Tonight's debate is particularly important for Mr Quayle, who has not yet
managed to live down the unfavourable impression he made in his first
national campaign in 1988.
Mr Quayle says he has gained experience during his four years as
vice-president, but complains he is unfairly treated by reporters. 'It's the
inability for us to get any kind of fair shake from the media that's been
the most frustrating thing about this campaign,' he told the New York Times.
Ironically, the vice-president stands to benefit from tonight's debate, as
few viewers will expect a stellar performance. With a modicum of good luck
Mr Quayle should be able to erase the memory of Senator Lloyd Bentsen's
put-down in the 1988 vice-presidential debate after he injudiciously
compared himself to President John Kennedy.
Yet Mr Quayle can be certain that any minor misstatement will be pounced on
as further evidence of an inability to remove his foot from his mouth.
On the Democratic side, Mr Gore has so impressed most spectators with his
intelligence, his command of detail and his unflappability that he will be
hard pressed to match expectation.
But, like Mr Clinton in Sunday's debate, Mr Gore need do no more than hold
his own.
For Mr Stockdale the debate offers a baptism of fire in policy questions -
ranging from health insurance to the spotted owl. An academic at the Hoover
Institution, a conservative think-tank in California, he holds the
distinction of being possibly the first man in the last half century to have
introduced the Greek Stoic philosopher Epictetus into American political
discourse.
His principal topic of public conversation, besides the Stoics, has so far
been his experience as the most senior US prisoner of war in Vietnam.
Few analysts expect Mr Stockdale to match his running mate's brand of humour
and colourful phrasing, but he may do better on the details of the Perot
platform. He says he has read the 117-page policy document, entitled 'United
We Stand,' 10 times; this is widely believed to be 10 times more than Mr
Perot himself.
