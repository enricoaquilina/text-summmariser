BRITAIN and the European Commission have 'not yet found common ground' on
the vexed political issue of lifting the UK's border controls on people,
according to Mr Martin Bangemann, EC internal market commissioner.
Mr Bangemann said yesterday the nine continental European members of the
Schengen free travel zone were unhappy with a compromise which would allow
EC visitors to Britain simply to wave their passports at immigration control
after January 1 1993.
After meeting Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British home secretary, in September,
Mr Bangemann was widely understood to have agreed British compromise
proposals.
But in an interview with the Financial Times yesterday, the commissioner
said he had been misinterpreted and discussions were continuing. 'What I'm
interested in is having a practical situation at the borders which shows
(member states) are taking on board what we believe is essential, and that
is: no regular controls at internal borders.'
He believes the Commission position has a strong foundation in EC law,
although he said yesterday he did not want a legal dispute with member
states on the issue.
Britain disagrees with the Commission's legal interpretation and has always
argued that controls are essential if non-EC travellers are to be properly
monitored.
British officials yesterday agreed that the question of how to resolve the
dispute was still open. Mr Bangemann hopes to continue discussions with Mr
Clarke when EC immigration ministers meet in London at the end of this
month. 'What I need is a declaration that these regular controls will not be
exercised (after January 1 1993) and a practical situation demonstrating
willingness not to exercise them,' he said yesterday.
Britain is not alone in its reluctance to lift border controls on people.
Denmark and Ireland also have specific problems, and even the nine Schengen
countries are worried that controls on external EC frontiers may not be
strong enough to justify lifting border checks so soon.
