CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's attempts to build an election platform on the issue
of Germany's flood of asylum-seekers resulted yesterday in an unprecedented
cabinet split between the CDU/CSU majority and the liberal FDP coalition
minority.
But his scheme was given a lift by a government-sponsored opinion poll,
conveniently released while the cabinet was at daggers drawn, which showed
that most of the population was behind Mr Kohl.
The poll said that although the threat of unemployment was the greatest
worry in the east, 47 per cent of west Germans said asylum seekers and
immigration were the country's biggest problem. Around 60 per cent of all
Germans backed changes to prevent 'abuse' of asylum laws.
The rift occurred in a debate on the Schengen Accord, a treaty between
Germany and other continental European Community states which will relax
internal border controls and tighten restrictions at external frontiers.
While both party groups approved the accord - and the opposition SPD said it
would not block it - the coalition partners disgreed on its implications.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, CDU interior minister, proclaimed that the asylum clause
in the federal constitution would have to be changed if the treaty were to
be fully effective.
At present, he added, 60 per cent of all people seeking asylum in the EC
were in Germany. Despite this, and for the first time in the history of the
present government, the FDP published a separate and contradictory
post-cabinet statement.
The row followed a CDU/CSU announcement on Tuesday that a constitutional
amendment will be tabled within the next two weeks.
