passports - Goods will move more freely than people

DON'T throw away your passport. For the EC traveller, the barrier-free
European market has not quite arrived.
The lifting of frontier controls on goods and people was perhaps the most
symbolic goal of the single market programme.
However, for six months or more it has been obvious that at least one,
possibly three, and perhaps all 12 member states will not achieve the second
of those objectives before the end of 1993.
Member states appear to have met the deadline for lifting frontier controls
on goods. For all its alleged faults, the new 'transitional' regime for VAT
and excise duty has done away with the need for basic administrative border
controls on all products. Some 60m tax forms, and the people who used to
fill them in, have gone too.
On the other hand, there are lingering doubts about how a new frontier-free
regime will affect certain products. In the case of bananas, for example,
member states have just agreed a new quota regime, but it is unlikely to
come into force for at least six months. There is as yet no definitive
system for monitoring the cross-border movement of works of art or of
'dual-use' goods, which have both military and civilian applications. The
most likely solution is a formal or informal 'cellule de crise' to deal with
any problems which might occur between January 1 and the implementation of a
new regime.
Officials agree it is little more than a sticking plaster solution, but it
has allowed frontier controls on goods to be lifted before the January 1
deadline. If member states keep their nerve - and do not allow the
inevitable media scares about loopholes and errors to shake them into a
hasty reimposition of controls - then free movement of goods seems more or
less assured.
The abolition of passport controls presents quite different problems, which
are unlikely to be resolved before the end of this year, if at all.
Nine months ago, the Community seemed to divide into three main camps on the
question of passport checks.
Britain has always been the member state most vehemently opposed to the
lifting of border controls on people and its government's argument is
relatively simple.
The 1986 Single European Act, it says, does not oblige the UK to lift its
controls on non-EC citizens. Consequently, Britain must maintain at least a
minimal check to ensure that unwanted non-EC travellers do not slip through
the EC passport lane at ports and airports.
In the second camp are Denmark and Ireland. Denmark wants to maintain border
controls, but has indicated in the past it might be prepared to lift them if
sufficient safeguards are put in place. Ireland claims to be committed to
the lifting of controls. But because of its geographical proximity to
Britain, and the fact that most of its travellers pass through the UK under
an existing free-travel agreement, it would find it difficult to loosen its
controls without at least consulting the UK.
Finally, the European Commission and the remaining nine EC countries, which
are members of the Schengen free-travel agreement, dispute the British
interpretation of the Single European Act and are committed to the lifting
of border controls on people.
Until recently, it looked as though the dispute between the Commission and
the British government might end in the European Court. An individual court
case - perhaps brought by a federalist MEP or ordinary free-travel zealot -
is still not out of the question, but in the past six to nine months, a
number of new elements have reduced the immediate threat of Commission court
action:
Euro-politics. Since the Danish and French referendums on the Maastricht
treaty, Brussels has been increasingly reluctant to challenge member states
on strongly held points of principle. Mr Kenneth Clarke, British home
secretary, warned fellow EC interior ministers in June that pressurising
Britain on passport controls could swing the UK parliament against the
Maastricht treaty - it was a potent argument, according to observers.
The refugee problem. Increasing immigration pressures and racial tension,
particularly in Germany, have made the Schengen nine think twice about
lifting their internal border controls as quickly as they had intended. The
Schengen accord does commit them to abolish internal checks, but only when
external frontiers have been sufficiently strengthened, and ancillary
measures - such as a computer link between Schengen immigration authorities
 -have been put in place. Neither has yet happened.
Practical difficulties. Airports - most notably the busy Schiphol hub in
Amsterdam - have won a deferral of the deadline for lifting controls, on the
grounds that they cannot physically change their infrastructure before
December this year to separate EC and non-EC arrivals.
The result is that even the most enthusiastic countries are unlikely to lift
their internal border controls on people before the middle of this year.
Travellers in continental Europe will probably notice little change - cars
will still be able to sweep through most internal borders without checks;
airports will still check passports, although controls may get lighter as
terminal infrastructure is adapted to cope with the new regime.
Britain, on the other hand, is planning to retain its controls at airports
and sea borders unaltered until Schengen decides to abolish its internal
checks.
When that happens, UK seaports will probably implement a version of the
so-called 'Bangemann wave' - named after the current internal market
commissioner - requiring EC travellers to show the cover of their passport
to officials.
Schengen's disarray on border controls let Britain off the hook as far as
the January 1 deadline was concerned, but it seems unlikely that an eventual
'two-speed' solution to the question of passport checks will be acceptable
to all continental European countries. According to Schengen, the Bangemann
wave is too strict as a control on internal borders and too lax as a control
on external frontiers.
If Britain - or, indeed, Ireland and Denmark - decides to apply only minimal
checks to travellers arriving from outside the Community then Schengen
members may have to start examining the passports of passengers on flights
and ferries from non-Schengen EC partners.
That would be a strange and unhappy end to a project that was supposed to be
built on mutual trust and partnership.
