MINISTERS of the nine European Community signatories to the Schengen free
travel pact yesterday agreed to delay removing systematic passport checks
until February 1, chiefly because of technical problems on a police
computer.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's EC affairs minister, who chaired the meeting
in Paris, played down the two-month delay from the December 1 deadline which
the Schengen signatories set earlier this year for ending routine controls
on people travelling between their countries. 'February 1 is virtually
tomorrow, and there is nothing to stop preparatory measures coming into
effect on December 1,' he said.
But the minister admitted that internal French problems over political
asylum were another cause for delay. One of the Schengen arrangements
provides that, as a general rule, asylum-seekers can only apply for refuge
in one state.
France's top court ruled in August that this infringed asylum rights
enshrined in the constitution. However, the president and prime minister
agreed on a compromise which has yet to be put in place.
France, Germany and the Benelux countries signed the agreement in 1990, and
Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece have subsequently signed.
