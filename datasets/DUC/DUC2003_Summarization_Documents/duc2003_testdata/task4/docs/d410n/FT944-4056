The Schengen accord to end border controls between nine European Union
states will finally come into effect on March 26 next year, Mr Yves-Thibault
de Silguy, one of France's new EU commissioners, told Le Figaro newspaper in
an interview. 'Schengen's all sorted out. On December 22, we will announce
that the accords come into effect on March 26,' said Mr de Silguy, who takes
over as economic and monetary affairs commissioner at the end of next month.
'On that date Schengen starts being applied and the signatory countries must
take measures to get rid of border controls before the summer,' he said.
Officials from the nine are due to meet in Heidelberg, Germany, on December
22 to set an official implementation date, which has been put back since
January 1993. Last month, Germany said the accords should come into effect
by April at the latest. Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Luxembourg, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece have signed the accord.
Austria, which joins the EU next month, has observer status. Britain,
Ireland and Denmark have kept their distance as have the two other new
members, Finland and Sweden.
