NINE MEMBERS of the European Community agreed yesterday to abolish formal
passport controls at all internal frontiers by December 1.
From that date, travellers between Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal,
Greece and the Benelux countries will be able to pass freely across internal
borders, including ports and airports.
Travellers from Britain, Ireland and Denmark will still be subject to the
same immigration checks as other international travellers arriving in the
free-travel zone.
The deal, if it can be put into effect, will put pressure on Britain - which
strongly opposes removing all passport checks - Ireland and Denmark to speed
up their efforts to reduce controls.
Meeting in Madrid, ministers from the nine signatories of the Schengen
free-travel accord agreed to give practical effect to the EC's aim of free
movement of people. Politically, it has proved the most sensitive aspect of
the single European market, which already allows free movement of most
goods, services and capital within the EC.
The Schengen group is named after the Luxembourg town where a regional
agreement to open frontiers was reached in 1985.
Mr Carlos Westendorp, the Spanish EC affairs minister, who chaired
yesterday's meeting, said the deal was 'good news for Europe at exactly the
moment when we need some good news'.
Yesterday's political declaration is subject, however, to conditions,
insisted on by the new centre-right French government, which is still
worried about the risks involved in allowing free movement of people.
In addition, certain large EC airports - including those serving Amsterdam
and Brussels - will be given time to adapt their infrastructure to the new
system, which will require splitting immigration and baggage-handling
facilities for passengers from Schengen and non-Schengen countries.
The delay means that some controls may be retained beyond December 1, even
for travellers within the Schengen zone.
A special Schengen committee will have to decide in October whether there
has been sufficient progress in three key areas to justify opening all
internal borders: improved checks on people coming from outside the free
travel zone; action against drug trafficking; and the establishment of a
Schengen information system, linking police and immigration authorities in
the nine member states.
