MINISTERS from nine EC countries should decide today whether it will be safe
to scrap systematic passport controls at their internal frontiers from
December 1.
But France, which will chair today's meeting in Paris, still appears to be
uneasy about opening its borders and could block a decision, setting back
efforts to end frontier controls across the Community.
At their last meeting in June, the nine signatories to the Schengen
free-travel accord - all the EC members except Britain, Denmark and Ireland
 -agreed to abolish controls from December, if certain conditions were met.
The nine ministers must decide today whether the Schengen group has made
sufficient progress in three key areas: improving checks on people coming
from outside the free-travel zone; fighting drug trafficking; and linking
police and immigration authorities by computer.
On Friday, Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's European affairs minister, voiced
his government's continuing concern about certain elements, particularly
delays in linking computer systems and strengthening checks at external
frontiers.
He told the EC affairs committee of the French National Assembly that France
might delay a decision until next month's ministerial meeting. Other
alternatives include postponing the deadline for two months, or calling for
gradual application of the Schengen accord, which came into force on October
1.
The French parliament fears abolishing controls prematurely could lead to
'an increase in illegal immigration, an increase in drugs trafficking and a
general weakening of security in Europe'.
Schengen and European Commission officials hope Mr Lamassoure will bury his
doubts in the interests of achieving unanimous agreement under his
chairmanship.
Agreement would allow Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the EC internal market
commissioner, to press ahead with attempts to persuade Britain, Ireland and
Denmark to abolish controls on travellers coming from other EC countries.
Brussels believes that was one of the clear objectives of the single market
programme, most of which came into force on January 1.
Most continental EC countries have already scrapped controls on people
crossing internal land borders by train or car, but passport checks are
still in place at most ports and airports, where intra-EC and international
travellers mingle. Large EC airports like Brussels and Amsterdam are
unlikely to meet the December 1 deadline, even if it is agreed today. They
will be given time to split immigration and baggage-handling facilities for
passengers from Schengen and non-Schengen countries.
