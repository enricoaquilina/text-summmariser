INTERNAL EC border controls will not be removed by next January 1, Mr
Kenneth Clarke, British home secretary, said yesterday.
In the first outright admission by a senior minister that the EC will miss
one of its fundamental single market objectives, he told the European
parliament there was ' no prospect of any general removal of frontier
controls on January 1. . . . there is difficulty in reconciling the position
of all the (EC) countries.'
His frank comments will set the tone for next week's two-day meeting of EC
interior ministers in London, where immigration policy and border controls
will be under discussion for the last time before the symbolic opening of
the barrier-free European market.
Britain itself is still adamant that controls on people are essential if
non-EC travellers are to be properly monitored. That stance has put the UK
in dispute with the European Commission and the nine continental European
members of the Schengen free-travel zone.
But in an attempt to take the heat off the UK, Mr Clarke indicated yesterday
that the nine Schengen members might also want to impose stricter checks on
travellers from the non-Schengen countries. He later picked out the
Netherlands, but Dutch officials denied the allegations.
Schengen countries are uneasy with a compromise solution to the British
problem which would allow EC visitors to Britain simply to wave passports at
immigration controls from next year. They believe that compromise would
undermine the barrier-free internal market - and weakens the EC's external
frontiers, where checks are supposed to be more rigorous.
