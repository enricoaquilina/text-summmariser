The European Commission yesterday approved a proposed list of 129 countries
whose citizens will require visas to enter the European Union.
But plans to draw up a 'positive' list of non-EU nationals who would not
require a visa had to be dropped following opposition within the Commission.
So far Brussels is reluctant to go further than national governments in
experimenting with its new powers under the Maastricht treaty to initiate
legislation on immigration, justice or internal affairs.
But although cautious, Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the internal market
commissioner, and Mr Padraig Flynn, commissioner responsible for
immigration, said yesterday that by strengthening external frontiers, the
measures proposed yesterday would help persuade EU member states to lift
controls on people at internal frontiers.
The Commission also pushed through proposed revisions to the European
convention on external frontiers, to take account of the Maastricht changes.
Justice ministers will discuss the measures at their meeting next week in
Brussels.
The proposals, including the list of nationalities requiring visas, follow
closely work done by the nine members of the intergovernmental Schengen free
travel agreement - all the EU members except Britain, Denmark and Ireland.
If approved unanimously, the proposals will also mean that EU countries will
have to recognise each others' visas.
The Schengen countries have already agreed to abolish all controls at
internal frontiers from February 1, 1994. But Britain, Ireland and Denmark
are likely to maintain certain systematic passport checks at their borders
beyond that date.
