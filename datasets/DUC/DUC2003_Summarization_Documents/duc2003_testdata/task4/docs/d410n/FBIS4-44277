  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- The common search data system of 
the Schengen states will probably be ready to go into operation 
in October, Bernd Schmidbauer, state minister in the 
chancellor's office, said in Berlin on Monday [27 June] before a 
meeting of the Executive Committee of the Schengen states 
Germany, France, Benelux states, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and 
Greece. With the so-called Schengen Information System the 
search for criminals and rejected asylum-seekers be made easier. 
  As soon as the information system, which is currently being 
tested, is put into operation, the Schengen Accord will come 
into force. In it the Schengen states have committed themselves 
to the gradual reduction of identity checks at the inland 
borders with compensation measures for checks at the external 
borders. According to the Schengen agreement, control of the 
external borders will be harmonized, as will the regulations for 
the issuing of visas and the entry of foreigners from third 
states. 
  At first the data of about 1 million people will be stored 
in 
the search system. At the beginning of the next year, material 
data relating to the search for e.g. forged passports, weapons, 
and stolen cars is to be added. In Germany alone access to the 
system, whose headquarters is in Strasbourg, will be possible 
via about 8,000 terminals at border checkpoints, in police 
stations, and during mobile operations. About 20 million marks 
will be spent on computers for this purpose. For the time 
being, Germany, France, Benelux states, Spain, and Portugal will 
participate in this system.
