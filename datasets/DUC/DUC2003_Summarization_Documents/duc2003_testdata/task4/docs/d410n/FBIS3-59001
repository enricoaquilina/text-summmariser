<F P=106> [Report by Sophie Huet: "According to a Senate Report: </F>
Schengen Agreements Inapplicable for One Year"] 
  [Text] The Senate fact-finding mission formed 31 months 
ago to verify the conditions for the implementation of the 
Schengen agreement, which eliminates the internal borders and 
makes provision for the free movement of people and goods within 
the European Union, yesterday issued its final report concluding 
that the system is inapplicable. "This is our third 
postponement," Xavier de Villepin (centrist, representing 
expatriate French citizens), chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Affairs Commission, stressed. 
  As the author of the mission's report, de Villepin 
reaffirmed 
that the free movement of people had originally been set for 1 
January 1993 when the single market came into force, then it was 
postponed until October 1993 (Madrid Conference), until December 
1993 (Paris summit), and again postponed until 1 February 1994, 
the date put forward as "an essential deadline." Even before 
the Senate report was published, Bernd Schmidbauer, the German 
secretary of state to the Chancellery responsible for European 
questions, said yesterday morning that the elimination of 
identity checks at the borders of the nine European Union 
countries would have to be postponed again because it is 
"totally impossible on 1 February." 
  The implementation of this agreement is encountering one 
main 
difficulty: The establishment of the Schengen Information 
System (SIS), the joint computer facility which should make it 
possible for the Schengen signatory states (namely the Twelve 
minus Britain, Ireland, and Denmark) to consult police and legal 
data. Paul Masson (Rally for the Republic, Loiret), chairman of 
the Senate fact-finding mission, blames "the dilution of 
responsibility," the "bad choice of technicians" responsible for 
designing the SIS, the conditions in which the contract was 
awarded, and the loss of control over technical tests. "The 
current failure of the SIS results from a series of dysfunctions 
in the Schengen system without it being possible to identify a 
single culprit," the report stresses. "The failure is 
collective. It is grave, serious, and bitter, and it undermines 
the credibility of an entire organization.... It is the system 
as a whole which must be reviewed." 
  The Senators' disappointment is particularly great because 
France has launched a complex process of adapting its 
Constitution (twice), its legislation (six laws passed), and its 
regulations to conform to the Schengen agreement.

  The Senate mission also heard European Affairs Minister 
Alain 
Lamassoure on 11 January and he confirmed this assessment: "The 
internal legal provisions we have made in connection with the 
implementation of the Schengen convention will not be 
implemented on 1 February," the minister stressed, explaining 
that internal border controls and the police system would not be 
relaxed "until the Schengen convention is implemented." 
  In the view of Xavier de Villepin and Paul Masson, the delay 
in the implementation of the SIS cannot be made up in less than 
a year. This computer network, costing 30 million francs (France 
contributed 26.8 percent of its financing), was designed badly 
from the start, and it is, in a way, "the cornerstone" of the 
Schengen agreement. The direct result of this is that all the 
joint policies drawn up in the Schengen framework (in the area 
of the right to asylum, the granting of visas, external border 
controls, airport equipment, combating illegal immigration, and 
drug trafficking) are blocked "for an indefinite period" 
creating "a major legal and technical vacuum."
