<P>
A year ago today, Linda Oxenreider wept in a Ventura County courtroom as her 
son's violent death in a traffic accident was recounted. 
</P>
<P>
The family of Diane Mannes was there too, listening as witnesses described her 
as a murderer who drunkenly mowed down five young men, killing three of them. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, as Mannes was bound over for retrial on a new set of 
second-degree murder charges, both families were back in court, sharing the 
same front row, reliving the night of March 31, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll come every day," said Linda Oxenreider, who attended every session of 
Mannes' first trial last November. 
</P>
<P>
Mannes' father, her boyfriend and several other family members sat behind the 
defendant, who was dressed in blue jail clothes. They declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Mannes was convicted of two felony drunk driving charges and was sentenced to 
four years in prison last year, but the jury deadlocked on the second-degree 
murder charges that the district attorney's office had filed. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than accept the initial verdict, the district attorney's office decided 
to retry Mannes on second-degree murder charges, a decision supported by the 
victims' families, Linda Oxenreider said. 
</P>
<P>
"What she did to us is absolutely the worst thing you can do to another person 
-- kill their child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
What Mannes did, according to witnesses at her preliminary hearing Wednesday 
and at the first trial, was drink a considerable amount of vodka before driving 
a 1984 Ford Bronco down the broad S-curves of the Conejo Grade on the 
northbound Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxenreiders' son Joshua, 19, and four of his friends were walking along the 
shoulder of the highway after having a flat tire. They were about 40 feet from 
their disabled car when Mannes sideswiped it and plowed into the group, fatally 
injuring Jacob Boyd, 14, of Camarillo; Scott Mullins, 20, of Mansfield, Ohio, 
and Joshua Oxenreider. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob's brother, Jeremy Boyd, 19 at the time, and Jeffrey Botens, then 15, both 
of Camarillo, were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Pulling yellow tissues from her purse, Linda Oxenreider cried quietly as 
Municipal Judge John J. Hunter recited some of the facts agreed to by both 
sides in the case: that Mannes had killed the three men with her car; that her 
blood-alcohol level was 0.20%; that 43 hours before the accident, Mannes had 
been arrested in Tarzana on suspicion of drunk driving with a blood alcohol 
level of 0.26%; that in 1983 Mannes was convicted of driving under the 
influence in Los Angeles with a 0.34% blood-alcohol level. 
</P>
<P>
"It fills me with a great deal of rage," Linda Oxenreider said during a break. 
"All this because of the selfishness of one woman." 
</P>
<P>
Mannes' boyfriend, David Pena, testified Wednesday that he had known her to 
drink only one other time in their five-year relationship. After her drunk 
driving arrest in the Valley the day before the accident, Mannes told him that 
she drank because she was upset about long-simmering family matters, Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
Mannes' lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Robert Dahlstedt, who unsuccessfully 
tried to block a second trial on grounds that it would constitute double 
jeopardy, said in an interview that Mannes suffers from depression and drank 
sometimes to obliterate her feelings. 
</P>
<P>
The only other witness Wednesday was Tony Dunn, 22, of Simi Valley. Dunn was 
with the youths who were hit but escaped injury because he was on the other 
side of the guardrail. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Oxenreider winced as Dunn told of hearing a "smash" of one car hitting 
another and of seeing the Bronco scraping along the pavement, upside down. Dunn 
climbed over the guardrail, he said, and found all of his friends lying on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
To get a second-degree murder conviction, prosecutor Donald Glynn must prove 
not only that Mannes killed the youths, but that her drunken condition 
constituted malice. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlstedt argued that the California Supreme Court has ruled that malice exists 
in such cases only if there is a high probability that the act will result in 
death. He noted that the Ventura court sees thousands of drunk drivers each 
year but only a few cases in which a death is involved. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, however, said the higher a driver's blood alcohol level, the higher the 
probability that death will result. Citing Mannes' prior cases of drunk driving 
and a program she attended, he said she was well aware of the dangers of drunk 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter scheduled arraignment for June 21. Dahlstedt said the trial should start 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney said a second trial could have been avoided. "We would 
plead guilty to vehicular manslaughter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That charge would result in a maximum term of about 14 years, he said, 
including the prison time already ordered. He said the maximum sentence she 
could receive for three second-degree murder convictions would be 45 years to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlstedt said Mannes "knows she has affected a lot of lives." 
</P>
<P>
"If it was left to her, she would probably say she should be punished as a 
murderer."
