DRIVER IN FATAL ACCIDENT HAD ILLEGAL BLOOD-ALCOHOL LEVEL, CHP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The blood-alcohol level of a Ventura County woman was twice the amount needed 
to categorize her as legally drunk when she was involved in an accident that 
killed three young men and injured two others, the California Highway Patrol 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Helen Mannes, 34, of Somis had a blood-alcohol reading of 0.20%, said CHP 
Officer Lisa Sowell. In California, a person with a level of 0.10% is 
considered legally drunk. 
</P>
<P>
The results were released sooner than usual because the CHP and the Ventura 
County district attorney's office requested that Mannes' blood test be given 
top priority, Sowell said. 
</P>
<P>
Mannes was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving Friday night after her car 
hit five pedestrians whose car had a flat tire on the Ventura Freeway near 
Camarillo. The men were returning to Camarillo after picking up a friend in 
Thousand Oaks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The previous day, Mannes was arrested in the San Fernando Valley for driving 
with a blood-alcohol content of 0.26%, the CHP said. She was released on her 
own recognizance after eight hours in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Mannes was released from a Thousand Oaks hospital on Monday and is at Simi 
Valley Adventist Hospital on the advice of a psychiatrist, Sowell said.
