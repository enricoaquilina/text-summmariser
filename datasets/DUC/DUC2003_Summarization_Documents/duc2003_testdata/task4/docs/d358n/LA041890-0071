Marcy DeJesus' worst fear became a reality with a knock on her door at 1:45 
a.m. Sunday, April 8. The police officer standing there told DeJesus, 
administrator of the Los Angeles chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, to 
call the county coroner's office in Palmdale. Her 19-year-old son, Adam, had 
been killed in a head-on collision with a drunk driver, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcy DeJesus buried Adam one week ago today. 
</P>
<P>
"What's been going through my mind since the first minute (I heard) has been, 
'Ten years of work and what have I been doing? Has it made any difference at 
all if they can still get my son?' " 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus founded the Los Angeles chapter of MADD with Barbara Bloomberg in 1981, 
after Bloomberg's son, Seth, was killed by a drunk driver. Seth and Kiley 
DeJesus, Adam's older brother, had been best friends. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in answer to the question that has been haunting her, she said she knows 
her work has made a difference. "This is random. I've worked with so many 
families I know I'm not the only one this has happened to and I won't be the 
last, although I pray every day that I would be." 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus' work with MADD was "absolutely tremendous," Candy Lightner said 
recently. Lightner founded the organization in Sacramento in May, 1980, four 
days after her daughter Cari was killed by a drunk driver. She watched 
Bloomberg and DeJesus build the Los Angeles chapter into a 5,000-member 
organization and take the initiative in creating programs -- such as taking the 
organization's message into schools -- that became models for MADD at a 
national level. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a behind-the-scenes person, the nuts and bolts of the organization, 
handling administrative details, going into the courts and monitoring (trials), 
writing letters to the editor -- all of this as a volunteer at first," Lightner 
said. "She was great working with victims. They loved her. She was very 
understanding, and impatient with the courts. That was good." 
</P>
<P>
Now those former victims are counseling Marcy DeJesus, writing letters to her, 
knowing enough, DeJesus said, not "to say anything stupid, like 'I know just 
how you feel.' " 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus talked about her son and MADD one rainy morning in her Canoga Park home 
while Lightner and another friend quietly worked in the background, sorting 
bills and correspondence, offering lunch or coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Grief weighs heavily on DeJesus. Her voice was flat, her look remote as she sat 
on the couch in her den, the family dog, Max, beside her. Conversation was 
clearly a strain. Frequently lighting cigarettes, she responded to questions 
obligingly, but with little animation, except for an occasional soft smile 
brought on by a memory. Just as often, memories crumbled her facade and brought 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
The rain made the morning dark and the unlit rooms had a gloomy cast to them. 
Looking around at one point, she said, "Five short years ago, there was so much 
laughter in this house and now it's so quiet." 
</P>
<P>
Five short years ago the family was complete -- she and her husband, Luchi, a 
successful musician and composer, and their two sons, Kiley and Adam. Then 
Luchi died within a month of being told he had a brain tumor. The family took 
it hard but held together, and last year, when Marcy, 50, had a stroke, Adam 
came home from UC Santa Barbara to be with her. She returned to work in 
January, and, still moving stiffly and slowly, describes herself as just 
getting back on her feet. Kiley, in his early 20s, is living at home and 
working for a sound system company. Adam had planned to return to UC Santa 
Barbara in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus last saw him when he left the house in his pickup truck that Saturday 
night. He and his girlfriend of two years, Shanya Roberson, 19, were heading 
for Lake Havasu, Ariz., for spring break. They were traveling on Route 18 in 
the Antelope Valley when they were hit at 8:30 p.m. Adam was killed instantly. 
Roberson was seriously injured and taken to a Palmdale Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
And then came the knock on the door. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I drove (Adam) a little crazy about it," she said of her fear that he 
would be killed by a drunk driver. "He never left the house without my saying, 
'Be careful. Watch out for the other guy.' And he never left the house without 
saying, 'I love you, Mom.' " 
</P>
<P>
Her face distorting, she began to weep. "I keep waiting for him to come through 
the door. I could tell the difference between the slams and I'd know what mood 
he was in when he came home. He was very moody -- high highs, low lows." 
</P>
<P>
That is how Adam came across in the eulogies at his funeral service last 
Wednesday at Mt. Sinai Mortuary. Those who knew him described an intense, moody 
young man, highly creative in music and art, who cared deeply and questioned 
everything and everyone, especially himself. All of those who spoke described 
someone who was just beginning to find himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember thinking to myself," DeJesus said, "that someone who hadn't known 
Adam would have come away (from the funeral) with a pretty accurate impression 
of him." 
</P>
<P>
His drums were set up in the chapel, beside the open coffin. Adam had a black 
belt in karate, and his black satin jacket, part of the karate-gi, lay folded 
on his chest, placed there gently by his instructor Rob Margolin, after 
Margolin eulogized him as student, teacher and friend. 
</P>
<P>
The chapel was packed, and people overflowed onto the veranda and into side 
rooms. Police officers in uniform stood in the rear of the chapel -- "the DUI 
squad from Van Nuys, and CHP from Malibu," DeJesus said later, describing 
people with whom she had worked closely over the years. 
</P>
<P>
What was particularly striking about the service was the racially mixed group 
of heartbroken young people in attendance -- young men tightening their jaws, 
and breaking down anyway, young women sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband was black," DeJesus said. "Adam was very diverse in his choice of 
friendships. . . . We tried all our lives to surround the kids with people from 
different races." 
</P>
<P>
Smiling at her memory, she said wryly of Adam: "He usually made a statement by 
the cut of his hair. He wore dreadlocks toward the end. It was like, 'I'm black 
this week.' There was a little identity searching, but he was a well-adjusted 
kid." 
</P>
<P>
They were not a religious family, DeJesus said. "If anything, they're (her 
children) metaphysical. Adam was probably more religious in his attitude than 
any of us -- the way he felt about people, the world in general. He cared very 
deeply about everything going on." 
</P>
<P>
She described him as an accomplished artist and animator who won student prizes 
from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He played the drums, 
studied music and, with brother Kiley on guitar, worked in a garage studio. His 
career ambitions tended toward music. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was trying to follow in his father's footsteps," DeJesus said. 
</P>
<P>
She does not want to romanticize Adam, or paint an overly ideal picture of him. 
He was no angel, she said, and their own relationship had all the predictable 
difficulties. She pestered him with "where are you going?" questions. He 
tortured her with monosyllabic "out" answers. 
</P>
<P>
And at other times he had a lot more to say. 
</P>
<P>
"He was full of questions and statements of fact," DeJesus said dryly. "He took 
everything so seriously. He thought he knew all the answers. He was a very 
intense young man. He was just maturing, trying to make up his mind about what 
he really believed in. His father's death really rocked him. They had been very 
close. He was 13 and did not really deal with it until he was 18." 
</P>
<P>
Darshan S. Grewal, the driver of the car that killed Adam and injured Roberson, 
has been charged by Los Angeles County prosecutors with second-degree murder, 
gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and felony drunk driving causing 
death or injury. Seriously injured himself, Grewal was transferred from San 
Bernardino Country Hospital to that county's jail ward. He has two previous 
drunk-driving convictions. His blood-alcohol level three hours after the 
accident measured 0.2%. The legal definition of intoxication is 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus is staying away from the case because of her anger, she said, leaving 
MADD's role in it to the Antelope Valley chapter. 
</P>
<P>
"As much as possible I've just got to concentrate on my grief. . . . Anger has 
to be put in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Her friendships are sustaining her around the clock. "It's unbelievable. . . . 
They won't leave me alone. I never believed that sort of thing could help, but 
I certainly do now. The mail has been overwhelming, from perfect strangers. 
It's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
She visited Roberson at the hospital last weekend, and while it was a rough 
visit on both of them, DeJesus said, "it was very important to me. I love her 
like my own daughter, and I needed to see she's all right." 
</P>
<P>
The two young people graduated from El Camino Real High School in Woodland 
Hills in 1988. Their families lived about five blocks from each other and they 
had attended UC Santa Barbara together. There are two photos of the young 
couple in the DeJesus den, one casual pose taken two weeks ago, and another in 
which they are dressed up for a MADD banquet. 
</P>
<P>
Shanya Roberson is recovering, but DeJesus is concerned for her. 
</P>
<P>
"She's so sad right now. She's got a long road ahead of her." 
</P>
<P>
DeJesus intends to carry on with MADD. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to be around people who understand what's going on. . . . We're trying 
to prevent this from happening to anybody else. Now that I really realize, I 
know I can't bear the thought of another family going through this."
