Jurors in the trial of of Danny David Ornelas asked questions in court Friday 
afternoon that indicate they may be moving toward a manslaughter, rather than a 
murder, verdict in the case. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour and a half later, however, the jury recessed for the weekend 
without having reached a decision. The trial began three weeks ago in Orange 
County Superior Court in Westminster. Judge Luis A. Cardenas ordered the jurors 
to resume their deliberations at 9:30 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas, 19, of Huntington Park, is accused of second-degree murder in the 
death last Sept. 1 of Debbie Killelea, 37, of Newport Beach. Killelea was 
fatally injured when a speeding car driven by Ornelas struck her as she was 
walking with two of her children in a narrow alley behind her home on Balboa 
Peninsula. The incident was accidentally videotaped by a young man riding in 
the car Ornelas was driving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statewide Interest 
</P>
<P>
The videotape, along with the outrage community members expressed over her 
death, has sparked statewide interest in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas' defense attorney, Ralph Bencangey of Beverly Hills, argued during the 
trial that Ornelas should have been on trial for manslaughter, not murder. 
Bencangey said he was encouraged by the jurors' sending written questions to 
Cardenas asking about vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
The questions, which the judge read aloud in court, asked whether a jury must 
find multiple elements of guilt to convict a defendant of gross vehicular 
manslaughter. Cardenas told the jurors that only one element of guilt is 
necessary for a conviction of that crime. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors also asked Cardenas whether it is necessary to find that a defendant 
had blood-alcohol level of 0.10 or higher in order to convict him of gross 
vehicular manslaughter. Cardenas responded that such a finding was not 
necessary for a defendant to be convicted of that crime. 
</P>
<P>
According to unrebutted testimony presented during the trial, a blood test made 
Sept. 1 about an hour after Ornelas was arrested showed that he had a 
blood-alcohol level of 0.18 -- almost twice the minimum of 0.10 that state law 
says constitutes proof of drunkenness. 
</P>
<P>
A curious twist in the trial was that both the defense attorney and the 
prosecutor produced expert witnesses to argue that Ornelas was fairly sober at 
the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The defense's expert witness testified that the strong rum Ornelas drank just 
before he got behind the wheel had probably not been absorbed into his 
bloodstream by the time he hit Killelea. That expert estimated that Ornelas' 
was driving with a blood-alcohol level of 0.04. 
</P>
<P>
The defense argued that Ornelas had tried to avoid hitting Killelea, and 
Bencangey has told reporters that part of his strategy was to show that Ornelas 
was sober enough to have been trying to veer away from Killelea. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Goethals, by contrast, said his intention was to show 
that Ornelas was sober enough to have "implied malice" in his hitting Killelea. 
A finding of implied malice is a necessary element for a second-degree murder 
conviction in the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Implications of Actions 
</P>
<P>
Jurors asked Cardenas questions about the legal definition of implied malice 
Friday morning. They had told the judge on Thursday that they were "hopelessly 
deadlocked" and that the question of implied malice was among the stumbling 
blocks. 
</P>
<P>
The switch that afternoon to questions about gross vehicular manslaughter 
seemed to indicate that the jury had changed its focus on a possible murder 
conviction, according to Bencangey. 
</P>
<P>
The judge told the jurors before they began deliberating Tuesday morning that 
they had five verdict options: guilty of second-degree murder; guilty of gross 
vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated; guilty of gross vehicular 
manslaughter without intoxication; guilty of simple vehicular manslaughter, or 
not guilty of any crime. 
</P>
<P>
Ornelas, who looked despondent on Thursday, was smiling outside court late 
Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Bencangey said in an interview: "I think my client has a good chance. . . . The 
questions permitted the court, using the law properly, to make it as easy as 
possible for them (the jury) to find a verdict of manslaughter. I'm 
encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he did not think the jurors would have asked about manslaughter 
if they were still focused on a murder conviction. "I don't think so," he said, 
"but I can't predict what people are thinking. You never know. Apparently they 
really are having a deadlock, because even after the judge answered those 
questions they stayed out the rest of the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
Goethals, in a brief interview, said he thought the jury was on the verge of 
delivering a verdict after it asked the manslaughter questions. "Since they did 
not come back with a verdict, it means they're still working," he said. "On we 
go. I'm still optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
A second-degree murder conviction carries a penalty of 15 years to life in 
prison. A conviction of gross vehicular manslaughter carries a penalty of up to 
10 years in prison.
