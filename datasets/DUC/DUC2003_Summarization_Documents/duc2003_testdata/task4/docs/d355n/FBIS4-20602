  [Text] The Earth Observation Center (EOC) of the National 
Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) receives and processes 
the data from the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-1 (JERS-1), 
Marine Observation Satellite-1 and 1b (MOS-1 and 1b), the US 
Earth observation satellite ``LANDSAT-5,'' French Earth 
observation satellite ``SPOT-2,'' and the European Remote 
Sensing Satellite ``ERS-1'' and produces image data. The EOC has 
been conducting Earth observation data analyses since the 
analyzing equipment was completed in FY 1991 to tackle today's 
environmental problems. 
  The following ten ground truth observations were conducted 
by 
EOC and the Remote Sensing Technology Center (RESTEC) to acquire 
fundamental data for conducting such an analysis and to 
contribute to the development of future Earth observation 
sensors. 
  (1) JERS-1 and ERS-1 Validation Experiment (Within EOC, and 
5 
locations including Shizuoka Prefecture) (During and after April 
1992) 
  (2) Marine Observation Experiment (the Sea of Kumano and 
Toba 
Bay) (From May 22 to May 26, 1992) 
  (3) Kushiro Marshland Observation Equipment (Kushiro 
Marshland) (June, August, and September 1992) 
  (4) Survey on Observation Requirements for Future Sensors 
(Tanegashima) (From July 7 to July 10, 1992) 
  (5) Air-Borne X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Data 
Acquisition (Tsukuba) (From August 17 to August 19, 1992) 
  (6) Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) Advanced 
Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer (AVNIR) Validation 
Experiment (Yadagawa) (From October 16 to October 23, 1992) 
  (7) Disaster Monitoring Mission Experiment (Mt. Unzen) 
(November 2 to November 9, 1992) 
  (8) ERS-1 Marine Observation Experiment (Off Wakayama) 
(November 27 to December 1) 
  (9) International Space Year (ISY) Sea Ice Observation 
Experiment (From February 16 to February 21, 1993) 
  (10) Truth Data Acquisition Experiment using Buoys for Ocean 
Color and Temperature Scanner (OCTS) and NASA/NROSS 
Scatterometer (NSCAT) (Moji Harbor) (From February 22 to 
February 27, 1992) 
  The ninth experiment conducted in FY 1992, ``ISY Sea Ice 
Observation Experiment,'' is outlined here. 
  The experiment was conducted in February when drift ice 
reaches the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk. Its purpose was to 
acquire data for the development and research of marine 
observation technology. Ground truth observation and aerial 
observation for satellite-synchronous marine observation 
experiment were conducted using the Side Looking Airborne Radar 
(SLAR) and an airborne laser altimeter. The Drift Ice Laboratory 
of Hokkaido University, the Hokkaido University of Education, 
the Communications Research Laboratory (CRL) of the Ministry of 
Posts and Telecommunications, the First Regional Maritime Safety 
Headquarters of the Maritime Safety Agency, and the Lake Saroma 
Fish-Raising Industries Cooperative participated in the 
experiment.

  The experiments, including those conducted overseas, will 
also be conducted in FY 1993 as shown in the table.
