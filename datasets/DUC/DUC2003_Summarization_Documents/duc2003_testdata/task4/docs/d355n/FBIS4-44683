<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "France: CNES 1994 Budget of Over 11 </F>
Billion Francs"] 
  [Text] Paris--The CNES [National Center for Space Studies] 
budget for 1994 totals 11,039,554,000 French francs [Fr]. 
Officials at the French space agency consider it a "good budget" 
and one that underscores the fact that "as far as the political 
authorities are concerned, space remains a priority," according 
to a statement by CNES President Rene Pellat at the agency's 
annual press conference on 16 March. 
  With a civilian and military space budget accounting for 40 
percent of the amounts being invested in space by Europe, 
"France remains the European leader in that area" and must keep 
that role within the ESA [European Space Agency], Pellat added. 
The CNES is nevertheless going to place a ceiling of some Fr5 
billion on its participation in ESA programs pending a 
reformulation of European space policy, which "should be decided 
on in mid-1995 during the next ministerial conference." 
  "That ceiling is not the result of an anti-ESA stance," 
Jean-Daniel Levi, general director of the CNES, pointed out. 
"Our participation in that agency will remain as it is; it will 
always be a compromise between our national programs and those 
of the agency." Pellat emphasized that the agency "is essential 
to Europe, but it cannot carry out military programs, whereas we 
must do so." 
  Of the total Fr11.039 billion--program authorizations (Fr8.4 
billion), ordinary expenditures (Fr875 million), and own funds 
(Fr1.764 billion) combined--47.95 percent will be used for 
French participation in the various programs of the ESA, to 
which France, along with Germany, is the biggest contributor; 
5.65 percent will be used for bilateral cooperation with 
countries such as the United States and Russia; 19.44 percent 
will be used for the national program; 15.06 percent will 
provide operating support for the programs; and 11.9 percent 
will be used for general operations, Levi said.

  Despite abandonment of the Hermes spacecraft program in 
1992, 
Fr4.148 billion (an increase of 3.8 percent over 1993) are 
earmarked for "access to space"--that is, the development of 
Ariane rockets, ATV [Automated Transfer Vehicle] and CTV [Crew 
Transport Vehicle] capsules, and the Columbus module. 
  Scientific activities will receive Fr1.704 billion (+6.4 
percent), applications (telecommunications, observation, and so 
on) Fr1.087 billion (+7.9 percent); rockets derived from 
Ariane-5 (first flight scheduled for October 1995) Fr485 
million, and support for current programs and operations Fr772 
million (-4.2 percent). 
  The Ariane-4's "will be even better when launchings resume 
at 
the end of May or the beginning of June" following completion of 
the modification program scheduled following the failure of the 
63d Ariane on 24 January, according to Pellat. As for 
development of the Ariane-5, it is continuing normally following 
the three tests in 1993. The M-3 test on the P-230 propellant 
stage is scheduled for June--with the M-4 and M-5 tests to 
follow in September and November using a new batch of propellant.

  Also scheduled for June is a test with a reinforced 
structure 
for the Vulcain cryogenic engine and its tubing. In November 
there will be a test with a real structure and two propellant 
stage mockups. In April, and then in Germany in October, there 
will be tests on the upper stage of Ariane-5. For their part, 
qualification tests on the nose cones are continuing in the 
United States. They will be followed by tests on the mechanical 
mockup of the complete launcher at the Guiana Space Center in 
Kourou. 
  In cooperation with the ESA, the CNES has already begun 
evaluating a further development of the Ariane-5 for beyond the 
year 2000 that should make it possible to launch a double load 
of up to 7,400 kg, or 1,400 kg more than with Ariane-5. And in 
cooperation with Italy, it is studying the need for a small 
European propellant-fired launch vehicle capable of placing one 
metric ton in polar orbit at an altitude of 700 km. 
  The Americans and Russians are still the CNES' two big 
partners when it comes to bilateral cooperation. Financial 
difficulties at the Russian Space Agency (RKA) make it somewhat 
doubtful whether it will be possible to carry out the 
French-Russian Mars-94 mission at the end of the year, given the 
economic problems being experienced by the Russians. As for the 
three scheduled flights by French cosmonauts between now and 
2000, it will be necessary to renegotiate them with the RKA, 
since the last two were to have taken place on the future 
R-Alpha international orbital station. 
  It is expected that the cosmonaut for the Cassiopee flight 
in 
1996 will be named in mid-1994. The choice will be either Dr. 
Claudie Andre-Deshays or Jean-Pierre Haignere. Two other French 
astronauts will participate in space flights or undergo training 
with NASA: Jean-Francois Clervoy, representing the ESA, is 
scheduled to fly on board the Atlantis space shuttle next 
October, and Jean-Jacques Favier, the CNES alternate for the 
IML-2 mission scheduled for July, will fly on the Columbia.

  As far as applications at the national level are concerned, 
the CNES is continuing to participate in preparations for the 
next two satellites, Telecom-2C and Telecom-2D. The former is to 
be launched in 1995 and the latter in 1996. Added to that, if 
approval is forthcoming, will be work on the major civilian and 
military telecommunications satellite program outlined in Yves 
Sillard's report. 
  The CNES is also continuing to follow up on definition of 
the 
Spacebus-2000 and Eurostar-3000 platforms for geostationary 
satellites in the 21st century and on the spin-off from the 
satellite optical link program (SILEX). It has also begun 
studies aimed at a technical definition of the future 
positioning and data collection system that will replace Argos. 
  In the area of earth observation, Spot-4 (lifetime: five 
years) is scheduled to be placed in orbit in 1995. Spot-5 has 
not yet been ordered, nor has the decision been made to produce 
new second-generation military Helios satellites to replace 
Helios-1 and Helios-2, the first of which is scheduled for 
launching by Ariane at the end of 1994 or the beginning of 1995. 
  Added to those typically French programs are the programs 
being carried out through international cooperation in 
connection with the environment, studies of global climate, and 
ocean studies: ERS, Envisat-1, and Topex-Poseidon. 
  Parallel with that in the scientific area, the French space 
agency is carrying out numerous programs with the ESA, the 
Russians, and the Americans. In particular, the Pronaos 
submillimetric telescope is to be launched from a balloon in 
Arizona in September.
