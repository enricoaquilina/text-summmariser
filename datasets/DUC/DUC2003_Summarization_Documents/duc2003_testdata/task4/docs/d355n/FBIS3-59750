<H5>  A. Overview </H5>
  The amount of budget spending for the Science and Technology 
Agency (STA) in the FY93 general account budget is &yen;437.575 
billion, which is an increase of 6.2&percnt;, or &yen;25.709 
billion, 
over the year before. In addition, &yen;140.202 billion in the 
Promotion of Electrical Power Resources Development S/A are 
appropriated for STA expenses; and &yen;3.800 billion in the 
Industrial Investment S/A for the Japan Information Center of 
Science and Technology (JICST). The combined amount of STA 
outlays from all the accounts above, &yen;581.577 billion, is an 
increase of 5.4&percnt; or &yen;29.799 billion over the previous 
year's initial budget of &yen;551.778 billion. In addition, as 
contract authorizations, &yen;132.702 billion in the general 
account, and &yen;29.957 billion in the Electrical Power 
Resources Development S/A are appropriated. The table below 
shows the STA budget in terms of the main items. In FY93, 
however, the Japanese government is emphasizing contribution to 
the international community from the aspect of S&amp;T, and 
promotion of S&amp;T aimed at a more comfortable way of living. 
The 
main axis of that is the promotion of richly creative S&amp;T, 
centering around the strengthening of basic research, that was 
indicated in the S&amp;T Policy Outline (April 1992 Cabinet 
decision).

<H3>  B. Strengthening Innovative, Basic Research and Maintaining 
the S&amp;T Promotion Base </H3>
  &yen;16.169 (11.921) billion in contract authorization 
  &yen;59.105 (51.117) billion 
  Because new scientific and technological knowledge in the 
form of humankind's common intellectual property becomes the 
cornerstone for Japan's and the world's continued advancement in 
the 21st century, the STA will work to promote innovative basic 
research and to maintain the S&amp;T promotion base. 
<H3>  1. Expanding Special Coordination Funds for Promoting 
S&amp;T To 
Organize a System for Fostering Centers of Excellence </H3>
  &yen;13.300 (11.000) billion 
  In order for Japan to strengthen its S&amp;T activities and 
to be 
a source from which excellent research results are transmitted, 
it must foster centers of excellence (COEs) that have eminent 
research leaders, the latest research information, excellent 
research facilities and equipment, and well-rounded research 
support systems. To effectively foster COEs in Japan under a 
competitive environment, the Special Coordination Funds for 
Promoting S&amp;T will be expanded to organize this new system. 
In 
the case where a national laboratory has its own concrete plan 
and works toward becoming a COE, in order to firmly facilitate 
that plan the STA will put priority on taking steps to provide 
the funds needed for test research, filling out the research 
support system, accepting researchers from outside the 
laboratory, establishing an accurate assessment system, etc. 
<H3>  2. Expanding Important, Basic Research Promotion Programs 
such as the Innovative S&amp;T Promotion Program </H3>
  &yen;12.806 (11.155) billion 
  The Innovative S&amp;T Promotion Program is the STA's 
attempt to 
organize researchers from industry, government, and universities 
and researchers from overseas for fixed periods of time under 
eminent project leaders for the purpose of bringing forth the 
seeds of innovative technology, and then to promote innovative 
basic research that fully demonstrates the researchers' 
creativity. For that purpose &yen;6.861 billion are appropriated 
to the Research Development Corporation of Japan (JRDC). During 
FY93, research on 18 themes will continue and research on four 
new themes will begin. The STA will also expand the JRDC's 
Precursory Research for Embryonic S&amp;T Program (PRESTO). 
PRESTO 
involves widely recruiting researchers from around Japan, then 
strictly selecting from those excellent researchers with truly 
original ideas and allowing them to freely implement their own 
individual research for fixed periods of time. Along with that 
the STA will expand RIKEN's Protea Research System, in which 
researchers from many fields are brought together to carry out 
in a fluid manner advanced and basic research in untrodden areas 
for long periods of time. 
  Furthermore, the STA will continue to promote the Basic 
Science Special Researcher Program at RIKEN, which provides a 
place where young researchers can do subjective research (75 
people accepted), and will expand the S&amp;T Special Researcher 
Program, which accepts young researchers at national 
laboratories for the purpose of strengthening basic research 
(150 people accepted). 
<H5>  3. Facilitating Research Exchange </H5>
  &yen;5.034 (4.165) billion 
  In order for researchers to fully demonstrate their 
creativity, ways must be found to further facilitate research 
exchange with industry, government, and universities, and other 
countries. 
  To that end, in addition to its usual work on international 
research exchange, the STA will begin efforts within the JRDC to 
send Japanese researchers to research organizations and national 
laboratories overseas, assist in the international and domestic 
exchange of researchers from different fields for the purpose of 
feeling out new research areas, equip the "International Plaza 
for Intelligent `Contact Detonation'" for research exchange, and 
facilitate joint research. 
  The STA will also work to promote special government-private 
joint research programs, which drive joint research between the 
private sector and national laboratories under the STA, and will 
effectively promote research based on programs such as the guest 
research official system. 
  Furthermore, building upon the research results from 
programs 
such as that for innovative S&amp;T promotion, the JRDC will 
organize loose coalitions with private firms working in 
different types of industries and will use the energy of the 
private sector to conduct tests. The STA will continue to 
promote systems for developing the results of advanced research 
(high-tech consortiums), which are a way to establish new 
technology organizations and peripheral patents. In addition, 
the STA will commission development using distinguished research 
results, and will facilitate the establishment of new technology 
firms by acting as a go-between. 
<H5>  4. Maintaining the S&amp;T Promotion Base </H5>
  &yen;16.169 (11.291) billion in contract authorization 
  &yen;29.990 (26.240) billion 
  (1) Improving Research Facilities, Starting With 
Deterioration Countermeasures 
  &yen;2.437 (1.769) billion in contract authorization 
  &yen;6.273 (5.808) billion 
  To cope with the increasing obsolescence and deterioration 
of 
the national laboratories' research facilities and make those 
facilities more sophisticated, the STA is proceeding with 
systematic maintenance of research facilities, e.g., its 
five-year research facilities maintenance plan. 
  (2) Expanding Per-Person Research Expenses 
  &yen;6.693 (6.463) billion 
  The per-person research expenses, which are the ordinary 
research funds that form the foundation for basic research 
activities in the national laboratories and other such research 
organizations, will be the same for all ministries and agencies 
and will be increased by &yen;40,000 to &yen;1.515 million for 
Experimental-I (physics and engineering) researchers. 
  (3) Expanding S&amp;T Talent Measures 
  &yen;3 million (0) 
  While the demand for researchers and engineers is expected 
to 
increase enormously from now on, the younger generation's 
interest in S&amp;T is declining. For that reason the STA will 
study 
measures for heightening the younger generation's interest in 
S&amp;T. The STA will also promote measures for fostering and 
securing talent, e.g., surveys and analyses of ways for young 
people to know the joy of doing science. 
  (4) Large-Scale Radiation Facility (SPring-8) Construction 
  &yen;13.733 (10.152) billion in contract authorization 
  &yen;9.009 (7.048) billion 
  The SPring-8 large-scale radiation facility is an important 
facility that will help bring forth dramatic results in a wide 
range of basic research fields centering around materials 
S&amp;T, 
the life sciences, information and electronics S&amp;T, optical 
S&amp;T, 
and atomic energy R&amp;D. The facility will also be available 
for 
joint international use. RIKEN and JAERI are continuing their 
collaborative efforts on the related R&amp;D work, production of 
the 
accelerator, construction of the building, etc. 
  (5) Facilitating More Advanced R&amp;D Functions in Regions 
  &yen;1.663 (1.219) billion 
  Along with expanding fluid regional research, as the 
research 
that uses Special Coordination Funds for Promoting S&amp;T to 
help 
improve the lifestyles of the people in the regions, the STA 
will work to make the R&amp;D functions in the regions more 
advanced 
by improving information exchange, centering around research 
information networks that will be constructed within regions and 
between regions and the Tsukuba Science City, and by 
facilitating the establishment of new technology firms. In 
addition, as the regional expansion of RIKEN's frontier 
research, in the Nagoya district the STA will begin "Biomimetic 
Control Research" to study the core of the cerebral base that 
controls the movement and behavior of animals. The STA will also 
continue to promote regional joint R&amp;D projects in which the 
Japan Marine Science and Technology Center (JAMSTEC) and 
regional public entities are collaborating. 
  (6) Facilitating the Distribution of S&amp;T Information 
  &yen;6.349 (5.702) billion 
  (&yen;3.8 billion of which is from the Industrial Investment 
S/A) 
  In the Japan Information Center of Science and Technology 
(JICST) the STA is working to set up comprehensive document 
databases, fact databases, etc., and to facilitate the 
nation-wide distribution of S&amp;T information by developing new 
technology for providing and distributing information on-line. 
  In addition, the STA will expand the English-language 
database for the document information generated in Japan, and 
distribute that information through an international S&amp;T 
information network (STN) that was built in cooperation with 
U.S. and European information-providing organizations. Along 
with that, the STA will also promote the operation of a machine 
translation system. 
<H3>  C. Contributing to the International Community Through 
S&amp;T </H3>
  &yen;105.500 (92.685) billion in contract authorization 
  &yen;127.800 (97.683) billion 
  Based on Japan's international standpoint, the STA will 
promote the following policies as its doctrine of actively 
contributing to the international community through S&amp;T by 
taking the initiative in globalizing S&amp;T. 
<H5>  1. Comprehensive Promotion of International Research Exchange </H5>
  &yen;3.773 (3.220) billion 
  (1) Establishing the Framework for a Wide-Area International 
Research Cooperation Network 
  In order for Japan's research organizations and the research 
organizations of other countries to work together in an 
organically linked manner on topics that are common to many 
regions, such as earth S&amp;T, the STA will establish a 
framework 
for a wide-area international research cooperation network 
(global research network) that will be funded by the Special 
Coordination Funds for Promoting S&amp;T. Based on that system, 
the 
STA will set R&amp;D topics, build researcher and information 
networks among many research organizations spread across the 
nations in which there are regions involved in international 
exchange, and proceed with R&amp;D. 
  (2) Facilitating International Exchange Among Researchers 
  &yen;3.184 (2.664) billion 
  In order to invigorate S&amp;T cooperation with 
Asian-Pacific 
countries, the former Soviet Union, etc., the STA will recruit 
researchers who have shown results in overseas S&amp;T 
cooperation 
and who want to become involved in research exchange with an 
applicable region, send such researchers to research 
organizations that need research cooperation, and establish 
within the JRDC a joint-researcher overseas dispatching system 
that will effectivate joint research. 
  In the enterprise for inviting young researchers from 
overseas that has been implemented since FY88, the STA will 
expand the number of people invited to 215 (from 185 people), 
and will operate housing facilities for the foreign researchers, 
provide lifestyle support such as Japanese-language training, 
operate the international Tsukuba network, and maintain the 
"International Plaza for Intelligent `Contact Detonation'." In 
addition, the STA will promote international research exchange 
and cooperation through efforts such as the JRDC's international 
joint research, prioritized international exchange using the 
Special Coordination Funds for Promoting S&amp;T, and individual 
important international joint research. 
  The STA will also continue its active participation as a 
member of the Asian-Pacific region in the Asia Science 
Cooperation Association (ASCA) and will work to round out 
Japan's bilateral and multilateral S&amp;T cooperation in that 
region in fields such as atomic energy and earth science. 
  (3) Facilitating the International Distribution of S&amp;T 
Information 
  &yen;658 (620) million 
  In order for Japan to actively contribute to the 
international community through the provision of S&amp;T 
information, the STA will work to facilitate the international 
distribution of S&amp;T information, e.g., in JICST the STA will 
continue to facilitate the international distribution of 
scientific and technical government materials that are difficult 
to obtain but for which there are strong demands from other 
countries. 
<H5>  2. Promoting International-Contribution Projects </H5>
  &yen;105.500 (92.685) billion in contract authorization 
  &yen;124.519 (94.829) billion 
  In order to contribute to the international community 
through 
S&amp;T, the STA will actively advance bilateral and multilateral 
international S&amp;T cooperation and exchange in addition to 
comprehensively promoting human genome analysis and the 
following international-contribution projects. 
  (1) Strengthening Earth S&amp;T Efforts in the Asian-Pacific 
Region

stability and 
prosperity of these regions. The STA will use the framework for 
a wide-area international research cooperation network (Global 
Research Network), the joint-researcher overseas dispatching 
system, and other such means to expand research cooperation and 
researcher exchange with the countries of those regions. 
  For countries of the Asian-Pacific region, the STA will 
implement feasibility studies on strengthening cooperation with 
the Asia Science Cooperation Association (ASCA) and will promote 
participation in ASCA activities along with promoting 
cooperation in fields such as atomic energy and earth science. 
  As for the former Soviet Union, the STA proposed research 
projects to the International Science and Technology Center 
(ISTEC). The STA will provide the related funding, and will work 
toward active participation in scientific advisory committees 
and other such groups. The STA will also contribute toward 
improving the safety of nuclear power plants in the region 
through emergency technical improvements, etc., for the purpose 
of safety measures in nuclear power plant operation. In the 
field of space, the STA will promote cooperation in areas such 
as manned space activities data and earth observation. 
<H3>  D. Promoting S&amp;T Aimed at a More Comfortable Way of 
Living </H3>
  &yen;2.099 (1.082) billion in contract authorization 
  &yen;16.346 (13.376) billion 
  To realize a more relaxed, gentle, comfortable way of 
living, 
the STA will augment its involvement in human gene analysis, 
which is expected to contribute significantly to finding cures 
for cancer and genetic diseases and elucidating the mechanisms 
of aging. The STA will also promote the following measures for
