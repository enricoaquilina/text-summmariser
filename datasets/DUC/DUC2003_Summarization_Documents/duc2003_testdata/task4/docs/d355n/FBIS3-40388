<H5>  Principal Observations and Recommendations </H5>
  This fifth report of the TGE Council affords an opportunity 
to review trends in past spending and outlays planned over the 
course of the next few years for TGEs already in existence or 
still under construction. It also contains recommendations on 
certain projects which the Council examined in detail in 1992. 
  For future budgets, as for the budget adopted in 1992, CNRS 
has distinguished between companion appropriations and the 
budgets proper of GANIL [Large National Heavy Ion Accelerator] 
and Saturne. This methodology, which conforms to that practiced 
by the ministry and other agencies, significantly affects the 
figures in the following tables. 
<H5>  General Observations </H5>
<H5>  Developments in 1991-1992 </H5>
  Expenditures for TGEs, exclusive of personnel costs, totaled 
2,150 million French francs [Fr] in 1992; the corresponding 
figure for 1991 was Fr2,000 million (cf. 1992 report). Thus, 
absolute spending (without adjusting for inflation) increased by 
7.5 percent. 
  Although CNRS outlays remained practically unchanged (cf. 
Table 2), CEA's dropped sharply (-94 million) by reason of 
serious budgetary problems in 1992. The net increase [i.e. for 
TGEs] was due principally to the space sector (+147 million for 
CNES) and to the Fr38 million voluntary contribution made to 
CERN, without which spending in that category would have 
remained unchanged. 
  The apparent decline of personnel outlays (Fr926 million in 
1992 versus Fr965 million in 1991) is due solely to a change in 
the method used by IN2P3 to determine the sums allocated to 
TGEs: The old method added in both the budgets proper of the TGE 
facilities and the primarily personnel-related expenditures 
allocated to the laboratories. These latter are now more 
correctly included under companion appropriations (see part 
three of this report). 
<H5>  1993-1992 Compared </H5>
  Nonpersonnel outlays rose from Fr2,150 million in 1992 to 
Fr2,328 million in 1993. The Fr178 million increase (up 8.3 
percent) is again due primarily to the steady growth of space 
programs (+ 157 million), especially ENVISAT-1, but in lesser 
degree to restoration of the CEA budget to its previous level 
(+20 million, principally for Super Torus). Start-up costs for 
Project VIRGO are responsible for the Fr32 million augmentation 
of CNRS's budget. Absolute spending on personnel was unchanged 
at about Fr925 million. 
<H5>  Post-1993 Projections </H5>
  Nonpersonnel spending is programmed to increase by Fr115 
million between 1993 and 1994 (from 2,328 million to Fr2,443 
million). For the first time in many years, the augmentation is 
not due to space programs, which are slated only for moderate 
growth (+20 million). CNRS outlays are scheduled for a 
substantial increase (+53 million), primarily because of Project 
VIRGO (+59 million), the agency's other programs remaining at 
the previous level or even declining, as in the case of ILL 
[Laue Langevin Institute], which is down Fr13 million in light 
of new accords between the three partners. Should construction 
of the LHC at CERN not get under way in 1994, the authorization 
in the CERN budget for this project (about Fr60 million) will be 
reviewed. 
  For out-years, no growth in spending is programmed (Fr2,455 
million in 1995), which leaves little room for discretionary 
spending to launch new projects--especially on the part of CNRS, 
whose projected budgetary needs for 1995 (Fr298 million) are 29 
percent greater than for 1992 (Fr231 million). Though outlays by 
the individual institutions were not itemized, simultaneous 
financing of all projects currently on the drawing boards at 
CNRS and CEA (GANIL-Plus, the 15-GeV [billion electron volts] 
European electron accelerator), Orpheus-Plus, the SOLEIL 
synchrotron radiation source, [particle] detectors for the LHC, 
etc.) seems out of reach, even if the Saturne project is 
discontinued. Choices must be made. 
<H5>  Long-term Trends (Nonspace) </H5>
  If one calculates the growth of nonpersonnel expenditures, 
excluding outlays entailed by the space programs of CNES and 
CEA, the diminution of real spending for the TGEs, first seen in 
1992, continues in 1993 as shown in the following table: 



  Table 1: Nonpersonnel Outlays for Non-Space-Related TGEs 

(millions of French francs) 

Year     1988     1989     1990     1991     1992     1993     1994     1995     1996 

Total    1,082    1,085    1,127    1,187    1,192    1,197    1,290    1,289    1,226

Constant 1993 francs 


  In current francs, five-year growth from 1988 to 1992 is 
only 
10.2 percent, or two percent per year on average, significantly 
less than inflation, as shown in the second line of Table 1. The 
spending level for 1993 will be very close to the 1992 level, 
i.e. no increase. Projections for 1994 offer the hope of some 
renewed growth in allocations for non-space-related TGEs, 
principally as a result of an expanded VIRGO program. 
  The stagnation of (non-space-related) TGE spending seen in 
the last few years is due to several factors: 


    -  the commitment of certain agencies such as CNRS 
[National Scientific Research Center] to rein in growth of TGEs 
and wait several years before launching new projects; 
  -  limitations--indeed, reductions in the case of the CEA--in 
the 
financial resources at the disposal of the various institutions; 
  -  the small number of new projects that have come to full 
maturity in the last few years; 
  -  the large share of new research funds earmarked for space 
programs. 

    As in reports for previous years, it is interesting to note 
(Table 2) the changing ratio of nonpersonnel TGE-related 
spending to total research ministry program authorizations in 
the budget bill for CNRS and CEA, two agencies heavily involved 
with TGEs.

  [Text] The previous relative growth in the percentage 
earmarked for 
TGE-related expenses has stopped in both agencies: 


    -  in CNRS, TGE spending has been virtually constant since 
1990, and its share of total program authorizations has declined 
slightly; 
  -  in CEA, 1992 was marked by a sharp reduction both in program 
authorizations and in TGE-related expenditures. Although the 
ratio does not change for 1993, the figures in both categories 
are somewhat higher.

Current francs                               1993 francs 


  Table 3 shows that between 1988 and 1993, TGE-related 
spending in the space domain enjoyed substantial growth (close 
to 11 percent per year on average, though with pronounced 
fluctuations). This growth corresponded to a clearly declared 
budget priority. However, augmentations in actual outlays were 
not as sharp as the annual CNES [National Space Studies Center] 
program proposals would have suggested: Significant 
reprogramming was necessary, in particular for Topex-Poseidon 
and ERS-2, as seen in the tables presented in the Council's 
reports for 1991 and 1992. Projections for the next few years 
for already-approved projects suggest a certain stagnation in 
spending. 
<H5>  TGE Spending Share </H5>
  To calculate the ratio of investments in scientific TGEs to 
total spending on civilian research, the ratio between the 
following two quantities can be evaluated: 


    -  total nonpersonnel spending for scientific TGEs; 
  -  total sum of program authorizations in the BCRD [Civilian 
Research and Development Budget] plus ordinary foreign ministry 
appropriations earmarked for BCRD (these latter principally 
cover contributions to CERN, ESO, and EMBL [European Molecular 
Biology Laboratory].

<H5>  Remarks and Recommendations </H5>
<H5>  Project VIRGO </H5>
  In May 1992 the director general of CNRS submitted to the 
Council the Franco-Italian VIRGO proposal to build a gravity 
wave detection antenna. 
  VIRGO is an experimental research project in the field of 
fundamental physics, completely new, and strongly 
multidisciplinary in terms both of implementation and expected 
results. 
  The Council first reviewed the proposal in April 1990. At 
that time, it noted its interest in the scientific objective 
being pursued and its appreciation of the high quality of the 
research teams proposing the project. However, it also 
underlined the need to strengthen those teams, continue with the 
research and development needed to build the antenna, and 
provide accurate cost estimates. 
  The Council has been informed of subsequent improvements not 
only in the project's design but also in its organization and 
collaborative aspects, and has familiarized itself with the 
exhaustive cost estimates since provided. 
  In consequence, taking into account the acknowledged value 
of 
the scientific objective pursued, the quality of the research 
teams proposing it, the excellence of their comprehensive 
description of the project, the solid European cooperation built 
into it, and the collaborative ties already established with 
Project LIGO [Laser Interferometer Gravity Wave Observatory], 
which was launched in 1992, the Council unreservedly recommended 
that: 


    -  this project go forward to the construction phase as 
quickly as possible, i.e. as soon as permitted by the budgets of 
the French and Italian agencies providing the financing; 
  -  the institutions concerned set up a very clearly articulated 
structure for the "project group" with responsibilities well 
defined, to assure effective coordination and complementarity of 
the French and Italian teams working on subsystems of this 
unique, high-technology antenna; 
  -  progress on the project be evaluated periodically by a 
"review 
committee" composed of experts not associated with the project; 
  -  as early as possible the appropriate manufacturers be 
informed 
of or involved in development of project components, especially 
the mirrors. 

<H5>    Project SOLEIL </H5>
  As the project now stands, the Council is not in a position 
to make precise recommendations. The value to the French 
scientific community of having access to an apparatus like 
SOLEIL is scarcely in question. We must be assured, however, 
that a premature positive decision not lead to dispersion of 
efforts within the French community: It would be a pity not to 
make maximum use of the ESRF [European Synchrotron Radiation 
Facility], a high-quality facility in support of which France 
makes a heavy financial contribution. 
  The very difficult problem that must be faced by 
institutions 
involved in the project is that of financing it. Projections of 
TGE-related appropriations presented in the first part of this 
report leave no resources available in the short term to finance 
construction of SOLEIL, absent a sizable augmentation of 
allocations for the TGEs operated by these agencies. The Council 
therefore awaits detailed proposals from these institutions. 
<H5>  Project LHC (CERN) </H5>
  The Council remains concerned by the large volume of costs 
that agencies will have to support to ensure suitable 
participation in construction of the detectors associated with 
the LHC. It would like to obtain specifics from them concerning 
how they expect to finance them, as it believes that a large 
part of this financing will have to come from internal 
reprogramming, as was already recommended in 1991. 
  The Council will wait to receive all the information which 
the CERN directorate promised to provide to member-state 
delegations--in principle before the end of 1993--before 
rendering an opinion on the project. 
<H5>  Part One: Multiyear Program Description </H5>
<H5>  TGEs Defined </H5>
  The Council endeavored, in its first meetings in 1988, to 
clarify the notion of TGEs. These are instruments whose 
importance for the scientific community and whose cost to build 
justify a decision-making process concerted at the national 
level and multiyear financial programming: 


    -  Such facilities must be international in their 
scientific impact, even if managed at the national level. 
  -  The research center that develops around the instrument in 
question must be a hub that attracts a significant portion of 
the French researchers in the discipline concerned, as well as a 
number of foreign research teams. 
  -  Most TGEs are built in the framework of an international 
collaborative effort: Even where such a facility is entirely 
national, it should figure prominently in France's international 
cooperation policy. 
  -  Financially, construction of a TGE necessitates multiyear 
programming and demands, if not a temporary or permanent 
increase in the budget of the responsible institution, at least 
a significant reprogramming of that budget. Given its role as a 
hub for the discipline concerned, financing is in general 
provided by all the institutions active in that field. 
  -  The minimum consolidated construction cost (including 
personnel 
outlays) for a national TGE amounts to several hundred million 
francs. If the facility is an international one, the French 
share is on the same order of magnitude, and the total cost of 
the facility is generally in excess of Fr1 billion. 

    Owing to these criteria there exists, between TGEs and the 
so-called "light-heavyweight" facilities (rarely costing more 
than Fr10-15 million), a third category of important facilities 
("heavy infrastructure") which must appear under separate 
budgetary headings at the agency level but do not require a 
decision-making process that involves participation of the 
Council on Large Scientific Facilities. 
  The current list of TGEs in operation or under construction 
is presented in Annex A2. 
<H5>  Tables Explained </H5>
  The research entities involved with TGEs have updated the 
figures furnished last year, which allows us to compare, in the 
following tables, actual spending for 1992 (in millions of 1992 
francs) versus projected spending for 1993 and subsequent years 
(in millions of 1993 francs). 
  It is quite evident, especially for the later years, that 
figures furnished by the institutions are only provisional: They 
constitute, at the current scientific juncture, the best 
estimate of needs to come. The final figures may be amended, 
among other factors, as a result of the need to take new 
projects or the overall growth in institutional budgets into 
account. 
  It should also be noted that the budgetary programming 
presented here covers only those facilities for which a firm 
go-ahead for construction was given prior to 31 December 1992. 
Projects on which a Council opinion is still under preparation 
are presented in the second part of this report. 
  Information furnished by the institutions has been used to 
prepare two groups of tables: 


    -  a breakdown of all facilities by broad scientific 
discipline (Tables I-1 to I-6); 
  -  a comprehensive breakdown by research institution and 
responsible ministry (Tables II-1 to II-6), which has been 
placed at the end of this report (Annex A5) to keep down the 
length of the main text. 

    Annual expenditures for each TGE are presented in three 
columns: 


    -  personnel expenses, covering persons employed at the 
TGE itself. These outlays can be evaluated very accurately for 
the national TGEs and for most of the international TGEs. 
However, the appropriate breakdown between personnel outlays and 
construction expenses is very difficult to establish for CNES 
and ESA [European Space Agency] scientific programs, and has not 
been obtained; 
  -  operating expenses, which cover all nonpersonnel expenditures 
obligated after the TGE went into service. These include both 
operating costs and new investments to improve or extend the 
facility's capabilities; 
  -  construction expenses, which include all nonpersonnel outlays 
entailed by construction of a TGE up to the time it goes into 
service, as well as major remodelings. 

    This classification, which puts the information into the 
form 
most useful for the Council, does not necessarily correspond to 
typical budgetary breakdowns between ordinary expenditures and 
program authorizations. The reasons for this are explained in 
Annex A3. 
  Since appropriations for the institutions are granted on an 
"all-taxes-included" basis, the data provided in the tables are 
quantified in the same way. Because of the special tax status 
enjoyed by CEA, it is difficult to establish the precise amount 
of taxes paid by each facility: An average rate of 9.3 percent 
was added to the HT [taxes not included] data to rationalize 
comparisons of CEA data for national TGEs with data from other 
facilities. The data for contributions to international 
facilities take the varying tax regimes into account. 
<H5>  Project Status Reports </H5>
  This section summarizes briefly the most important 
developments in the TGE sector in 1992; it does not represent a 
detailed and systematic description of activities in all the 
TGEs. 
<H5>  (1) Elementary Particle Physics </H5>
  Activities of French physicists working in this domain 
continue to be divided mainly between CERN in Geneva and the 
DESY [Deutsch Elektron Synchrotron] laboratory in Hamburg, 
though contact is also maintained with the large international 
research centers. 
  CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research/European 
Particle Physics Laboratory: the acronym comes from its original 
name, European Council on Nuclear Research) has seen the number 
of its member states grow from 14 in 1990 to 17 as of 1 January 
1993 with the entry of Finland, Poland, and Hungary. The Czech 
and Slovak Republics will be admitted separately in the course 
of 1993, bringing the number of member states to 19. 
  Scientific activity in 1992, as in the previous year, was 
focused on exploitation of the LEP [Large Electron-Positron 
Collider]. Thanks to several important technical advances, beam 
intensity is expected to exceed specifications in the very near 
future. As a result, more Zë boson decays were observed in 
1992 (3 million) than in the three previous years. Very precise 
tests of the "standard model" are carried out with the help of 
four large detectors whose performance is being steadily 
improved. 
  The program to augment the beam energy level continues: By 
the end of 1994, the energy level should be high enough to 
produce a pair of W bosons (160 GeV); the maximum energy level 
of 180 GeV should be reached by spring 1995, with installation 
of 192 superconducting accelerator chambers. The performance of 
the first chambers delivered by the manufacturers (including one 
French enterprise) regularly exceeds contractual specifications. 
Beginning in 1993, 48 LEP chambers will be operational. 
  Finally, work continues apace on preparatory studies for 
construction of the LHC, both the apparatus itself and the 
detectors. This subject will be discussed in greater detail in 
the second part of the present report. 
  The annual budget of CERN's basic program for 1993 totals 
951 
million Swiss francs; growth from 1992 is less than inflation. A 
further reduction of about 2.5 percent is planned for 1994, 
Germany having been exempted from contributing the full amount 
of its quota until 1995. The French contribution for 1993, 
representing 16.6 percent of the combined normal contributions 
of the 14 "original" member states, comes to 153.3 million Swiss 
francs (down 2 million Swiss francs from 1992), or about Fr567 
million (one Swiss franc = Fr3.7, as of 1 February 1992). France 
in 1992 was able to make a voluntary contribution of 10 million 
Swiss francs, thanks mainly to fluctuations in the exchange 
rate, to help resolve the dispute with the Eurolep consortium. 
  As in previous years, we must add to the contribution the 
sum 
of about Fr50 million for repayment of taxes on the income of 
French international employees residing in France. Thus total 
appropriations to CERN in 1993 will amount to about Fr617 
million. The breakdown shown in Table I-1 (particle physics, 
nuclear physics, fusion) is calculated by applying to our 
contribution the overall relative proportions of the three 
expense categories in the CERN budget. The only expenditures 
listed in the "construction" category are those associated with 
the LEP (final instalment to pay off debts incurred for Phase I 
in 1992 and completion of Phase II) or programmed for 
construction of the LHC if approved at the end of 1993. The 
figures corresponding to the years 1995 and 1996 all concern the 
LHC: In case the decision is postponed, they would of course be 
revised. 
  As will be recalled, the HERA (Hadron Elektron Ring 
Accelerator) electron-proton collider went into service in 
Hamburg in June 1992. A large team of French physicists (IN2P3 
and CEA) made a major contribution to realization of the "H1" 
detector and is now analyzing initial data. The DESY laboratory 
is a German facility financed by BMFT [Federal Ministry for 
Research and Technology] and the city of Hamburg. France between 
1987 and 1989 made in-kind contributions (superconducting 
magnets) worth about Fr100 million toward HERA's construction. 
[table omitted] 
<H5>  (2) Nuclear Physics </H5>
  French nuclear physicists have at their disposal two large 
national installations (broadly open to international 
cooperation): GANIL at Caen, and the Saturne National Laboratory 
at Saclay. Operating and capital expenses for the two facilities 
are divided equally between CEA and CNRS/IN2P3. 
  a) GANIL (Large National Heavy Ion Accelerator) is a 
three-cyclotron unit, in service since 1984 and currently one of 
the best installations in the world in its field, which is 
acceleration of heavy ions over a vast range of masses and 
energies, on the order of several tens of millions of electron 
volts per nucleon. Research there focuses primarily on exotic 
nuclei and general properties of nuclear matter. 
  Nonpersonnel operating expenses planned for 1993 amount to 
Fr52 million. These figures do not take into account 
appropriations earmarked expressly for laboratory operation. 
Companion appropriations for outside research teams for 
experiment preparation are listed and discussed in the third 
part of this report. GANIL's budget for 1993 should be 
sufficient to allow it to return to a normal operating schedule 
(37 weeks) instead of the 33-week schedule funded in the 1992 
budget. 
  Future prospects for GANIL, apart from obtaining very 
high-intensity beams, depend on installation of radioactive 
beams, which will open up a new line of research in nuclear 
structure. A final proposal will be presented in 1993: If 
approved, the financing required beginning in 1994 would amount 
to about Fr12 million (all taxes included) per year for each of 
the three partners (CEA, IN2P3, and the Basse-Normandie region). 
  b) The Saturne accelerator, rebuilt between 1974 and 1978 as 
an "intermediate" energy accelerator dedicated to nuclear 
physics and enhanced in 1987 by a new injector (MIMAS), 
accelerates protons up to 3 GeV and "light" heavy ions up to 1.2 
GeV per nucleon. It is the world's best generator of polarized 
protons and deuterons. It is used to study the internal 
structure of nuclei and nucleons with the help of the "hadron 
detector," which offers the advantage of high effective sections 
but has the disadvantage of complex interaction with the object 
being studied. Except in the domain of polarized light ion 
beams, Saturne's capabilities are now exceeded by those of the 
SIS [strategic information system] synchrotron at Darmstadt. For 
1993, its operating budget is Fr38 million, divided equally 
between CNRS and CEA. This is enough to support 5,000 hours of 
operation (versus 4,500 hours in 1992), while maintaining 
accelerator and experimental equipment operations. Beyond 1995, 
the future of LNS [Saturne National Laboratory] is uncertain and 
depends on decisions made on other projects. CEA is not 
programming any funds for it beyond that date. It should be 
noted that the personnel costs borne by CEA (Fr60 million in 
1993, versus Fr14 million for IN2P3) are particularly high: The 
equipment is operated primarily by CEA personnel, but most users 
are employed by IN2P3 or foreign laboratories. In its resource 
program for the next few years, CEA notes that it plans to end 
its contributions to Saturne's operating budget. 
  In the domain of intermediate-energy nuclear physics, 
priority for utilization of the flux magnetometer in conjunction 
with a 15 GeV continuous-beam electron accelerator was announced 
in the report which the Research Ministry requested from the 
Academy of Sciences in 1989 ("La physique nucleaire 
fondamentale," G. Charpak et al., November 1989); this priority 
was reaffirmed by French physicists in a report requested for 
the scientific council of IN2P3 and DSM/CEA [Sciences and 
Materials Directorate, Atomic Energy Commission] and published 
in 1992 ("Du nucleaire a la matiere nucleaire: rapport sur la 
physique aux energies intermediaires," B. Desplanques et al., 
January 1992). Under CEA's MACSE [Accelerator Module with 
Superconducting Electron Chambers] program, it has been possible 
successfully to test models of superconducting chambers for this 
project, studies for which continue in the framework of NUPECC 
[Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee], now under 
the aegis of the European Science Foundation. A draft proposal 
is expected to be presented in 1993. 
  The Council established guidelines on this subject in its 
1991 report and is waiting for submission of more advanced 
proposals. 
<H5>  (3) Controlled Thermonuclear Fusion </H5>
  European research in this domain is closely coordinated at 
the level of the European Communities Commission, under the 
aegis of the EURATOM [European Atomic Energy Community] Treaty. 
The fusion program is one of the major elements in the Framework 
Program for Research and Technology Development [PCRD]. 
  a) The European JET (Joint European Torus) Tokamak located 
at 
Culham, near Oxford in Great Britain, is the European 
Community's most advanced torus and is utilized in collaboration 
with Sweden and Switzerland. The decision to build it was made 
in 1978, and JET first produced plasma in 1983. JET's objectives 
are to define the parameters and operating conditions of a 
tokamak fusion reactor. 
  The capabilities of JET make it far and away the world 
leader. Achieving ignition of the plasma will require the 
"fusion product" (density of plasma x energy containment time x 
temperature) to be further increased by a factor of 5. While 
performance may have been satisfactory in terms of heating and 
plasma containment, the impurity ratio is posing problems as 
more and more energy is injected into the plasma. It was 
primarily in order to deal with this problem that the research 
council in October 1991 agreed to extend the life of the JET 
program to the end of 1996. 
  A preliminary experiment using a weak tritium concentration 
was carried out in November 1991, producing two megawatts of 
fusion power. The experiment yielded valuable information about 
the behavior of tritium in tokamaks. 
  The JET was shut down in February 1992 for a period 
scheduled 
to last about 18 months (to October 1993), during which time the 
"divertor coils" needed to fix the impurities problem will be 
installed. A great deal of new equipment will also be installed 
to prepare for the final phase of tritium operations in 1995 and 
1996. 
  Eighty percent of JET's funding comes from the EEC, 10 
percent from the host country, and the other 10 percent from the 
respective partners in the fusion program. France's direct share 
(Fr16 million in 1993), paid by CEA, represents 2.5 percent of 
JET's total budget, which for 1993 comes to 105 million ECU. 
  b) France's Super Torus, located in Cadarache and operated 
by 
CEA, will get back on a normal budgetary footing this year (the 
operating budget increases from Fr52 million in 1992 to Fr70 
million in 1993, all taxes included). The program is oriented 
toward sustained output, a major objective of the international 
program. 
  It should be noted that in June 1992 an output of 1 
mega-ampere [MA] was sustained for a full minute. All basic 
diagnostics are operational. Research efforts are focused on 
obtaining quasi-stationary output by adjusting heat levels and 
mastering techniques for adjusting active and passive components 
of the primary confining field. This equipment needs further 
development, to furnish data usable for Project ITER 
[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]. In the final 
phase of experimentation, it might be able to produce output 
lasting as long as 1,000 seconds, comparable to ITER's 
performance projections. 
  The preparation of "Next Step," i.e. the next-generation 
apparatus with which the successor program to JET will work, is 
becoming an important component of the European program. The 
detailed planning phase ("Engineering Design Activities"--EDA) 
of Project ITER, which was described in the Council's 1991 
report, has become a reality. A general accord and an initial 
protocol between the four global partners--Europe, the United 
States, Japan, and Russia--were signed in July 1992. This phase, 
which will last six years, should lead to a proposed apparatus 
demonstrating the possibility of self-sustained plasma 
combustion lasting on the order of 1,000 seconds. Its technical 
objectives are in process of being determined. The project 
leader is a Frenchman, and the work will be carried out at three 
sites (Garching, San Diego, and Naka). The cost of the EDA phase 
is projected to be about a billion dollars. It probably will 
entail an augmentation of fusion program appropriations in the 
course of the fourth PCRD, even before construction of the 
apparatus, which will require substantially greater investments 
in the fusion program. 
  In the very short term, financing for the fusion program as 
a 
whole will be difficult in 1994, owing to extreme budgetary 
stringencies affecting the third PCRD. [table omitted] 
<H5>  (4) Ground-based astronomy </H5>
  a) The European Southern Observatory (ESO) is the European 
research umbrella for ground-based astronomy. Its charter is 
modeled on that of CERN. ESO today has eight member states. The 
organization gives European astronomers access to a large, 
modern observatory located at La Silla, in Chile. Its major 
project, approved in late 1987, is construction of the Very 
Large Telescope (VLT), which by the end of the century will be 
the most powerful telescope in the world. 
  ESO's total budget for 1992 was 113 million German marks 
[DM] 
(Fr385 million), of which close to DM46 million represents 
investment in the VLT. Personnel expenditures are 32 percent of 
the budget. France is providing 24.7 percent of the funds (its 
contribution will grow from Fr95 million in 1992 to Fr97 million 
in 1993). 
  The VLT is a cluster of four telescopes, each equipped with 
an 8-meter-diameter mirror. Fabrication of these mirrors is a 
technological challenge in itself, since the primary mirrors 
will be shaped like thin menisci whose shape must be 
continuously adjusted using active optical technology. The VLT 
will be installed at Paranal, 500 km north of La Silla, site of 
the current ESO telescopes. The infrastructural work begun in 
1991 will continue, in particular evaluation of seismic risks 
and a study of near-surface geological strata. Contracts for 
providing the foundations (Schott) and smoothing the mirrors 
(Reosc) are proceeding as planned. 
  CNRS's National Institute of Physical Sciences (INSU) is 
preparing the French astronomical community for the arrival of 
this very large facility. In accordance with ESO's policy, VLT's 
focusing apparatus will be fabricated at laboratories of member 
countries. French teams are involved in two of the 
instrumentation projects: 


    -  development of a multi-object fiber spectrograph, 
Fuegos (French-Swiss-Italian consortium under the direction of 
the Paris observatory); 
  -  development of a spectroscopic imaging instrument for the 
10-micron window (Franco-Dutch consortium under the direction of 
the DSM/CEA astrophysics service in Saclay). 

    Also, special efforts are being made in the field of optic 
interferometry. Contracts have been signed with ESO to develop 
(in France) improvements in the interferometric instrumentation: 
development and fabrication of very small deformable mirrors 
(Marseille observatory), and development of a system of 
[interference] fringe monitoring. 
  A convention was signed in December 1992 between ESO, the 
Max 
Planck Gesellschaft (MPG), and INSU for amplification of VLT's 
interferometric mode: The idea is to supplement the ESO proposal 
for two auxiliary telescopes 2 meters in diameter (VISA/VLTI 
[VLT Interferometric Sub Array]) with a third telescope and a 
delay line, which will greatly strengthen its imaging 
capabilities. Over a three-year period beginning in 1993, France 
will contribute Fr17 million to this improvement. 
  b) The Canada-France-Hawaii telescope (CFH) is financed by 
equal lump-sum contributions from the University of Hawaii, the 
Canadian National Research Council, and INSU. These institutions 
are also sharing equally in financing of the 1991-1993 
instrumentation plan. 
  Out of the Fr16 million that CNRS is contributing in 1993, 
Fr10 million corresponds to personnel expenses; there is also 
Fr4 million to defray travel costs for users. 
  c) The Institute of Millimeter Radioastronomy (IRAM) 
received 
new support with the adhesion of the National Geographic 
Institute of Spain, which reduces CNRS's participation to 47 
percent. The growth in activities, now that antennas are fully 
operational and Spain is involved, explains the programmed 
budgetary growth. Out of the Fr33 million authorized for 1993, 
about Fr19 million is to meet personnel costs. 
  In 1994 and 1995 financing will be required for additional 
equipment on the Bure plateau to support Very Large Base 
Interferometry (VLBI), a project approved in December 1988; the 
project will be funded by INSU (since MPG financed the VLBI in 
Spain). 
  The proposal to add two antennas to the interferometry 
infrastructure on the Bure plateau will be deferred, as MPG has 
no plans to finance it in the short term. MPG and CNRS will 
review project development in June 1993, and a decision may be 
made in December 1993. CNRS's decision will be closely tied to 
the program to restructure French ground-based observation 
facilities. 
<H5>  (5) Space-based Astronomy </H5>
  The satellite and space probe programs of which French 
physicists have been beneficiaries have been carried out by CNES 
in collaboration with the European Space Agency, Russia, and the 
United States. CEA contributes to fabrication of some of the 
instrumentation. 
  a) The Hipparcos astrometry satellite launched in 1989 is 
still carrying out its original mission despite a very eccentric 
orbit, the result of problems during launch. High-level ESA 
teams have made substantial efforts to save the mission. In 
particular, ESA is financing four receiving stations at diverse 
longitudes (instead of a single station if the orbit were 
geostationary). The satellite's power supply should enable it to 
remain operational until mid-1994. The precision required for 
the five astronometric parameters (2 milliseconds of arc) very 
probably will be obtained. 
  Operating allocations (Fr3 million in 1993) are henceforth 
set aside for support of the French research teams involved. 
  b) The ISO satellite is part of ESA's scientific program. 
Launch date has been postponed from 1994 to 1995 because of 
snags in development. Four focal instruments will be launched. 
France, playing an important role in the consortium, is 
responsible for the ISOCAM camera; CEA is project leader. In the 
framework of another European consortium, France is 
participating in the large wavelength spectrometer. Nonpersonnel 
outlays programmed by CNES for 1993 amount to Fr55 million. 
Another Fr1 million is being provided from the CEA budget. 
  c) The first "cornerstone" of ESA's Horizon 2000 program 
includes: 


    -  the SOHO [Solar and Heliospheric Observatory] 
observatory, whose purpose is to study the internal structure of 
the corona and solar winds, scheduled for launch by NASA in 1995; 
  -  the "CLUSTER" mission to study small-scale fluctuations in 
the 
magnetosphere with the help of four identical satellites 
positioned at key locations, also scheduled for launch in 1995 
or 1996, aboard one of Ariane 5's qualification flights. 

    French laboratories are closely involved, since France is 
project leader for six of the observation instruments, and CRPE 
[Center for Physical and Environmental Research] is responsible 
for important coordination functions at the European level. 
Development costs to CNES in 1993 come to Fr214 million, and CEA 
is contributing an additional Fr1 million. 
  d) The second "cornerstone" of ESA's Horizon 2000 program is 
the XMM observatory. Its cost, apart from the apparatus itself, 
is estimated at 531 million 1991 ECU. The industrial 
construction phase is expected to get under way by the end of 
1993, with launch scheduled for 1999. 
  The basic objective of the XMM mission is the study of soft 
and medium-strength x-ray radiation (wavelengths between 1 and 
50 Angstroms) emitted by gases at very high temperatures (tens 
of millions of degrees) as a result of supernova explosions. 
Spatial imaging resolution is better than 0.5 minutes of arc. 
Spectral resolution is "medium." 
  The feasibility of the mirrors, which it was hoped could be 
molded onto a structure made of composite materials, has not 
been fully established: A more traditional but less lightweight 
solution based on nickel shells is being studied concurrently. 
  Instrumentation consists of three cameras, two 
spectrometers, 
and one optical monitor. French participation, which concerns 
the cameras on the principal focal plane, is in the framework of 
a consortium of European laboratories; three French space 
science laboratories are involved very closely with this project. 
  The French share of the construction budget for this newly 
embraced TGE is Fr15 million in 1993. It will increase 
incrementally to Fr169 million in 1996. 
  e) France's SIGMA on-board telescope, whose mission is to 
provide high-resolution spectral and angular imagery of the sky 
in the low-energy gamma-ray band, has been in operation since 
December 1989 on board the Soviet satellite "Granat." Given the 
importance of the results obtained, especially in the region of 
the galactic center, it was decided to continue operating this 
instrument for as long as possible. Since 1992, operating costs 
have been shared with Russia. CNRS will contribute Fr4 million 
in 1993 to defray nonpersonnel expenses, and CEA will contribute 
Fr1 million. 
<H5>  (6) Planetology </H5>
  a) The 1994-1996 Mars mission in cooperation with Russia is 
the first phase of exploration of the planet Mars, which will 
continue in a series of launches between now and the year 2000. 
The 1994 Mars probe will orbit the planet and leave small 
stations and penetrators. In 1996, a balloon and small vehicle 
will be dropped onto the planet's surface. CNES's share of the 
program this year will be Fr82 million. 
  b) The Cassini-Huygens mission is being developed for 
exploration of the planet Mars and its satellite Titan. It will 
be a joint Franco-American project. An orbital module (NASA) 
will be put into orbit around Saturn, while a descent module 
(ESA) will be dropped into the atmosphere of Titan. The mission 
is scheduled for launch by NASA in 1996. CNES will spend Fr74 
million on development in 1993, and CEA Fr3 million. 
  Funding for these two projects does not increase in 1993. 
<H5>  (7) Oceanology </H5>
  a) - The oceanological fleet TGE consists of the sea-going 
oceanographic vessels and their on-board equipment; the vessel 
most recently launched is the "Atlante," which went into service 
in 1991 equipped with an EM 12 multibeam depth sounder. 
  One facet of the fleet renewal program, funding of the 
future 
High-Seas Research Vessel (NRH) at a total estimated cost of 
Fr160 million, is divided over the 3-year period 1992-1994. 
  In 1993, Fr7 million is earmarked for repairs to the 
"Noroit" 
in addition to its quadrennial overhaul. In 1995, Fr10 million 
will be allocated for repairs to the "Suroit." 
  For 1995-1996, consideration is being given to program 
authorizations for Project Nereis, a light drilling vessel (Fr50 
million in 1995, Fr60 million in 1996). Appropriations for each 
fiscal period correspond to needed renovations or equipment 
maintenance. 
  In 1993, the oceanological fleet is allocated Fr158 million 
for operations. This endowment, insufficient to ensure optimal 
operating conditions, will increase in stages to Fr170 million 
in 1996. Most of the funds are earmarked for GENAVIR, (a 
subsidiary of IFREMER [French Research Institute for Exploration 
of the Sea]), and are used to defray salary costs. The equipment 
budget will increase from Fr60 million in 1993 to Fr70 million 
in 1996. 
  Expenses for IFREMER personnel serving on the oceanological 
fleet amount to about Fr3.2 million per year. [table omitted] 
  b) - Construction of the Marion Dufresne 2 (MD2), the new 
polar research vessel provisionally approved by the Council in 
February 1992, has now received the official nod. An economic 
interest group [GIE] to be composed of General Maritime Company 
(CGM) and the Polar Institute is now being formed. A contract 
has been signed between CGM, acting on behalf of the future GIE, 
and the shipbuilding yards at Havre, subject to final approval 
of a financial package. Total cost of the operation is Fr556 
million, of which Fr50 million is for scientific equipment and 
technical gear (cranes, winches, etc.) A project group is being 
established. 
  The MD2 will embody important improvements over MD1, 
including: 


    -  better accommodations for scientific personnel, in 
terms of both living quarters and working conditions 
(laboratories, analytical instruments, computers); 
  -  a more flexible propulsion system and better navigational 
equipment; 
  -  installation of a multibeam depth sounder. 

    The possibility of returning only once each year to 
Marseille 
is being studied in conjunction with the Polar Institute; this 
would increase the length of the annual oceanographic season and 
perhaps extend the vessel's operating radius to take in all of 
the Indian Ocean, to facilitate participation in various 
international cooperation programs (Indonesia, Australia, etc.). 
The recommendation of the Council on Very Large Facilities 
concerning "ice" rating was not followed. Implementing it would 
have been too costly. On the other hand, beginning this year, 
one-time funding requests are subject to the same scientific 
evaluation as other oceanographic projects. 
  The budget for the Polar Institute's fleet remains stable in 
1993 at Fr24 million. 
  c) The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) was initiated in 1968 in 
the United States (Deep Sea Drilling Project). In 1974, France 
became a partner in the first phase of this project, which 
concluded in 1983. The project enabled researchers to 
reconstruct the general history of the geological events over 
the last 200 million that led to the present configuration of 
the world's oceans and continents. 
  Since October 1984 (after a year devoted to planning and 
refitting the vessel), a new ODP program has been established; 
participating in it with the United States are seven 
international partners: Canada-Australia (consortium), France, 
Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, a 12-nation European 
consortium, and Russia. The heart of the program is the drilling 
vessel "Joides Resolution." Results stemming from the initial 
objectives have contributed to improving science's understanding 
of fluid circulation in the lithosphere and demonstrated their 
role in tectonic phenomena. The program has also contributed to 
the study of paleo-environments. 
  The French ODP community consists of about 230 researchers, 
engineers, and landside technicians. France's annual 
contribution is $2.75 million, or Fr18 million. Expenses for 
IFREMER personnel are estimated at Fr1.2 million per year, plus 
a companion appropriation of Fr1 million to aid French teams 
participating in the project. 
<H5>  (8) Earth Observation </H5>
  The Council reiterates that it is absolutely essential to 
establish some means of coordinating the preparation, operation, 
and scientific exploitation of the entire array of space-based 
earth observation programs. Despite the efforts of CNES, which 
created a committee on earth observation programs, the user 
communities are still too unstructured. 
  a) The Franco-American Topex-Poseidon satellite launched in 
August 1992 will complete its radar altimetry measurements of 
worldwide fluctuations in sea level, pinpointing areas of high 
and low "pressure" produced by oceanic circulation. France will 
contribute Fr106 million to this project in 1993, the year that 
analysis of the data gets under way. Discussions with the United 
States are currently being held to prepare a successor to that 
apparatus. The structure of the companion appropriations for 
this TGE is presented in summary form in the third part of this 
report. 
  b) The WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) program is 
devoted to the study, over a five-year period (1990-1995), of 
heat redistribution via oceanic circulation. It includes a 
program of hydrographic measurement and tracers that will cover 
all the oceans, laying of surface and subsurface floats, 
networks of current-measuring anchorages, and intensive 
utilization of altimetry data. 
  In all, worldwide hydrographic survey activity will amount 
to 
the equivalent of 25 ship-years. In addition to these 
observation programs, WOCE has plans to involve itself in the 
vital domain of simulations and data analysis, which will 
require substantially augmented data processing facilities. 
  The French part of the WOCE program is concentrated in two 
regions: the South Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean, 
including its antarctic part. IFREMER is responsible for 
development the of subsurface floats (over a two to three-year 
period). In 1992, nonpersonnel expenses amounted to Fr15 
million. This level will be maintained in 1993 and 1994 and then 
diminish. Personnel outlays remain stable at Fr4 million. 
  c) The ENVISAT program adopted at Granada in November 1992 
involves a series of satellites dedicated initially to the 
objectives of research on climate and terrestrial environment, 
especially radioactivity. It uses a mid-size platform optimized 
for payloads in the 1.5-ton range. The ENVISAT-1 platform will 
carry five instruments built by ESA and four financed on a 
national basis (pursuant to a "call for proposals"). 
  The ENVISAT-1 program will get under way in January 1993, 
looking toward a launch date in 1998 with an expected five-year 
orbital life. The budgetary cost to France in 1993 is Fr167 
million; the amount will increase each year thereafter, reaching 
Fr293 million in 1996. 
  d) The ERS (Earth Resource Satellite [or Earth Remote 
Sensing 
Satellite]) is an "optional" program for ESA. It consists of two 
satellites: ERS-1 and ERS-2. These satellites (the first was 
launched in July 1991, the second is to be launched in 1994) 
will carry out missions in oceanographic meteorology, primarily 
with the aid of UHF instruments that will permit continuous 
observation of the ocean surface (temperature, wind, waves) and 
ice. France's contribution is Fr1,200 million (in 1988 francs) 
to ERS-1 and Fr800 million (in 1990 francs) to ERS-2. Programmed 
CNES outlays in 1993 amount to Fr234 million. The ERS satellites 
will ensure continuous observation over a six-year period; in 
principle, they will then be replaced by ESA's POEM-1 (Polar 
Orbit Environment Monitoring) mission about 1998. 
  The Council notes that, as it had predicted, earlier 
decisions will once again have a very significant impact on 
spending in 1993. Between 1992 and 1995 there will be a 
substantial increase in resources allocated to earth observation. 
<H5>  (9) Geology and Interior Geophysics </H5>
  The Deep Geology of France (GPF) project has recently 
completed two drill holes in the Ardeche. In a meeting in 
November 1992, the scientific council for the program took note 
of the high quality of the multidisciplinary research conducted 
during the previous 18 months on materials from the first drill 
hole. 
  In early 1991, the program steering committee decided to 
elevate GPF to the status of a European-level program, 
reinforcing dialogue with the scientific communities of 
neighboring countries, and in particular strengthening links 
with the corresponding German program. The first step was to 
create a new scientific council on which several countries are 
now represented: Germany, Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, United 
Kingdom, and Switzerland. 
  The TGE Council believes the project has not yet reached a 
sufficiently mature stage to warrant examination and the 
rendering of an opinion. 
<H5>  (10) Condensed Matter Studies </H5>
  Beginning in 1994, European scientists at Grenoble doing 
research on condensed matter will have at their disposal a pair 
of installations unique in the world: the European Synchrotron 
Radiation Facility (ESRF) and the Laue Langevin Institute (ILL). 
  In addition, the French scientific community has its own 
national facilities, the LURE at Orsay and the Leon Brillouin 
Laboratory (LLB) at Saclay. 
  a) Neutron sources 
  The High Flux Reactor (RHF) is operated by the Laue Langevin 
Institute of Grenoble, a private French enterprise. An 
intergovernmental convention structures relations between it and 
its partners, the CEA and CNRS in France, the KFK in Karlsruhe 
in Germany, and the SERC [Scientific and Engineering Research 
Council] in the United Kingdom. Through the end of 1993, the 
annual budget will be funded by approximately equal 
contributions from the three partners (France's 1993 
contribution amounts to Fr134 million, taxes included). The 
French contribution covers the taxes in their entirety. 
  The RHF is currently idled, following discovery of cracks on 
the baffle plate of the heavy water circuit. In May 1992, the 
steering committee decided to completely overhaul the reactor at 
a cost of Fr173 million; financing was obtained by reprogramming 
funds within a budget that has remained unchanged (exclusive of 
taxes) from 1992 to 1993. Plans are to restart the reactor in 
July 1994. The reactor being almost completely rebuilt, one can 
expect it to remain in operation for 20 more years without major 
problems. 
  The English side has given formal notice it plans to 
withdraw 
from the international convention, which expires on 31 December 
1993. A codicil to the convention was negotiated between the 
partners and signed in March 1993. It authorizes a reduction in 
the English contribution. ILL has reorganized and implemented 
various steps to cut costs: Operations will be limited to five 
cycles (232 days), with only 25 instruments programmed, compared 
to six cycles (279 days) and 30 instruments before the shutdown. 
ILL plans to delegate responsibility for the spectrometers 
increasingly to research teams, under contracts analogous to 
those between ESRF and collaborating research groups [CRGs]; it 
also plans to develop additional scientific partnership 
conventions like those already in existence with Switzerland, 
Spain, and Austria. 
  The budget for 1994 is estimated at Fr270 million (1992 
francs), with contributions from partners covering only Fr240 
million. France's share will be Fr126 million (including Fr10 
million in taxes). Beginning in 1995, a Fr6 million reserve will 
be set aside to cover reprocessing of fuel elements currently in 
storage. [table omitted] 
  The Orpheus ["Orphee"] reactor and the Leon Brillouin 
Laboratory (LLB), a facility jointly owned by CEA and CNRS, are 
located at the Saclay research center. For 1993, the budget will 
be Fr120 million (including Fr68 million for data analysis 
operations). The reactor started up only about a dozen years ago 
and remains very modern. But maintenance outlays will have to be 
budgeted in 1994 and funds set aside, as with the RHF, for fuel 
reprocessing (Fr9 million in 1993, Fr12 million in 1994). 
  Neutron flux is four times weaker than in the RHF, but the 
reactor has a collection of features (two cold sources and one 
radioactive source) that give it useful characteristics. 
Twenty-one spectrometers are used in experiments. 
  The number of experiment proposals grew considerably in 1992 
(from 300 to 500) following shutdown of the RHF and remains at 
the higher level this year. To accommodate the surge in 
requests, CEA and CNRS have taken steps (Fri.1 million) to keep 
the reactor in operation and available for use as much of the 
time as possible (about 275 days). These measures will be 
continued in 1993 and 1994. 
  A new type of cold source, ring-shaped, may be installed in 
the reactor in 1994, to augment the amount of neutron flux 
available with existing equipment. No decision has been made 
thus far on proposed augmentation of the reactor's experimental 
capacities, which in any case cannot be completed without 
external partners or before the RHF is back in operation. The 
financing (Fr70 million), stretched over a 3-year period, could 
begin in 1993 with a Fr2 million allocation for studies. Actual 
work will be timed to coincide with the reactor's overhaul, 
which cannot be delayed beyond 1997. 
  French researchers have access to other neutron sources, 
including the ISIS pulsed source at England's Rutherford 
Appleton Laboratory. The CNRS-CEA-SERC accord on ISIS expired at 
the end of 1992; since French requests for access to ISIS more 
or less counterbalanced British requests for access to LLB, CEA 
and CNRS have proposed continued collaboration with SERC in the 
form of reciprocal access times at LLB and ISIS. In both cases, 
experiments are selected from proposals after discussion by a 
committee of experts. 
  b) Synchrotron radiation sources 
  The principal objective of the private company ESRF 
(European 
Synchrotron Radiation Facility) is to build and operate at 
Grenoble a synchrotron radiation source and ancillary 
instrumentation to be used by the scientific communities of 
contracting countries. The source, a 6 GeV electron-positron 
storage ring, is already producing hard x-ray beams of very high 
intensity, six months ahead of schedule. 
  ESRF will contribute to fundamental and applied research on 
the structure of condensed matter in domains such as physics, 
chemistry, crystallography, earth sciences, biology and 
medicine, surface phenomena, and the study of materials. The 
apparatus is financed by Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, 
Finland, France, Italy, Norway, Netherlands, United Kingdom, 
Sweden, and Switzerland. 
  Numerous experiment stations (beam lines) are under 
construction around the periphery of the storage ring. Even 
before tests of the radiation source have been successfully 
concluded, initial test experiments have been performed on the 
three beam lines already installed in the ring experiment 
building. These experiments confirm source consistency with 
respect to beam intensity and stability. 
  The floor stability problems noted in the experiment hall do 
not threaten to derail early completion of the project. 
Corrective measures are under way. Results of first efforts to 
fix the problem confirm the repair work has improved plate 
stability; it remains to be seen whether the improvement is 
permanent. This is why all lines currently being installed are 
clustered in the south half of the experiment building, so the 
floor can be replaced one section at a time, if necessary. 
  For 1993, the objective is to continue intensive testing of 
the first group of beam lines. A few scientific experiments may 
be scheduled concurrently. More than 20 experiment proposals 
have already been submitted. The first such experiments were 
conducted in December 1992. 
  Scientific exploitation of the facility will begin in 1994 
with seven fully tested beam lines (the number should reach 30 
by 1998). 
  France's share of the ESRF budget will be Fr156 million in 
1993. It will be Fr150 million in 1994, then drop to Fr126 
million in 1996. The share devoted to exploitation will 
increase, going from Fr26 million in 1994 to Fr50 million in 
1996. It should be noted that the Convention calls for the 
portion funded by France to decline from 33 percent during 
construction period to 27.5 percent after operations get under 
way. 
  In the framework of CRG contracts with ESRF, France is 
fitting two beam lines on cambered magnets. This equipment has 
been financed by the Ministry of Research, the Rhone-Alpes 
region, and the department of Isere (a total of Fr21 million 
over the three-year period from 1990 to 1992). An additional Fr6 
million from CEA and CNRS is in the pipeline to complete the 
project. Installation is scheduled for early 1993, with 
equipment going into service by the end of the year. 
  The Laboratory for Utilization of Electromagnetic Radiation 
(LURE) will receive a total 1993 endowment of Fr116 million 
provided by CNRS, CEA, and MEN [Ministry of National Education]. 
In keeping with the decision of the board of trustees, start-up 
financing will conclude in 1993. The cost of operating CLIO 
[Collaboration for an Infrared Laser at Orsay] has been included 
in the LURE budget. The EEC contract for "access to large 
installations," of which the laboratory was a beneficiary, 
expired in 1992. A new request has been prepared. 
  The growth in the number of users of synchrotron radiation 
and the aging of LURE's existing equipment have prompted 
consideration of the idea of building a new source that would 
become operational about the year 2000. The apparatus in 
question, "SOLEIL," is still on the drawing boards. Scientific 
justification and technical specifications are under 
preparation. A preliminary discussion may be found in part two 
of this report. 
  c) The EURECA [European Retrievable Carrier] space platform 
is a module launched by an American shuttle with recovery 
scheduled for several months later. On board are microgravity 
devices to produce semiconductor and protein crystals, treat 
alloys, and perform biological experiments. Compared to 
Spacelab, it has the advantage of being able to conduct longer 
missions under better microgravity conditions and with reduced 
safety requirements, but it demands more sophisticated 
automation of experiments, since there is no possibility of 
outside assistance. The primary payload consists of five 
multi-user instruments plus several national experiments (two 
were developed by French laboratories). 
  EURECA was launched in July 1992, and recovery is scheduled 
for sometime in the first half of 1993. The cost for CNES is 
Fr39 million for 1992 and Fr19 million for 1993. No further 
flights of this platform are currently scheduled. 
<H5>  (11) Life Sciences </H5>
  The life sciences community is making increased use of large 
facilities devoted to the study of condensed matter (synchrotron 
radiation and neutron diffusion). 
  The European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in 
Heidelberg is a facility that offers European scientists a 
cluster of high-quality semi-heavy scientific instruments. It 
also has two branches at ILL in Grenoble and the DESY Laboratory 
in Hamburg. This laboratory, a 15-nation project, has evolved 
into one of the best in Europe in the fields of cellular and 
structural biology. It is particularly active in the domains of 
cellular biology, differentiation, biological structures and 
information systems, genetic expression, physical 
instrumentation, biochemical instrumentation, information 
processing services, and data banks. It also conducts training 
for researchers who are completing or have already completed 
their doctorates. 
  EMBL has plans to expand its Grenoble branch, to take more 
advantage of the ESRF, and to establish a new branch (European 
biological information systems), the site for which had not yet 
been chosen by the time this report was prepared. 
  Contributions by member states in 1993 will amount to DM68 
million (up 11 percent from 1991). Personnel expenses account 
for close to 60 percent of the budget. The French contribution 
(16.7 percent) will be DM11.5 million, equal to about Fr39 
million. 
  Considering the size of the financial investment, the level 
of participation of French researchers is still too low, and the 
Council urges that incentives be offered to the French 
scientific community to promote increased participation by 
French scientists in the work of EMBL. [table omitted] 
<H5>  (12) Interdisciplinary Projects </H5>
  Under this heading are two research programs that involve 
diverse disciplines. 
  a) Detection of gravity waves (Project VIRGO) 
  This project in fundamental science, under the leadership of 
CNRS/IN2P3, involves a broad spectrum of physicists and 
astrophysicists, theoreticians, and experimenters. It was 
approved by the Council in 1992, and in cooperation with Italy 
it has now been launched. CNRS is considering committing a Fr40 
million program authorization in 1993 to this project, which is 
described in detail in part two of this report. 
  b) Manned space flights 
  These are experiments carried out with human beings in 
attendance, under microgravity conditions (10[.sup]-3[/] to 
10[.sup]-5[/] g). The primary areas of research involved are: 
  --study of human behavior during manned flight: 


    -  understanding the effects of gravity on the process of 
perception and spatial orientation; 
  -  analysis of adaptive responses of major physiological 
functions 
to microgravity (cardiovascular and immune systems) 

    --biology: reproductive functions, radiation environment and 
its effects on living tissue; 
  --physical sciences in general: materials, crystal growth, 
atomic physics, etc. 
  The latter two research categories do not require the 
presence of human beings and could be pursued with robotic 
equipment. 
  CNRS in 1993 will spend Fr170 million on all these programs, 
the cost of which is bound to increase. The manned flight 
program is an important element of bilateral collaboration 
programs (United States, Russia) and the ESA program (notably 
the European contribution to the Freedom space station, which 
could require sizable investments). 
  The Council does not yet have a clear vision of the level of 
resources France is prepared to commit under these three 
categories and questions the scientific priority of these 
programs. 
<H5>  (13) Technical/operational Facilities </H5>
  Outlays programmed under this heading are noted here only 
for 
purposes of information, and only for those international 
facilities that deserve the appellation "very large facility." 
Programming decisions concerning them fall outside the 
competence of the TGE Council. 
  a) Construction of the European Transonic Wind Tunnel (ETW) 
at Porz (Germany) continued in 1992, remaining on schedule. The 
goal of completing the mechanical engineering was met. The 
calibration and testing phase is next. Inauguration of the 
facility is set for June 1993. 
  Projections of total cost remain under the budget ceilings 
set by the governments of the four participating countries 
(France, Germany, Great Britain, Netherlands). France's 
28-percent share of costs in the construction phase (which ends 
in 1994) will translate in 1993 into a Fr37 million contribution 
from the Ministry of Transport (and an equal amount from the 
Ministry of Defense). 
  b) The METEOSAT network of meteorological satellites in 
geostationary orbit was developed under the overall lead of the 
European Space Agency and is exploited by the meteorological 
organization EUMETSAT [European Meteorological Satellite 
Organization]. France's share in 1992 was financed with a Fr139 
million contribution from the Ministry of Transport (national 
meteorological directorate). This subsidy is listed in the BCRD 
under technical programs. The corresponding amount for 1993 will 
be Fr197 million. 
  Data collected by these satellites is used primarily by the 
meteorological forecasting services. It is also used in research 
on climatic change, especially research on cloud cover. [table 
omitted] 
  The operational character of the METEOSAT satellite network 
prompted EUMETSAT to reposition one of its satellites to 
compensate for the delay in stationing of an American satellite, 
thus to ensure coverage of the Atlantic zone for the United 
States. One of the tangible benefits from this action was the 
detection of Hurricane Andrew last August and issuance of an 
alert a week before its passage over Florida. The expected 
increase in appropriations between 1993 and 1996 will be 
sufficient to keep the existing system operational until about 
the year 2000 (construction of two additional satellites and one 
launch), to begin building the new-generation satellites that 
will replace them, and finally to fund European participation 
(per international agreements) in observations from polar orbit, 
which today only the United States can conduct. The budget 
augmentation is less than projected initially. In fact, from a 
technical standpoint the METEOSAT satellite system is doing so 
well that the launch date for the next satellites could slip 
without jeopardizing continuity of EUMETSAT operations; having 
loaned METEOSAT-3 to the United States to cover for the delay in 
orbiting GOES-Next, we can expect the favor to be reciprocated 
at some point, should the METEOSAT system run into problems. 
France therefore has persuaded EUMETSAT to stretch out financing 
of the project. 
<H5>  Commentary on Future Needs </H5>
  The elements appearing in Tables I-1 to I-6, in particular 
I-6, "Summary by Disciplines," prompt the Council to make the 
following observations: 


    -  In elementary particle physics, the future of the 
discipline depends on whether it is decided to build the LHC at 
CERN: The Organization by the end of 1993 must furnish the 
information needed to make a final decision, but already it 
appears that building the detectors is likely to pose difficult 
problems at the level of national agencies and institutions. 
  -  The Council has noted CEA's intention to cease operating the 
Saturne accelerator in 1996 in order to move ahead along new 
lines of research using the GANIL beginning in 1994 (radioactive 
ion beams). This change of direction has not been expressly 
confirmed by CNRS, which exploits the equipment on a shared 
basis with CEA. The Council still hopes to see an international 
project elaborated to build a 15-GeV continuous-beam electron 
accelerator. 
  -  In the domain of controlled nuclear fusion, it is noted that 
the budget for Tore-Supra [Super Torus] is returning to normal 
levels, after a temporary dip in 1992. Also, the Council notes 
that the detailed planning phase of Project ITER is now under 
way. To the extent that this facility would be realized outside 
Europe, in a global context, the Council is not certain whether 
it is qualified to render an opinion on that subject. 
  -  The Council notes with satisfaction the progress on 
construction of the VLT, and is pleased that INSU has made 
available the supplementary funds needed to expand that 
instrument's interferometric mode. 
  -  In the sector of space-based astronomy, the Council notes the 
delay in construction of the ISO satellite. It also points out 
that it was not consulted before approval of the XMM mission. 
  -  In oceanology, construction of the two vessels recently 
approved by the Council (the NRH and the Marion Dufresne 2) is 
proceeding as planned. 
  -  In the domain of earth observation, the sizable augmentation 
in 
financial requirements already foreseen last year has been 
confirmed (up Fr155 million). It is bound to continue, given the 
higher funding levels that will be required for ENVISAT-1: Fr90 
million more in 1995 than in 1993. Like the XMM, this 
environmental study mission, adopted at the Granada conference, 
was not the subject of consultation with the Council. 
  -  Programmed outlays in the condensed matter sector will 
steadily 
decline (down Fr85 million) between 1992 and 1996, thanks to 
completion of the construction phase of ESRF and operational 
economies at ILL. This could leave room for the possibility of 
new projects, but reprogramming to other scientific domains 
(e.g. Project VIRGO) must also be taken into consideration. 
  -  The Council is pleased that an accord guaranteeing the 
long-term future of ILL has been signed with the two partners, 
English and German, despite the attendant financial restrictions 
on full exploitation of the facility. 
  -  The Council notes with satisfaction the fact that progress on 
construction of the ESRF continues ahead of schedule, as well as 
the high quality of the x-ray beaming equipment furnished. 
  -  The Council continues to question the pertinence of the 
expenditures for manned space flights, the scientific utility of 
which still appears to it unclear. 

<H5>    Part Two: Progress on Projects and new Projects </H5>
  Only one TGE proposal advanced sufficiently in 1992, in 
terms 
of planning within the scientific community, for the Council to 
take it up to render a definitive opinion: That project (VIRGO) 
is discussed in this second part of this report, accompanied by 
the Council's recommendations. 
  In addition, the Council received updates on the status of 
progress in the SOLEIL synchrotron radiation accelerator project 
and the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN. The status of these 
two projects and the Council's preliminary recommendations are 
also presented in this second part of the report. 
  As previously noted, in rendering its opinions the Council 
decided to put most emphasis on the following points: 


    -  the scientific value of the project and its impact on 
the discipline concerned; 
  -  the size of the community of potential users and the 
structuring role of the facility for that community; 
  -  the role of the facility at the international level, and 
analysis of the cooperation expected; 
  -  construction and exploitation costs, attendant laboratory 
costs, personnel needs, and ramifications for institutional and 
agency budgets. 

    These conditions have already been formulated explicitly in 
the previous reports. 
<H5>  Project VIRGO </H5>
  The Council in May 1992 formally took up the Franco-Italian 
gravity wave detection proposal (VIRGO) submitted by the 
director general of CNRS. 
  The Council had examined the project previously, in April 
1990. At that time it indicated its interest in the scientific 
objective pursued and noted the high technical caliber and 
overall quality of the scientific teams proposing it; it 
underlined the necessity for further strengthening these teams 
and continuing with the research and development needed for 
fabrication of the antenna and precise evaluation of costs. The 
analysis, presented in the 1991 report, is updated in what 
follows. 
  Scientific program: Modern theories of gravitation predict 
that a group of accelerated masses can engender gravitational 
radiation. General relativity, the best known and most accepted 
of these theories, allows of precise predictions of the 
properties and intensity of this radiation. Close study of 
pulsar PSR 1913 + 16 has established that the slowdown of the 
binary system to which this pulsar belongs is fully consistent 
with the hypothesis of the emission of gravity waves. Their 
direct observation would be still more convincing. Even more 
importantly, such detection would have the long-term consequence 
of giving birth to a new mode of observation in astrophysics. 
The physical observation being sought is an infinitesimal 
variation in the distance between two mass points during the 
passage of a gravity wave. 
  The only detectable signals--and they are very weak--come 
from condensed astrophysical objects. The collapse of the core 
of a supernova situated in our galaxy will generate a brief 
signal (1 millisecond), one of the most intense imaginable, but 
this type of event is rather infrequent. It is thus necessary to 
be able to detect more distant supernovas. Consequently we must 
aim for a relative sensitivity of 10[.sup]-21[/] to 
10[.sup]-22[/] (approximately the ratio between the radius of 
an atom and the distance between the earth and the sun). Such 
sensitivity would also make possible the observation of other 
sources whose existence is all but certain. 
  In short, this is an experiment in fundamental physics which 
requires recourse to highly multidisciplinary technologies, and 
whose impact on astrophysics, albeit long-term, could be 
essential. 
  Technical characteristics of the project: The development of 
laser metrology opens up the possibility today of 
interferometric detection of gravity waves thanks to increased 
sensitivity over a wide band of frequencies. This approach is 
much more promising than those hitherto explored. 
  The interferometry projected for VIRGO has the structure of 
a 
Michaelson [interferometer], i.e. a separating plate that splits 
the laser beam into two waves propagating along two 
perpendicular arms. The passage of a gravity wave train induces 
differential deformation of the two arms, producing a phase 
displacement of the partial wave, thus a change in observed 
luminosity. The optimal signal level (differential phase 
displacement of the two arms) is reached when the optical length 
L of each arm is equivalent to one-fourth the length of the 
gravity wave. For a band of frequencies below the kilohertz 
[kHz], this yields optical paths greater than 75 km in length. 
  Inasmuch as such a length is not practically attainable, the 
arms of the interferometric apparatus, 3 km long, form a 
Fabry-Perot [resonating] chamber with a grid fineness rating of 
50. Despite this optimization, the effect to be measured is 
still infinitesimal (10[.sup]-16[/] m). 
  Preparations for VIRGO were responsible for several complex 
technical advances: computer-programmed simulations of the 
precise characteristics of optical components, vibration 
isolation, high vacuum in a large container, and an extremely 
stable single-mode Neodymium/YAG laser. 
  It is important to note that indisputable proof of the 
existence of gravity waves can only be obtained by simultaneous 
detection of these waves by two independent detection devices, 
to be certain of eliminating ground noise mimicking the signal 
being investigated. 
  Structure of the project: New researchers, engineers, and 
technicians became involved in the project in 1991. About 90 
people are currently participating in it. 
  Project teams have made considerable progress in defining 
and 
testing all components of the antenna with the exception of 
mirrors. 
  As early as 1991, the scientific value of the project was 
accepted unreservedly by scientific experts independent of the 
project. The reliability of the technology, the modalities, and 
the cost of building the antenna were set forth in February 1992 
in the "Final Conceptual Design" (FCD) prepared by the Italian 
and French promoters. At the request of INFN [Italian National 
Institute of Nuclear Physics] and CNRS, experts reviewed it in 
April 1992. The experts have submitted a very favorable 
recommendation, which was taken into consideration along with 
subsequent comments from the scientists concerned. 
  Investment and timetable: This favorable evaluation led CNRS 
to request a formal opinion from the Council, with a view to 
giving top priority in the TGE program to finance this project. 
The antenna would be installed at Cascina, near Pisa. 
Construction would last six years and cost 81 million ECU in 
1992 currency (about Fr540 million), to be divided between INFN 
(55 percent) and CNRS (45 percent). Personnel needs have been 
estimated at about 500 man-years. Most personnel will be 
researchers, engineers, or technicians belonging to INFN or 
CNRS; their salaries are not included in the above figures. 
  International context: Detection of gravity waves is the 
subject of research in all major countries, but especially the 
United States and Europe. Project VIRGO today is collaborating 
closely with America's counterpart Project LIGO and receives 
scientific and technical support from English and German 
researchers. 
  After Britain's SERC backed off from a joint project with 
Germany's MPG, that project was shelved. But European efforts to 
build at least one antenna in Europe are being more closely 
coordinated. A tripartite ad hoc committee--called for in an 
April 1992 declaration of common interest signed by CNRS, INFN, 
and MPG--met in Geneva in May of that year. It recommended that 
German, British, French, and Italian physicists and engineers 
expand technical collaboration and coordinate their research and 
development efforts. Representatives of MPG confirmed their 
interest, though the latter is not currently in a position to 
participate in financing. 
  Collaboration with the American Project LIGO (which calls 
for 
two antennas in the United States) has been expanded, with a 
view to correlating future American and European observational 
data. In comparing the two projects, the Council made the 
following comments: 


    -  In its initial version, VIRGO will be able to make 
finer measurements: The American antennas will be much less 
sensitive below 50 Hz and about equal between 100 and 10,000 Hz; 
  -  there are significant design differences between VIRGO and 
LIGO, a fact which will reinforce the credibility of signals 
detected by all the antennas; 
  -  assuming the existence of two 
American antennas with sensitivity equal to VIRGO, the latter's 
presence would significantly augment the probability of 
detecting a signal; 
  -  the two LIGO antennas will not be built simultaneously: NSF 
[National Science Foundation] estimates that the second will be 
completed a little less than two years after the first, and 
VIRGO would be completed before the second American 
antenna. 

    In consequence, given the acknowledged value of the 
scientific objective pursued, the quality of the proposing 
research teams, the excellence of their comprehensive 
description of the project, the solid European cooperation 
embedded in it, and the collaboration already established with 
Project LIGO (which was launched in 1992), the Council 
recommends unreservedly that: 


    -  this project proceed to the construction phase as early 
as possible, i.e. as soon as research budgets permit; 
  -  the agencies and institutions put in place a very well 
articulated structure for the project group, with 
responsibilities well defined, to assure strong coordination and 
complementarity of French and Italian teams working on 
subsystems of the novel and highly technical antenna; 
  -  progress on the project be reviewed at regular intervals by a 
review committee composed of experts not involved in the project; 
  -  as early as possible the appropriate manufacturers be 
informed 
of or involved in development of project components, especially 
the mirrors. 

    The CNRS's council on large instruments has also endorsed 
Project VIRGO. But the construction schedule and corresponding 
program authorizations have been altered to take into account 
what CNRS can contribute (Fr40 million for construction) and to 
smooth out the 1994 spending surge entailed by the optimal 
timetable proposed in the FCD. This means about six months' 
slippage in completion of the project. 
  The Italian partner, INFN, has accorded it top priority 
among 
its special projects for the next five-year plan, which is to be 
negotiated during the first half of 1993. 
<H5>  Project SOLEIL </H5>
  The Council has already mentioned, in its 1992 report, the 
deliberations of the Prospects Committee established in 1990 by 
CNRS, CEA, and the Ministry of National Education to evaluate 
the synchrotron radiation needs of the French scientific 
community. The institutions' request was motivated by problems 
of aging of some equipment at the LURE laboratory, in particular 
the linear injection accelerator and the DCI ring [Igloo 
Collision Device]. In the document that it prepared ("Rapport du 
Comite de Prospective pour l'utilisation du rayonnement 
synchrotron en France," H. Benoit et al., July 1991), the 
Prospects Committee categorically recommended construction of a 
new storage ring to complement the ESRF (which operates in the 
hard x-ray range). This new ring would enable France to hold 
onto its position in the far ultraviolet to soft x-ray range 
despite scheduled decommissioning of LURE's installations. The 
ring, with an energy level of about 2 GeV, should have the 
characteristics of so-called "third-generation" devices and be 
able to function either at high intensity or with a low number 
of packets to permit experiments involving time correlations. 
  In that connection, the LURE scientific community conducted 
a 
study of the laboratory's future in the year 2000 and France's 
synchrotron radiation needs once ESRF becomes operational. The 
result was a November 1991 draft proposal for "Optimized Source 
of Intermediate-Energy Light at LURE" (SOLEIL). This document 
gives a brief description of a 2.15 GeV machine, indicates the 
principal technical variables that dictate the structure of the 
project, and gives a more exhaustive presentation of scientific 
arguments in favor of the new equipment. 
  As of early 1993, a fuller technical study is being 
prepared, 
with detailed evaluation of the cost of construction for the 
machine, eventual supporting facilities, and scientific 
equipment. 
  At the current stage of thinking, the institutions 
concerned--CNRS, CEA, DRED [Directorate of Research and Doctoral 
Studies] (Ministry of National Education)--have not yet come to 
a decision whether to support the project, hence whether to 
request a formal opinion from the TGE Council. 
  The Council, which has expressed the desire to be kept 
informed not only of fully matured projects but also of those 
for which preparatory work is well advanced, asked one of its 
members (G. Ferey) for a report on the current status of SOLEIL. 
The report was given at the Council meeting in November 1992. 
The principal elements of G. Ferey's report, and comments from 
the Council during the discussion, are summarized below. 
<H5>  National and international context </H5>
  a) LURE Laboratory: The current status of the LURE 
laboratory 
is described in the "SOLEIL" report. The laboratory presently 
operates three machines: the DCI, the Super-ACO, and the 
injector that serves both. 
  DCI: Built between 1971 and 1975 for high-energy physics, it 
was used for that purpose for 9 years but was converted in 1985 
into a synchrotron radiation source. The 1.85-GeV energy beam 
generates photons at energy levels between 3 and 25 keV 
[kiloelectron volts] on magnetic dipole lines and 3-40 keV on 
lines from the superconducting wiggler. The machine is notable 
for the exceptional duration of its powerful beam (55 hours at 
an intensity of 300 milliamperes [mA]). It is handicapped in 
some experiments however by the large transverse dimension of 
the positron packet (hence of the optical source), the lack of 
sufficient space surrounding the ring, and limitations on the 
number of insertions (only one in practice). It presently has 22 
experiment stations. Start-up funds provided in 1990 should be 
sufficient to ensure acceptable operations up to the end of the 
decade. 
  Super-ACO: Built between 1982 and 1987, this ring was the 
first of the so-called third-generation machines dedicated to 
synchrotron radiation. The source is small in size, and its 
cross-sections can accommodate up to six undulators. At present 
it has 28 experiment stations operated full-time or on a shared 
basis around the ring. It currently is the best machine in the 
extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray range. With energy of 800 MeV 
[megaelectron volts], it permits coverage of the visible band up 
to 5 keV and will soon operate in the millimetric wavelength 
range (the SIRLOIN experiment now in the final stages). 
  It is the only machine that makes such massive use of 
temporal structuring of the beam, which operates 50 percent of 
the time in a stable two-packet mode, with a 120-nanosecond 
interval, at a total intensity of 200 mA, while the other half 
of the time it operates in a 24-packet mode at a total intensity 
of 400 mA for production of high-flux photons. 
  Injector: This is a linear accelerator with energy of 2.3 
GeV 
which with the help of a converter generates positrons with 
energy of 1.1 GeV. The choice of positrons is justified by the 
fact that they make it possible to obtain beams that are more 
stable and have longer duration than electrons. The oldest part 
of this apparatus dates from 1957, the most recent from 1968. 
  With this impressive equipment endowment and with what might 
be called its adolescent years behind it, LURE has grown 
considerably in recent years. In 1991 it had close to 1,300 
users working at some forty experiment stations--a load factor 
that makes use of almost all possible beam lines. Seventy-five 
percent of users are French (European demand has been rising 
steeply over the last two years), and participation is evenly 
balanced between the Paris region and the provinces; industrial 
demand (including demand assimilable to industry, such as 
calibration of on-board satellite instruments for ESA via IAS 
[Institute of Space Astrophysics], or experiments conducted by 
CEA's DAM [Directorate of Military Applications]) accounts for 
about 10 percent of all work sessions. The number of projects 
submitted and the number of users have more than doubled in the 
last 6 years. This trend, noted at LURE as well as other 
centers, shows no sign of leveling off--quite the opposite. 
  LURE's weak points have to do with the age of some of the 
equipment: The injector is old, too big, and very costly to 
maintain; the DCI ring, built 20 years ago for elementary 
particle physics, is no longer competitive with machines being 
built now. On the other hand, the Super-ACO could continue to 
play an important role in its domain for many more years if 
furnished with a modern injector. 
  b) Status of the project vis-a-vis ESRF: ESRF is beginning 
to 
get into operation at Grenoble well ahead of schedule, and is 
already obtaining excellent beam quality. However, several 
objective considerations argue for giving French researchers 
access to a complementary machine that operates at lower energy 
levels: 


    -  The ESRF source is unable to cover the ultraviolet to 
far-ultraviolet to soft x-ray range (photons with energy less 
than 1 keV, basically the domain of Super-ACO). Also, it is 
unlikely that the time-structured configuration can be used with 
the ESRF synchrotron radiation source; 
  -  our financial contribution will give French researchers 
access 
to about 25 percent of ESRF's operational availability, the 
equivalent of about ten full-time experiment stations (including 
time used by collaborating research groups). 

    Access will thus be difficult and competition very tough. 
Experience in the neutron domain has demonstrated the utility of 
having, along with ILL, facilities at LLB for purposes of 
training users, conducting standard analytic tests, preparing 
original experiments, developing new technologies, and serving 
the needs of industry. 
  c) Other projects in Europe: Several facilities that are 
comparable to SOLEIL (energies between 1.3 and 2.5 GeV) and 
complementary to ESRF are already in operation or under 
construction in neighboring countries: 


    -  In Germany, DORIS III (at Hamburg) will be augmented, 
per a very recent decision, by the BESSY II in Berlin, a 
third-generation ring optimized for the ultraviolet-far 
ultraviolet-soft x-ray range; 
  -  In Italy, ELETTRA will enter into service in Trieste in 1994 
with a program very comparable to that of SOLEIL; 
  -  In the United Kingdom, since 1987, the SRS at Daresbury has 
been Europe's best source of high-intensity x-rays. A new 
machine is under study (DAPS [Daresbury Advanced Photon 
Source]); In Sweden, construction of the MAX II at Lund has been 
authorized; In Spain, plans are being considered to install a 
2.5-GeV synchrotron in Catalonia (Barcelona). 

    Technical characteristics of the project: Project SOLEIL is 
the result of taking the following factors into consideration: 


    -  user requests, described hereinafter; 
  -  the experience acquired in developing ACO, DCI, and 
Super-ACO; 
  -  experience at the international level, ESRF in particular. 

    The project starts from the concept of a 2.15-GeV positron 
storage ring (i.e. with enough energy for the undulator to 
function properly in the kiloelectron volt range) with about 
thirty emission points, about one-third of which are multi-user, 
for a total of about forty experiment stations. The 
circumference of the ring is close to 200 m. Its energy is 
comparable to third-generation machines such as ELETTRA and 
BESSY II. With optimization of parameters, the ring can be very 
compact and cost-effective. 
  The apparatus supports maximum-flux operation with a total 
intensity of 300 mA (240 packets) and beam life of 15 to 20 
hours, the possibility of operations with one to six packets, 
and unit intensities of 10 mA for more than 10 hours with 
excellent emissivity (greater than Super-ACO at 800 MeV, and 10 
times greater than DCI). It should be noted, and this is the 
most novel feature of the project, that the solution adopted 
meets user needs in terms of both emissivity and beam duration, 
accommodating both temporal structuring and high flux. 
  Most of the technical decisions have already been made, 
thanks in part to the experience acquired by LURE itself and to 
the optimizing solutions adopted by other centers. This is the 
case in particular for alignment techniques, which will be based 
on ESRF's experience (alignment by hydraulic level, with lifters 
capable of effecting displacements on the micrometric scale in a 
gamut of frequencies ranging from .1 to several dozen Hertz 
while preserving excellent time precision). 
  Already finalized options concern utilization of positrons 
(despite its initial cost), sextipoles fully integrated into the 
quadripoles, generalized utilization of split-pair control of 
beam elements, the vacuum chamber, injection, photon beam 
stability, and topography of the building. 
  Two options are still open. They concern radiofrequency 
acceleration and beam lines, an area where LURE, despite its own 
experience, is very closely following developments under way at 
other centers to stabilize photon beams. 
  As for the injector, in light of the experience amassed and 
the options adopted in numerous other projects, the proposal is 
leaning toward the idea of a booster synchrotron adjoining the 
positron source rather than a long linear accelerator. 
Accordingly, the system will include: 


    -  a 200-MeV linear electron accelerator delivering beam 
pulses of 2 to 5 A [Angstrom units] via an electron-positron 
converter; 
  -  a converter (e[.sup]+[/]/e[.sup]-[/] output =0.02 GeV); 
  -  a linear positron accelerator with an energy of 400 MeV; 
  -  a booster synchrotron accelerating the positrons at 2.15 GeV 
before injection into the ring, the two accelerators being built 
by a company with expertise in the field. 

    With the booster option, and assuming it is built at the 
Orsay site, the estimated cost is Fr700 million HT (1991 
prices). The proposal calls for financing in two stages. The 
first (five year) stage corresponds to construction of the 
machine and two-thirds of the beam lines; the second, also five 
years long, would see installation of the final one-third of the 
lines and introduction of experiments. 
  Scientific justification: This takes into account the strong 
pressure for utilization of methodologies already mastered, 
openness toward other research sectors, and the possibility of 
new upstream research in the physics of radiation-matter 
interactions. For the source to have characteristics that meet 
these three objectives, three options were explicitly adopted: 
spectral range, temporal structure, and photon beam polarity. A 
doubly versatile machine was needed: coverage of both UV and 
x-ray bands by numerous insertion units, and operations at 
either high intensity or utilizing the unique temporal beam 
structure of this type of machine. Beyond the intensive 
discussions between engineers and researchers entailed by these 
objectives, an instrument was required which, from an 
interdisciplinary perspective, was optimized in an energy range 
where coupling of structural and electronic research is 
maximized. 
  a) In atomic and molecular physical chemistry, the 
challenges 
first of all concern particles that are unstable or difficult to 
produce. These include radicals and transitory particles that 
govern elementary chemical reactions, van der Waals molecules 
and aggregates, the structure and reactivity of which are not 
precisely understood, and simple and multiple-charge ions found 
in plasmas, the ionosphere, or in interstellar space. Owing to 
high densities, high-resolution spectroscopy of these particles 
is essential. SOLEIL's high-flux capabilities, in the 
ultraviolet as well as x-ray region, will provide that 
resolution; its pulsed character will allow spectroscopy of 
threshold electrons and field ionization. Apart from current 
developments in ion disintegration (selective photochemical 
reactions, dissociation dynamics), this domain is not yet well 
developed, owing to insufficient intensities, whereas in this 
energy range the typical nuclear vibration cycles are equivalent 
in time-span to the duration period of gaps in the inner shells 
(10 fs [femtoseconds]), giving rise to interference effects not 
yet well explored. 
  Finally, in this sector of research, SOLEIL will make it 
possible to perform experiments combining two sources of photons 
(RS [radioscopic source] + laser, or RS + free-electron laser) 
for the study of ionization of excited particles and dynamics of 
short-term dissociation (50 ps [picoseconds]) in order to 
understand transition states in the break-up of complex 
molecules. 
  b) In biophysics, the demand of biocrystallographers in the 
areas of x-ray diffraction, diffusion, and absorption is 
constantly growing. The domains concerned, where the frantic 
pace of international competition impels us to decisive and 
immediate action, range from time crystallography to the study 
of molecular interaction with very large groups of molecules, to 
studies of microcrystal structure, to resolution of the phase 
problem by use of anomalous dispersion at variable wavelengths. 
In this respect, SOLEIL is complementary to existing facilities 
elsewhere, Grenoble in particular. 
  The other category concerns the study, using pulse 
fluorometry, of dynamic and structural properties of proteins in 
solution and multimolecular systems (membranes, micells). 
Synchrotron radiation, which makes it possible to repeat a great 
number of measurements across a wide range of wavelengths of 
excitation, offers the only means of meeting this demand. The 
tunability of energy wavelengths and operability with small 
numbers of packets complement the picosecond laser measurements; 
the high flux levels of SOLEIL's undulators permit studies of 
weakly fluorescent samples as well as kinetic experiments with 
excellent quantification potential. 
  c) In the domain of surfaces and interfaces, the synchrotron 
remains an essential tool, notwithstanding near-field 
microscopy. In the hard x-ray domain, ESRF opens up new 
possibilities, but a majority of experiments must continue to 
rely on an intense white source centered in the soft x-ray 
region (hv less than 3 keV), which ESRF covers rather poorly. By 
permitting x-ray absorption in polarized light, combined with 
anomalous glancing diffraction and stationary waves, it supports 
structural, electronic, and magnetic depiction of imbedded 
interfaces, which are of capital importance in miniaturized 
systems. 
  With SOLEIL, angular photoemission and photodiffraction can 
be further improved with resolutions down to a few meV 
[millielectron volts]. Numerous domains (opening of "gaps," 
quantic "wells," Kondo effect) are sure to benefit. With 
polarization, photoemissivity will yield information on magnetic 
moments at the surface of magnetic materials. 
  SOLEIL's capabilities will allow further progress in surface 
EXAFS [expanded x-ray absorption fine structure] and 
glancing-incidence diffraction on very thin heteroepitaxies, and 
much broader extension of the infrared spectroscopy work begun 
on the Super-ACO with vibrations of adsorbed molecules. The 
primary benefits will be very high resolutions 
(cm[.sup]-1[/]) and excellent sensitivity (up to 
10[.sup]-3[/] unilayers). 
  d) In the materials sciences, x-ray adsorption or 
diffraction 
is important in a great number of domains, in particular 
materials that are unordered on the large or very small scale 
(aggregates, films, multilayers). In addition, the recent trend 
away from stationary systems toward studies of the dynamics 
under stress of the crstallographic and electronic parameters of 
materials creates a considerable need, no more than one-third of 
which currently can be satisfied. 
  In Project SOLEIL, the very important feature of 
polarization, especially in adsorption, will support structural 
anisotropy and studies of local magnetism by selective 
measurement of partial density of spin for a given type of atom. 
By virtue of the geometric characteristics and duration of 
beams, SOLEIL should greatly facilitate adsorption experiments 
not only at high resolution but also with multiple stresses. 
  Another important and unique feature in the domain of 
adsorption, also linked to high resolution, has to do with 
K-threshold light-element spectroscopy (low-energy domain: 
200-3,000 eV). The excellent extractability of different events 
at this level should make it possible to obtain direct 
structural information simply by examining structures near the 
thresholds. 
  With other structural methods (diffusion and diffraction), 
SOLEIL will continue to provide a useful service for a 
traditional but wider community: that of occasional users who, 
having extracted the maximum information compatible with their 
semi-heavy equipment, employ the source for its white spectrum 
and its wavelength tunability, its linear and circular 
polarization capacities, and its microsecond temporal beam 
structuring. It can be predicted that such users, given the 
nature of their needs, will not be using high-energy source such 
as ESRF over the medium term. These users want a high-quality, 
easily accessed source of intermediate energy that incorporates 
recent progress and responds to their needs. This large 
community must not be forgotten, because it plays a very 
important role in current developments on new materials: 
quasicrystals, superconductors, multilayers, fullerenes, etc. 
  Site of the machine: Much of the LURE laboratory's current 
success is a function of the exceptionally fine scientific 
environment in which it is situated: the immediate vicinity of 
the University of Orsay and the Saclay nuclear studies center, 
close to the large universities of Paris. At the technical 
level, LURE has considerable drawing power vis-a-vis the large 
nearby CEA and IN2P3 laboratories. 
  Current estimates of the cost of the project assume a site 
on 
the Saclay plateau, at Orme des Merisiers, where 15 hectares of 
land belonging to CEA is available. The land and soil 
characteristics--important to consider--are excellent. 
  Assuming a site outside Ile-de-France [the Paris region], 
one 
would have to take into account, in addition to problems of 
accessibility, the currently strong interaction with the local 
science and technology community, and the percentage of 
researchers and engineers willing to accompany the project away 
from Orsay, and the costs such a transplantation would entail: 
creation of new work areas, reception facilities, ease of access 
to site, scientific environment, etc. At all events, a gradual 
disappearance of large installations at the Orsay-Saclay complex 
would seriously weaken this important scientific hub. 
  Remarks and recommendations of the Council: At the current 
stage of the proposal, the Council is not in a position to issue 
precise recommendations. The usefulness for the French 
scientific community of having a machine such as SOLEIL seems to 
admit of little doubt. As a scientific instrument it would 
complement the ESRF, toward which France makes a heavy financial 
contribution: Assurances would be needed that the communities 
concerned have the capacity to exploit them both. 
  The most difficult problem with which institutions affected 
by the project must concern themselves is how to finance it. 
Projections of TGE-related expenditures presented in the first 
part of this report appear to leave no resources available, in 
the short term, to finance construction of SOLEIL unless these 
institutions receive significantly larger allocations for TGEs. 
The Council is thus waiting for these institutions to submit 
precise proposals exploring all the possibilities. 
<H5>  Project LHC </H5>
  In its 1991 report, the Council examined the LHC issue, 
which 
at the time was presented in a preliminary form that required 
future technical and financial studies. 
  With the information then at its disposal, the Council was 
in 
a position to "recommend that France maintain a positive 
attitude in pursuit of negotiations to secure approval of the 
project by the member states of CERN, provided however that the 
growth in our own contribution remain limited and that the 
companion appropriations necessary to build the detectors must 
for the most part be found by redeploying current budgets in the 
discipline." 
  At its meeting in September 1992, the Council undertook to 
review the status of progress in the decision-making process and 
on preparation of the detector proposal. 
  The TGE Council took note of an important resolution of the 
CERN Council, adopted unanimously at its December 1991 meeting. 
In that resolution, the CERN Council declared: 


    -  "that in every respect the LHC is the right machine to 
ensure the future of CERN and continuation of its mission;" 
  -  that before the end of 1993 the director general shall 
furnish 
detailed information on the cost and participation of member and 
nonmember states, to enable the Council to move toward a 
decision on the LHC; in particular, information is required on 
the following points: 

    --technical feasibility of the project; 
  --best estimate of the final cost of the machine, sources of 
finance, and timetable for delivery of components; 
  --details of the program of experimentation, its objectives, 
and direct costs to CERN, as well as indirect costs that will 
have to be borne by the financing agencies of the principal 
participating institutions. 
  The year 1992 was marked by important progress in design and 
preparation of the LHC: 


    -  the injection system, utilizing existing accelerators 
(including the 26-GeV PS and the 450-GeV SPS), was tested 
successfully; 
  -  the machine's grid was optimized. Maximum energy of 7.7 TeV 
[teraelectron volts] will be obtained with a field of 9.5 Tesla; 
  -  installation of half the (4 x 12 kW) cryogenic stations is 
under way as part of Project LEP 200. These stations will also 
be used for the LHC; 
  -  fabrication of prototypes of the superconducting magnets is 
progressing at a satisfactory pace. 

    With regard to the strategy for preparation of the 
experimentation program, the Council heard a presentation from 
J.E. Augustin, president of the ECFA (European Committee for 
Future Accelerators). At the European level, the strategy is 
being developed in cooperation with CERN's committee on 
scientific directives and with ECFA. 
  Important steps were taken in 1992, in particular at an 
important colloquium held at Evian in March, where 650 
physicists from 30 countries met for a broad discussion of 
possible experiments and the detectors needed to conduct them. 
  In November, CERN hosted a meeting for public presentation 
of 
the "letters of intent" prepared by three collaborative teams 
that hope to build and operate a detector. Only two detectors 
can be installed adjoining the machine, and the LHC committee on 
experiments will therefore have to make its decisions before the 
close of 1993--probably thereby encouraging some restructuring 
of the groups: 


    -  the ATLAS team has chosen a magnetic field created by a 
large toroid, which permits precise measurement of muons, 
complemented by a superconducting coil in the center. The 
electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry uses a liquid argon 
detector; 
  -  the CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) team proposes to install a 
high-resolution electromagnetic calorimeter (CeF[.sup]3[/] 
crystals) inside a large superconducting solenoid (3-meter 
radius) providing a 4-Tesla field; 
  -  the L3P (Lepton and Proton Precision Physics) team proposes 
far-reaching modifications to the L3 detector installed for the 
LEP, to adapt it to the LHC. 

    French teams are strongly represented in ATLAS and to a 
lesser degree in CMS and L3P. Their research and development 
efforts have focused on calorimetry, trace measurement, and 
radiation-resistant electronics. They have often come up with 
innovative solutions. 
  Each team involves between 400 and 900 researchers 
representing 50 to 90 laboratories. Depending on which proposals 
are accepted, the estimated cost (exclusive of salaries) would 
be between 300 and 450 million Swiss francs per detector. 
  France's cumulative investment in LEP detectors amounts to 
Fr170 million (1983 francs), or Fr240 million in 1993 currency. 
Assuming a French contribution of 15 percent of the total cost 
of the two LHC detectors, and taking the lower cost estimate 
(600 million Swiss francs), we obtain a burden of about Fr350 
million, or 50 percent more than France's cumulative investment 
in LEP detectors. 
  The Council remains concerned by the magnitude of the 
financial burden which institutions will have to shoulder to 
participate at an appropriate level in construction of these 
detectors. It wishes to obtain detailed information from them on 
how they plan to accomplish this, given that the majority of 
such financing will have to be found by internal reprogramming, 
as it already recommended in 1991. 
  The Council is also waiting to be provided with all the 
information promised to the member-state delegations by the CERN 
directorate--in principle before the end of 1993--before 
rendering a definitive opinion on the project. [passage omitted]
