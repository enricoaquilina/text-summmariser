<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  In this paper, a method of high-resolution digital imaging 
using spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is presented. 
Computer digital images are generated using raw radar data 
collected by the U.S. ocean surveillance satellite SEASAT-A. The 
images cover 2,048 cells in the range direction and two 
synthetic apertures in the azimuth direction with an imaging 
area of approximately 38 km x 34 km. The high-quality radar 
images with a resolution of 25 m x 25 m have demonstrated the 
effectiveness of the proposed method. 
<H5>  I. Introduction </H5>
  During the past 20 years, the use of synthetic aperture 
radar 
(SAR) as an advanced microwave remote sensor has attracted a 
great deal of attention. Since the mid-1970s, SAR technology has 
evolved from airborne applications to spaceborne applications. 
In recent years, significant progress has been made in 
spaceborne SAR technology. Since the launch of the SEASAT-A 
satellite by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration in 1978, the U.S. SIR-A, SIR-B, SIR-C, and 
European ERS-1, the Canadian RADAR SAT and the Japanese JERS-1 
satellites have all been equipped with advanced SAR imaging 
systems. 
  The unique features of spaceborne SAR systems are: high 
altitude, extended range and coverage, wide bandwidth, and high 
data rate; also, various error correction and compensation 
schemes and complex signal processing techniques are used in 
spaceborne SAR. There are distinct differences between 
spaceborne SAR and airborne SAR. Because of the relatively low 
altitude and slow velocity of airborne SAR, the Earth can be 
regarded as a large planar surface, which makes signal 
processing relatively easy. In the case of spaceborne SAR, 
however, the effects of Earth rotation and Earth curvature 
produce coupling in the radar returns between the range 
direction and the azimuth direction; as a result, azimuth 
compression of the radar signal becomes very complicated. In 
general, digital image processing for spaceborne SAR involves 
range processing, azimuth processing, motion compensation and 
multi-look processing, of which the most difficult problems are 
azimuth processing and motion compensation. In this paper, a 
method of digital imaging using spaceborne SAR is presented. The 
effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by the 
high-resolution images generated using raw radar data collected 
by the U.S. SEASAT-A satellite. 
<H5>  II. Mathematical Model of the Radar Signal </H5>
  The radar transmits a linear frequency-modulated (FM) pulse 
signal. Let _D_ be the pulse width, T be the pulse repetition 
period, R(t) be the slant range between the satellite and the 
ground target, W[.sup]a[/](t) be the azimuth directivity 
function of the antenna, _s_(x,r) be the scattering coefficient 
of the ground target, a(t) be a step function of width _D_, 
_l_ 
be the wavelength, and c be the speed of light; then the radar 
return signal can be expressed as:[.sup]1[/] 
  s(x,r) = _s_(x,r)W[.sup]r[/](r) * h[.sub]1[/](x,r) 
*[.sup]r[/]h[.sub]2[/](x,r) (1) 
  where W[.sup]r[/](r) is the range directivity function of 
the antenna, * is the two-dimensional convolution with respect 
to azimuth x and range r; *[.sup]r[/] is the one-dimensional 
convolution with respect to range r. Also, 

  In the above equation, f[.sup]D[/] is the Doppler center 
frequency, f[.sup]R[/] is the rate of change of Doppler 
frequency, v is the satellite velocity relative to the ground, 
and b is the frequency-modulation rate. 
  One can see from the radar signal model that the radar 
return 
is a complicated two-dimensional convolution; the purpose of 
signal processing is to extract the scattering characteristics 
of the target from the received signal, and ultimately to form a 
high-quality radar image. 
<H5>  III. Range-Compression Processing </H5>
  Range processing of spaceborne SAR actually implies pulse 
compression. Digital pulse compression in the range direction 
uses FFT for matched filter implementation. The processed signal 
can be expressed as: 

  where c[.sup]0[/] = 2ãb_D_/c. 
  It is known from the principle of pulse compression that the 
slant range resolution after pulse compression is: 
  _r_[.sup]r[/] = c/2B[.sub]r[/] 
  and the ground range resolution is: 


  where B[.sup]r[/] is the signal bandwidth, H is the 
satellite altitude, R[.sup]e[/] is the mean Earth radius, and 
_th_ is the antenna viewing angle. The number of samples of the 
range reference function is 


  where f[.sup]s[/] is the sampling frequency. 
  The raw data collected by SEASAT-A are digital data produced 
by the A/D converter; prior to range processing, they must first 
be orthogonalized and then matched-filtered. The 
orthogonalization process is accomplished in the frequency 
domain, where a window function is applied and the signal 
carrier frequency is shifted to zero frequency; finally, a 
complex IFFT [inverse fast Fourier transform] is performed to 
complete the process of range digital pulse compression. This 
process is equivalent to a transformation from real data to 
complex data; the complex data are stored for azimuth processing. 
<H5>  IV. Azimuth-Compression Processing </H5>
  The azimuth reference function is chosen based on the 
expression of the range-compressed radar signal:[.sup]2[/] 


  Due to the effect of range drift, coupling between the range 
direction and the azimuth direction exists in the radar return; 
therefore, azimuth processing requires complicated 
two-dimensional processing. In fact, azimuth processing is 
actually a two-dimensional matched filtering; the filtered 
output signal represents the scattering characteristics of the 
ground target, which is of the form: 
  _s_[.sup]0[/](x,r) = s[.sub]R[/](x,r) * 
h[.sup]*[/][.sup]a[/](x,r) (8) 
  The implementation of two-dimensional matched filtering for 
azimuth processing is highly computation-intensive. By using a 
hybrid time-domain and frequency-domain correlation technique, 
the two-dimensional problem reduces to a one-dimensional 
problem, and the correction of range drift can be accomplished 
in the frequency domain; as a result, the amount of computation 
is greatly reduced. For a second-order curve R(x), the azimuth 
reference function for range r[.sup]0[/] is: 


  where d[.sup]i[/] is the distance of the range reference 
value r[.sup]0[/], and 


  The expression in the frequency domain after azimuth 
processing is of the form: 


  It can be seen from the above expression that the hybrid 
correlation method uses time-domain correlation in the range 
direction and frequency-domain correlation in the azimuth 
direction; this approach takes full advantage of the FFT and 
therefore provides an efficient way of calculating precision 
impulse response. 
  If the above method is applied directly for azimuth 
compression, the amount of computation will increase with 
increasing Doppler center frequency. A more efficient way would 
be to apply correction to the range wander (the linear term of 
range drift) before azimuth pulse compression, then apply 
correction to the range bending (the second-order term of range 
drift) in the frequency domain; this approach requires less 
computation, and R(x) in the azimuth reference function 
g[.sup]i[/](x,r[.sub]0[/]) becomes: 


  Computer results show that the digital images of spaceborne 
SAR produced by this method and the previous method are almost 
identical, but the amount of computation for azimuth compression 
(at f[.sup]D[/] = 980 Hz) is reduced by one half. 
<H5>  V. Motion Compensation </H5>
  Because of antenna pointing error and errors caused by 
satellite motion, it is difficult to accurately estimate the 
Doppler center frequency and the rate of change of Doppler 
frequency from satellite historical data and from SAR 
parameters. Inaccuracy in the Doppler center frequency and in 
the rate of change of Doppler frequency will have an adverse 
effect on SAR images. Inaccuracy in the Doppler center frequency 
will result in lower signal-to-noise ratio, which in turn will 
cause an increase in the fuzziness in azimuth and a shift in the 
target position. Inaccuracy in the rate of change of Doppler 
frequency will cause defocusing in the radar images and result 
in a decrease in pixel resolution. An effective method of 
estimating the Doppler parameters is to estimate the errors in 
the Doppler parameters directly from the radar return data. 
  The clutter lock used for estimating the errors in the 
Doppler center frequency is obtained from the normalized energy 
difference of the symmetric multi-look sub-images.[.sup]3[/] 
Experimental results show that the error in the Doppler center 
frequency is proportional to the normalized energy difference 
_D_E: 
  _D_f[.sup]D[/] ÷ f[.sub]R[/]T_D_E (13) 
  where T is the time required for the satellite to travel the 
distance of one aperture. 
  The auto-focusing used for estimating the rate of change of 
Doppler frequency is determined by the relationships between the 
multi-look sub-images. The offset between the first-look 
sub-image and the Nth-look sub-image _D_X can be obtained from 
the relationship between the two sub-images. Experimental 
results show that the offset is proportional to the errors in 
the rate of change of Doppler frequency: 
  _D_f[.sup]R[/] ÷ f[.sub]R[/] _D_X/vT (14) 
  Accurate estimates of the Doppler center frequency and the 
rate of change of Doppler frequency can be obtained by an 
iterative procedure. For example, for an image around the city 
of London, the estimation error of the Doppler center frequency 
is less than 10 Hz, and the estimation error of the rate of 
change of Doppler frequency is less than 0.3 Hz/sec. 
<H5>  VI. Spaceborne SAR Digital Imaging </H5>
  Raw radar data of an area around the city of London have 
been 
collected by the U.S. SEASAT-A satellite; the center of the area 
is located at 51.43ë N. latitude and 0.33ë E. longitude. 
The radar parameters and signal processing parameters are as 
follows:

  The estimated Doppler center frequency and the rate of 
change 
of Doppler frequency are approximately 940 Hz and 505 Hz/s, and 
the range drift is 43 range resolution cells. In order to reduce 
the effect of spot noise during the formation of the radar 
signal, we use an iterative procedure of non-coherent 
integration of 4-look sub-images. Figure 1 [photo not 
reproduced] shows the computer-generated digital image obtained 
using the method given in this paper. The processed image has a 
resolution of 25 m x 25 m; the imaging area covers 2,048 range 
cells and two synthetic apertures in the azimuth direction, 
which corresponds to an area of approximately 38 km x 34 km. 
During the imaging process, Doppler parameters are estimated 
every 128 range cells. 
<H5>  VII. Conclusion </H5>
  By applying the spaceborne SAR digital imaging method 
presented in this paper, we have generated computer images using 
raw radar data collected by the U.S. SEASAT-A satellite. These 
are the first high-resolution spaceborne SAR images obtained in 
this country; the image resolution is 25 m x 25 m. The results 
of computer images have verified the effectiveness of the 
proposed method.
