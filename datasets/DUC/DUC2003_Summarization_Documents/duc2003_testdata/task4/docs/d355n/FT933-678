latest growth enterprise in space

A rocket is scheduled to take off today from Vandenberg Air Force Base in
California. Its 2.8-tonne, Dollars 232m satellite is not going to Mars or
carrying astronauts. Instead, when it gets about 450 miles off the ground -
the moon is 240,000 miles away - it will turn to face the ground and start
taking pictures.
As spending on space - a total Dollars 3.5bn a year by EC countries in the
civil sector alone - slowly levels off, earth observation satellites are
topping the list of priorities at the world's space agencies. Their
applications are practical and immediate: they can help in planning food
production, mineral prospecting, flood damage control, pollution monitoring,
the prediction of volcanic eruptions and weather forecasting.
The growing interest in observation satellites is understandable, as western
governments, wrestling with recession or stubborn budget deficits,
increasingly seek value for money from their space ventures. In addition,
the opportunity to capitalise on the public's concern for the global
environment seems too good to miss.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the US sees earth
observation projects as a way to achieve good public relations after a
series of embarrassing failures. Efforts to explore deep space with the
Hubble space telescope and the Galileo mission to Jupiter have been dogged
by technical hitches, and last month the Dollars 980m Mars Observer was
lost.
The European Space Agency has also experienced setbacks. It has been forced
to delay plans for manned space flights and has bowed to suggestions by
member governments that, when they start, it will make use of cheaper
Russian technology rather than its own more expensive equipment.
With manned flights on the back burner, Esa, funded by western European
governments, has switched its focus to earth observation. In June it
approved funding for a project to build Envisat, so far the biggest earth
observation satellite.
'Earth observation means the arrival of applications that can be used by
governments, rather than just scientists,' says Mr Emilio Lanfranco, the Esa
earth observation director. 'Earth observation now has the highest political
interest.'
This attention translates into big contracts on both sides of the Atlantic.
Today's planned launch - the Landsat 6 satellite made and put into space for
Nasa by the American defence company, Martin Marietta - comes three days
after the launch of a French satellite designed to do a similar job. The
FFr1.5bn Spot 3 lifted off from Esa's launch site in French Guiana, South
America, on Saturday. Built by Matra-Marconi Space, a joint venture between
Matra-Hachette of France and GEC of the UK, Spot 3's tasks include map
making, urban planning, geology, agriculture and forestry. Other Spot
satellites have been used by western military allies for surveillance,
notably during the Gulf war.
The biggest project, Esa's Envisat, has a Dollars 2bn budget. The joint
prime contractors for the 8-tonne satellite are Deutsche Aerospace and
British Aerospace. The UK company's involvement is a reflection of the
British government's championing of earth observation since the late 1980s.
Set for launch in 1998, Envisat will be followed by a regular programme of
further Esa launches. It is part of a global push into the environmental
field in the second half of the decade. Landsat 7, also to be built by
Martin Marietta, is due for launch in 1995.
Japan, whose space agency, Nasda, decided this year to set up its own earth
observation division, also plans an advanced earth observation polar
platform, the Adeos, to be launched in 1996-97. Even newcomers to space such
as Brazil and South Africa are planning their own environmental satellites.
This new emphasis on observation satellites stems partly from their
potential for commercial application: pictures of the earth's surface can be
sold to various agencies, from the US Department of Defence to British
Sugar.
France has set up an agency to sell pictures from the Spot series of
satellites. Spot Image, based in Toulouse, has subsidiaries in the US, Asia
and Australasia. Annual sales have grown from FFr15m (Pounds 1.7m) a year in
1986 to FFr220m in 1992. The US Department of Defence is one customer, but
wants to reduce its reliance on French photographs by installing a camera on
Landsat 7, which can pick out objects 16ft in diameter.
Several companies in Europe and the US already offer satellite photographs
that can be shown on personal computers for a few dollars each. A smattering
of Russian pictures, taken by reconnaissance satellites and detailed enough
to identify objects only 6ft wide, are also trickling on to western markets.
The market for images of the earth's surface could be extensive. British
Sugar, for example, plans to use observation data to predict the size of the
UK sugar beet crop so that it can plan the capacity of its sugar refineries.
The commercial potential of environmental satellites has prompted a US
company, Orbital Sciences, to go it alone next year. It intends to build,
launch and operate its own small satellite which will take pictures of
oceans, picking out sediment, plankton for use in assessing coastal erosion,
and greenhouse gases. Such small satellites can be designed and launched
quickly and cheaply and are calculated to appeal to private sector customers
as well as space agencies.
Despite the rapid development of the sector, problems could lie ahead. Many
satellites are being launched for scientific purposes, but since their
pictures are finding ready commercial customers, the question of how much to
charge different buyers has arisen.
European companies are not well placed to compete with their US
counterparts, says Mr Chris Elliott, an adviser to the European and Japanese
space agencies. American companies have proved themselves winners in
private-sector telecommunications satellites, where California's Hughes
Aircraft has 60 per cent of the market, and in broadcasting, where all seven
direct broadcasting satellites over Europe were built in the US.
While US companies such as Orbital Sciences aim to sell to the private
sector, he adds, European companies are still dependent on giant space
projects such as the Dollars 2bn Envisat.
Although Mr Elliott's views find little public backing in Europe, space
agency officials agree in private that satellite companies could be more
entrepreneurial. But with billion-dollar contracts such as Envisat's up for
grabs, there is not much incentive to change the status quo - particularly
when the satellites may be used for such popular causes as improving the
environment.
