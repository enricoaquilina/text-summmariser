SOVIET EMIGRE gangs have been defrauding the German government of hundreds
of millions of D-Marks by faking the delivery of consumer goods to the
former Soviet armed forces in eastern Germany, according to Berlin police.
Mr Uwe Schmidt, a superintendent heading the police investigation, estimated
yesterday that 'more than DM1bn' (Pounds 340m) had been embezzled out of the
DM3bn Germany had agreed to pay for supplies to the former Soviet forces
until their withdrawal in 1994.
The contracts were secured by Soviet emigre gangs, via Soviet officers, and
fictitious deliveries were recorded for cigarettes, food, alcohol, hi-fi
units, televisions and video recorders for the troops.
Police say that in a typical case, the gangs bribed Russian officers to
order tax-free liquor in bulk for the armed forces from a Berlin company. A
bill was provided and payment made but the liquor never reached the troops;
it was resold on the open market at a higher price.
The police became aware of the embezzlement scheme because of a flood on to
the market of such things as cigarettes, alcohol and electronics goods.
Large quantities of tax-free cigarettes were ordered at DM4.50 a carton,
compared with the German retail price of DM40.
'There were enough cigarettes to supply everyone remotely connected with the
army including infants and grandmothers,' said Mr Schmidt. In many cases the
cigarettes were sold to Vietnamese citizens living in east Germany who
resold them on the street for DM25 a carton.
The police also believe that embezzled goods to the value of DM250m were
illegally transported to Poland and Russia for resale in the past year.
The police hope the investigation will lead to prosecutions by the Berlin
justice authorities later this year. However this may be hampered by the
speed with which the companies involved in the fraudulent operations were
set up and liquidated.
Mr Schmidt said: 'We know who the 100 or so perpetrators are. They are
people who were convicted of counterfeiting, illegal weapons sales and
forgery of documents and art objects. There is no place left where they can
escape.' Most are known to be in Berlin, but no arrests have been made so
far because of the complexity of the company operations.
He complained that the finance ministry was not taking an active enough
interest in trying to find the money.
A recent parliamentary investigation in Moscow has claimed that the scandal
extended into the top echelons of the former Soviet armed forces.
Russian state prosecutors conducted a preliminary investigation at the main
army purchasing mission in Leipzig but their findings were not made
available.
