Anthony Gene Tetro, described by prosecutors as one of the nation's most 
prolific art forgers, pleaded innocent today to copying the works of artists 
such as Chagall, Miro and Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
Tetro, 40, indicted on 44 counts of felony forgery, entered his plea before 
Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner, who assigned a public defender to represent 
him and set a pretrial hearing for July 19. 
</P>
<P>
At a preliminary hearing in March, Mark Henry Sawicki, a former associate of 
Tetro, testified that he did $75,000 to $100,000 worth of business a year with 
Tetro between 1984 and 1989. Sawicki said he sold hundreds of works attributed 
to such artists as Joan Miro, Salvador Dali, Norman Rockwell and Hiro Yamagata. 
</P>
<P>
Sawicki, who was charged with selling forged art last year, agreed to be wired 
with a tape recorder and, according to authorities, recorded a conversation in 
which Tetro is heard to say he "did a Chagall" and had other fake Chagalls "in 
the works." 
</P>
<P>
Sawicki said Tetro would practice the signatures of the artists he was copying. 
</P>
<P>
"He would practice on note pads, scratch paper, sometimes even on the backs of 
damaged artworks," Sawicki said at the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Sawicki, former owner of a Sherman Oaks gallery called Visual Environments, and 
Tetro are among several art dealers local and federal authorities have 
implicated in a multimillion-dollar art fraud investigation.
