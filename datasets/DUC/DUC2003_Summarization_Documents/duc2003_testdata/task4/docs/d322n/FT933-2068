The Arts Council is now considering cutting its entire grant to the Theatre
Royal, Plymouth unless a response from the Plymouth region can persuade it
otherwise by September 22. The theatre has already coordinated a campaign of
90,000 signatures and 6,000 letters. The quality of recent performances and
the quantity of local response should allow the Council to vote a reprieve
without losing face.
The Theatre Royal's most recent play, Master Forger (in repertory until 25
September) starts an autumn season which tables the dependable Les Liaisons
Dangereuses alongside the innovative The Doctor and the Devils, a play by
Dylan Thomas about Burke and Hare. The Theatre Royal's Drum Theatre offers a
line in modern classics and midwinter pantomime. The balanced programme and
sensible scheduling includes visits from the Welsh National Opera,
Glyndebourne Touring, London Contemporary Dance Theatre and The Birmingham
Royal ballet. This breadth makes Plymouth a valuable resource for dance,
opera and theatre in the South West.
Master Forger is a fine new play by Hugh Janes based on the life of the
artist Tom Keating (1917-1984). Keating became famous in 1976 for forging
Samuel Palmer's paintings. But he also forged over 2,000 others. These
'Sexton Blakes', slang for 'fakes', as he called them, included Degas, Goya,
Modigliani, Rembrandt, Sisley, Van Gogh and Vuillard. But he was best at JMW
Turner, another consummate professional who was capable in a visit to Venice
of turning out 300 sketches in three days.
In 1977 Keating was charged with conspiracy and fraud in relation to sale of
paintings, and early in 1979 the trial, which The Observer described as 'the
best free show in town' began. Charges against Keating were dropped before
the spring. Inside five years, he was a national hero, advising on TV and
venting his anger against an art establishment which used money alone to
value art.
The play, directed by Roger Redfarn, sticks to the surface of Keating's
colourful life like the formaldehyde-varnish he used for ageing paintings.
Roy Marsden as the bohemian cockney delivers a fine performance which shows
how the artist was in some sense possessed by the Old Masters, and how his
promiscuous reading emerged as a series of lectures in court: 'The only
thing that amazes me is that I wasn't exposed in the press a lot sooner.'
Marsden's voice is superb, ringing around the revolving set, pleading with
the audience, imparting information or directing models.
Fakes are the way forward. Umberto Eco's Faith in Fakes has a scene where a
California sculpture garden shows the Venus de Milo with both arms. Maybe
now she can write to Arts Council on behalf of Plymouth.
Master Forger in repertory until September 25 (0752 267222)
