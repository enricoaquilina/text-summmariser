When he was a graduate student sweating out his dissertation on Blake, Zachary 
Leader got the idea for this multidisciplinary exploration of writer's block. 
This dread literary ailment afflicts lowly Ph.D. candidates no less than great 
authors, often driving victims crazy or to drink. 
</P>
<P>
Coleridge took opium. Hemingway shot himself. Leader took himself in hand and 
wrote what may be the first book on the subject that doesn't attempt to be 
helpful; it is a theoretical and historical account, bristling with footnotes 
and erudition, none of it intended to increase your productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Leader, a lecturer in English at London's Roehampton Institute, raises 
a series of questions about writer's block: "At what point -- and why -- did 
the term come into existence, and what were the terms it replaced? How was it 
to be distinguished from the sorts of difficulties most writers encounter in 
the act of composition? When, in other words, did a problem with writing become 
a block?" 
</P>
<P>
Leader looks for answers in psychology and literary history, "but also in a 
long philosophical tradition of distrust of the written word as well as in more 
general social and cultural speculation." He covers a great deal of very rugged 
ground, quoting an eclectic assortment of thinkers, ranging from Plato and 
Melville to Mark Twain and Julia Kristeva. 
</P>
<P>
The term "writers block" was coined in 1947 by Dr. Edmund Bergler, a largely 
ignored but extremely prolific psychoanalyst who published 25 books and more 
than 300 articles before his death in 1962. By then the phrase had entered the 
language, spread by word of mouth, a sign of a time in America of intense faith 
in psychoanalysis and intense psychoanalytic interest in creativity. These 
origins explain "the air of medical substance, of a treatable condition, 
assumed by writer's block; hence also the suspicion of something bogus or 
unearned about its claims." 
</P>
<P>
Because of its connection to a particular place and time, a writer like Philip 
Roth might think of himself as blocked, while Philip Larkin, who wrote no more 
than four poems a year, simply considered himself unprolific. Earlier writers 
"dried up" or "froze" or were "stuck in a rut," metaphors that imply internal 
deficiency, rather than external impediment, as the source of the trouble. 
Locating this outside the individual shifts responsibility away from the self. 
No doubt this is one reason "writer's block" caught on. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you call it block, desiccation, frigidity or stasis, it's hell on 
Earth. The complaint entered literary history in the 18th Century, according to 
one theory, when modern technology -- paper and the press -- inundated writers 
with the work of their betters. Since Shakespeare and Milton are tough acts to 
follow, Romantic poets suffered from "the remorseless deepening of 
self-consciousness before the rich and intimidating legacy of the past." They 
lost the power to write, and made that a subject of literature. When truly 
stuck, they invented the fragment as a poetic form. 
</P>
<P>
The new self-consciousness of the mid-18th Century also may be interpreted as 
just one episode in the recurring history of writerly difficulty, which goes 
back at least to the acedia suffered by medieval authors. Then as now, it was 
considered a sin, although an unenjoyable one. 
</P>
<P>
The book also focuses on various psychoanalytic explanations of creative 
inhibition, emphasizing Freud, several post-Freudians and especially the 
British Object-Relations school, which explains blockage in terms of unresolved 
conflict between the primitive internal forces involved in 
self-differentiation. 
</P>
<P>
Leader stresses the affinities between post-Kleinian theory and the testimony 
of Wordsworth and Coleridge, the great bards of blockage. He analyzes a number 
of Wordsworth texts -- including the first 285 lines of the "Prelude," which 
are explicitly about being unable to write -- and details the extravagant 
agonies that led Coleridge to plagiarism and worse. Coleridge's poetry, 
particularly "Dejection: An Ode," documents his struggles, as do his notebooks 
and letters. In one of many tormented moments, the poet wrote a friend, "I wish 
I had been a tanner." 
</P>
<P>
After his consideration of these psychological, historical, and literary 
aspects of his subject, Leader adds a sociological dimension with a discussion 
of the cultural taboos that may produce blockage, devoting a chapter to women 
writers and theories about them. 
</P>
<P>
This approach is coherent but arbitrary, since the themes that emerge are 
dictated by the author's choices. These reflect his interests and a 
predilection for complexity, as when he summarily dismisses non-psychoanalytic 
psychology as "theoretically threadbare." 
</P>
<P>
This book is knotty as a Persian rug, and will be of interest primarily to 
scholars of psychoanalysis and literature. Writers avoiding the blank page 
might be better off with Mozart, though Leader's analysis is finally 
encouraging. Creative impairment "can be a necessary precursor to health," he 
concludes. "Blockage itself can bring insight, and with it the power to write."
