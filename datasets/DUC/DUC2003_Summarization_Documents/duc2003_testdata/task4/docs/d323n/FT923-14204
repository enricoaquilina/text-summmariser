It is an interesting title: Batman Returns. Does it refer to the caped
crusader's comeback or the series' box-office revenue to date? The returns
from Batman 1, as we know, were roughly equivalent to the gross national
product of Phrygia under King Midas. Now here comes Batman 2, which in two
weeks in America has notched up Dollars 100m, enough to make Midas sell his
kingdom for shares in Warner Brothers.
What can it mean? I am leasing space briefly in this column to two
authorities who may shed light. First, my six-year-old nephew. 'Well, in the
film, Batman fights the Penguin who is very nasty and wants to have the
power over Gotham City, 'cos Penguin is this big, fat thing who squawks and
has these penguin soldiers with rockets and, and, and, Catwoman, who was the
bad millionaire's secretary but now has been made into a cat by falling out
of a window and then cats breathe in her face and she helps Batman and
fights him.'
All clear so far? Let us proceed to my second authority, a
sociologist-structuralist friend. He prefers not to be quoted direct but
maintains that Batman is a symbolic alter ego for developed Western
civilisation today. Batman/Bruce Wayne acts out our own identity crisis as
we make amends for our guilty affluence, amassed over the century, with
guerrilla deeds of heroism (like Iraq) or fly-by-night flourishes of
socio-ecological conscience (like the Rio summit).
Possibly. What I saw and heard in Batman Returns was two hours of noisy,
lurid pyrotechnics. Experiencing the soundtrack, all bangs, shrieks and
maniacally repeated signature tunes, is like being lost in an exploding
American theme park: Anaheim agonistes or Orlando furioso.
The sets, plundering everything from Citizen Kane to Socialist Realism, pile
design plagiarisms on the late Anton Furst's haunting original. (Furst won
an Oscar for Batman and then died after throwing himself from an eighth
floor window, in bizarre premonition of Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman). And
the actors, Miss P apart, either offer languid read-throughs of
underdeveloped roles (Michael Keaton's Batman, Christopher Walken as demon
millionaire Max Shreck) or scream and gesticulate as if someone has set fire
to their trousers (Danny De Vito's Penguin).
As for the script, co-written by Daniel Waters with director Tim Burton who
fashioned Batman 1 and the gentle Edward Scissorhands, it seems aimed at two
main social groups.
One is sub-literate morons who can recognize a pun only when it swats them
firmly in the face. ('Just the pussy I was looking for]' cackles Penguin on
first sighting Catwoman.)
The second is people with cloth ears who need a joke repeated in case they
missed it the first time. Thus Miss Pfeiffer's pre-feline spinster
secretary, tripping into her lonely flat, says 'Honey, I'm home - oh, I
forgot, I'm not married.' We laugh. Then 20 minutes later she says it again.
The cloth-ears laugh.
Pfeiffer, it happens, is the treat of the film. She begins as a female Clark
Kent, all spectacles, gaucherie and tangled ankles. Then, metamorphosed into
Catwoman, she purrs and miaows with leather-clad panache. Not since Diana
Rigg in The Avengers have so many large animals lost their skins to so great
sartorial-erotic effect.
muddle-headedness that Pfeiffer is given no clear role in either the romance
or the action. She sets Batman and Penguin each a-tremble, but by climax
time she has been sidelined by both.
The story's last-act spotlight, jiggling away in the glory of Batvision and
Bat-erama, shines down fulsomely, exclusively on hero and villain. What a
shame they are both so dull. Keaton the actor has vanished forever into his
designer-muscled Batsuit. And De Vito's Penguin suggests a Jimmy Durante
impersonator trying to shout himelf silly from a mountain-top. Will there be
a Batman 3? Buy earplugs and other necessary protective devices while stocks
last.

The Butcher's Wife is a comedy so sotto voce, by contrast, that you should
borrow your great aunt Norma's ear trumpet. Scripted for gentle whimsy by
Ezra Litwak and Marjorie Schwartz, it plants North Carolina psychic Demi
Moore in New York where she falls out of love with her butcher husband
George Dzunza and in love with psychiatrist Jeff Daniels. Throwing her
clairvoyant powers around like confetti, she also changes the lives of
spinster, and Frances McDormand, literate lesbian.
Has Demi Moore, wan of voice and manner, been on a charisma reduction
course? Here she vanishes into the recycled Greenwich Village wallpaper,
more Hemi-demi-semi Moore, while Daniels and the minor characters come forth
with the charm. The mad offhand grace-notes are best: like the actions in
one scene of a patient in Daniels' office when no one except us is looking.
(I shall reveal no more: giggle yourself). Britain's Terry Hughes directed.
How I wish that some pairs of unrelated films could be introduced to each
other, like boxers touching gloves before Round One, and then set scrapping
with no holds barred. Joan Micklin Silver's Stepkids, an icky tale of family
bonding, would be greatly improved by the attentions of Clovis the Attack
Cat from Stephen King's Sleepwalkers, directed by Mick Garris.
Clovis is a police cat with a mission: to tear apart over-bonded families
like Alice Krige and Brian Krause, an incestuous, vampiric mother-son duo
who settle in a small Southern town where he brings home date-rape victims
for her to eat.
Meanwhile large numbers of famous horror writers and directors pop up
through the cracks in the plot doing cameos: John Landis, Joe Dante, Clive
Barker, King himself. They distract us from the gathering daftness, but not
enough. The film's blood count is high and fine, its special effects
likewise. But plot logic is savaged early on - why do Krige-Krause stay in a
town with such an active police force, why do cats gather in unexplained
dozens outside their window? - and never fully recovers.
Stepkids is a moral fable set in America's Laocoon age of serial polygamy
and multiple half-siblings. When young Laura (Hillary Woolf) runs away from
a lakeside visit to her stepbrother, a platoon of parents, step-parents and
semi-brothers and sisters descend to search for her and sort out their own
lives. It is a comedy of extended families by a director not extended at
all: Joan Micklin once made, though you would not think it, Hester Street
and Between The Lines. Frank Mugavero wrote the homiletic script, Griffin
Dunne, Margaret Whitton, Adrienne Shelley and ohers try to bring it to life.
I have one more job for Clovis the Attack Cat. After his visit to Lake
Homily, he should go to Madrid to sort out problem elements in the city's
post-liberation subculture.
Pepi, Luci, Bom .. is an early Pedro Almodovar comedy - how many more are
still to come? - featuring drugs, sex, violence, urination and the other
things not possible under Franco. It also features a plot of sorts, but we
cannot expect you to find that when even critics with helpful Press handouts
are powerless to do so. In short, a shambles. Clovis's mission is to track
down any further early Almodovar films and shred them on sight.

Why not repair to the 16th Cambridge Film Festival? The fens are alive with
the sound of international movies receiving their British premieres.
From America, the animated feature Ferngully, Jim Jarmusch's latest
mood-piece Night On Earth and Tim Robbins's Cannes-acclaimed political
satire Bob Roberts. From Europe and points East, films by Chabrol, Zanussi,
Istvan Szabo, Agnieszka Holland
