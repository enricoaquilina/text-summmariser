FT  27 SEP 94 / Sir David Napley, leading lawyer: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir David Napley was the most high-profile solicitor in Britain, celebrated
for the famous cases he took on and for his masterful advocacy.
He was lauded by the legal profession as the most distinguished solicitor of
his generation, but also attracted hostility from barristers who felt he
usurped their role.
The list of those he represented reads like a potted history of causes
celebres of the last 20 years.
It includes politicians such as Mr Jeremy Thorpe and Mr Harvey Proctor,
Princess Michael of Kent and murderer Jeremy Bamber.
Born the son of a London stockbroker in July 1915, David Napley was educated
at Burlington College, Essex.
He founded the now prominent legal practice of Kingsley Napley in 1937. He
joined the Queen's Royal Regiment in 1940 and was commissioned into the
Indian Army in 1941. After contracting a mystery illness, he was invalided
out in 1945 with the rank of captain.
He sought advice whether to aim for the Bar or to remain a solicitor and was
told by a senior judge to go for the more mundane life of a solicitor. Too
late he discovered his talent for advocacy, although in later years he said
he had no regrets about the decision.
He was elected to the council of the Law Society in 1962 and was chairman of
the Law Society criminal law committee from 1963 until 1975. He became
president of the Law Society in 1976-77 and was knighted in 1977.
It was Sir David's defence of former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe on charges
of incitement and conspiracy to murder in 1978 that thrust him to fame.
In 1986 he acted for Princess Michael of Kent. He negotiated an out-of-court
settlement after the princess was accused of plagiarism in her book,
'Crowned in a Far Country'.
In 1989 he was brought in as a solicitor for Guinness to help with the
Department of Trade and Industry investigation into the takeover of
Distillers. Consequently he figured prominently in the trial of Guinness
chief executive Mr Ernest Saunders.
He also represented families of victims involved in the Zeebruge Herald of
Free Enterprise ferry disaster, the Lockerbie air crash and the King's Cross
fire.
He leaves his wife Leah, whom he married in 1940, and two daughters.
