PLAGIARISM ISSUE RAISED IN COLLEGE WORK OF DR. KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. plagiarized or inadequately credited other authors' 
works in his doctoral dissertation and other college writings, according to a 
Stanford University history professor appointed by King's widow to edit the 
papers of the civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of that finding, by Clayborne Carson at Stanford and by other 
researchers, Boston University is reviewing whether King's 1955 doctoral degree 
in theology should be revoked retroactively. But officials said that such a 
drastic step is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Carson and King's associates in the civil rights movement said Friday that the 
discovery of plagiarism by King in his student days, no matter how disturbing 
to strict scholars, should not detract from later achievements of the Nobel 
Peace Prize laureate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what it shows is that there was an earlier stage in King's life when 
there were other goals in his mind. He wanted to succeed as a student of 
theology and he wasn't practicing to be the Martin Luther King who has become a 
kind of national icon," Carson said in a telephone interview. "He was just a 
flesh-and-blood human being with flaws and limitations." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference, the Atlanta-based organization King once led, said: "We're 
impressed by Martin Luther King's footprints and are willing to forgive any 
youthful errors in his footnotes." 
</P>
<P>
Carson, an expert in the history of black Americans' struggle against bias, 
said the findings of plagiarism in the dissertation and other student writings 
by King were emotionally "draining" for him and other researchers. "There is 
very little elation about this kind of discovery. But I wouldn't be a historian 
if I didn't think it's better to know than not to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The interim president of Boston University, Jon Westling, said the allegations 
of plagiarism "merit close scrutiny" and he appointed a committee of scholars 
to look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty-five years ago, as now, the university's standards for the proper use 
and attribution of scholarly sources were strict, explicit and explicitly made 
known to all graduate students," Westling said. But, he added, to investigate 
allegations against a dead man unable to defend "any misleading appearances" 
will be difficult. King was assassinated in 1968 in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
The findings have delayed an ambitious plan to edit and publish all of King's 
papers in 14 volumes. The first two volumes, covering King's life until just 
before the start of the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott in 1955, were to be 
published this year. But now all the papers are being scrutinized for possible 
borrowing and are not expected to be published until 1992, complete with 
annotations showing similarities to others' works. 
</P>
<P>
The King papers project is sponsored by the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for 
Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta and is conducted in association with 
Stanford, Emory University and the University of California Press. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members of the King papers project first became aware in 1988 of 
insufficiently credited similarities between some of King's academic papers and 
other writers' texts. How to address the issue reportedly caused much debate at 
the King Center last year. A spokesman at the King Center declined comment 
Friday and said King's widow, Coretta Scott King, who appointed Carson as top 
editor, wanted the Stanford professor to handle any press inquiries about the 
matter. Carson said Friday that he had planned to discuss the findings in a 
history journal article next year but decided to talk publicly after the Wall 
Street Journal published an article Friday about the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Luker, the project's associate editor, said Friday that he would not 
attach the word plagiarism to King's writings but would let others reach their 
own conclusions. "Plagiarism is a charge and I am not making such a charge," he 
said. Yet Luker, who works out of Emory University in Atlanta, said that he 
"had lost sleep" over the findings and that several graduate students quit the 
project because "the research was to some extent spiritually enervating." 
</P>
<P>
King himself donated many of his writings to Boston University six years before 
his assassination, but Mrs. King is suing to retrieve those documents. 
According to Carson, that donation shows that King probably felt no guilt about 
his scholarly work and was not trying to hide any plagiarism. 
</P>
<P>
King's dissertation, entitled "A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the 
Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman," presented some of Tillich's 
ideas in passages nearly identical to Tillich's but did not credit him. 
</P>
<P>
But that is not the worst of academic sins, because those sections were clearly 
intended to represent the views of Tillich, an influential Protestant 
theologian who died in 1965. Worse, in the view of most universities' 
standards, was King's appropriation of works by other writers about Tillich, 
including a 1952 doctoral dissertation by another Boston University student. In 
his own thesis, King cited that dissertation by Jack Boozer in the general 
bibliography but did not credit Boozer for particular passages. 
</P>
<P>
"What we can say is by the strict definition of plagiarism, which is the 
appropriation of words or phrases, there are instances of plagiarism in King's 
papers," Carson said. "But in most of the cases, the sources were . . . in the 
bibliography or on another page." 
</P>
<P>
The revelation about King's student writings may be viewed by some as another 
dent in his image. For example, last year, King's former close associate, the 
Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, published a book which included details about 
King's extramarital sex life. 
</P>
<P>
Abernathy, who died in April, said he did not expect his account to diminish 
King's stature. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Lowery, who had disputed parts of Abernathy's book, urged the public 
not to think any less of King as a result of the plagiarism issue. "Sometimes 
those who are in a high level of scholarship become so involved with technical 
secondary issues that they overlook the substantial issues," Lowery said in a 
phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's project has not yet researched King's later and more famous writings 
and speeches. But other scholars have noted similarities in those to works by 
other ministers and social activists. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Williams, author of "Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years," the 
1987 book tied to the PBS television series of the same name, said there is "no 
doubt" that King or the aides who helped write his speeches sometimes borrowed 
from others' words. To say otherwise, he said Friday, would be "intellectual 
dishonesty." But Williams, now a Washington Post reporter, emphasized that 
focusing on this aspect of King's work was petty, and he feared it will be used 
by "people who haven't gotten over the fact that King was such a great man and 
that we are a changed society in large part because of him." 
</P>

COMPARING THE TEXTS 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a passage from King's 1955 doctoral dissertation and a similar passage 
from a 1952 dissertation by Jack Boozer, another Boston University student. 
They both deal with views of theologian Paul Tillich. In his bibliography, King 
cited Boozer's dissertation, but did not credit this particular passage to 
Boozer. 
</P>
<P>
KING 
</P>
<P>
Tillich insists that a symbol is more than a merely technical sign. The basic 
characteristic of the symbol is its innate power. A symbol possesses a 
necessary characteristic. It cannot be exchanged. A sign, on the contrary, is 
impotent and can be exchanged at will. 
</P>
<P>
BOOZER 
</P>
<P>
Tillich distinguishes between a sign and a symbol. A characteristic of the 
symbol is its innate power. A symbol possesses a necessary character. It cannot 
be exchanged. On the other hand a sign is impotent in itself and can be 
exchanged at will . . .
