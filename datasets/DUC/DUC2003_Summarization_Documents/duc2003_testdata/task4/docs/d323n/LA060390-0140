Reading Richard Holmes' award-winning biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge felt 
something like meeting face-to-face a person with whom I have worked 
long-distance for years. Here he is, with all of his faults and all of his wit, 
all of his astounding intellectual power, and above all with his richly 
engaging personality: Coleridge -- the great Romantic poet and literary critic, 
the theologian, the political theorist. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes plays his hand openly: He has written a courageous and tough-minded 
book. As he points out, "No biographer, since James Dyke Campbell in 1894, has 
tried to examine (Coleridge's) entire life in a broad and sympathetic manner, 
and to ask the one vital question: What made Coleridge -- for all his 
extravagant panoply of faults -- such an extraordinary man, such an 
extraordinary mind? The most radical thing about the present book -- the first 
of two volumes -- is simply that it is a defence of Coleridge in these terms." 
</P>
<P>
Offhand, that may not seem so radical, but in our times as in his own, 
Coleridge has provoked both hyperbolic praise and bitter condemnation. In this 
context, Holmes' work is indeed radical because he does not blink at 
Coleridge's faults, and yet he values both Coleridge's character and his 
achievements fairly. 
</P>
<P>
To do so, Holmes has had to bridge gulfs of several sorts. Because Coleridge's 
interests and achievements were so broad, "Coleridgeans" easily divide into 
hostile camps: the literary theorists, the critics, the epistemologists, the 
theologians, the political theorists. Coleridge's personal life also invites 
sharply divided opinion: Lies, debts, drugs, plagiarism must be balanced 
against wit, generosity, genius and suffering. Given this situation, 
intelligent moderation can be a daring act -- and one that also requires 
considerable scholarship. I came away warmly impressed both with Holmes' 
personal integrity and with his scholarly judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes' balanced yet sympathetic portrait rests upon a consistent narrative 
unity. He does not use biography as an excuse to string together analyses of 
major works. Nor is he trying to psychoanalyze Coleridge. I particularly 
admired the balance and insight of his accounts of Coleridge's early 
experiences because the primary documentary evidence often is so contradictory. 
For instance, all his life Coleridge elicited extravagant praise; in 
particular, he made an incredible first impression on others. Too often, this 
exaggerated praise collapsed into an equally exaggerated censure. Coleridge's 
discerning empathy, his verbal wit, his capacity for self-parody and, above 
all, his prodigious intelligence ought to have impressed anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Coleridge was always eager for approval; he was centrally, agonizingly 
insecure -- a pair of problems that he himself linked to the early death of his 
fond, approving father and to his mother's remarkable coldness. Having elicited 
the attention and approval he needed, Coleridge then had to cope with meeting 
expectations that would have intimidated far more confident men. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes maps out this pattern in well-documented detail but never uses depth 
psychology to explain it away. Instead, he uses the pattern to generate a 
lively dramatic tension: How talented is this chap anyhow? Will he make 
anything of himself? And if so, what? Is he going to make it as a poet? Or 
should he stick with the political journalism that has been so well-received? 
And is this German stuff yet another escape, or will it lead to something? 
</P>
<P>
The only personal or dramatic balance that Holmes misses, it seems to me, 
concerns Coleridge's opium use. Although duly noting Coleridge's arthritis and 
his recurrent bouts with rheumatic fever (in which severe joint pain is the 
most prominent symptom), Holmes at first seems to dismiss Coleridge's 
subsequent malaise in damp winter weather as some version of Seasonal Affective 
Disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes does not point out that Coleridge's pattern of opium use more nearly 
matches that found in people who take narcotics for legitimate reasons: When 
his symptoms subsided with warmer and dryer weather, he could decrease his dose 
with far fewer consequences than true addicts experience. Especially when 
rheumatic valve damage turned to congestive heart failure, Coleridge's mix of 
physical and psychological motives for taking opium became extraordinarily 
complex: the use of the word addict oversimplifies. Holmes does not explore 
these motives with the subtlety that I admire at other points in this book. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Holmes is bold and discerning in his portrait of Coleridge's work, 
including the plagiarism problem. In the disappointments of 1799, Holmes can 
"glimpse something new stirring in that extraordinarily flexible and 
resourceful mind: the hope of creating himself imaginatively out of the sense 
of failure itself." He contends that, for Coleridge, "the subject of failure, 
of lost imaginative power, could itself produce great poetry, vividly imagined 
and metaphysically argued." 
</P>
<P>
This very central argument probably will have a parallel in the next volume of 
this two-volume biography: that the failure of Coleridge's formal philosophic 
ambitions itself produced a philosophic theology and a literary criticism of 
extraordinary power and influence. Holmes' argument about Coleridge's 
significance is radical because Coleridge has been damned for his "inability" 
to propose an old-fashioned, closed, strictly logical philosophical system. Or, 
just as obtusely, Coleridge's philosophic and theological work has been written 
off as a disaster that smothered a fine poet. Holmes adeptly transcends these 
usual categories. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes' work thus complements the massive re-evaluation that has slowly been 
built upon new or modern editions of Coleridge's writings -- especially the 
"Notebooks." This biography promises to integrate Coleridge's career as nothing 
else ever has, and thus to provide one basis for interrelating Coleridge's work 
in diverse disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
"Coleridge: Early Visions" will prove widely influential because Holmes' 
portrait is so accurate, so fully imagined, so wonderfully engaging in its own 
right. I'm ordering copies of this volume as gifts for friends who have heard 
me tell Coleridge stories for 20 years. Here: Someone for you to meet.
