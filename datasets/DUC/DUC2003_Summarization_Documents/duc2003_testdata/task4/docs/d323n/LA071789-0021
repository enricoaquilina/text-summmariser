In the San Diego Tribune newsroom, staffers are questioning their editors' 
definition of plagiarism when it involves press releases, after a recent 
incident involving a real-estate reporter. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, a story on Los Angeles redevelopment with Trib real estate 
reporter Herb Lawrence's byline was killed by editors when it was discovered to 
be extremely similar to an article that ran in a small Los Angeles business 
magazine. Later it was learned that the story in the magazine, as well as 
Lawrence's story, were derived from a press release. 
</P>
<P>
The story didn't run, and Tribune management apparently took no formal action 
against Lawrence. A veteran of more than 20 years with the paper, and its 
former building editor, Lawrence was suspended for a week in 1982 after he 
lifted large sections of a story from an article in an architectural magazine, 
according to published reports at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in the newsroom said that much of the redevelopment story was taken 
verbatim from the press release. Lawrence declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"There is disenchantment far and wide in the newsroom over this," said one Trib 
staffer. "We'd like an accounting of what occurred and how it was handled. If 
it was plagiarism, does management condone plagiarism?" 
</P>
<P>
Tribune Deputy Editor Bob Witty refused to discuss specifics of the Lawrence 
case, but he acknowledged that an accusation of plagiarism was recently 
presented to him. Material from a press release was used "liberally," Witty 
said, but it was not a case of plagiarism. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look up the definition of plagiarism, it is the unauthorized use of 
someone's material," Witty said. "When someone sends you a press packet, you're 
entitled to use everything in there." 
</P>
<P>
In general, Witty said, press releases are helpful as background, but it is 
"sloppy to take things too much from releases." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, public relations people don't mind their material being used in 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
"I take that almost as flattery," one public relations veteran said. "I'd be in 
hog heaven if all my press releases were used verbatim." 
</P>
<P>
The standard industry philosophy, echoed by Witty, is that press releases 
should be used only as background information for stories. 
</P>
<P>
But such general guidelines are sometimes ignored. Quotes are taken from 
releases without being identified as prepared statements. Phrases from releases 
are used in bylined stories. Reporters, especially on small papers, simply 
rewrite press releases and put their names on the new product, adding little or 
no new information. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an absolutist," said Don Sneed, professor of journalism at San Diego State 
University. "You can't be a little pregnant. If you're going to take a 
paragraph from a press release, it's wrong. If you're going to take a handful 
of words, that's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly all papers use rewritten press releases, without bylines, especially 
as briefs in real-estate and business sections. Some, especially understaffed 
weekly papers, commonly insert press releases into the paper, without bylines, 
as news or informational stories. 
</P>
<P>
But there are gray areas. For example, what if a reporter rewrites a press 
release and adds just a sprinkling of new information? Is it fair to give the 
reporter a byline on the story? 
</P>
<P>
"The question in this case is, is he giving readers the good faith they 
deserve?" said Lee Brown, another San Diego State professor. "In my view, to 
claim for your own work that is not yours is not playing fair with the 
readers." 
</P>
<P>
Until recent times, public relations representatives often would develop 
stories for the real-estate sections of many newspapers, supplying reporters 
with quotes and detailed information. 
</P>
<P>
But times are changing. At the San Diego Union, for instance, there was a 
change in editors two years ago, the real-estate department's staff was 
increased, the section's emphasis was moved away from commercial real-estate 
news, and the policy toward press release information was dramatically changed 
to eliminate the verbatim use of press releases. This created a furor among 
public relations practitioners, some of whom talked of boycotting the section. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Union's real-estate section's policy is to attribute the source if a 
quote or information is used from a press release, according to Lizanne 
Poppens, news editor of the Union's Home section. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably commonplace to have more of an industry approach to 
real-estate news in real-estate sections throughout the country," local public 
relations veteran Jim Frampton said. "About 10 years ago, the trend began 
throughout the industry toward more consumer-oriented sections. There was less 
of a reason to quote Joe Blow from XYZ Builders on the economy," precipitating 
a de-emphasis of press release-supplied information. 
</P>
<P>
The use of press release information in stories has been questioned in the 
Tribune newsroom in the past. A year ago, a columnist was accused of copying a 
few paragraphs from a press release. The Lawrence case has simply raised the 
topic again. 
</P>
<P>
"To do nothing about it reaffirms reporters' laziness" toward press releases, 
one Tribune staffer said. "It's telling them it's OK to do this type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
XTRA-FM (91X) Program Director Trip Reeb is leaving the station to become 
general manager of KROQ in Los Angeles, the granddaddy of the "Cutting Edge of 
Rock" format used by 91X. KROQ's ratings have been foundering lately, and it is 
facing a stern new challenge from KQLZ-FM (Pirate Radio). Reeb replaces Tony 
Berardini, who remains vice president of the station, as well as general 
manager of KROQ's sister station in Boston. Reeb will leave 91X in two weeks, 
after a year and a half with the station. "We wanted someone with an overall 
sense of the radio station who could be here all the time," a KROQ spokeswoman 
said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
XTRA-FM is touting its success in the recently released Birch ratings, which 
lists the station No. 1 among listeners 12 and older. The Birch book tends to 
reflect young listeners more than the commonly used Arbitron system because it 
uses phone surveys instead of the written diaries favored by Arbitron. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In this summer of sequels, it is fitting that KNSD-TV (Channel 39) is once 
again exhorting viewers to send their excrement to Thrifty. Called the "Test 
for Life II," the station is offering free screenings for colorectal cancer to 
those who bring stool samples to the stores. More than 59,000 samples were 
brought in during the first Test for Life in 1987, the station said, with 553 
testing positive. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KPBS-TV's "The Art and Vision of James Hubbell" has been picked up by the 
national PBS prime time network, which includes more than 300 stations. No air 
date has been announced . . . . 
</P>
<P>
There's "Public People, Private Lives," the schmaltzy syndicated talk show 
hosted by Sarah Purcell, and then there's "Public People, Private Lives," the 
locally produced talk show that airs on cable systems throughout Southern 
California. Attorneys for David Eisenberg, producer and host of the local 
program, have sent a letter to Orbis Communications, distributor of the other 
show, advising it that his show was on the air first and thus is entitled to 
the name. No reply yet, and Orbis representatives didn't return a reporter's 
calls last week. The Purcell version isn't exactly burning up the airwaves, so 
Eisenberg said he has been advised to "wait and see" if the show even stays on 
the air.
