MR Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD), said yesterday he would sue for libel over accusations
of plagiarism and inaccuracy in his new book about the early Mitterrand
years.
Mr Attali said yesterday he would sue the weekly magazine, Le Nouvel
Observateur, for alleging that his new 960-page book, Verbatim, recording Mr
Francois Mitterrand's time at the Elysee between 1981 and 1986, had
plagiarised conversations which the president had had with Mr Elie Wiesel,
the Nobel Peace prize-winning American author.
Mr Attali told a radio station that 'at my initiative, the president had
some conversations with Elie Wiesel which were broken off and were never the
subject of a contract with any publisher or of any written work'.
'The two men are no longer under any obligation to each other. The president
authorised me to use what he had said in my book, and Elie Wiesel told me he
intended to do the same in his own memoirs,' Mr Attali, who was President
Mitterrand's closest aide during the 1980s, said yesterday.
Le Nouvel Observateur said last night it had not yet received any legal writ
from Mr Attali or his lawyer. Mrs Odile Jacob, a leading French publisher,
had intended to publish the conversations as a book later this year. Mr
Attali said the president had proof-read Verbatim line by line.
Mr Attali has been under fire recently over the amount spent on fitting out
the EBRD headquarters in London. The international governors' board of the
EBRD has ordered an audit into the spending.
