PERSPECTIVE ON MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.;

<P>
WHEN A HERO LETS US DOWN

Of course it matters that Martin Luther King Jr. appears to have plagiarized 
important sections of his doctoral dissertation. It won't change (though it may 
be used to justify) the opinions of those who never thought him worthy of 
adulation. It won't make him less of a hero (though it will certainly render 
him more human) to his legions of admirers. 
</P>
<P>
But it matters -- matters a great deal -- and those who say otherwise may be 
yielding to wishful thinking. As a certified King admirer, I was among those 
whose first reaction to the revelation of his probable academic cheating was to 
insist that it was no big deal. My admiration, I told myself, was based not on 
his scholarship: It was based on his leadership of perhaps the most important 
social movement in the history of this country, on the eloquence of his words 
and actions that moved America to rethink its racial attitudes, change its laws 
and refocus its fundamental dream. 
</P>
<P>
King's most important contribution, I reminded myself, was his gift of courage: 
the courage to resist -- and to inspire countless others to resist -- the Jim 
Crow laws that had seemed a permanent way of life in the Deep South; the 
courage to stand up (or to go limp in passive resistance) against threats of 
jail, economic reprisal and physical harm; the courage to look his own 
impending death in the eye and still go forward with his campaign for racial 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
I still admire him for that. But I also admired King the scholar, a man to whom 
philosophical ideas and political action seemed inseparable, who was as willing 
to borrow the seminal ideas of the great theologians as to appropriate the 
nonviolent techniques of a Gandhi. I treasured his courage, but I also 
treasured the ideas that lay behind the courage and the words that gave it 
force. I have used his example to impress on young people the value of 
scholarship and to tell them (and myself) that intellectual integrity is no 
less valuable than physical courage. 
</P>
<P>
So it cannot be inconsequential that his scholarship and his intellectual 
integrity are now called into question. In one area, at least, my hero has let 
me down, and it makes me sad. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't that I had thought King perfect, or that I joined those who willfully 
overlooked his shortcomings -- or who contended that anyone else should. His 
storied fondness for women and his marital cheating did not, for me, detract 
from either his courage or his moral leadership on the racial front. (My 
objection to the "womanizing" revelations of his friend and picked successor, 
the late Ralph David Abernathy, was not that I thought King's human weaknesses 
should be concealed but that they should not be exploited by someone King had 
let so completely inside and so completely trusted.) 
</P>
<P>
The newest revelations are different, because they call into question not 
King's weaknesses but his strengths. Claybourne Carson, the Stanford University 
researcher picked by King's widow to head the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers 
Project, and a committed admirer of King, has been forced to acknowledge that 
"several" of the martyr's papers, as well as his dissertation, "contain 
numerous appropriated passages that can be defined as plagiarism." 
</P>
<P>
It's a bitter fact that the revelation comes just after the defeat of an 
Arizona bill to make King's birthday an official holiday. It will be used as 
evidence that the Arizona voters were right. 
</P>
<P>
They weren't. The importance of the proposed bill was that it honored America's 
foremost black leader. It was not based on King's reputation as a scholar, but 
on the undeniable fact of his leadership. And those who voted against it would 
not have voted differently if Claybourne Carson's scholars had disclosed that 
the theologian Paul Tillich had stolen from King's work, rather than the other 
way around. Evidence after the fact does not alter the racism implicit in what 
happened in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
But I cannot say it doesn't matter. King the scholar has been diminished, even 
if King the leader stands as tall as ever. I suppose we can draw lessons from 
the revelations -- just as we draw lessons from the discovery that other people 
we admire turn out to have their feet of clay. We need to understand that our 
heroes are, after all, human beings. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't alter my sadness that for now, and in one area of his 
still-astounding career, my hero let me down.
