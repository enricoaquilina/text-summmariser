AMERICAN FARMERS are facing a new year as shrouded in uncertainty as any in
recent times. The collapse of the Soviet Union puts into jeopardy one of
their most lucrative markets; trade war with China is looming; and the
condition of the world economy is precarious.
Negotiators in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade are still deadlocked on farm trade reform. Even the course of the El
Nino weather phenomenon is confounding experts, who worry that it could
trigger droughts in some areas at a time when US grain stocks are
uncomfortably low.
At the annual outlook conference of the US Department of Agriculture
Department last month, Mr James Donald, head of the USDA's World Agriculture
Outlook Board, put an optimistic face on 1992 for American farmers. Global
crop production would fall but animal output would grow, creating many more
hungry mouths to feed, he said.
Higher grain prices and an increased volume of wheat, soyabean and
horticultural product exports would boost the value of farm exports to
Dollars 39bn, up 4 per cent from 1991, Mr Donald forecast. World commodity
demand would increase because of real economic growth of about 2.5 per cent,
population growth of 1.7 per cent and a 2 per cent rise in meat output.
Meanwhile a 'modest increase' could be expected in input prices. However,
the overall result would be cash returns only 'close' to 1991 levels.
Mr Robert McElroy, a USDA agricultural economist, predicted a rise in US
wheat prices next year. But he told the conference a threatened drop in
other grain prices could lead to an overall drop in incomes. That would be a
further blow to a sector where bankruptcies are continuing at a brisk pace,
although not at the rate of the early 1980s.
Mr Mitchell Morehart, another USDA agricultural economist, acknowledged that
the rapid changes in the world had made it 'pretty difficult' to forecast
net farm income. The drop in US interest rates would benefit some farmers
and a possible fall in fuel prices would also help.
Maize is the largest single component of US farmer price receipts and the
republics of the former Soviet Union are still the major wild card in the
pack. The future of this trade rests on the willingness of the west to
provide financial assistance.
If the west withheld credits mendous,' said Mr Alan Terhaar, executive
director of the US Feed Grains Council.
'The cumulative effect of lack of trade credits that would cause the Soviets
to fall from the projected level to, for example, 5m tonnes of imports would
by the end of 1995-96, could cause a build-up of 60m tonnes of US feed
grains stocks. Wheat stocks would face a similar build-up.'
If President Bush took the lead on increasing export guarantees to the
former Soviet republics then the subsequent rise in maize prices could
actually turn falling farm incomes around.
With all the uncertainties, Mr Terhaar expected a 'disappointing' outcome
for 1991-92 trade. Although exports to Mexico had been rising, they were
slightly behind expectations of 7.5m tonnes per year by 1995. Furthermore,
he was keeping a close watch on proposed changes to Mexico's ejido (communal
farm) land tenure system.
'Even two years ago it would have been inconceivable that Mexico would ever
change its ejido system, which dates back to that country's revolution,' Mr
Terhaar said. The system had been 'considered an insurmountable impediment'
to higher Mexican production, but a proposal to introduce privatisation into
the system could have 'far reaching consequences for the make-up of crop and
livestock production'.
Mr Terhaar was hopeful about increased exports to Egypt, since US debt
forgiveness and an emerging private sector had strengthened the market.
Eastern Europe offered some possibility of new markets in the short term but
it could not afford to buy much.
Australia, South Africa and Thailand appeared to be moving away from feed
grains exports, but the Asian market posed another concern for the US.
Japan's tariff quota on imports of maize for industrial processing and
layers of regulations and secondary tariffs on feed grain might indicate 'we
have simply reached a plateau in Japanese imports. . . or we are entering a
period of significant decline'.
In Korea the US was facing China as a major competitor, while China was
maintaining firm control on import volume into the south, where economic
growth rates in excess of 20 per cent were causing an explosion in demand.
Mr Terhaar was 'bullish' that China would succumb to economic and political
pressures to open its market to feed grain imports. Currently it was
importing 800,000 tonnes of barley for malt production, and demand was
growing by more than 100,000 tonnes a year.
The likeliest bet is that election year politics will prevail and US farmers
will not be allowed to suffer unduly in 1992. If history repeats itself -
and why not? - then the Republican administration and Democratic Congress
will join forces to ensure that the Midwest and the Sunbelt states, major
electoral battlegrounds, will get sticking plasters for their pain.
Already there have been calls in Congress for export subsidy re-armament.
President Bush, facing a tough re-election fight and lagging in the polls,
is unlikely to refuse this favoured constituency unless Gatt brings
discipline into the trade.
