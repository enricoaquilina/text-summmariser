Two stormy nights in a week do not a rainy season make, but some climate 
experts are wondering whether the trace amounts of rain that fell six days 
apart in Southern California and other changes in weather patterns signal an 
end to the region's four-year chain of dry winters. 
</P>
<P>
Despite continuing concern about the prospects for a fifth drought year in 
California, weather and water experts said that, at least on paper, there 
appear to be improved conditions for a wetter rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
Among encouraging indications they cited were movement by a coastal 
high-pressure system toward the central Pacific Ocean, evidence that El Nino 
warming conditions are under way off the coast, and a spate of small storms 
across the West. 
</P>
<P>
"The possibilities are there," said Jerry McDuffie, deputy meteorologist in the 
National Weather Service's Los Angeles bureau, "but they could disappear in a 
hurry. You never know in this business." 
</P>
<P>
Weather and water experts also cautioned that a failure to at least match 
average rainfall over the next three crucial wet-season months could lead to 
the driest year yet. An average snowfall of 52 inches a year in the Sierra 
Nevada is essential to provide water for the southern part of the state, but so 
far, precipitation is running more than 7 inches below average. 
</P>
<P>
"We need something in the bucket we can really count on," said Maurice Roos, 
the state's chief hydrologist. 
</P>
<P>
The two rainfalls in Southern California -- dropping just 0.19 of an inch on 
downtown Los Angeles last Tuesday and early Monday -- are at least a start, 
experts said. "They need to hang around a little longer," McDuffie said. "It's 
the two- to three-day storms that are the ones we want." 
</P>
<P>
One reason the storms blew through so quickly, meteorologists said, was the 
high-pressure system lingering in the upper atmosphere over the central 
Pacific. In recent dry winters, that system was closer to the California coast, 
acting as a shield and preventing moist air from pouring in at lower 
elevations. 
</P>
<P>
But with the system now farther out in the Pacific, there are more chances for 
not only the sort of brief showers that fell on Southern California, but also 
for heavier rainstorms of the kind that caused flooding last weekend in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We still don't have an ideal situation for heavy rains, but it's certainly 
improved," said Mike Smith, a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which 
provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and other experts also pointed to warming sea surface temperatures as a 
sign that El Nino conditions are starting again. El Ninos -- Pacific Ocean 
temperature fluctuations near the Equator that are linked to changes in 
low-level atmospheric patterns -- may set favorable conditions for more 
rainfall, meteorologists say. 
</P>
<P>
Experts cautioned that El Ninos do not necessarily bring more rain. "We've had 
cases of heavy and light precipitation associated with El Nino conditions," 
said Dan Cayan, a climate researcher with the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography. "All we can say for sure is that if these conditions last, there 
are some changes in store." 
</P>
<P>
The early Monday rainfall brought no more than 0.02 of an inch to downtown Los 
Angeles, but was accompanied by cold temperatures and biting winds that hinted 
of winter weather to come. The overnight low was 54 downtown and the high 
Monday was 63. 
</P>
<P>
Although high temperatures inland were expected to continue in the 60s today, 
with winds between 25 and 30 m.p.h., temperatures could reach into the 70s on 
the coast, said WeatherData forecaster Steve Burback. And by Wednesday, 
temperatures will begin a warming trend that will rise into the 80s by the 
weekend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are no signs of more rain, Burback added. 
</P>
<P>
The latest storm brought snow to parts of the Sierra and the local mountains. 
The National Weather Service reported that 1.75 inches of snow fell early 
Monday at Big Bear Lake. 
</P>
<P>
To ward off the morning chill, Los Angeles residents donned coats and 
turtleneck sweaters and began using car heaters on their way to work. Heating 
fuel companies reported a sudden surge in business. Customers "are talking 
about what a sudden cold snap we're having," said Dale Gould, manager of 
Heating &amp; Cooling Supply in Van Nuys. "People always wait till it gets cold 
to buy a furnace." 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, the city opened up a shelter for the homeless as 
part of an emergency foul-weather program. The Van Nuys Armory will house 
homeless adults for one night after predictions that the temperature in the 
Valley would dip to 40 degrees or below. 
</P>
<P>
In the deserts, winds gusted to 60 m.p.h., uprooting dozens of trees, toppling 
Christmas decorations and power lines and whipping up thick sandstorms that 
caused several minor traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit was eastern Riverside County, where a frigid wind caused scattered 
power outages in desert from Palm Springs to Blythe. There were no injuries or 
major damage reported, but work crews were busy throughout the day replacing 
fallen street signs and traffic signals.

downtown L.A. crystal clear -- and temperatures in the low 50s prompted some 
morning commuters to don sweaters or to turn on car heaters. The chill came in 
the wake of a second light sprinkling of rain in a week. KEN LUBAS / Los
