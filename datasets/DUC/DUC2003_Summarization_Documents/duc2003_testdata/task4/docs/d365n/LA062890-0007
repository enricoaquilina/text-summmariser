This is supposed to be June Gloom. That's what the month between May and July 
is ordinarily called in San Diego. But in looking for a word to describe this 
June, gloom just isn't a strong contender. 
</P>
<P>
Local experts suggest maybe a new name is needed. 
</P>
<P>
June Weird? 
</P>

As San Diego broke a record for heat Wednesday -- the high at Lindbergh Field 
reached 91 degrees, surpassing the mark of 1976 -- the weathered weather types 
scrambled to find out why. 
</P>
<P>
"This has certainly been an unusual month," said Dan Atkin, meteorologist with 
the National Weather Service. "It's been the wettest June ever in San Diego, 
and that was from one storm. And now we've got this heat." 
</P>
<P>
Atkin said San Diego received 0.38 of an inch of rain on June 9, followed by 
0.48 of an inch the next day, breaking two daily records. The accumulated 0.86 
of an inch set a monthly record. 
</P>
<P>
"In average years," Atkin said, "June is our cloudiest month of the year. On 
the average, the smallest amount of possible sunshine we receive in San Diego 
is 57%. We don't have complete figures yet, but this June has been much sunnier 
than normal." 
</P>
<P>
Atkin said the traditional June Gloom is caused by a blast of heat welling up 
from the desert and coming into conflict with "very cool air over the water. At 
the same time, high pressure is starting to form, which traps the marine air. 
In July and August, we usually break through the (temperature) inversion, and 
it gets much, much hotter. This year, it happened earlier." 
</P>
<P>
Atkin said the temperature this time of year usually hovers around 73 degrees. 
He speculated that part of the extreme conditions, not just here but 
nationally, is caused by El Nino and the greenhouse effect. Not just summers, 
but winters, too, Atkin said, are now more severe. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hibbert, a meteorologist with Weatherdata Inc. in Wichita, Kan., which 
supplies weather information for The Times, believes the greenhouse effect and 
El Nino -- as well as its "female" counterpart, La Nina -- have had a profound 
effect on weather nationwide, particularly in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Hibbert defines the greenhouse effect as "man's influence on the environment, 
where industrial processes and consumer excesses have generated gases that tend 
to absorb solar radiation rather than let it transfer freely." 
</P>
<P>
"El Nino is the shifting of temperatures on the surface of the sea," Hibbert 
said. "People generally don't recognize that oceans cover three-fourths of the 
planet's surface, receiving three-fourths of the sunlight that shines on the 
Earth at any given time. Normally, El Nino affects Southern California with 
much wetter weather. 
</P>
<P>
"What people don't know as much about is La Nina, which imposes the opposite 
condition. That produces a cooling of (ocean) surface temperatures, resulting 
in excessively dry weather, which you're now having in Southern California," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Both can be equally virulent, especially with both occurring in conjunction 
with other weather patterns. What you have to remember is, with weather, 
nothing stands alone -- everything is interconnected. And, whatever the 
connection is, at the moment, it's producing extreme heat and very dry 
conditions in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"But believe me, it's hardly as bad as Wichita, where I am. I'll trade with you 
any time."
