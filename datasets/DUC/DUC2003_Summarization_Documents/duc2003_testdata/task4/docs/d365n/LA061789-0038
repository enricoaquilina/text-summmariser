ASTRONAUT RIDE TO PURSUE DUAL INTERESTS AT UCSD 
</P>

Casting about for a new career challenge, Sally K. Ride, the first U.S. woman 
astronaut, said she sought to pursue two interests: teaching and the space 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Physicist Ride, who is winding up a two-year-stint as a fellow at Stanford 
University's prestigious Center for International Security and Arms Control, 
has found such a dual role at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, UC San Diego announced that Ride has been appointed a professor of 
physics at the university, and that she will serve as director of the 
California Space Institute, part of the university's Scripps Institute of 
Oceanography. Her time will be divided between the two responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Space, as it is known, coordinates space-related research at all eight 
general campuses in the University of California system. It also serves as a 
liaison with the state aerospace industry in developing new technologies and 
their applications. 
</P>
<P>
Ride, whose appointment becomes effective July 1 and who is already slated to 
teach undergraduate physics classes in the fall, said the joint positions 
dovetailed in singular fashion with her career plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Package 'Very Attractive' 
</P>
<P>
"This will allow me to pursue my interest in physics and in the space program," 
Ride said Friday in a brief telephone interview from Stanford. "The package of 
those two was very attractive. . . . It's a good opportunity for development." 
</P>
<P>
Ride, who participated in two space shuttle missions in 1983-84, also served on 
the presidential commission that investigated the fatal explosion in 1986 
aboard the space shuttle Challenger, and later directed a National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration panel on the future of the space program. She stepped 
down from NASA in 1987 to assume the position at Stanford. She remains one of 
the nation's best-known ex-astronauts, although she has shunned interviews and 
is said to have not enjoyed the public exposure that accompanied her position 
as the first U.S. woman in space. 
</P>
<P>
Ride expressed her view that the shuttle program was developing very well since 
the Challenger accident, and that NASA was "paying an appropriate amount of 
attention to safety." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Research Outpost on Moon 
</P>
<P>
She reiterated her well-known interest in establishing a permanent research 
outpost on the moon, and urged Congress, the Bush Administration and NASA to 
coordinate a long-term plan for space exploration. "If it's not developed," she 
said, "the space program will be fragmented." 
</P>
<P>
Space policy debates in Washington currently focus on a number of potential 
avenues, including whether to fund a manned space station, an expedition to 
Mars, or both. 
</P>
<P>
At UC San Diego, there was a sense that Ride's arrival was a coup. The former 
astronaut said she had been in touch with several universities in recent 
months, but the San Diego offer was the "most appealing." She is to be paid a 
full professor's salary of $64,000, plus a $6,000 stipend as the Cal Space 
director, a university spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sally was sort of a natural for this," said Edward A. Frieman, director of the 
Scripps Institute of Oceanography, which is part of the UC San Diego campus. 
"Clearly, Sally has immense experience in areas that relate to this (space), 
and impinge on it." 
</P>
<P>
Added UC San Diego Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson: "I can think of no one 
better suited to lead Cal Space into the next decade and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
Ride said it was premature to say in what direction she hoped to guide the Cal 
Space institute, which was created by the California Legislature in 1979. The 
idea was to coordinate disparate space research throughout the system. Cal 
Space has a budget of $3.3 million, including university funds and grants, and 
employs 28 full- and part-time staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Ride did express a clear interest in expanding satellite remote sensing of the 
Earth, a growing field in which space images are used to study a wide range of 
environmental phenomena, from global warming to the destruction of rain 
forests. Scripps is already heavily involved in such monitoring, and is 
expecting to conduct even more related research. 
</P>
<P>
Other fields of research coordinated by Cal Space include climatology, space 
resources, propulsion and robotics. Specific research projects include cloud 
effects on radiative energy, marine production, advanced propulsion systems and 
El Nino, the Pacific current that affects fisheries and climate. 
</P>
<P>
Ride, 38, who is single and a native of Encino, holds master's and doctorate 
degrees in physics from Stanford, as well as an undergraduate diploma from the 
same university. University of California regents approved her appointment at 
UC San Diego this week. 
</P>
<P>
At Cal Space, she will replace James Arnold, the founding director, who is 
stepping down to devote full time to teaching and research.
