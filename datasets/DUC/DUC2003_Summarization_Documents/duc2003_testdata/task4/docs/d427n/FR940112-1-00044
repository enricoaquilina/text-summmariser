SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to add 313 chemicals and chemical categories to the list of toxic chemicals required to be reported
on under section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 and section 6607 of the Pollution
Prevention Act of 1990. The proposed addition of these chemicals and chemical categories is based on their acute human
health effects, carcinogenicity or other chronic human health effects, and/or their environmental effects. EPA
believes that these chemicals and chemical categories meet the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria for addition to
the list of toxic chemicals.

A. Statutory Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is issued under sections 313(d) and (e)(1) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11023. EPCRA is also referred to as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization
Act of 1986.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 313 of EPCRA requires certain facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using listed toxic chemicals
to report their environmental releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such
facilities also must report pollution prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607
of the Pollution Prevention Act, 42 U.S.C. 13106. When enacted, section 313 established an initial list of toxic chemicals
that was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and 20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to add chemicals
to or delete chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria for these actions. Under section 313(e), any person may
petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list. EPA has added to and deleted chemicals from the original
statutory list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA issued a statement of petition policy and guidance in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479), to provide guidance regarding the recommended content and format for submitting
petitions. EPA must respond to petitions within 180 days either by initiating a rulemaking or by publishing an explanation
of why the petition is denied. On May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23703), EPA issued guidance regarding the recommended content
of petitions to delete individual members of the section 313 metal compound categories.

II. Explanation for Expansion of the EPCRA Section 313 Chemical List 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), through the public access provisions of EPCRA, has proven to be one of the most
powerful forces in empowering the Federal government, State governments, industry, environmental groups, and
the general public, to fully participate in an informed dialogue about the environmental impacts of toxic chemicals
in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A major section of EPCRA, which Congress passed in 1986, resulted in the creation of the Toxics Release Inventory.
TRI is a publicly available data base that provides quantitative information on toxic chemical releases, transfers,
recycling, and disposal. With the collection of this information for the first time in 1987, came the ability for the
public, government, and the regulated community to understand the magnitude of chemical emissions in the United
States; to compare chemical releases and transfers of chemical wastes among States, industries, facilities, and
environmental media; and perhaps most importantly, to assess the need to reduce and where possible, eliminate these
releases and transfers. TRI enables all interested in environmental progress to establish credible baselines,
to set realistic goals, and to measure progress over time, in meeting those goals. The TRI system has become a neutral
yardstick by which progress can be measured by all interested parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original list of chemicals for which reporting was required consisted of 320 chemicals and chemical categories.
The list was a combination of the Maryland Chemical Inventory Report List of Toxic or Hazardous Substances and the
New Jersey Environmental Hazardous Substance List. The combination of these two lists provided a sound and logical
starting point for the national TRI program. Recognizing however that the list would need to be a dynamic one, EPCRA
specifically authorizes additions to and deletions from the list. To date, EPA has added 16 chemicals to the list and
has deleted 12 chemicals from the list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With 5 years experience behind the program, EPA, other federal agencies, Congress, and the public have recognized
the need to expand the TRI list beyond the original chemicals and chemical categories and beyond the relatively limited
reporting universe. (Currently reporting is only required from facilities that fall within the manufacturing Standard
Industrial Classification (SIC) codes 20 through 39 that meet certain thresholds).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the data on the chemicals that are covered have allowed the public and private sectors to be informed and involved
in environmental decisionmaking as they never were before, it has become increasingly evident to those same constituents
that they have access to information on a relatively small number of important chemicals. Congress has echoed this
recognition in the Right-to-Know More bills that were put forward in the 102nd Congress. EPA and State regulatory
agencies have integrated TRI information as a critical component in their environmental decisionmaking and in many
cases are constrained by the lack of similar information on chemicals of concern not covered by the TRI. While the TRI
has been successful in focusing attention on the initial list of chemicals and in many cases fostering emissions reductions
and prevention activities, that same focus has highlighted the need to expand beyond that initial list and to include
additional chemicals that exhibit similar toxicity characteristics. This proposal is one of the first in a series
of actions that EPA plans to use to expand the coverage of the TRI. This first phase will focus on adding chemicals, followed
by a second phase that will identify additional facilities for inclusion. EPA is considering a third phase, which
would look at modification of the data elements currently required by TRI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conjunction with these expansion activities EPA has been considering whether other adjustments are needed in
the scope of the TRI program. EPA received petitions from the Small Business Administration and the American Feed
Industry Association seeking an exemption for ``small sources'' (i.e, those facilities that file TRI forms with
zero or small release estimates). EPA previously put those petitions out for public comment and, on review, believes
there is substantial merit to the general concerns raised in the petitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's plan for proceeding on the small source issue would include the following steps. EPA is examining four
options for establishing a small release exemption from the TRI reporting obligation: Cutoffs at zero, 500 pounds,
1,000 pounds, and 5,000 pounds. EPA will provide the public with a report on these four options by the end of January.
This analysis will consider what data might not be available at both the national and community level, and the cost
savings to the government and to industry of the four exemption levels. EPA plans to hold a public meeting in February
for discussion of the report. Based on this feedback, EPA will then design a regulatory strategy that will align the
small source issue with final action on today's proposal. The Agency's objective will be to minimize unnecessary
data collection and reporting by facilities, including for the chemicals identified in today's proposal.

B. Development of the Chemical Addition Candidates
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a starting point for screening candidates for addition to the toxic chemical list under EPCRA section 313, EPA chose
to examine the lists of chemicals regulated or identified, as of concern, under various environmental statutes including:
(1) Section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990 (Hazardous Air Pollutants); (2) section 602(b) of the
CAA (Class II ozone depleting substances); (3) section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) (Priority Pollutant List);
(4) Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Active Ingredients, including Special Review,
Canceled/Denied or Suspended, and Restricted Use Pesticides; (5) section 302 of EPCRA (Extremely Hazardous Substances);
(6) section 102 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); (7) section
3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and chemicals listed at 40 CFR 261.33(e) and (f) and Appendix
VIII; (8) section 1412 of the Safe Drinking Water Act as amended; (9) certain chemicals subject to the Toxics Substance
Control Act (Existing Chemicals); and (10) the State of California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act
of 1986 (Proposition 65) (List of Chemicals Known to the State to Cause Reproductive Toxicity). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA considered chemicals designated as possible, probable, or known carcinogens in the Monographs
of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the 6th Annual Report on Carcinogens of the National
Toxicology Program (NTP), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). From this initial group of substances,
EPA excluded chemicals that are already listed on section 313 or are already reportable under one of the EPCRA section
313 categories. For example, ``cyanide, total'' is listed under section 307(a) of the CWA. This listing is considered
to be a subset of the EPCRA section 313 cyanide compounds category and the hydrogen cyanide listing. EPA decided not
to propose listing these types of chemicals separately because they are already reportable under one of the existing
section 313 categories. To prioritize chemicals for possible addition to EPCRA section 313, EPA applied a human health
and ecotoxicity screen and a production volume screen, which are described below. The results of the toxicity screen
for a subset of these chemicals were presented at a public meeting on May 29, 1992 (Ref. 4). Other chemicals were also
removed from consideration for this rulemaking because they are the subjects of two recently published EPCRA petition
responses. On March 4, 1992, EPA received a petition from Governor Mario M. Cuomo of New York and the Natural Resources
Defense Council (NRDC) to add 80 chemicals and 2 chemical categories to the list of toxic chemicals under section 313
of EPCRA. All of these chemicals and chemical categories appear on the RCRA list of hazardous wastes under 40 CFR 261.33(f)
and as such are a subset of the chemicals screened by EPA. EPA responded to the petition in a proposed rulemaking on September
8, 1992 (57 FR 41020) and in a final rule adding 22 chemicals on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63500). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 3, 1991, EPA received a petition from the NRDC, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund
to add hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) to the list of toxic chemicals under section 313 of EPCRA. The HCFCs are listed
under section 602(b) of the CAA as Class II ozone depleting substances and as such are a subset of the chemicals screened
by EPA. EPA responded to the petition in a proposed rulemaking on June 24, 1992 (57 FR 28159) and in a final rule adding
11 HCFCs on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63496). An additional 16 HCFCs not added to the TRI list by the November 30, 1993 final
rule are proposed for addition in this rulemaking (See Unit IV.B.135. of this preamble).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Toxicity screen
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A toxicity screen is a limited review of readily available toxicity data (e.g., information in data bases and other
secondary sources) that is used for a preliminary categorization of a chemical during the process of selecting candidates
for possible listing under EPCRA section 313. The toxicity screen is used to identify chemicals for further consideration
and does not reflect a final determination for listing a chemical under EPCRA section 313. Such a determination can
only be made after a hazard assessment is conducted (See Unit II.B.3. of this preamble). The chemicals identified
above were screened for four general effect categories: Acute human health effects, cancer, other chronic human
health effects, and ecological effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The screening criteria associated with each of the effect areas used in the toxicity screen are discussed in detail
in the

Revised Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines for Listing Chemicals on the Toxic Release Inventory (Draft Hazard Assessment
Guidelines)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, (Ref. 6). The numerical screening values reflected in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 were developed to capture, in the ``sufficient for listing'' screening category, the majority of chemicals already
listed on various CERCLA and EPCRA lists, and thus known or suspected to be toxic and/or hazardous. These 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contain guidance for both the screening and hazard assessments of chemicals and are available for review in the docket
associated with this rulemaking. This draft document was distributed at a public meeting on May 29, 1992. A final version
of these guidelines has not yet been developed. Requests for further information about these draft guidelines should
be addressed to the person identified under ``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the results of this screen, the chemicals were preliminarily placed in one of three screening categories
defined in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: ``sufficient;'' ``may be sufficient;'' or ``insufficient.'' EPA received comment in response to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that objected to the Agency's use of the terms ``sufficient,'' ``may be sufficient,'' and ``insufficient'' as titles
for the toxicity screening categories. The commenter claimed that these terms are appropriate only for the results
of a hazard assessment. The commenter stated that these terms should not be used for screening categories because
the toxicity screen only identifies chemicals for further consideration. EPA agrees that the screening categories
only reflect a preliminary determination on each chemical, and therefore, to avoid further confusion, will refer
to the screening categories as ``high priority,'' ``medium priority,'' and ``low priority'' to reflect the difference
between a toxicity screen and a hazard assessment. These terms will be used throughout this document in reference
to the toxicity screening categories. Chemicals that were categorized as ``low priority'' during the screening
process were not considered further as candidates for addition to the EPCRA section 313 list in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Production volume screen
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPCRA section 313(f) establishes reporting thresholds related to the amount of a chemical that is manufactured,
processed, or otherwise used. [The EPCRA section 313 manufacture (includes import) and processing thresholds are
25,000 pounds per facility per year. The otherwise use threshold is 10,000 pounds per facility per year]. EPA anticipates
that the addition of chemicals manufactured, imported, processed, or used in quantities less than the EPCRA section
313 volume thresholds would not result in the submission of TRI reports. Thus, EPA elected to initially focus its attention
on chemicals likely to yield reports. Accordingly, EPA also screened potential candidates for the likelihood of
meeting the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds. Chemicals for which there were no data to indicate that the chemical
is likely to meet or exceed the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds were not considered further as possible candidates
for addition to the section 313 list at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Production volume data on each of the chemicals were gathered primarily from two sources: (1) The TSCA Chemical Update
System (1990); and (2) the FIFRA Section 7 Tracking System. On June 12, 1986 (51 FR 21438), EPA promulgated a rule pursuant
to section 8(a) of TSCA which required manufacturers and importers to report every 4 years, subject to certain threshold
production quantities and other exclusions, the quantities of chemicals they produced (40 CFR part 710). Among the
exceptions to the inventory update rule (IUR) reporting were polymers, biological products, inorganic substances,
and chemicals produced at less than 10,000 pounds, all with certain limitations. Data from the IUR is maintained in
EPA's TSCA Chemical Update System (CUS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7 of FIFRA provides the Agency with annual production information on registered pesticides. EPA regulations
implementing FIFRA section 7 (40 CFR part 167) require all manufacturers of pesticidal products (which includes
formulated pesticides, active ingredients, and devices) to submit an annual report detailing the amount of each
type of pesticidal product manufactured, sold and distributed during the past year, and estimated to be manufactured,
imported, and processed during the current year (40 CFR 167.85). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For industrial inorganic compounds not subject to FIFRA or available on CUS, information from the public literature
was used, supplemented with information from companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hazard evaluation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA conducted a hazard evaluation for each of the addition candidates that resulted from the above analyses and determined
based on the weight-of-the evidence if there was sufficient evidence to establish that the candidate chemical met
the statutory criteria for addition to EPCRA section 313. To make this determination, EPA senior scientists reviewed
readily available toxicity information on each chemical for each of the following effect areas: acute human health
effects; cancer; other chronic human effects; and environmental effects. In addition, EPA reviewed, where appropriate,
information on the environmental fate of the chemical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with relevant EPA guidelines for each adverse human health or environmental
effect (e.g., the appropriate guidelines for hazard evaluation of chemical carcinogens and for the type of evidence
required to substantiate a determination of carcinogenicity are the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 2)). The guidelines that were used for each effect are Agency guidelines that are identified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 6). During this assessment the severity and significance of the effects induced by the chemical, the dose level
causing the effect, and the quality and quantity of the available data, including the nature of the data (e.g., human
epidemiological, laboratory animal, field or workplace studies) and confidence level in the existing data base,
were all considered. Where a careful review of the scientific data for a particular chemical results in a high level
of confidence that the chemical causes an adverse effect at relatively low dose levels, EPA believes that this evidence
is sufficient for listing the chemical under section 313. On the other hand, where a review of the scientific data indicates
that the chemical will cause various adverse effects at moderate dose levels, EPA believes, based on the total weight-of-the-evidence,
that there is sufficient evidence for listing the chemical under EPCRA section 313. EPA also conducted an analysis
of exposure for each chemical or chemical category proposed for listing under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) (i.e.,
based on adverse acute human health effects), and, where appropriate, under section 313(d)(2)(C) (i.e., based on
adverse ecological effects). For chemicals listed under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A), this analysis included estimated
concentrations of the chemical at or beyond the facility site boundary through the use of estimated releases and modelling
techniques. EPA requests comment on its approach in considering exposure as a part of its evaluation of these chemicals
under sections 313(d)(2)(A) and (C).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this analysis for each of the chemicals proposed for listing, EPA determined that one or more of the statutory
criteria were met. A discussion of EPA's interpretation of the EPCRA section 313 criteria is given in Unit III. of this
preamble. A discussion of the evidence supporting EPA's proposal to add each of the chemicals to EPCRA section 313
is presented in Unit IV. of this preamble and in the record supporting this proposed rule.

. EPA excluded certain chemicals and chemical categories from consideration for proposed listing under EPCRA section
313 in this rulemaking for a number of reasons. Some chemicals were identified only as environmental degradation
products rather than chemicals that are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used by a facility. These chemicals
will only be present in the environment as a result of the release into the environment of precursor chemicals. If the
degradation product meets the toxicity criteria of EPCRA section 313, the precursor chemical may be considered for
listing on EPCRA section 313. The degradation product would not be considered for listing on EPCRA section 313 because
a facility subject to EPCRA section 313 is only required to file a TRI report for a chemical that it manufactures, processes,
or otherwise uses, within the facility boundaries. Therefore, EPA does not believe that it is appropriate to consider
listing such chemicals at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the lists reviewed by EPA included listings that represented waste streams from particular processes. These
waste streams, such as coke oven emissions, are not discrete chemicals or chemical categories, but contain a wide
range of chemicals, many of which are currently listed individually on EPCRA section 313. The focus of this rulemaking
is on the addition of specific chemicals and chemical categories and, as such, EPA believes that these waste streams
are inappropriate for listing under EPCRA section 313 at this time. EPA also excluded chemicals whose only identified
toxicity concern was a result of their status as a volatile organic compound (VOC). VOCs contribute to the formation
of tropospheric ozone which causes a number of health-related and environmental problems. EPA continues to believe
that VOCs meet the listing criteria of EPCRA section 313. However, EPA intends to address the issue of how VOCs should
be listed on EPCRA section 313 separately. Therefore, chemicals whose only identified toxicity concern is due to
their status as VOCs were excluded from consideration at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also identified chemicals that are routinely manufactured, processed, or otherwise used at levels far below
the reporting thresholds of EPCRA section 313. These chemicals are not expected to ever be manufactured, processed,
or otherwise used in quantities at or above these reporting thresholds. In this proposed rulemaking, EPA is attempting
to add chemicals to EPCRA section 313 that are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used in quantities greater than
the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds and thus would result in the submission of TRI reports. Consequently, chemicals
that are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used in quantities less than the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds
were excluded from further consideration at this time, because no reports would be filed under EPCRA section 313 for
such chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the chemicals that are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used below the EPCRA section 313 activity thresholds,
particularly those chemicals that are manufactured in trace amounts in waste streams, are highly toxic at very low
dose levels and have physical, chemical, or biological properties that make the chemicals persist for extended periods
in the environment, and bioaccumulate through the food chain. Persistent bioaccumulative toxic chemicals, such
as dioxins, are of particular concern in ecosystems such as the Great Lakes Basin due to the long retention time of the
individual lakes and the cycling of the chemical from one component of the ecosystem to another. EPA may reconsider
in the future the issue of listing such chemicals in a manner which would result in the submission of TRI reports. EPA
requests comment on the following: Is it appropriate to list such chemicals on EPCRA section 313? If EPA were to add
this type of chemical to EPCRA section 313, what modifications to EPCRA section 313, such as lowering the reporting
thresholds and modifying the

be collected?

III. EPCRA Section 313 Statutory Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPCRA section 313(d)(2) sets out criteria for adding chemicals to the list of chemicals subject to reporting under
section 313(a). For a chemical (or category of chemicals) to be added to the EPCRA section 313(c) list of toxic chemicals,
the Administrator must determine whether, in her judgement, there is sufficient evidence to establish any one of
the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The chemical is known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health
effects at concentration levels that are reasonably likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries as a result of
continuous, or frequently recurring, releases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The chemical is known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause in humans--
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) cancer or teratogenic effects, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) serious or irreversible--
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) reproductive dysfunctions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(II) neurological disorders, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(III) heritable genetic mutations, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(IV) other chronic health effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The chemical is known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause, because of--
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) its toxicity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) its toxicity and persistence in the environment, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) its toxicity and tendency to bioaccumulate in the environment, a significant adverse effect on the environment
of sufficient seriousness, in the judgement of the Administrator, to warrant reporting under this section. To remove
a chemical from the section 313(c) list, the Administrator must determine that there is not sufficient evidence to
establish any of the criteria described above as required by EPCRA section 313(d)(3). Thus, the criteria for listing
or delisting a chemical are identical. However, whereas EPA can add a chemical if only one of the criteria is met, it
can only delete a chemical if none of the criteria are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ascertain whether there is sufficient or insufficient evidence to determine that the statutory criteria are met
for listing a chemical, EPA conducts a hazard assessment on the chemical and determines based on the weight-of-the-evidence,
whether the chemical can reasonably be anticipated to cause any of the adverse effects specified in EPCRA section
313(d)(2). The hazard analysis is described above in Unit II.B.3. of this preamble. EPA's interpretation of the specific
statutory criteria follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 313(d)(2)(A) (acute human health effects)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. To determine whether the section 313(d)(2)(A) ``acute human health effects'' criterion is met, EPA must examine
the adverse effects associated with the chemical, the ``concentration levels'' which would cause acute human health
effects, and the likelihood of such levels existing ``beyond facility site boundaries as a result of continuous,
or frequently recurring, releases.'' Such a determination may include, among other factors, consideration of production
processes, workplace procedures, pollution controls, and the volume and pattern of production, use, and release,
as well as other chemical-specific factors. EPA believes that to make the section 313(d)(2)(A) determination it
must demonstrate that a chemical can reasonably be anticipated to be released in quantities that result in concentration
levels, or within a reasonable margin of exposure of the concentration levels, that would be expected to cause acute
human health effects beyond the facility site boundary. The margin of exposure applied is dependent upon the type
of hazard data (e.g., data in animals versus human) and the confidence in this hazard data base for acute effects (e.g.,
sufficiency of the hazard data). However, EPA is not required to make a facility-specific finding, nor is it necessary
for EPA to demonstrate that these concentration levels or effects occur at or near any particular facility (Ref. 1).
Furthermore, ``EPA may, but is not required to, conduct new studies or risk assessments or perform site-specific
analyses to establish actual ambient concentrations or to document adverse effects at any particular location''
(Ref. 1). Nor is EPA limited to considering concentration levels and potential acute human health effects at the ``fenceline.''
Rather, the phrase ``beyond facility site boundaries'' reflects Congress' recognition that the ``highest concentration
to which persons outside the site boundary may be exposed'' could occur at ``any point outside the boundaries of the
site on which the facility is located,'' including, for example, where an air emissions plume cools and settles to
the ground (Ref. 1). Therefore, EPA believes that to make a finding under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A), the Agency may
estimate concentrations at or beyond the facility site boundary through the use of estimated releases and modelling
techniques. The term ``continuous or frequently recurring releases'' is included only to distinguish routine releases
that are a normal consequence of the operation of a facility from the episodic and accidental releases that are subject
to EPCRA section 304 (Ref. 1). As such, EPA believes that episodic and accidental releases are not pertinent in a determination
that a chemical meets the section 313(d)(2)(A) criterion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 313(d)(2)(B) (chronic human health effects)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In contrast to the section 313(d)(2)(A) criterion, section 313(d)(2)(B) does not require consideration of either
the nature and frequency of releases or concentration levels at facility site boundaries. Rather, section 313(d)(2)(B)
is focused solely on whether the chemical is known or can reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer, teratogenicity,
or other serious or irreversible chronic human health effects. Consequently, EPA believes that it is sufficient
to consider only the toxicity of the subject chemical to make the section 313(d)(2)(B) determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 313(d)(2)(C) (environmental effects)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The section 313(d)(2)(C) criterion requires EPA to consider a chemical's potential to cause significant adverse
effects on the environment. The statute directs EPA to base its determination on a consideration of the toxicity of
the chemical, either alone or in combination with the persistence of the chemical or the potential for the chemical
to bioaccumulate. Congress intended that EPA consider a broad range of environmental effects when making a determination
under section 313(d)(2)(C).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining what constitutes a significant adverse effect on the environment...the Administrator should consider
the extent to which the toxic chemical causes or can reasonably be anticipated to cause any of the following adverse
reactions, even if restricted to the immediate vicinity adjacent to the site: (1) Gradual or sudden changes in the
composition of animal life or plant life, including fungal or microbial organisms in an area. (2) Abnormal number
of deaths of organisms (e.g. fish kills). (3) Reduction of the reproductive success or the vigor of a species. (4) Reduction
in agricultural productivity, whether crops or livestock. (5) Alterations in the behavior or distribution of a species.
(6) Long lasting or irreversible contamination of components of the physical environment, especially in the case
of groundwater, and surface water and soil resources that have limited self-cleansing capability (Ref. 1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that the environmental effects criterion inherently contains a limited exposure component because
of the statutory requirement for EPA to find a ``significant adverse effect on the environment of sufficient seriousness,
in the judgment of the Administrator, to warrant reporting'' under EPCRA section 313. Unlike section 313(d)(2)(B),
where EPA only has to determine whether certain kinds of effects are ``known or reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated'' to occur, section 313(d)(2)(C) requires EPA to find the effect to be of sufficient seriousness to warrant
reporting, which implies the possibility that under certain circumstances, a chemical that could theoretically
cause a significant adverse effect on the environment is unlikely to cause one of a magnitude to warrant listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The extent to which exposure is factored into EPA's determination depends upon the inherent toxicity of a chemical,
and a variety of other chemical-specific characteristics. EPA believes that when a chemical is inherently extremely
toxic, that is, it is toxic at very low dose levels, an exposure assessment is not necessary because even minimal releases
of such a chemical may reasonably be anticipated to result in significant adverse environmental effects. In such
cases, EPA could rely on toxicity alone under section 313(d)(2)(C)(i) as a basis for listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, for chemicals that exhibit adverse effects upon the environment solely based on toxicity at moderately
low doses, EPA believes that consideration of potential exposure is warranted because minimal releases may not result
in significant adverse effects upon the environment. These exposure considerations may include, among other factors,
pollution controls, the volume and pattern of production, use, and release, environmental fate, as well as other
chemical-specific factors, and the use of estimated releases and modelling techniques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPCRA sections 313(d)(2)(C)(ii) and (iii) allow EPA to consider the impacts of other characteristics of a chemical.
Where a chemical exhibits significant adverse effects in the environment based on toxicity and persistence or toxicity
and bioaccumulation at very low to moderately low dose levels, EPA believes that exposure considerations are not
required in addition to those considerations implicit in evaluation of the chemical's potential for persistence
and bioaccumulation. This is because even minimal releases of the chemical may result in elevated concentrations
in the environment or in an organism that can reasonably be anticipated to result in significant adverse effects.
This reflects the increased likelihood that there will be exposure to a chemical that persists due to its longer residence
time in the environment. Repeated minimal releases of a persistent chemical may result in elevated concentrations
in the environment. For a chemical that bioaccumulates, even low levels of the chemical in the environment may result
in increased concentrations in an organism. Therefore, evaluation of a chemical's persistence or bioaccumulation
potential may be considered the functional equivalent of an exposure analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, for chemicals which induce well-established adverse effects, e.g. chlorofluorocarbons, which cause
stratospheric ozone depletion, EPA believes that an exposure assessment is unnecessary. EPA believes that these
chemicals typically do not affect solely one or two species but rather affect changes across a whole ecosystem. EPA
believes that these effects are of sufficient seriousness that additional exposure considerations are not warranted
because of the scope of their impact and the well-documented evidence supporting the adverse effects. EPA requests
comment on its approach for considering exposure as a part of its evaluation for listing of these chemicals under section
313(d)(2)(C).

A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Data on the chemicals and chemical categories were reviewed for evidence indicating adverse acute and chronic toxicity,
carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, developmental and reproductive effects, neurotoxicity, and environmental effects.
Information on the environmental fate was also reviewed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each chemical proposed for addition to EPCRA section 313 in this rulemaking, EPA conducted an extensive hazard
assessment, and, where appropriate, an analysis of exposure, to determine whether the chemical met one or more of
the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) listing criteria. This hazard assessment is discussed in detail in Unit II.B.3 of this
preamble. Only after this careful review was a final determination made as to whether one of the EPCRA section 313(d)(2)
listing criteria was met for each individual chemical or chemical category proposed for listing below. EPA need only
show that one of the listing criteria is met in order to list a chemical or chemical category under EPCRA section 313.
The information summarized below for each chemical or chemical category represents the key data elements that lead
EPA to believe that there is sufficient evidence to establish that one of the section 313(d)(2) listing criteria is
met. A more extensive review of the existing data base for each chemical or chemical category proposed for listing,
which reflects the entire weight-of-the-evidence considered by EPA, is contained in following support documents:

1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abamectin (avermectin B1)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 071751-41-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). This compound induces developmental toxicity in several species with
the mouse being the most sensitive species. Increased retinal folds in weanlings, decreased viability and lactation
indices, and decreased body weight were noted in a two-generation rat reproduction study. The lowest-observed-effect
level (LOEL) was 0.4 milligram per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day) and the no-observed-effect level (NOEL) was 0.12
mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL, EPA derived a reference dose (RfD) of 0.0004 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing abamectin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available
developmental toxicity data.

 of 0.34 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing abamectin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to
EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Acephate (acetylphosphoramidothioic acid O,S-dimethyl ester)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 030560-19-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 28&hyph;month feeding study in rats, inhibition of brain, plasma,
and red blood cell cholinesterase activities was observed at 50 parts per million (ppm) (2.5 mg/kg/day). The NOEL
for this study was 5 ppm (0.25 mg/kg/day). Similar findings were noted in a 2&hyph;year feeding study in dogs. The LOEL
for this study was 100 ppm (2.5 mg/kg/day) and the NOEL was 30 ppm (0.75 mg/kg/day). EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing acephate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available
neurotoxicity data for this chemical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Acifluorfen sodium salt (5-(2-chloro-4-(triflouromethyl)phenoxy)-2-nitro-benzoic acid, sodium salt)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 062476-59-9) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Acifluorfen is classified as a Group B2 compound, i.e., the chemical is
a probable human carcinogen. Acifluorfen produced an increased incidence of combined malignant and benign liver
tumors in two different strains of mice. The compound also displayed positive mutagenic activity in several non-mammalian
test systems, and is structurally similar to four other diphenyl ether herbicide compounds which caused increased
incidences of liver tumors in two different strains of mice. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing
acifluorfen sodium salt on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity
data.

4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alachlor
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 015972-60-8) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Alachlor is an aniline-type herbicide. Dose-related hemolytic anemia
with reductions in red blood cell counts, hematocrit and hemoglobin, as well as hemosiderosis in the liver, spleen
and kidney occurred in male dogs orally exposed to alachlor for 1&hyph;year. The LOEL based on these effects was 3.0
mg/kg/day, and the NOEL was 1.0 mg/kg/day. Effects in female dogs in the same study were not demonstrated as clearly
as in males but were considered suggestive of anemia. EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.01 mg/kg/day from this study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

days. Rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs were exposed to boron trifluoride via inhalation. Guinea pigs died of respiratory
failure after being exposed to 0.036 mg/L for 19 days; rats experienced fluorosis of the teeth at this concentration.
All three species were minimally affected at 0.004 mg/L. In a 2-week rat inhalation study, all animals died after 6
daily exposures to 0.18 mg/L. Rats exposed to 0.024 mg/L showed signs of respiratory irritation, increased lung weights,
and depressed liver weights. Rats exposed to 0.17 mg/L of boron trifluoride 6 hours/day, 5 days a week for 13 weeks developed
necrosis of the proximal tubular epithelium of the kidneys. Guinea pigs exposed to 0.035 mg/L, 7 hours/day, 5 days

in humans exposed to carbon monoxide. In humans, histological effects in the brain include extensive demyelination
of white matter, and necrosis. Neuropsychiatric disorders have also been reported. Persistant electrocardiograph
changes, and degeneration of myocardial muscle fibers, hemorrhage and necrosis were observed following inhalation
exposure of dogs to 100 ppm (0.11 mg/L) carbon monoxide, 5.5 hours/day, 6 days/week, for 11 weeks. Some of the dogs showed
disturbances in gait and in postural and position reflexes. The toxicity of carbon monoxide results from its combination
with hemoglobin in the blood to form carboxyhemoglobin which is a poor oxygen carrier. Thus, oxygen delivery by the
blood is severely compromised, which leads to tissue hypoxia and possibly tissue poisoning, resulting in the toxic
effects (including death) known for this substance. Infants born to women who survive acute exposure to high concentrations
of carbon monoxide during pregnancy often display neurological sequelae and gross brain damage. Exposure of pregnant
rats to 150 ppm (0.17 mg/L) carbon monoxide caused reduced pup growth rate, and altered behavior (poor performance

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 000075-72-9) (CAA OD) (Ref. 8). Chlorofluorocarbons, including chlorotrifluoromethane (CFC-13) are
known to release chlorine radicals into the stratosphere. Chlorine radicals act as catalysts to reduce the net amount
of stratospheric ozone. Stratospheric ozone shields the earth from ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation (i.e., 290 to
320 nanometers). Decreases in total column ozone will increase the percentage of UV-B radiation, especially at its
most harmful wavelengths, reaching the earth's surface.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exposure to UV-B radiation has been implicated by laboratory and epidemiologic studies as a cause of two types of nonmelanoma
skin cancers: squamous cell cancer and basal cell cancer. Studies predict that for every 1 percent increase in UV-B
radiation, nonmelanoma skin cancer cases would increase by about 1 to 3 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent epidemiological studies, including large case control studies, suggest that UV-B radiation plays an important
role in causing malignant melanoma skin cancer. Recent studies predict that for each 1 percent change in UV-B intensity,
the incidence of melanoma could increase from 0.5 to 1 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies have demonstrated that UV-B radiation can suppress the immune response system in animals, and, possibly,
in humans. Increases in exposure to UV-B radiation are likely to increase the incidence of cataracts and could adversely
affect the retina.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aquatic organisms, particularly phytoplankton, zooplankton, and the larvae of many fishes, appear to be susceptible
to harm from increased exposure to UV-B radiation because they spend at least part of their time at or near the surface
of waters they inhabit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increased UV-B penetration has been shown to result in adverse impacts on plants. Field studies on soybeans suggest
that yield reductions could occur in some cultivars of soybeans, while evidence from laboratory studies suggest
that two out of three cultivars are sensitive to UV-B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this increased UV-B radiation can be reasonably anticipated to lead to cancer and other chronic human health
effects and significant adverse environmental effects, there is sufficient evidence for listing chlorotrifluoromethane
(CFC-13) on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA sections 313(d)(2)(B) and (C).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 000068-12-2) (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). In humans, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) produced an increase in subjective
symptoms suggestive of mild liver dysfunction in workers and changes in objective measurements of liver damage (serum
enzymes and liver enlargement) via inhalation exposure, resulting in a LOAEL of 22 mg/m3 (adjusted LOAEL of 7.9 mg/m3)).
Although there are several additional studies which are generally inadequate when considered individually, taken
together, these studies demonstrate that DMF exposure is associated with hepatic toxicity in humans. Several animal
inhalation studies further support the hepatotoxic effects of DMF. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing N,N-dimethylformamide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based upon the available
hepatotoxicity data for this chemical.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 039300-45-3) (CAL; FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Dinocap is a dinitrophenyl-type fungicide. In mice, oral administration
of 25 mg/kg/day of dinocap on days 7 to 16 of gestation has been shown to increase post-implantation mortality and reduce
newborn viability. Oral administration of 5.0 mg/kg/day to pregnant mice produced developmental toxicity in the
offspring (administration of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in abnormalities of the musculoskeletal and hepatobiliary
system in the offspring). In the same study, oral administration of 20 mg/kg/day on days 7 to 16 of gestation produced
craniofacial abnormalities in offspring. In the same study, behavioral abnormalities and delayed growth were observed

 (CAS No. 069806-50-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). A 3&hyph;month rat feeding study demonstrated hepatocyte hypertrophy
in males (the LOEL was 5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day). In a 1&hyph;year feeding study, dogs had changes in
serum alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase and/or alanine sulfatransferase (the LOEL was 25 mg/kg/day;
the NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day). Similar changes were also reported in dogs following 3 months exposure in their diet (the
LOEL was 125 mg/kg/day). In a carcinogenicity study, male mice fed 20 ppm (2.6 mg/kg/day, the LOEL) had an increased
incidence of hepatocyte hypertrophy. The NOEL was 5 ppm or 0.65 mg/kg/day. Male and female mice exposed to a higher
dose of 80 ppm (10.4 mg/kg/day) had increased liver weight (relative and absolute) and hypertrophy of periacinal
hepatocytes. Males in this dose group also had increased pigmentation in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a teratogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats exposed via oral gavage, delayed ossification and an increased
incidence of hydroureter were observed in fetuses (the fetotoxic LOEL was 5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL 1 mg/kg/day) and a
teratogenic LOEL of 200 mg/kg/day (the NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day) was determined based on the incidence of diaphragmatic
hernia. Maternal toxicity was observed in this study at doses higher than those causing fetotoxicity and included
reduced body weight gain and decreased gravid uterus (the maternal LOEL was 200 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day).
In a 2-generation reproductive toxicity dietary study in Wistar rats, the reproductive LOEL of 250 ppm (12.5 mg/kg/day;
the NOEL was 80 ppm or 4 mg/kg/day) was based on reduced litter sizes, reduced viability, reduced testis and epididymis

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 000051-21-8) (CAL; EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). A major use of fluorouracil is in the palliative treatment of carcinoma
of the colon, rectum, breast, stomach, and pancreas that is not amenable to surgery or irradiation. The major toxic
effects of fluorouracil are on the normal, rapidly proliferating tissues particularly of the bone marrow and lining
of the gastrointestinal tract. Leukopenia, predominantly of the granulocytopenic type, thrombocytopenia, and
anemia occur commonly with intravenous fluorouracil therapy at doses ranging from 6 to 12 mg/kg. Pancytopenia and
agranulocytosis also have occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Developmental abnormalities or other effects on newborns were reported in offspring of women receiving 150 or 240
mg/kg fluorouracil intravenously during weeks 11 to 14 or 20 to 31 of pregnancy. In addition, maternal toxicity to
the reproductive organs, toxicity to the fetus, and developmental abnormalities have been reported in mice, rats,

 (CAS No. 069409-94-5) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Delayed ossification and decreased weight and length of fetuses were observed
in offspring of rats orally administered 50 mg/kg/day (LOEL) on days 6 to 15 of gestation. The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day.
These effects were observed at doses that produced maternal toxicity. Curved tibia and fibula were observed in the
offspring of rabbits orally administered 125 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day. In a 2&hyph;generation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a range finding study, dietary administration of 50 mg/kg/day for 30 days produced skin lesions in rats. The NOEL

at 15 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 2 mg/kg/day. Dietary administration of 10 mg/kg/day (LOEL for effect) to mice for 2 years
produced scabbing and dermal abrasion. No NOEL for these effects was established. An increase in plantar ulcers was
observed in rats fed 2.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL) for 2 years. The NOEL was 1 mg/kg/day. Decreases in body weight gain were also
observed in this study. Based on the NOEL of the study, an oral RfD of 0.01 mg/kg/day was derived. In a 2&hyph;generation

EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals
in the category manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members
of a chemical category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing
threshold for that category. When filing reports for chemical categories, the releases are determined in the same
manner as the thresholds. One report is filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form.

These diisocyanates represent a category of chemicals that may effect many organ systems. However, the primary toxicity
target for diisocyanates is the upper and lower respiratory tract resulting in chronic pulmonary irritation. Diisocyanates
are also known respiratory and dermal sensitizing agents. Both acute and chronic effects may result from acute or
chronic exposures. These effects may be immune- or non-immune mediated. EPA believes that diisocyanates should
be listed as a category because it is the isocyanate functionality that is responsible for the observed chronic pulmonary
irritation associated with exposures to members of this category. The other part of the molecule does not mitigate
to any large degree the observed toxic effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing diisocyanates
as a category on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available toxicity data for
members of the category.

Hydrochlorofluorocarbons
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAA OD) (Ref. 8). Hydrochlorofluorocarbons are known to release chlorine radicals into the stratosphere. Chlorine
radicals act as catalysts to reduce the net amount of stratospheric ozone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stratospheric ozone shields the earth from ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation (i.e., 290 to 320 nanometers). Decreases
in total column ozone will increase the percentage of UV-B radiation, especially at its most harmful wavelengths,
reaching the earth's surface.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exposure to UV-B radiation has been implicated by laboratory and epidemiologic studies as a cause of two types of nonmelanoma
skin cancers: squamous cell cancer and basal cell cancer. Studies predict that for every 1 percent increase in UV-B
radiation, nonmelanoma skin cancer cases would increase by about 1 to 3 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent epidemiological studies, including large case control studies, suggest that UV-B radiation plays an important
role in causing malignant melanoma skin cancer. Recent studies predict that for each 1 percent change in UV-B intensity,
the incidence of melanoma could increase from 0.5 to 1 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies have demonstrated that UV-B radiation can suppress the immune response system in animals, and, possibly,
in humans. Increases in exposure to UV-B radiation are likely to increase the incidence of cataracts and could adversely
affect the retina.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aquatic organisms, particularly phytoplankton, zooplankton, and the larvae of many fishes, appear to be susceptible
to harm from increased exposure to UV-B radiation because they spend at least part of their time at or near the surface
of waters they inhabit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increased UV-B penetration has been shown to result in adverse impacts on plants. Field studies on soybeans suggest
that yield reductions could occur in some cultivars of soybeans, while evidence from laboratory studies suggest
that two out of three cultivars are sensitive to UV-B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this increased UV-B radiation can be reasonably anticipated to lead to cancer and other chronic human health
effects and significant adverse environmental effects, EPA believes there is sufficient evidence for listing the
following HCFCs that are commercially viable on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA sections 313(d)(2)(B) and (C).

Linuron
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 000330-55-2) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). The appearance of sulfhemoglobin in the blood of dogs, rats, or mice exposed
to linuron has been reported. In fact, available animal data from feeding studies of various durations (30 days to
2 years) with linuron as well as from studies with structurally similar urea-based herbicides indicate that the presence
of sulfhemoglobin (abnormal blood pigment) and morphological changes in red blood cells provide the most sensitive
indicator of exposure to linuron. In a 2&hyph;year feeding study with beagle dogs, the LOAEL, based on the presence
of the sulfhemoglobin, was 0.625 mg/kg/day. This was the lowest dose tested. Red blood cell counts were decreased
in dogs exposed to higher doses of linuron. EPA has derived an oral RfD of 0.002 mg/kg/day for linuron from this study.
Similar findings were reported in two separate 2&hyph;year rat feeding studies. In one of these studies, the LOAEL
was 31.25 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 6.25 mg/kg/day. These values were based on spleen and bone marrow changes indicative
of hemolysis, and an increase in mortality and growth retardation. In the other 2&hyph;year rat study, a LOAEL of 2.5
mg/kg/day (the lowest dose tested) was based on decreased red blood cell counts and reticulocytosis. Elevated sulfhemoglobin
levels were reported in rats exposed for as little as 30 days to 150 mg/kg/day. This exposure level also caused severe
growth retardation and increased mortality. The LOAEL for decreased body weight gain was 15 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL
was 3 mg/kg/day. Chronic administration of linuron at 4 mg/kg/day to rats caused hypochromic anemia, decreased cholinesterase
and peroxidase activities in the blood.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A LOAEL of 31.25 mg/kg/day was established in a 3&hyph;generation reproductive toxicity study in which linuron (in
the diet) caused reduced weanling weights, reduced liver and kidney weights, liver atrophy, and reduced pup survival.
In a separate developmental toxicity study in rats administered linuron orally, a LOAEL of 31.25 mg/kg/day was based
on an increased incidence of fetal resorptions. The LOAEL for maternal toxicity in this study was 6.25 mg/kg/day (NOAEL
2.50 mg/kg/day), and was based on decreased food consumption and decreased body weight gain. An oral teratology study
in rabbits indicated a LOAEL of 5 mg/kg/day (lowest dose tested) based on decreased fetal body weight, decreased litter
size and an increase in skull malformations.

illness. Decreases in the number of implantations, number of live fetuses and fetal body weight, and increases in
resorptions and various limb/skeletal anomalies were reported in the offspring of Wistar rats that received 100
mg/kg (the fetotoxic LOEL; the fetotoxic NOEL was 50 mg/kg) during gestation days 6 through 15. Offspring of mice that
received 465 mg/kg/day during gestation days 6 through 15 had increased craniofacial abnormalities. Fetal death

Malathion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 000121-75-5) (CERCLA) (Ref. 8). Malathion is a phosphorothioate insecticide. Its insecticidal properties
are due to cholinesterase inhibition. A 42&hyph;year old woman ingested a minimum of 120 ml of a 50 percent solution
(approximately 850 mg/kg). She quickly became comatose, cyanotic, flaccid, devoid of tendon reflexes, and miotic.
Her serum cholinesterase activity was 22 percent of normal for 9 days and her red blood cell cholinesterase activity
was 10 to 25 percent of normal for 45 days. Thirty-five cases of poisoning by ingestion were reported in India. The symptoms
observed were cyanosis, excess salivation, pinpoint pupils, pulmonary edema, and electrocardiographic abnormalities;
all of which are indicative of cholinesterase inhibition. Autopsy of the fatalities indicated damage to the myocardium.
In a 56&hyph;day study in which men were orally administered malathion, the NOEL for neurotoxic effects was 0.23 mg/kg/day
and the LOEL was 0.34 mg/kg/day. Plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase inhibition was observed at 0.34 mg/kg/day;
however, no clinical signs of overt toxicity were noted at this dose. Based on the NOEL, EPA has derived an oral RfD of
0.02 mg/kg/day for this chemical. Cholinesterase inhibition symptoms have also been observed in experimental animals
exposed to malathion. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing malathion on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurotoxicity data for this chemical.

Man-made mineral fibers category
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). Man-made mineral fibers are synthetic, amorphous (noncrystalline) fibers which consist of three
major groups: Glass fibers; mineral wool fibers (which includes mainly rock wool and slag wool); and refractory ceramic
fibers. Health concerns for these fibers are based on the morphological and toxicologic similarities with asbestos,
a known human carcinogen, causing lung cancer and mesotheliomas in humans and non-malignant respiratory diseases
(e.g. lung fibrosis). Injection studies, in which glass wool and glass microfibers were directly placed into the
respiratory airways, the pleural or abdominal cavities of laboratory animals, have shown consistent evidence of
carcinogenesis. Experimental studies have shown evidence of carcinogenesis by injection of rock wool and slag wool.
IARC has classified glass wool, rock wool, and slag wool fibers as Group 2B compounds, i.e., possible human carcinogens.
EPA has classified refractory ceramic fibers as Group B2 compounds, i.e., probable human carcinogen. EPA believes
that there is sufficient evidence for listing man-made mineral fibers as a category on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for these fibers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals
in the category manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members
of a chemical category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing
threshold for that category. When filing reports for chemical categories, the releases are determined in the same
manner as the thresholds. One report is filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered a number of options for listing man-made mineral fibers on EPCRA section 313. In 1977, the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended that exposures to fibers be limited to 3 fibers
per cubic centimeters (f/cc) for fibers that are less than 3.5 micrometers in diameter and longer than 10 micrometers
in length. NIOSH has since commented that in order to protect workers from lung cancer it will be necessary to lower
the exposure to 0.2 f/cc for fibrous glass. In 1992, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposed
a 1 f/cc 8&hyph;hour time-weighted average (TWA) limit for respirable fibers of fibrous glass, including refractory
ceramic fibers. Respirable fibers are generally defined as fibers with a diameter of less than 3.5 micrometers whose
length is at least 3 times the diameter (i.e., an aspect ratio (fiber length divided by fiber diameter) of 3 or greater).
In order to ease the burden of reporting, EPA considered listing fibers based on an aspect ratio that simply discriminates
between particles and fibers. This, however, seemed to be overly inclusive in that it would cover nonrespirable as
well as respirable fibers. EPA also considered using a diameter criteria without an aspect ratio but this option also
appears to be too inclusive since it may include particles as well as fibers. EPA is proposing to list man-made mineral
fibers as a category that includes glass microfibers, glass wool fibers, rock wool fibers, slag wool fibers, and refractory
ceramic fibers that have a diameter less than 3.5 micrometers and an aspect ratio greater than 3. This definition is
consistent with both the NIOSH and OSHA recommendations and is limited to fibers that are respirable. EPA requests
comment on this definition of man-made mineral fibers and any other options for defining a fibers category.

IARC has assigned mecoprop to Group 2B, i.e., it is possibly carcinogenic to humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In several animal studies, changes in liver or kidney weights were the most sensitive indicators of mecoprop toxicity.
In a 90&hyph;day rat feeding study, the LOAEL was 9 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 3 mg/kg/day. At 26 mg/kg/day, the changes
in organ weights were accompanied by decreased glucose levels in males and increased creatinine levels in females.
EPA has derived an oral RfD of 0.001 mg/kg/day from this study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

range from 240 to 470 ppb. The 60-day MATC for rainbow trout range from 41 to 78 ppb. EPA's exposure analysis indicates
that releases of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole will result in concentration levels that can reasonably be anticipated
to cause significant adverse environmental effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing

Merphos
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 000150-50-5) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Merphos is a thiophosphate-type cholinesterase inhibitor. Delayed neurotoxic
effects have been reported in a 28-year old man following accidental exposure to the chemical over a period of 3 days.
Fourteen days later, he developed complete facial diplegia and decreased conduction velocity in his nerve fibers.
He recovered completely. Both immediate and delayed neurotoxic effects following exposure to merphos have been
reported in experimental animals. In a 3&hyph;month hen feeding study the NOEL for neurotoxic effects was 0.1 mg/kg/day
and the LOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day. At 0.5 mg/kg, hens showed delayed neurotoxicity, ataxia, and equivocal changes in
the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Based on the NOEL, EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.00003 mg/kg/day for this chemical.
In a 112-day rat feeding study, females showed red blood cell cholinesterase inhibition at the LOEL of 0.25 mg/kg/day.
The NOEL was 0.1 mg/kg/day. In a 90&hyph;day rat feeding study, animals showed reduced brain cholinesterase activity
at the LOEL of 3.8 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 1.8 mg/kg/day. In a 90&hyph;day dog feeding study, plasma cholinesterase
inhibition was observed at the LOEL of 2.5 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 0.75 mg/kg/day. Fourteen cattle and 20 sheep administered
single doses of merphos (25 to 200 mg/kg) or 10 daily doses of merphos (2.5 mg/kg/day) showed emaciation, diarrhea,
and depression of blood cholinesterase. Ingested merphos is rapidly metabolized to n-butyl mercaptan within the
gastrointestinal tract. n-Butyl mercaptan has been shown to be responsible for the acute neurotoxic effects of merphos.
Thus, oral exposure to merphos is expected to cause acute neurotoxic symptoms while dermal exposure to merphos is
expected to cause delayed neurotoxic symptoms. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing merphos
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurotoxicity data for this chemical.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 000137-42-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Postimplanatation loss was observed in rabbits administered metham sodium
at 30 mg/kg/day (LOEL) on days 6 to 18 of gestation. The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day (4.2 mg/kg/day based on active ingredient).
In rats fed metham sodium, increased variations, retardations, and anomalies were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day
(LOEL) administered on days 6 to 15. The NOEL was less than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day (less than or equal to 4.2 mg/kg/day

deficiencies, the weight of evidence indicates that metham sodium induces developmental toxicity. In addition,
metham sodium is metabolized to carbon disulfide, a potent developmental toxicant. EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing metham sodium on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAL; CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; FIFRA AI; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Nicotine salts will dissociate in aqueous solutions
to yield soluble nicotine. Nicotine is highly toxic in humans. The estimated lethal oral dose in adults is approximately
40 to 60 mg. The onset of toxicity is rapid. Symptoms include nausea, salivation, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea,
headache, weakness, sweating, and confusion. Nicotine markedly stimulates the central nervous system, causing
tremors and convulsions. The stimulation is followed by depression, and death resulting from paralysis of respiratory
muscles. Nicotine can also activate parasympathetic ganglia and cholinergic nerve endings resulting in gastrointestinal
hyperactivity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Skeletal defects and occasional cleft palates were observed in mice injected with 25 mg/kg nicotine on gestation
days 9 to 11. Reduced size in the newborn of rats and limb deformities in the offspring of swine were reported in swine

EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing nicotine and its salts as a category on EPCRA section 313
pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity data for these substances. EPCRA section

3.2 mg/kg/day and a NOAEL and RfD of 1.6 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 10 mg/L nitrate-nitrogen or 44 mg/L nitrate ion
in drinking water. Infants weighing an average of 4 kg (0 to 3 months of age) are the most sensitive population to nitrate-induced
methemoglobinemia. This is primarily due to their higher stomach pH which favors the growth of nitrate-reducing
bacteria, the immaturity of their metabolic enzyme systems, and reduced capacity of their erythrocytes to reduce
methemoglobin to hemoglobin. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing nitrate ion on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hematological toxicity data for this chemical.

In nitrogen-limited waters, nitrates have the potential to cause increased algal growth leading to eutrophication
in the aquatic environment. (Nitrate-nitrogen is the form of nitrogen most available to plants.) Studies of estuarine
water at several locations along the eastern coast of the United States have indicated that low concentrations of
dissolved nitrogen (e.g., nitrate) limit primary production of plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additions of nitrate to such estuarine systems stimulate primary production of plants and can produce changes in
the dominant species of plants, leading to cultural eutrophication and ultimately to deterioration of water quality,
including algal blooms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that lakes with a spring maximum concentration of more than 300 ug/L of inorganic nitrogen (e.g.,
nitrates) could be expected to have algal nuisances in the summer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toxic effects result from oxygen depletion as the algae die and decay. Toxic effects have also been related to the release
of decay products or direct excretion of toxic substances from sources such as blue-green algae. EPA believes that
there is sufficient evidence for listing nitrate ion on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C)
based on the available environmental toxicity data.

high. Nitric oxide causes death or permanent injury after very short exposure to small quantities. Exposure to nitric
oxide can result in acute and chronic changes of the pulmonary system including pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, bronchitis,
bronchiolitis, emphysema, and methemoglobinemia. Neurologic effects (fatigue, restlessness, anxiety, mental
confusion, lethargy, loss of consciousness) have also been reported. The effects of nitric oxide may be related to
the formation of methemoglobin. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing nitric oxide on EPCRA

 (CAS No. 010102-44-0) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Acid precipitation occurs in large regions
of the Eastern United States and Canada, Europe, and Japan. This widespread occurrence of acid precipitation and
dry deposition results in large part from man-made emissions of oxides of sulfur and nitrogen (e.g., nitrogen dioxide).
These substances are transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric acid and nitric acid, transported over great distances
and deposited on vegetation, soils, surface waters, and materials. These substances are transferred from the atmosphere
into ecosystems by the absorption of gases, the impaction and gravitational settling of fine aerosols and coarse
particles, and precipitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acids contained in polluted snow are released as contaminated meltwater. The resulting release of pollutants can
cause major or rapid changes in the acidity of streams and lake waters. Interference with normal reproduction in fish
populations is induced by acidity of lake and stream waters. Reproduction of frogs and salamanders is also inhibited
by atmospheric acidification of surface waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Atmospheric deposition of sulfuric acid and nitric acid can cause serious damage to crops and forests. Biological
effects include induction of necrotic lesions, loss of nutrients due to leaching from foliar organs, accelerated
erosion of waxes and leaf surfaces, and interference with normal reproductive processes. Acidification also decreases
the rate of many soil processes such as nitrogen fixation and the breakdown of organic matter.

in the prophylactic management of tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures and partial seizures with complex symptomatology.
In doses used to treat seizure disorders (i.e., 300 mg/day in adults, 5 mg/kg/day in children) phenytoin can cause
adverse effects such as constipation, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and weight loss. Ingestion of 4.5 g
(64 mg/kg/day) by adults and 0.6 g (60 mg/kg/day) by children has produced transient coma with motor restlessness.
Ingestion of 11 mg/kg/day produced changes in motor activity in a child (duration of study not reported). Oral administration
of 7.8 mg/kg/day for 4 days produced encephalitis, hallucinations, and irritability in a man. Ingestion of 7.6 mg/kg/day

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phosphoric acid, as well as other phosphates, have the potential to cause increased algal growth leading to eutrophication
in the aquatic environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eutrophication may result when nutrients, especially phosphates, enter into an aquatic ecosystem in the presence
of sunlight and nitrogen. The phosphate ion is a plant nutrient, which can be a major limiting factor for plant growth
in freshwater environments. In excess, phosphates can cause algal blooms. Toxic effects result from oxygen depletion
as the algae die and decay. Toxic effects have also been related to the release of decay products or direct excretion
of toxic substances from sources such as blue-green algae.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory studies indicate that eutrophication may occur at phosphate concentrations as low as 50 ppb in lakes.
The resulting oxygen depletion and toxic decay products (e.g., hydrogen sulfide) kill many invertebrates and fish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although green algae are more sensitive to growth stimulation by phosphates in fresh water, blue-green algal blooms
may cause greater damage. At least three species of blue-green algae are known to excrete toxins. Secretion by cyanobacteria
of dyalyzable metabolites have inhibited the growth of other species of algae and may result in algal monoculture.
When algal blooms of these toxic species occur in a reservoir, lake, slough, or pond, the cells and toxins can become
sufficiently concentrated to cause illness or death in invertebrates and vertebrates. Major losses have been reported
for cattle, sheep, hogs, birds (domestic or wild) and fishes, minor losses for dogs, horses, small wild animals, amphibians,
and invertebrates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eutrophication may occur in slow moving rivers, but is less likely in swift rivers where rapid mixing occurs. Light
is the most important limiting factor because rivers are murkier than lakes thus, the chances of eutrophication in
swift rivers are slight. However, lakes and reservoirs collect phosphates from influent streams and store a fraction
of them within consolidated sediments, thus serving as a phosphate sink.

 (CAS No. NA) (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). Polycyclic aromatic compounds are a class of chemicals that include polycyclic aromatic

others. PACs can be formed in any combustion process that involves the burning of fuels or, more generally, materials
containing carbon and hydrogen. Some industrial sources include coke ovens, catalytic cracking of crude oil, carbon
black production, and iron and steel processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Materials containing mixtures of PACs have been shown to be carcinogenic. Several epidemiology studies have shown
increased mortality due to lung cancer in humans exposed to coke-oven emissions, roofing-tar emissions, and cigarette
smoke. Each of these mixtures contains benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(a)phenanthrene,
and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene as well as other potentially carcinogenic PACs and other carcinogenic and potentially
carcinogenic chemicals, tumor promotors, initiators, and co-carcinogens such as nitrosoamines, coal tar pitch,
and creosote. Although it is impossible to evaluate the contribution of any individual PAC to the total carcinogenicity
of these mixtures to humans, reports of this nature provide qualitative evidence of the potential for mixtures containing
PACs to cause cancer in humans. In addition, several PACs caused cancer in animals when orally (e.g., benz(a)anthracene,
benzo(a)pyrene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene), dermally (e.g., benz(a)anthracene, benzo(a)phenanthrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene,

In addition to the above compounds, EPA proposes that the PAC category also include the following seven PACs:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (CAS No. 000193-39-5)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These PACs were proposed for listing individually in EPA's response to a petition to add certain chemicals that appear
on the RCRA list of toxic wastes under 40 CFR 261.33(f) to EPCRA section 313 (57 FR 41020, September 8, 1992). These chemicals
were proposed for addition based on the available carcinogenicity data. Due to the similarities of these seven PACs
to the chemicals listed in Unit IV.B.207.a. through IV.B.207.u. of this preamble, EPA believes that these chemicals
should be added to EPCRA section 313 as part of the delineated PAC category rather than listed individually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals
in the category manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members
of a chemical category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing
threshold for that category. When filing reports for chemical categories the releases are determined in the same
manner as the thresholds. One report is filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form. In the case
of the delimited PAC category, only the 28 chemicals listed above would be included for purposes of making the threshold
determinations and in filing reports on releases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Clean Air Act Amendments section 112(b) Hazardous Air Pollutants list includes a listing for polycyclic organic
matter (POM) that includes PACs. The definition given for the POM category is broad and chemically non-specific and
may be delineated by test method. For the purpose of listing under EPCRA section 313, EPA considered the following
more chemically-specific definition for a PAC category: ``includes all chemical species from the polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon, aza-polycyclic, thio-polycyclic, or nitroarene families where polycyclic means three or more fused
rings. More specifically, it means any combination of three or more fused six or five membered hydrocarbon rings with
at least two or more rings being aromatic. The structure may contain fused non-aromatic five-membered rings, a ring
nitrogen, a ring sulfur, one or more attached nitro groups, or one or more attached alkyl groups.'' As an alternative
to the delimited category, EPA is proposing to add a PAC category based on this broad definition. Although this definition
may include chemicals of low or no concern, it may be less of a burden for facilities to report their total PACs rather
than trying to determine which and how much of the specific PACs covered by the delimited category they are producing
and releasing. EPA requests comment on the addition of the delimited PACs category versus the alternative PAC category
based on the broader definition. 208.

Methemoglobin cannot combine reversibly with oxygen and its formation can cause anemic hypoxia which may lead to
intense cyanosis. Infants are particularly susceptible to this effect because of their higher stomach pH, immature

 (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; FIFRA SR; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Strychnine salts will dissociate in aqueous solutions to
yield soluble strychnine. Strychnine, an alkaloid, can cause violent convulsions in humans. Other effects include
agitation, hypertonicity of muscles, and painful muscle spasms. Renal failure and respiratory paralysis generally
ensues, from severe or prolonged convulsions. A potentially lethal oral dose in a small child is 5 to 10 mg. The lethal
oral dose for an adult may be as low as 30 mg. Similar effects have also been reported in animals exposed at lethal doses
ranging from 0.25 to 2.35 mg/kg via oral and parenteral routes of exposure. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that
strychnine and strychnine salts concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result
of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant
adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing strychnine and salts
as a category on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and

EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals
in the category manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members
of a chemical category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing
threshold for that category. When filing reports for chemical categories, the releases are determined in the same
manner as the thresholds. One report if filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form.

 (CAS No. 007446-09-5) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Acid precipitation occurs in large regions of the Eastern United
States and Canada, Europe, and Japan. This widespread occurrence of acid precipitation and dry deposition results
in large part from man-made emissions of oxides of sulfur (e.g., sulfur dioxide) and oxides of nitrogen. These substances
are transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric acid and nitric acid, transported over great distances and deposited
on vegetation, soils, surface waters, and materials. These substances are transferred from the atmosphere into
ecosystems by the absorption of gases, the impaction and gravitational settling of fine aerosols and coarse particles
and, precipitation.

manifested as an exaggerated sunburn reaction on sun-exposed areas of the body has occurred following oral therapy
with tetracycline hydrochloride. Photosensitivity reactions of this type generally develop within a few minutes
to several hours after sun exposure and usually persist 1 to 2 days after discontinuance of tetracycline hydrochloride.

Manufacturers of tetracycline hydrochloride state that this substance should not be used in women during the last
half of pregnancy or in children younger than 8 years of age unless other appropriate drugs are ineffective or contraindicated.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that tetracycline hydrochloride be used only in children who are 9
years of age or older, except under unusual circumstances. Use of tetracycline hydrochloride in pregnant women or
infants has resulted in retardation of skeletal development and bone growth in the fetus or child. Because tetracycline
hydrochloride localizes in the dentin and enamel of developing teeth, use of this substance during tooth development
may cause enamel hypoplasia and permanent yellow-gray to brown discoloration of the teeth. Use of tetracycline hydrochloride
may result in discoloration of the deciduous teeth of children if the substance is used during pregnancy or in children
up to 4 to 6 months of age. These effects are most common following long-term use of tetracycline hydrochloride but
have occured following repeated short-term use. Premature infants treated with tetracycline have demonstrated
a 40 percent depression of bone growth. This effect is readily reversible if exposure to the substance is short.

Intraperitoneal injection of 85 mg/kg/day on days 14 to 18 of gestation has resulted in abortion and extra embryonic
structures in rat offspring. Subcutaneous injection of 48 mg/kg/day on days 16 through 20 of gestation and intramuscular
injection of 40 mg/kg/day to rats on days 10 through 15 of gestation resulted in embryo/fetotoxicity. Exposure to
50 mg/kg/day on days 7 to 15 of pregnancy resulted in postimplantation loss and fetotoxicity in rats. Exposure to 85
mg/kg/day on days 7 to 15 of pregnancy resulted in abortion in rats. Fetotoxicity was observed in mice receiving 86
mg/kg/day of tetracycline hydrochloride on days 8 to 13 of gestation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (CAS No. 000078-48-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 8). S,S,S-Tributyltrithiophosphate (DEF) is a cholinesterase inhibitor.
Both immediate and delayed neurotoxic effects have been reported in humans following exposure to DEF. The exposure
levels at which these effects occurred, however, were not reported. In a 3&hyph;month hen feeding study, the NOEL
for neurotoxic effects was 0.1 mg/kg/day and the LOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day. At 0.5 mg/kg day, hens showed delayed neurotoxicity,
ataxia, and equivocal changes in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Based on the NOEL, EPA has derived an oral RfD
of 0.00003 mg/kg/day for this chemical. In a 12&hyph;week dog feeding study, animals showed over sensitivity to stimuli
at 0.62 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.12 mg/kg/day. In the same study, the LOEL for cholinesterase inhibition was 0.12

the primary target organs for 1,2,3-trichloropropane are the liver and kidney. Renal and hepatic necrosis were observed
in rats administered 1,2,3-trichloropropane by gavage for 17 weeks. The LOAEL was 16 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 8
mg/kg/day for hepatic effects. The LOAEL was 32 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 16 mg/kg/day for renal effects. Hepatic
necrosis in mice occurred at 125 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was 63 mg/kg/day. Less severe renal necrotic changes were seen
at 250 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was 125 mg/kg/day. The renal and hepatic lesions were accompanied by increases in organ

gestation, and also in a 2-generation reproduction study in rats (the LOEL was 86 mg/kg/day, the NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day).
Other developmental effects observed in the latter study included developmental delays, reduced male and female
pup weight, increased stillbirths and increased pup mortality throughout lactation.

EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing vinclozolin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available endocrine, adrenal, renal, hepatic, and developmental toxicity data.

V. Rationale for Listing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to add the chemical substances identified in Unit IV.B. of this preamble because EPA believes that
these chemicals meet the statutory criteria for listing under section 313(d)(2) of EPCRA. The bases for these determinations
and the specific toxic effects are summarized in Unit IV.B. of this preamble and set forth in more detail in the rulemaking
record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to evaluate public comment on this proposed rule and issue a final rule by November 30, 1994. Reporting
for the chemicals identified in the final rule would be required for activities during the 1995 calendar year. Such
reports would have to be submitted to EPA and States by July 1, 1996.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Request for Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA requests comment on any aspect of this proposal. EPA requests specific comment as detailed in the following paragraphs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on the sufficiency of the evidence for each of the chemicals proposed for addition in Unit IV.B.
of this preamble. In addition, EPA requests comment on any issues that may be specific to any of the individual chemicals
or chemical categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on whether it would be appropriate to list persistent bioaccumulative toxic chemicals that
are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used below the current reporting thresholds on EPCRA section 313. If EPA
were to add this type of chemical to EPCRA section 313, what modifications to EPCRA section 313, such as lowering the
reporting thresholds and modifying the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in mixture exemptions, would be required to insure that release and transfer information would be collected? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Units IV.B.132., IV.B.144., and IV.B.158., of this preamble, EPA is proposing to add individually three diisocyanates:
hexamethylene-1,6-diisocyante; isophorone diisocyanate; and 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane).
EPA requests comment on its alternative proposal in Unit IV.B.132. of this preamble to create a diisocyanates category
rather than adding diisocyanates individually to EPCRA section 313. EPA also requests comment on what diisocyanates,
other than those listed in IV.B.132. of this preamble, should be included in such a category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on its proposed definition of man-made mineral fibers, given in Unit IV.B.149. of this preamble,
and any other options for defining a fibers category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Unit IV.B.166. and 172. of this preamble, EPA is proposing to add two ethylene bisdithiocarbamates (EBDCs): metiram;
and nabam. An additional two EBDCs, zineb and maneb, are currently listed on the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals.
The category of EBDCs has recently been added to EPCRA section 313 (December 1, 1993; 58 FR 63500). EPA requests comment
on the following: (1) Should the individual EBDCs, metiram and nabam, be added individually to EPCRA section 313 even
though they are members of the EBDC category, which is listed on EPCRA section 313; and (2) should the individual listings
for two EBDCs, zineb and maneb, be deleted and added as members of the newly created EBDC category? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on whether polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) should be added as a delineated category consisting
of the PACs listed in Unit IV.B.207. of this preamble or as a category with the definition given in Unit IV.B.207. of
this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on its approach in considering exposure as a part of its evaluation of certain chemicals under
sections 313(d)(2)(A) and (C).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Units IV.B.36, 179., and 235. of this preamble, EPA is proposing to add three chemicals (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
dioxide, and carbon monoxide) that are regulated by Title I of the CAA (Provisions for Attainment and Maintenance
of National Ambient Air Quality Standards). In addition, sulfur dioxide is regulated under Title IV of the CAA (Acid
Deposition Control). Extensive data, which are highly technical, are collected on these chemicals as required by
the CAA. EPA requests comment on the following: (1) Is the information collected under the CAA sufficient for public
right-to-know purposes; and (2) suggestions on how the data collected on these chemicals pursuant to CAA Titles I
and IV could be used to meet the purposes of EPCRA section 313.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments should be submitted to the address listed under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADDRESSES unit. All comments must be received on or before April 12, 1994.

VIII. Public Meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA will hold a 1&hyph;day public meeting to discuss the issues presented above. The tentative agenda for this public
meeting will include a discussion of the issues presented in Unit VII. of this preamable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scheduling of oral statements will be on a first come first served basis by calling the telephone number listed under
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. All statements will be made part of the public record and will be considered in the
development of the final rule.

X. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the
Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action likely to
result in a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this proposed rule is a ``significant regulatory
action.'' As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review, and any comments or changes made in response to OMB suggestions
or recommendations have been documented in the public record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each Federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The analysis
supporting this proposed rule estimated the maximum cost that a small business might incur, and calculated the cost
impact percentage (reporting costs divided by average value of shipments) for each employee size, class, and SIC
code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reporting costs are estimated at less than one percent of the average value of shipments per report in the first year,
and less than one-half of one percent of the value of shipments per report in subsequent years. The precise impacts
depend on how many reports an individual small business submits. However, experience with current reporters indicates
that small businesses generally submit fewer reports per facility than larger ones. Most of the reports are anticipated
to be submitted from industries with the lowest impacts. Because of this, no segment of the manufacturing sector is
likely to suffer significant adverse effects due to this rule, Therefore, EPA certifies that this proposed rule will
not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The collection of information and other requirements under section 313 of EPCRA and section 6607 of the PPA are covered
under OMB approval number 2070&hyph;0093, which was issued on May 14, 1992. While this approval normally would have
expired on November 30, 1992, it remains in effect pursuant to the 1993 Department of Veteran Affairs and Housing and
Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, Pub. L. 102&hyph;389, signed October 6, 1992, which
states that:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 or any requirements thereunder the Environmental Protection
Agency Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Form R and Instructions, revised 1991 version issued May 19, 1992, and related
requirements (OMB No. 2070&hyph;0093), shall be effective for reporting under section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention
Act of 1990 (Public Law 101508) and section 313 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (Public
Law 99-499) until such time as revisions are promulgated pursuant to law.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule adds chemicals to the list of toxic chemicals subject to reporting under section 313 of EPCRA and
section 6607 of the PPA and does not change the elements of the TRI reporting form, its instructions, or related requirements.
Accordingly, the Form R and Instructions and related requirements remain in effect, as provided by Pub. L. 102-389.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The industry reporting burden for collecting this information is estimated to average 53 hours per respondent annually,
including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data
needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The actual burden to a specific facility may
deviate from this estimate depending on the complexity of the facility's operations and the profile of the release.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief,
Information Policy Branch, 2131, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and
to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 726 Jackson Place NW., Washington,
DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on this
collection of information.
