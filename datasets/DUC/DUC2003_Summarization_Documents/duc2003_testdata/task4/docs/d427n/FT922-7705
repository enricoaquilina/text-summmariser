essential fashion accessory

SOME USE them to hide their hangover, some to look glamorous, some to seem
famous and others just to 'avoid having to say hello'. And some people, of
course, even wear them to protect their eyes. We are talking about
sunglasses, the ubiquitous shades without which no Grand Prix race, film
festival or fashionable night happening could take place.
Shades these days are more than just a passing fad. They are part of the
growing essentials of the fashionable person. Ritzy designers worth their
logos turn them out in droves. Men and women no longer content themselves
with a single pair for serious jet-lag or the tropical sun - in fashionable
circles they are bought like handbags, a pair to match the mood and
occasion.
For those who think that shades are only for poseurs, it is worth saying
that this is simply no longer true. The evidence is piling up that, these
days, eyes need protecting from the bad rays of the sun - the UVAs, Bs and
Cs - that are increasingly penetrating the thinning ozone layer. All have
long ago been identified as being harmful to the retina and contributing to
the growth of cataracts. Of all the rays, invisible ultra violet radiation
is the most dangerous to the human eye and, of course, not easy to identify.
For instance, in Namibia, which I have just visited, inside the
characteristic thick morning mist rolling in from the Atlantic shore hover
highly dangerous ultraviolet rays.
So, having agreed that shades these days are more than just a glamorous
fashion accessory when strong sunlight or ultraviolet rays are around, how
do you choose them?
The temptation is to begin with the frames. Thick tortoiseshell from Giorgio
Armani, solid black from Valentino or little round metal ones from Romeo
Gigli? A tempting roll-call but - hold your horses - take a look at the lens
first - most of the big names produce lenses of high optical quality and
lenses is where you should really start.
Daska Barnett, President of the North London Optometrists Society advises
checking on the label to see if a lens is produced to British Standard 2724
 -not easy to do as many, particularly the most fashionable sunglasses, are
imported. Good opticians, however, will give advise and most will not deal
with lenses which are not up to proper optical standards.
The British Standard classifies sunglasses into several categories of which
the most relevant are for:
Cosmetic Purposes (mainly just a fashion accessory, these lightly tinted
glasses will not protect against significant sunlight);
General Purposes (will reduce glare in bright conditions, including driving
in daylight);
Special Purposes (which means they will reduce glare in abnormal conditions
such as sailing and skiing).
Either glass or plastic or glass lenses will do. Plastic lenses can protect
the eyes just as well (provided, of course, they have the UV filter) but
they are slightly easier to scratch unless they are coated. On the whole,
plastic is better for action sports and glass should certainly not be used
unless it has been toughened. Glass is usually slightly heavier than plastic
although it can be made a lot thinner and so is cosmetically better for
those who have a heavy prescription.
Some manufacturers, such as Luxottica, produce lenses of tempered crystal,
making them more resistant to scratching and breakage.
Remember that the colour of the lens has nothing to do with how much UV
protection they provide. If lenses are coloured, but do not protect against
UV rays, Daska Barnett says they are more damaging to the eyes than wearing
no glasses at all. The eye, noticing that it is dark, dilates making it more
vulnerable to the sun's rays, whereas usually in bright sunlight an eye with
no glasses over it uses its own protection system by contracting the iris
and allowing fewer rays to penetrate.
If you have not bought a pair recently you may need to sit down before you
consider the matter of price. A designer name, such as Armani or Valentino
will cost anything from Pounds 85 to Pounds 160, while Yves St Laurent
starts at Pounds 110 and at Cartier, a Pounds 290 price tag, if not de
rigueur, is reeled off without a blush.
A designer name is not just a way of paying a lot of money for something
that could be bought cheaper - designers have to solve complicated
functional and technical problems as well as producing frames and lenses
that give the consumer the image he is after. A canny manufacturer such as
Luxottica needs designers such as Armani and Valentino not just for their
names, but to make sure his ranges are at the forefront of fashion.
Ever since Bausch &amp; Lomb was asked to produce anti-glare glasses for fighter
pilots in the 1930s and came up with the functional Aviator shades,
sunglasses have joined that troupe of accessories that tell the world more
about you than you may wish it to know.
For years Ray-Bans (as they came to be called), Aviator and Wayfarer shapes
were the only frames to wear (they still are perenially, classically
fashionable) but these days the choice is vast.
At Harvey Nichols, the Knightsbridge store, a snazzy new sunglasses
department has just opened and Daniela Rinaldi, the buyer, tells me the two
current looks are big arms, wide eyes, wide-frames in tortoiseshell  -
Persol, the Italian brand, at about Pounds 99, Cutler &amp; Gross (cats-eyes
shaped, tortoiseshell frame) at about Pounds 70 - and small-round metal
frames (here the lead brands have to be Gaultier, at anything up to Pounds
300, and Romeo Gigli).
Confident extroverts could go for Moschino - lots of cheeky designs like
credit cards and combs on the arms, spots and colour, Dame Edna-style
jewel-encrusted frames, all jokey, fun and slightly tongue-in-cheek at
prices ranging from Pounds 105 - Pounds 185.
Almost every manufacturer these days has to offer its own version of the
shapes now in fashion - little round metal glasses, Jackie O, Grace Kelly,
teamed with Hermes-style silk scarves (think of the Riviera circa 1960 To
Catch A Thief time). For the shapes without the chichi price tags,
Mazzuchelli is a name to look out for - most lie in the Pounds 59 - Pounds
69 bracket.
Serengeti's is a good photochromic range - traditionally fashionable with
toughened glass making them safe. The Aviator shape sells the best in that
range.
For drivers looking for protection, it would be hard to beat the Serengeti
range. Dolland &amp; Aitchison, a chain of some 500 opticians around the UK,
reports that Serengeti is one of its best-selling ranges. Not cheap - prices
range from over Pounds 100 to Pounds 250 - they sport specialised
photochromic lenses. The glass is toughened and the lens is graded in colour
so that it is darker at the top, giving more protection when looking into
setting or rising sun, and lighter at the bottom so that the driver can
still see the dashboard.
Persol, it seems generally agreed, does the best fold-ups at about Pounds 99
but it also has a popular Italian cats-eye style - wide-armed in
tortoiseshell, also at about Pounds 100.
For those who wear glasses all the time, there are two solutions. Clip-ons
were once considered naff but these days they are all part of the look. Dark
clip-ons start at Pounds 5.99 and designs get better all the time.
Best of all for the four-eye set has to be prescription lenses. Dollond &amp;
Aitchison opticians is at the moment offering tinted prescription lenses for
Dollars 59 in plastic or metal frames in reasonably fashionable styles
(including a wide variety of aviator designs). Bi-focals will cost a little
more.
Those who - whisper it quietly - are prone to sweating might look at
titanium frames. These are extremely light and so cause less pressure and
the metal is unaffected by acid in the perspiration. A good range to look at
is one produced by Luxottica.
