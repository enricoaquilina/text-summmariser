The idea of surgeons manipulating the shape of the eye to correct faulty
vision would have been unthinkable to most people a few years ago. But today
 -with the help of laser incisions, special materials and new techniques -
defective eyesight can be improved with a surgical precision that only the
latest technology can provide.
For many, this means a visit to the optician for a new pair of spectacles or
contact lenses will no longer be necessary, or not so often. Surgeons can
break up the lenses of patients with poor vision and replace them with
artificial ones. The profile of the cornea can be altered and tests are
being carried out on injectable lenses made of gels.
One of the most common eye defects, especially in old people, is the
cataract in which the lens becomes clouded. It is more common in old people
and affects 80 per cent of over 80s in the UK, according to Arthur Steele, a
surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital. The causes are unknown, but exposure to
ultraviolet light and poor diet may be important.
To restore the vision of an eye with a cataract, the cloudy lens must be
removed and may be replaced by a plastic implant. But early implants caused
problems. The Perspex (PMMA) lenses were large and heavy. A long incision,
weakening the eye and changing its shape as it heals, is needed to insert
them and their weight makes them tend to move around. Cells tend to stick to
the PMMA lenses, making the implant cloudy and the implant is rigid, so the
eye cannot accommodate (focus) on near objects.
Yet all these problems, except the lack of accommodation, have been solved
by advances in equipment and techniques. The first step towards reducing
incision size was to break the lens up before extracting it. The problem was
to hit the lens hard enough, without damaging anything else inside the eye.
In the technique known as phaco-emulsification, a vibrating ultrasonic probe
breaks the lens up and removes it by suction.
The latest instruments remove the lens through a 1.5mm incision. The
problem, however, is that the implant replacing the lens has to pass through
the incision and be big enough to sit snugly in the lens capsule holding it
in the correct position inside the eye. Extracting the old lens through a
pinhole is no use if the incision has to be enlarged to insert a big
implant.
The development of foldable lenses alleviates this problem. PMMA is rigid,
but small lenses can be made with folding extensions (haptics). After
insertion the haptics are unfolded to keep the lens in the centre of the
capsule. These lenses can be inserted through a 5mm incision.
Even more advanced are lenses that can 'remember' their unfolded shape, and
resume it after insertion. Made of newer plastics, such as silicone or
acrylic, they can be folded or rolled up and inserted through even smaller
incisions. Lens insertions through incisions as small as 1.5 mm have been
reported. But these techniques are experimental and need to be carefully
evaluated. One potential problem is that silicone lenses may unfold
violently and damage the eye.
New lens materials also have other advantages. Cells do not stick to them,
so the lenses stay cleaner. Acrylic lenses can be made very thin, because
the plastic has a high refractive index - it bends light sharply, allowing
implants of very high optical quality to be designed.
However, even the latest implants cannot change focus. In the normal eye,
the lens capsule is under tension and flattens the lens by squeezing it. The
eye focuses on near objects by relaxing the capsule, allowing the lens to
curve.
Researchers in several countries are searching for a substance that will
form a lens that fills the capsule, corrects the focus of the eye and is
elastic enough to permit accommodation, or close-up focusing.
Yet even without accommodation, vision with a rigid implant can be improved
by a new technique. The profile of the cornea is measured before surgery and
the size and shape of the surgical incision are then planned so that the eye
heals with a corneal profile giving a precisely calculated degree of
astigmatism (difference in focus for lines of different angles).
According to Julian Stevens, a London eye surgeon who uses a
computer-controlled laser to make the incisions, the desired astigmatism
leaves the cornea slightly more curved in the vertical direction than in the
horizontal direction. The subjective effect is that clear vision is obtained
except for the very closest work.
For patients with simpler vision problems surgeons can also modify the
profile of the cornea, avoiding the need for spectacles or contact lenses.
The profile must be made flatter to correct myopia (short sight) or more
curved to correct hypermetropia (long sight).
One such method is radial keratotomy, in which a star-shaped incision
flattens the cornea. The success of this technique is highly dependent on
the surgeon's skill.
A newer, and rapidly evolving, technique - entirely driven by technological
changes, many derived from military applications - is photorefractive
keratectomy (PRK). A computer-controlled laser etches tissue from the
corneal surface to change its shape. PRK is an area of extremely rapid
development. Companies in the US, Europe, Japan and Russia are developing
more flexible ways of controlling the lasers so that problems requiring
different patterns of tissue removal can be treated. The change in profile
is produced by varying the amount of tissue removed from different parts of
the surface.
Long-sightedness can now be treated using a moving laser beam. The first
results are available from a system which uses a moving slit, developed by
Aeschulap-Meditech of Germany.
To correct hypermetropia with a scanning laser beam, the beam intensity or
the number of pulses can be controlled to etch more tissue from the edge
than from the centre, thus steepening the corneal curvature. The approach
can be extended, modifying the shape, intensity and number of pulses to
produce any desired change in the corneal profile. Thus astigmatism and
irregularities in the corneal surface can be corrected.
With such rapid advances in eye technology, patients will one day find a
visit to the eye-surgeon as routine and beneficial as a trip to the high
street optician.
