When peasants in the remote south of Chile noticed that rabbits were going
blind and their sheep and cattle were developing cataracts, they were
witnessing the grim signs of one of today's biggest environmental concerns -
the depletion of the earth's protective ozone layer.
Last year, the Financial Times first reported a sharp increase in skin
burns, eye complaints and allergies in Punta Arenas, the town at the
country's southern tip. Since then, the animals' plight has prompted keen
interest among scientists. Thus southern Chile is about to become the
world's first open-air laboratory for studying the health effects of the
ozone layer's decline.
Each spring, a huge ozone hole opens up over the Antarctic. US satellite
measurements show that the area of severe ozone depletion extends about 6m
square kilometres beyond the borders of the frozen continent. The ozone
loss, caused by a build-up of chlorofluorocarbons in the stratosphere,
allows increased levels of cancer-causing ultraviolet radiation to reach the
earth. Scientists believe that exposure to ultraviolet-B rays can also
damage the body's immune system, weakening people's resistance to disease.
According to Bedrich Magas, a researcher at the University of Magallanes in
Punta Arenas: 'It's like getting Aids from the sky.' The ozone hole now
covers the southern tip of Latin America. Even as far north as Santiago, the
capital' scientists have measured a five-fold increase in the intensity of
radiation this austral spring.
In Punta Arenas, the increase has been even greater. A team of US scientists
from Johns Hopkins University flew there earlier this month to study the
impact of this invisible bombardment of ultraviolet rays on humans and
animals. They were alerted to the problem by reports last year of a sharp
increase in skin burns, eye complaints and allergies in the area.
It is the first time an international group of eye and skin specialists,
immunologists, optical physicists and epidemiologists will have the chance
to examine the veracity of these reports, and whether the health complaints
can be linked to overdoses of radiation. They will also study the
feasibility of setting up a full-scale project to monitor the long-term
health effects associated with ultraviolet radiation. Like x-rays, the
effects of UV-B exposure are cumulative.
Although the intensity of ultraviolet radiation hitting Punta Arenas is
still below the levels received near the Equator, what interests the Johns
Hopkins team is the impact of sudden increases in exposure. 'We want to know
whether these sharp aberrations in UV-B levels, which expose people to
several times the amount of radiation they are used to, can cause acute or
chronic health problems over the years,' says Oliver Schein, the team's
head.
The scientists are taking several devices to monitor UV-B exposure in
different occupational groups. Farmers, fishermen and office workers in
Punta Arenas will carry UV-B dosimeters similar to x-ray counters.
Kirk Gellat, a veterinary ophthalmologist, will be looking at the reports of
blindness in animals. 'It is possible,' he says, 'that animals exhibit
symptoms before humans because their lifespans are shorter.'
The pilot project is being financed by the US Environmental Protection
Agency, the Chilean Health Ministry and the University of Chile.
