Loma Linda University Medical Center on Tuesday inaugurated the world's first 
hospital-based cancer treatment facility that uses a beam of protons to 
irradiate tumors. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that their $45-million center marks a "milestone" in cancer 
treatment, Loma Linda officials said proton therapy could ultimately be 
effective for many of the 1 million new patients diagnosed with cancer in the 
United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the use of protons -- positively charged particles in the nucleus of 
atoms -- to destroy cancer cells is not a new concept, Loma Linda's facility is 
the first dedicated solely to medical purposes. Previously, several thousand 
patients have received proton treatments at laboratories designed for physics 
research. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important beginning," said Dr. James M. Slater, chairman of Loma 
Linda's department of radiation medicine. "If this (treatment) produces the 
benefits we anticipate, there will be many, many centers like this one 
available to cancer patients." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Loma Linda center treated its first patient -- a 35-year-old 
rehabilitation nurse from the Los Angeles area suffering from a tumor in her 
right eye. At a news conference, the patient, Becky Carrillo, said the proton 
treatment gave her hope of retaining her eye and her vision. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very grateful," said Carrillo, who will undergo five treatments and was 
told there is a 96% chance they will destroy her tumor. "My husband said, 
'Don't get your hopes up too high,' . . . but I feel like I've been given 
another chance." 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo was diagnosed with ocular melanoma on Sept. 18 after a partial vision 
loss prompted her to consult an ophthalmologist. Her doctor said the only 
remedy was removal of the eye, but a friend told Carrillo to seek a second 
opinion at Loma Linda, and the medical center agreed to treat her. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, several tiny metal rings were sutured around the base of the 
eye tumor to help doctors focus exactly on their target. Tuesday morning, 
Carrillo sat in a padded gray seat resembling a dental chair for her first 
encounter with the proton beam. 
</P>
<P>
Her head was held still by a plastic mask attached to the chair's frame, and 
she was told to focus her eye on a light. There was some minor discomfort, 
caused by having her eyelids stretched open to reveal the eye's surface, but 
otherwise Carrillo called the 67-second treatment "painless." 
</P>
<P>
Proton therapy is a form of radiation effective on certain types of so-called 
localized tumors -- those that have not yet spread throughout the body. It is 
made possible by the use of an accelerator, called a synchrotron, that 
accelerates the protons to reach the energy level proven effective against 
cancer cells. 
</P>
<P>
Because the energy of the beam can be precisely delivered to a tumor without 
seriously harming healthy surrounding tissues or vital organs, proton treatment 
is free of many of the side effects of conventional radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Proton therapy also allows doctors to supply a more potent dose of radiation. 
In conventional radiation therapy, the danger of inflicting excessive damage on 
adjacent organs or healthy cells often requires doctors to use a 
less-than-optimal dose, Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
Loma Linda's center, funded by private contributions and $19.6 million in 
grants from the U.S. Department of Energy, will initially treat patients with 
ocular tumors, like Carrillo. Slater said patients with head and neck cancers 
will be accepted in December and those with cancers below the shoulder may be 
treated early next year. 
</P>
<P>
By late 1991, the facility could be treating as many as 100 people a day, 
Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
Development of proton therapy has evolved over the past 45 years, and to date 
8,000 cancer patients worldwide have been treated. One Harvard University study 
showed that after at least two years of follow-up, 96.3% of 1,008 patients with 
melanoma of the eye had no further tumor growth, and 90% retained their eyes.
