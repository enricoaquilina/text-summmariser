An international conference to stave off further erosion of the Earth's 
protective ozone layer opened here Wednesday amid widespread optimism that an 
agreement is near to significantly strengthen controls on ozone-destroying 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates from more than 55 nations and from major chemical manufacturers and 
environmental groups closeted themselves to hammer out details of far-reaching 
amendments to the Montreal Protocol, which will expand the list of chemicals 
controlled by the accord and establish a fund to assist Third World nations in 
paying for more expensive ozone-friendly substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations, expected to continue at least through Saturday, are aimed at 
presenting a final document to environmental ministers for their endorsement 
when they arrive next week. Their endorsement would precede formal approval by 
their governments. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to fail in London. The stakes are very high," Mostafa K. 
Tolba, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, told 
participants shortly before the conference was closed to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the threat is global, Tolba added: "It is a must that north and 
south, east and west should cooperate together. It is not an option." 
</P>
<P>
The stratospheric ozone layer shields all life on the planet from the sun's 
ultraviolet radiation, which can cause skin cancer, cataracts, suppression of 
the body's immune system and damage to plant and animal life. 
</P>
<P>
Only a week ago, there was considerably less optimism that an agreement on 
strengthening the protocol could be achieved. Last month, at a preliminary 
U.N.-sponsored meeting in Geneva, the United States served notice that it would 
oppose any effort to require industrialized countries to provide additional aid 
to Third World nations to help them pay the higher costs of using less harmful 
chemicals. It argued that the World Bank has sufficient funds to meet the 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position stirred an international outcry, not only among Third World 
countries sometimes referred to as "the South" but even from Americas' closest 
allies. They urged President Bush to reverse the position, which was fashioned 
by White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and Richard Darman, director of 
the White House Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
Late last week after intensive lobbying, Sununu told reporters that the United 
States will now support additional funds and offered a proposal for dispensing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The latest U.S. plan is not totally acceptable to developing countries, who 
want a greater voice in spending the estimated $240 million needed in the first 
three years of the program. Nor is there agreement on how developed countries 
such as the United States are to be assessed their share of the contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was general agreement here Wednesday that the biggest obstacle has 
been overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"That has removed what many people regarded as a major obstacle to this 
meeting, and we are grateful for the shift," British Environmental Secretary 
Chris Patten said of the U.S. shift. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
was one among those who urged Bush to reverse course. 
</P>
<P>
Another encouraging sign came Wednesday when delegates from China presented an 
estimate of their cost for complying with the protocol which closely matched 
Tolba's -- about $40 million in the first three years. 
</P>
<P>
Neither China nor India, which together account for 40% of the world's 
population, has signed the protocol. At a similar ozone conference here last 
year, they warned that unless developed countries, which they blame for most 
ozone depletion, foot much of their costs, they will not sign. 
</P>
<P>
Several major amendments to the protocol are under consideration. They include 
a total phase-out of ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 
2000 instead of the 50% reduction called for in the original protocol signed 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The original accord also limited the consumption of halons -- used as fire 
extinguishing agents -- only to 1986 levels, starting in 1992. The proposal now 
before delegates calls for a 50% reduction by 1995 and a ban by the year 2000. 
The United States and the European Community have endorsed the earlier 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, two chemical solvents that contribute to ozone depletion but 
are not now covered by the protocol are expected to be added: carbon 
tetrachloride and methyl chloroform. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the conference opened, delegates were given disturbing additional 
evidence of destruction of the ozone layer. A report released by British 
government said recent evidence has reinforced a 1988 report of "substantial 
damage" to the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
They said that the ozone hole over the Antarctic was "depleted as severely" in 
1989 as it was in 1987. The report said that the less severe depletion in 1988 
"was not a sign of recovery" but merely evidence that variability from year to 
year should be expected.
