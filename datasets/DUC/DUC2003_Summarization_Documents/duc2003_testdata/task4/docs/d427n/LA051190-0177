Dr. Arthur Charap is a little embarrassed to admit that, until recently, he 
rarely wore protective eye gear while windsurfing. He didn't want to worry 
about losing expensive sunglasses in the water -- or having them shatter on his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
But Charap never felt comfortable leaving his shades on shore. He's an Anaheim 
Hills ophthalmologist, and he's seen the injuries that can result from engaging 
in water sports without protecting your eyes from ultraviolet light or sudden 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
Now he wears the kind of protection he recommends for his patients, because 
after years of searching, he's finally found sunglasses that provide safety 
without cramping his style. 
</P>
<P>
They're called Spex, and if you take a spill in these sunglasses, you can 
retrieve them easily because the frames float, and they come in trendy neon 
colors visible from quite a distance. 
</P>
<P>
They're made of a soft, pliable material designed to bend on impact. 
</P>
<P>
They were invented by a windsurfer who, like Charap, was unable to find the 
right kind of protective eye gear for water sports. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't buy one, so I went out and made one," says 33-year-old Casey 
Patelski, who is senior vice president of Costa Mesa-based Sport Eyes 
Enterprises -- the company created to market his invention. 
</P>
<P>
Patelski made nine different prototypes before he finally found the right 
formula for a frame that would float, using a material that he created with 
help from a chemist and patented under the name Floatron. 
</P>
<P>
His prototypes also reflected his efforts to structure Spex -- a cross between 
sunglasses and goggles -- so their shatter-proof lenses wouldn't fog or collect 
water and so wearers would have peripheral vision. 
</P>
<P>
Spex -- now being sold for about $65 throughout the United States and in more 
than 60 other countries -- come with an amber lens that provides 100% 
ultraviolet light protection and can easily be interchanged with clear or gray 
lenses, available for about $10 for each pair of lenses. 
</P>
<P>
Although they were designed for windsurfers, Patelski says they're being used 
in a variety of water sports -- jet skiing, surfing, sailing, water skiing. 
He's even seem them used for protection from impact in racquetball and karate 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
Once he had a prototype, it didn't take Patelski long to get his product into 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
One of his high school surfing buddies, Steve Teregis, 33, liked it so much 
that he showed it to Shawn Troup, a friend who had been a professional 
windsurfer but had never worn eye protection. Troup, 28, was equally impressed 
and took a prototype with him to a popular windsurfing spot in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
He was the only one in the water wearing sunglasses, he recalls. "I felt funny, 
so I took them off. But it was so bright that I put them on again. Then I took 
them off and threw them. I could see them floating 200 yards away." 
</P>
<P>
Soon he had some of the world's top windsurfers asking to try them out. The 
demand has been growing ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Sport Eyes Enterprises was incorporated in April, 1989, with Teregis as 
president, Patelski as senior vice president in charge of research and 
development and Troup as vice president of sales and marketing. Jim Nanko, a 
29-year-old Newport Beach attorney who loves to surf and sail, is the fourth 
co-owner and handles the firm's financial and legal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Teregis says they sold about 5,000 Spex in last month. At the end of last year, 
they were selling about 1,750 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Spex are sold locally by Nordstrom, Bruce Jones Surfboards Inc. in Sunset Beach 
and Newport Ski Co. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Owen, manager of Newport Ski Co. and a windsurfer who wears Spex, says he 
hasn't seen any other product on the market that offers the same protection for 
high-speed water sports. 
</P>
<P>
"They do float," he says. "And you can step on them and turn them inside out 
and they don't break. They can take a lot of abuse. In windsurfing, your 
equipment has to hold up or it's no fun." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Nolan, product manager for Denver-based Bolle America and a windsurfer, 
says it's been frustrating to work for a sunglass manufacturer that doesn't 
provide protective eye gear for his sport. But that will soon change. He says 
Bolle America is developing a pair of sunglasses for windsurfers with a 
lightweight frame that will float. They're expected to be on the market by 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Oakley Inc. in Irvine also is developing special goggles for windsurfing and 
other water sports that will be designed to float, Advertising Director Kris 
Anderson says. 
</P>
<P>
Patelski, who is now working on prescription lenses for Spex, says he sees the 
competition as a compliment rather than a threat. 
</P>
<P>
The trend thrills Charap, who is an assistant clinical professor of 
ophthalmology at UC Irvine. He feels protective eye wear for water sports is 
long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes products such as Spex will become as fashionable as regular 
sunglasses, which, he says, "are not made to take any of the punishment these 
sports deliver. 
</P>
<P>
"Spex aren't a crash helmet," he says, "but they will give you 95% protection 
against most things that can happen to you in the water."
