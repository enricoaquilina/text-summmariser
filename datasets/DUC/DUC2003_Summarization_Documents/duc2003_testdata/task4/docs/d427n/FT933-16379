NOW THAT few of us travel to the parts that smart hotel chains do not reach,
packing for our holidays is nothing like the serious matter it once used to
be.
If we are not conquerors of Everest, like Rebecca Stephens, or adventurers
such as Colonel Blashford-Snell, we are unlikely to meet the kind of
emergency that cannot be dealt with locally.
However, getting it right before we go seems worth the effort, if only
because it allows more time and comfort to do more agreeable things than
shop for things we have left behind. For the really intrepid traveller - the
sort who needs mosquito tablets, water purifying tablets, emergency
lighting, that sort of thing, there are two specialist shops worth
mentioning - Travelling Light of Morland House, Morland, Penrith, Cumbria
CA10 3 AZ (tel: 0931-714 488 for a catalogue) and Safariquip, The Stones,
Castleton, Sheffield, 530 2WX (Tel: 0433-620 320).
Another essential for most of us is something good to read. Bloomsbury
Classics are worth knowing about - 'small . . . but perfectly bound' goes
the blurb and I could not put it better myself. Light and packable, there
are 22 contemporary classics, such as Michael Ondaatje's Coming Through
Slaughter or Brian Moore's The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne. Each costs
about Pounds 10.
IF YOU have, as I do, a friend who is gradually going blind from too many
years spent in the African sunshine, if you know that writer Wilfred
Thesiger, too, is almost blind from the effects of the desert sun, then you
will probably not need much urging to wear sunglasses in strong sunlight.
Sunglasses are not just for the Hello] set, photographed as they stumble out
of jets or enter nightclubs. With lenses of good optical quality they are
more than just a fashion accessory, they are essential eye protection.
Unfortunately, good lenses do not come cheap. Those which are just coloured
will not protect against ultra-violet rays and are more damaging to the eyes
than wearing no glasses at all (the eye, thinking it is dark, dilates making
it even more vulnerable to the sun's rays). Most branded lenses do give some
protection but you should always check.
Having made sure that the lenses are good you can then worry about
fashionable frames. This year's latest shape is what you might call
Swot-of-the-Remove, small round frames giving an air of entirely illusory
(in most cases) scholarly distinction. Not the most flattering shape, it is
the one most in favour with the Voguettes. Sketched here is a version by
Giorgio Armani, Pounds 115, while Armani's other pair folds into a neat
leather pouch, Pounds 125. The black Valentino shades are Pounds 115 and
represent the other fashionable shape - upswept sides with protection at the
sides. All are available from Harvey Nichols and Harrods.
THERE ARE some for whom the only holiday hat is a Panama. Proper Panamas,
like the two sketched here, come from Ecuador, where they hand-plait the
fibres of the jipijapa plant to make the distinctive headgear. They are then
steamed and blocked in the US, from whence they set out on their journeys
round the world. If you are wondering why they are called Panamas it is
because north American sailors first discovered them on sale there.
The two sketched here are imported for gardeners by Pulbrook &amp; Gould. Not
only are they flattering but they can be folded and packed in a suitcase. In
cream or caramel, the one on the left is Pounds 25, the one on the right,
Pounds 27.50. Pulbrook &amp; Gould, Liscartan House, 127 Sloane Street, London
S1X 9AS, will post either for Pounds 5 post and packing.
A floppier version is made by Herald &amp; Heart Hatters. It comes boxed, ready
folded, with its own hatpin and matching silk scarf. In white, ivory, marine
blue or red, it is Pounds 50 direct from Herald &amp; Heart Hatters, 131 St
Philip Street, London SW8 3SS.
EVERY swimsuit needs a wrap. Most useful of all are pareos - if you can
master the art of tying them - which transform the skimpiest of bikini into
something relatively modest. For some years Slix has sold a selection of
one-piece bathing suits and bikinis with matching cover-ups which can be
bought separately. Shown above is a two-piece bikini with an underwired
bra-top and a matching mini-sarong which does not exactly add-up to formal
restaurant wear but does lend a vestige of cover-up to the skimpy bottoms.
Pounds 34.99 for the bikini, Pounds 21.99 for the sarong. both will be in
good department stores throughout the UK from early July.
For those who cannot be bothered with irons there is a marvellous scrunched
silk fabric which Whistles has made into a series of simple holiday (and
glamorous evening) garments. As the scrunched look is part of their charm
they can be folded, crushed, twisted and packed without coming to any harm.
There are long skirts (Pounds 59 at Fenwick), slip dresses (Pounds 129) and
cropped tops (Pounds 59). From Whistles branches, the Whistles department in
Fenwick of Bond Street, Harrods and Selfridges.
CHOOSING luggage has become a complicated business. Those who belong to the
'you are what you buy' school of thought believe that your choice of luggage
reveals volumes.
This is a school of thought I am deeply apprehensive about myself, as I feel
that my own luggage says nothing at all about my inner being but plenty
about the state of my purse and the efficacy of my shopping habits.
However, the real problem with suitcases revolves around two conflicts: on
the one hand one wants them to be light, inexpensive and easy to carry but,
on the other, one would like them to be beautiful, too.
When it comes to appearance no material, in my view, looks as good as
leather. It may be heavy, it is indubitably expensive, but the older it gets
the better it looks.
Sketched on the right, are four very special pieces, each designed to meet a
specific travelling need and each of which, while indubitably expensive, is
so finely made that it should last way beyond your own lifetime.
Henry's, an all-British leather company with a flagship store at 143 Fulham
Road, London SW3 (tel: 071-581-1321) has produced the Survival Bag, which is
small enough to fit under an aircraft seat yet seems to hold an amazing
amount.
A combination of suitcase, briefcase and document case, it also has two
flaps on the front to hold things such as passports, vaccination
certificates and the like.
One side holds the briefcase and document case while the other has four
separate deep pockets, each of which has a canvas container into which you
can put all those myriad things that seem an inevitable part of modern
travelling (the personal toiletries, the malaria tablets, the pocket
calculators, or the tot of whisky). It costs Pounds 751.
Next come three pieces from a new range by Baronessa Franchetti. First comes
The Weekender - roomy (22in by 10 in by 13) but nothing like as heavy as it
looks. It has a large, front pocket, another pocket at each end and a
detachable shoulder strap.
Like all Baronessa Franchetti's collection it is made from full hide tanned
with natural ingredients. In green and tan or black and tan, it is Pounds
375.
Next comes The Overnighter, a simple, classic Boston-style overnight bag
with a detachable shoulder strap,. 30 in by 14 in. It, too, comes in green
and tan or black and tan for Pounds 250.
Finally, there is The Suiter. Suits or dresses hang on the inside hanger and
there are three outside pockets, one large and two small, for accessories or
documents, as well as two further pockets inside. Measuring 18 in by 24 in
when closed, it costs Pounds 250. All have fine brass detailing with good
locks. Franchetti-Bond is at 7 Burlington Arcade, London W1 or 5 Lion and
Lamb yard, Farnham, Surrey GU9 7LL. (Tel: 071-629 0025 for mail order).
FOR THOSE who love gadgets the Go selection is the name to look for. Whether
you want something as simple and useful as a portable iron (The Slim Press),
some travelling adaptors, a sturdy flight bag or a tough holdall, Go will be
bound to have it.
There is a travelling laundry (tube of Kwikwash, Stain Go spot removal
sachets, a clothes line with hooks and suction cups, a PVC laundry bag,
laundry pegs and a carry case for just Pounds 4.50), an array of money belts
and bags, as well as inflatable pillows, packaway macs, blow-up hangers and
pouches.
Photographed above is the Wonder towel (Pounds 4.50) which, measuring just
70 cm by 25 cm, mops up as much moisture as a bath towel. Apart from its
uses while travelling it is ideal for the aerobics set. Also pictured is the
Aquasafe, a waterproof - if you follow the manufacturer's instructions -
belt safe which means you need not leave your valuables on the beach but can
take them swimming with you - though not, it seems, scuba-diving. Go
products can be found in most department stores and Big airports, such as
Heathrow and Gatwick, have a large selection of their wares.
