to finance an electricity project

MRS Anne Evans was not in a champagne mood yesterday. True, the sun was
shining on Wolverhampton and she had just completed a 15-month struggle to
secure financing for the UK's largest non-fossil fuel electricity generating
plant. Rather, she was a trifle wan. It was all a bit of an anti-climax,
said the US businesswoman.
It had been a close-run thing. She told the lawyers in London at 11.20pm on
Tuesday that either everybody signed up or she would walk away from the
Pounds 49m project, which will use about 20 per cent of the UK's scrap
tyres. Come what may, she was catching the 11.40pm train to Wolverhampton.
The agreements were signed.
But the signatures were obtained about a year later than Mrs Evans had
expected. In October 1990 she was talking of a Pounds 36m project on the
site of an old Wolverhampton iron foundry. Now there is Pounds 13m more at
stake - and it is that extra sum which caused a year of difficult
negotiations and a final five days of tetchy discussions.
Mrs Evans's company, Performance Services Corporation of Hebron,
Connecticut, acts as a consultant on the use of scrap tyres in energy
production. The Wolverhampton project, whose company name is Elm Energy,
stems from the Department of Trade and Industry's desire to be rid of a
growing mountain of waste tyres.
Originally the scheme was to have been financed by Pounds 12m of equity and
Pounds 24m of bank borrowings. Final financing is Pounds 14.5m equity and
Pounds 34.5m of debt. So Mrs Evans had to persuade her equity backers to put
up more money, and to persuade the banks to lend more.
The cost escalation came from a number of factors. Finding a contractor
proved difficult. Eventually a consortium of Tarmac of Wolverhampton and
Black &amp; Veatch Engineering of Kansas City agreed to take on construction -
Tarmac for its building expertise, Black &amp; Veatch for its knowledge of plant
mechanics.
Designers then altered the plans to increase the plant's output. This is set
at 25MW, to be sold to Midlands Electricity as power for about 25,000 homes.
Land-reclamation costs rose. Applications for a Pounds 2m reclamation grant
were accepted by the Department of Environment but rejected by the Treasury.
As the costs rose so did Mrs Evans's demands on her US partner, Nipsco
Development, a subsidiary of the Indiana electricity utility. Nipsco had
first agreed to put up Pounds 4m. The amount grew and at the end of last
week the US company threatened to pull out.
The more Nipsco put up as equity, the more Mrs Evans's stake was diluted.
She now has 5 per cent, Nipsco 95 per cent.
The banks were cautious. In the background was concern about the rapidly
changing pattern of environmental regulation, not to speak of more stringent
lending policies.
Mrs Evans said she has a 13-year non-recourse loan at a margin over base
rate, but only after the contractors had been tightly screwed down. They
have a Pounds 38m fixed-price contract with performance guarantees.
Work began yesterday.
