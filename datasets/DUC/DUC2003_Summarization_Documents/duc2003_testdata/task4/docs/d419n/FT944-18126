King Canute would not have approved of the method, but the land reclamation
scheme in the southern Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung is sure to be watched
with interest by the Netherlands.
Kaohsiung is reclaiming coastland using non-hazardous industrial waste as
fill instead of sand and gravel. The project creates much-needed new land -
an expensive and highly sought-after commodity in the crowded, heavily
industrialised city. It also provides a practical way to dispose of
materials which were previously dumped offshore.
The city government plans to reclaim up to 200ha (494 acres) of land by the
end of the century. Begun in 1989, reclamation of the first 50ha will be
completed by the end of this year. It will be used to build a public sports
park and recreation area. Uses for land still to be reclaimed have yet to be
decided.
Kaohsiung's environmental protection bureau conceived the South Star project
as a stop-gap measure to prevent further erosion of the shoreline south of
the city, but it has since evolved into a more ambitious reclamation
project.
South Star is using slag produced by the state-owned China Steel Corp, fly
ash generated by the state power company, Taiwan Power Co, and construction
rubble. Even the sea walls are made with recycled material  - primarily a
concrete using slag powder and slag aggregate. About 200,000 old tyres will
be used to protect them from erosion.
The project is economical as well as environmentally friendly, according to
the environmental protection bureau. It says the cost of building the sea
walls was half the price it would have been using conventional construction
methods.
The project that most closely resembles the South Star reclamation is the
new Kansai airport in Osaka, Japan, says Liu Chia-nan, deputy commissioner
of the bureau of environmental protection.
'The concept is similar, but compressed garbage was used for fill at Kansai,
and now the airport is experiencing problems with subsidence,' Liu says.
'However, our method is quite stable because the materials we are using for
fill are solid.'
Future reclamation projects intend to use other waste material, including
ash produced by Kaohsiung's several planned garbage incinerators.
