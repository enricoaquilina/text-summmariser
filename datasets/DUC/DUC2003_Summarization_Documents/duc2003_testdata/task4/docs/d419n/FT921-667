environmental liability are making banks hesitate before lending to some
businesses

Mrs Anne Evans knows about dirty industries. The US businesswoman and her
company, Elm Energy, are about to build a Pounds 50m electricity generating
plant in the British Midlands which will burn used rubber tyres - the first
of its kind in Europe.
Not that the plant will besmirch the Midlands environment: it uses the
latest clean technology, and has the blessing of Her Majesty's Inspectorate
of Pollution. The UK government also gave it enthusiastic support because of
its pioneering nature.
Mrs Evans's problem was with the banks, from which she was trying to raise
Pounds 35m in loans. Although they were satisfied about the quality of the
technology, they were anxious about the green aspects of the plant. Did Mrs
Evans have all the right permits, would she be able to dispose of the waste
products, and - their greatest worry  - was there any danger of land
contamination?
After more than a year of negotiation, Mrs Evans finally secured the money
she needed, but she reckons that environmental issues added greatly to her
upfront costs, in lawyers' fees alone. 'If banks are worried about
contaminated land, they should not be lending in the Midlands,' she says
with some impatience. 'They should be lending in the middle of the desert.'
Harrisons &amp; Crosfield, the UK chemicals and feedstock company, also knows
about financiers' worries. Since last August, it has been negotiating a
Dollars 120m private placement with a group of US institutions. But
Harrisons owns 110 chemical sites in the US and the institutions insisted on
inspecting each one before they would commit themselves. Eventually,
Harrisons persuaded them that they need only visit a fraction of that
number, and gave them documentation for the rest. But the delays and
lawyers' fees have added noticeably to the cost.
'This is clearly indicative of a trend,' says Mr Bill Turcan, Harrisons'
finance director.
The lenders' fears are twofold. One is that a customer could be caught up in
an expensive environmental lawsuit which might impair its ability to repay
its loan. The other is the extent of a bank's own liability for the
environmental damage caused by a borrower - a legal grey area which bankers
see lawmakers longing to fill to their cost.
'We are worried about the uncertainty and the legislation that could come
out of the UK and Brussels,' says Mr Humphrey Norrington, deputy chairman of
Barclays Bank, one of the two banks involved in the Elm project, the other
being Fuji Bank of Japan.
There has always been a danger that banks will find themselves liable for
penalties incurred by a company when they foreclose on it because it cannot
pay its debts. The act of foreclosure makes them own-ers of the company's
property, and responsible for any pollution it has caused. More recently,
though, there have been suggestions that banks might also be made liable
simply by virtue of their lending relationship, regardless of whether or not
they foreclose.
The fear was triggered by a notorious court case two years ago in the US
involving a company called Fleet Factors, which set a broad precedent for
bank liability for clean-up costs. The court ruled that banks must pay if
they participate 'in the financial management of a facility to a degree
indicating a capacity to influence the corporation's treatment of hazardous
wastes'. A bank did not have to exercise that capacity to be liable.
The case sent shock waves through the financial community and provoked
several attempts - so far unsuccessful  - to introduce new legislation into
Congress which would define liability much more tightly, or specifically
exempt secured lenders.
The position in the EC is less clear. Although several member states have
laws defining liability for environmental damage, none has so far created
any big problems for banks. However, last year the EC Commission produced a
draft directive on civil liability for damage caused by waste, which said
that 'the producer of waste' would be liable 'irrespective of fault on his
part'. Although it was not clear whether a lending bank would count as 'a
producer', the strictness of the proposed liability sent further tremors
through bankers' ranks.
Since then, the Commission appears to have retreated on the proposal.
Instead, it is preparing a green paper on liability for environmental damage
which will address the issue again. However, officials say this will be more
of an exercise to provoke discussion than an attempt to define precise
borders to liability.
Some UK bankers are not satisfied by this. Mrs Hilary Thompson, head of the
environmental management unit at National Westminster and a leading
lobbyist, says that remarks made by EC officials to her suggest that they
intend to take a tough line.
'What they forget is that we might stop lending to these people,' she says.
The irony is that the more a company needs green finance to clean up its
act, the less likely it is to get it. Mrs Thompson is proposing that secured
lenders be exempted from liability provided they exercise due diligence
before lending to a company which subsequently causes damage. This would
probably involve that company carrying out an environmental audit as a
condition for a loan.
British bankers' worries have been noted by the UK government. Mr Michael
Heseltine, environment secretary, told a recent audience of City financiers:
'There are real concerns in this area which I recognise.' But he assured
them: 'We shall be looking for workable solutions in which we are equally as
clear about the effects on business costs as we are about the beneficial
effects on the environment.'
What is already clear is that the level of anxiety about these issues is
much higher in the Anglo-Saxon world than on the Continent. This is partly
because of the Fleet Factors case, and the fact that the US and the UK share
similar legal traditions. In continental Europe, lawyers say, the Napoleonic
traditions treat liability more narrowly. Also, enforcement of any
environmental legislation emanating from Brussels would be a matter for
individual countries, so differences in legal traditions could have a
significance.
It is not clear at this point quite how dampening an effect such worries are
having on bank lending. It has certainly been in the banks' interest to
sound the alarm bells to reinforce their case. But, though Mrs Evans's
experience shows how closely banks are scrutinising sensitive projects, they
are still willing to lend to them provided they are well-managed and
financially sound. The Chemical Industries Association, representing the UK
chemical sector, says it is unaware of any significant financing problems
among its members.
But whatever form the EC's legislation ultimately takes, banks will play an
increasing role in policing the environment. To protect themselves, all the
big UK clearing banks have introduced procedures to check out customers'
environmental records before advancing a loan, and to keep watch until it is
repaid. And checks are bound to get tougher.
'Lenders become essentially an enforcement agency,' says Mr Steve Jones, a
lawyer with Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue of Washington which specialises in
environmental issues. 'Almost all US property now goes through a site
assessment, and I would be surprised if a similar process did not evolve in
Europe.'
