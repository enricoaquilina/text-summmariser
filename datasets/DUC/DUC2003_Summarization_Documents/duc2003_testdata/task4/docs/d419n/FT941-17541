FT  04 JAN 94 / Tyre crisis swept under carpet: A recycling joint venture
that tackles part but not all of a scrap mountain

A collaborative venture between a subsidiary of BBA, the motor components
and engineering group, and Colway Tyres, the UK's largest independent tyre
remoulder, is turning 3m scrap tyres a year into carpet underlay.
The venture represents one of the latest ways of dealing with the mountains
of discarded tyres now regarded as a major environmental problem.
About 25m tyres are discarded each year in the UK and about 250m a year in
western Europe. With serious attempts at recycling only just starting to
gain momentum, several hundred million tyres have collected throughout the
countryside.
One large dump of tyres in Wales is still burning after eight years, all
attempts to extinguish it having failed. Even without fire, pollutants leech
from the tyres, poisoning soil and endangering waterways.
The BBA-Colway venture has involved building a tyre-shredding and storage
facility next to Colway's remoulding plant on the outskirts of Durham, which
produces more than 1m tyres a year and employs about 250 people.
Four million discarded tyres a year are collected from distributors and
retail outlets. Only about a quarter are fit for remoulding and the
remainder are shredded, with the resultant rubber 'crumb' being collected in
large silos.
It is transported to Duralay, BBA's wholly owned subsidiary at Rossendale,
Lancashire, where it is made into underlay. Steel cords reclaimed from the
tyres are sent for recycling separately.
Finding new ways of recycling scrap tyres not suitable for remoulding 'has
become part of our corporate strategy', says Mr Bob Bonomy, managing
director of Colway. The partners stress that underlay can only be a small
part of the recycling solution to the problem of scrap tyres.
Research commissioned from consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand has identified the
inclusion of rubber crumb in asphalt as one potentially major way of dealing
with the problem. Inclusion of about 15 per cent crumb in road construction
would increase the life of a road surface by 15 to 22 years, the research
says.
'But the bad news is that, as things stand, the cost of the asphalt rises by
50 per cent to 100 per cent so the actual payback is marginal,' said Mr
Bonomy.
However, the picture might improve if Europe were to follow the example in
some states of the US. There it has become law to use crumb to improve
drainage and skid resistance.
