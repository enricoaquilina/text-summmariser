The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority yesterday said its members
had overcome the initial 'yuk factor' they felt over using eggs from aborted
foetuses to treat infertility and were now keeping an open mind.
The HFEA - the government body set up in 1991 to regulate 'test-tube baby'
clinics - rushed out a consultation document in response to widespread
concern about research which could lead to foetal eggs being used to treat
infertile women within three years.
Sir Colin Campbell, HFEA chairman, said yesterday that members of the
authority had reacted with 'unease, distaste and surprise' when they first
heard about the technique. But this emotional response to the 'Yuk factor'
had passed, he said.
The document itself acknowledges that the public 'may feel an initial
repugnance' to using aborted foetuses to help women whose own eggs are
defective in some way. But it says the authority has an open mind and is
looking forward to hearing people's views on the issue.
Scientists at Edinburgh University, led by Dr Roger Gosden, have shown that
the technique works with animals. It involves removing ovaries from a
foetus, 'maturing' the eggs in the laboratory, fertilising them with sperm
and then implanting the resulting embryos into the womb.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said it would not be permissible
to use human foetal ovaries under present legislation, and Dr Gosden has
stopped the research programme until the HFEA has issued new guidelines.
These are not expected before the autumn.
There is currently a severe shortage of donated eggs available for
implantation into infertile women, who typically wait between three and five
years for treatment in one of Britain's 63 fertility clinics.
