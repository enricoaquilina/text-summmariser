FALLOPIAN TUBE IMPLANT LEADS TO BIRTH OF GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A baby was born this week at an Orange County hospital after what is believed 
to be the first implant of a frozen, fertilized egg in a woman's Fallopian 
tubes in the United States, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The baby, a healthy 8-pound, 3-ounce girl, was born Monday, said Dr. Lawrence 
B. Werlin, director of fertility services at Hoag Memorial Hospital 
Presbyterian. 
</P>
<P>
The mother, a 37-year-old Mission Viejo resident who was not identified, also 
is doing well, added Werlin, who implanted the embryo taken from the woman's 
27-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
Werlin initially transferred unfrozen eggs, which had been fertilized with 
sperm from the older woman's husband, directly to the mother's womb. That 
attempt failed to result in pregnancy. Later, using a frozen fertilized egg, 
Werlin placed the egg in the woman's Fallopian tubes. 
</P>
<P>
Werlin said the significance of the birth is that in vitro fertilization may 
now have a higher success rate. In vitro fertilization involves having a 
woman's egg fertilized by a man's sperm in a laboratory dish. In some cases, 
the fertilized eggs are frozen for later use.
