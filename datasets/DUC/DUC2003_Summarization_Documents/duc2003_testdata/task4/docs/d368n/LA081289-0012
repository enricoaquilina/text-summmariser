The battle being waged in a Tennessee courtroom over the fate of seven frozen 
and fertilized ova could gear up to be a national sensation along the lines of 
the "Baby M" surrogate mother case two years ago. Like the Baby M case, this 
dispute raises controversial questions concerning reproductive rights. And like 
the Baby M case, this dispute is unlikely to solve any of them. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Sue Davis and her former husband, Junior Lewis Davis, wanted to have a 
child. Because Mrs. Davis could not conceive normally, the couple opted for in 
vitro fertilization -- so-called test-tube fertilization -- where egg and sperm 
are united in a laboratory and surgically implanted in the woman's uterus. Part 
of the way through this process, after fertilization and before implantation of 
seven of the fertilized eggs, the marriage fell apart and the couple decided to 
divorce. Mrs. Davis now wants to gain possession of the embryos, hoping to use 
them to have a child in the future. Mr. Davis doesn't want her to bear his 
children without his consent. 
</P>
<P>
The case raises many larger questions: Does Mr. Davis have the same rights over 
the embryos as Mrs. Davis because their genetic contribution was equal? Or does 
Mrs. Davis have greater rights because she can put the embryos to use and Mr. 
Davis cannot? Or do the rights of the parents shrink in comparison to the 
rights of the embryos who, as potential human beings, have been accorded full 
legal status in some states? 
</P>
<P>
The judge, who has said repeatedly that this case has no direct legal 
precedents, has several avenues of response. One is to consider the case as a 
standard divorce case and the embryos as any other piece of marital property. 
Another would be to follow the reasoning of a California appellate court that 
ruled last year that persons who give biological material to medical 
institutions retain rights over that material. In that case, Mr. Davis would 
retain at least equal right over the embryos. Finally, the judge could turn to 
law concerning custody of children in divorce cases, determining what decision 
would be in the "best interests" of the Davises' potential children. 
</P>
<P>
The answers to such questions have enormous implications for reproductive 
ethics. Should the judge decide that the well-being of the embryos supersedes 
the claims of both adults, that would raise questions about the morality of 
abortion. If the father is granted some say in the fate of the embryos, then 
that would raise larger issues about paternal consent for abortion and the 
rights of sperm donors. If the mother is accorded full powers over the embryos, 
the ruling would raise questions about fathers' parental rights. 
</P>
<P>
But although this case raises such sweeping questions, it is unlikely to 
resolve them. In the Baby M case, the judge resorted to straight contract law 
to make his ruling. Similarly, the Davises are likely to reach a satisfactory 
legal solution that sidesteps the moral issues -- Mr. Davis could relinquish 
all future rights or responsibilities over any children born from the embryos, 
for instance, and Mrs. Davis would gain control over the embryos in return for 
giving up the right to ask her former husband for child support. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the judge does not grant the embryos legal status -- which would go 
far beyond existing law -- this case will be just one more dispute that spurs 
public debate and reveals how deep are society's uncertainties about 
reproduction in this technologically confused era. The answers to the larger 
questions will come about only after long deliberation -- not by one nervous 
judge in one Tennessee courtroom but by society as a whole.
