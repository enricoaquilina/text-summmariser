Most couples trying to conceive through artificial insemination probably should 
give up if the technique has failed after six attempts, researchers said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
A study involving 50 women who underwent in vitro fertilization or IVF at the 
Beth Israel Hospital in Boston found that it was highly unusual for a 
successful pregnancy to occur after the sixth try.

"We conclude that the overwhelming majority of couples who will achieve 
pregnancy as a result of IVF do so within a relatively short period of time," 
Dr. Machelle Seibel and colleagues wrote in a letter published in the New 
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"Couples who do not achieve a viable pregnancy after four to six IVF cycles 
should be counseled that success with this technique is unlikely and should not 
be encouraged to pursue IVF further," they said.
