Provided no one gets hurt, does it matter where babies come from? If it does
matter, do we know where to draw the line?
Society, we assume, decides what scientists shall do - hence the latest
alarms about egg-farming and designer babies. But scientific breakthroughs
will themselves re-define social attitudes.
For the next four months the British public is being invited to join an
ethical debate about overcoming the severe shortage of human eggs for embryo
research and the treatment of infertile women.
The Human Fertilisation &amp; Embryology Authority, a committee of experts and
prominent citizens, wants to know what the public thinks about taking eggs
or ovarian tissue from corpses and even (when the procedure becomes
reliable) from aborted foetuses.
First reactions have been predictable. For a second opinion, I went to see
Robert Edwards, the Cambridge professor who brought test-tube babies into
the world, at the splendid Jacobean house outside Cambridge where he and
Patrick Steptoe founded their clinic.
It has taken the public 20 years to accept in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and
Prof Edwards, a distinguished scientist, knows all there is to know about
controversy. He has even had to sue for libel.
He gives the impression of one who is immune to criticism but not to
contradiction. Yet from behind the set face and flat northern accent there
gradually emerged a humane and pleasant subtlety.
Not surprisingly, Edwards is a militant libertarian. He seeks the maximum
possible freedom for scientific inquiry and the minimum of statutory
intervention into what he regards as a humane endeavour to satisfy a
fundamental human desire, which is to produce children.
I asked him how the latest outbreak compared with the test-tube baby furore.
'There have been endless controversies, all of them headline news. This is
only the latest. But could I say that we started the ethical debate in the
whole field in 1971.' He was referring to an article he wrote with David
Sharpe, an American academic lawyer, for Nature magazine. There he called
for elaboration of the issues 'in order to give time for defining and
evolving social attitudes on which to base rules of conduct for scientists
and society.'
Some scientists, I said, argue theirs is a pure, untrammelled, discipline
and it's not for them to take the ethical decisions.
'I've never, ever believed that. I've always said that in the early stages
of investigation the crucial roles are played by the scientists and
doctors.'
Would you yourself use foetal ovaries?
'I would grow them at the present time to the stage before fertilisation,'
he said. 'I would want to know they're perfectly normal before I take any
further step. That will probably take years. Then I would probably fertilise
some and grow them as embryos.
'I would not transfer them (into the surrogate mother) because there could
be considerable social backlash to this work.
'In any ethical debate one must always put down a period of two to three
years for social balance to be established. The effect of many scientific
developments on society comes as a shock . . . the 'yuk factor' or whatever
you call it.'
Would you treat single women?
'I would, yes. Provided they had ethical counselling and there was detailed
ethical investigation of their background.' Patients usually came on
referral, their backgrounds known. But he recalled that one would-be patient
turned out to be a lesbian.
Should there be an age limit?
Prof Edwards quoted the Biblical story of Sarah, and observed that the
oldest 'artificial' pregnancy to date was of a woman of 61 or 62. 'Between
50 and 60 the medical risks to mother and child are no greater than those of
a younger woman, with proper care. Had there been medical or scientific
contra-indications I would have said this is out. But I have not seen those
contra-indications.
'It has moved from being a scientific question to a social one. And I feel
very strongly that individual liberties here are being threatened. I see no
reason why a woman of 60 should not have a baby. I don't know if I would go
to 70 or not. I always say: 'Ask the question when you know the work can be
done.'
Should people be able to choose the baby's colour?
'If they say they do not let the colour of skin affect their relationships
with anybody, that they are non-racist, then you should not mind if a white
lady wishes to have a black baby.'
Can't you see any ethical objection?
'Not really. If two white patients come and ask for a black baby I would
wonder about that. But if it's a white man and black woman, as it usually
is, and the colour of the child is very obviously going to be a problem,
then provided they were counselled, I would say very well.'
What about choosing sex?
'Again, I think I must be very liberal: I do not see any great dangers in
choosing the sex of your children provided certain controls are exercised:
the most serious thing that can happen is that you will get an imbalance of
sexes as in China. But the most interesting aspect, which is never
discussed, is what the children would say and feel if they knew they had
been chosen as boys or girls by their parents.'
Edwards himself is the father of five girls, of whom two are non-identical
twins. He would not, however, seek to create twins 'to order'.
We discussed the problems of medical consent and I asked him whether,
paradoxical as it might sound, a child could have rights even before its
conception.
'I am increasingly thinking so. It is quite clear in American law and
increasingly in British law that the foetus has rights.' These rights
'matured' at birth, he explained, and children had been able to sue for
damage in utero, even for 'wrongful birth' if they emerged grossly abnormal.
Do women have a right to bear their own children?
'The right to have a baby is not absolute. There are no absolutes. But I
think the transmission of generations is one of the most fundamental areas
of human activity.'
Our notion of rights and duties has come from the Judaeo-Christian tradition
but in today's secular society it is framed, ultimately, by Parliament.
Edwards said he had been impressed by the sophistication of debates,
especially in the House of Lords.
'I think our democracy does give us the basis for open and fair discussion.
We have to tolerate the newspaper headlines and the pressures. And that, by
the way, is incredibly difficult and exhaust-ing.
'But if you enter a field like this it is part of what you must expect. You
can no longer work in isolation in the laboratory. You must accept the
implications of your own decisions and defend them. It is very wise to take
advice from the ethical committee as soon as possible.'
Have you been accused of bending your ethics to suit your profession?
'As far as I know, the opinions I gave in 1971 and after have not changed at
all. One always fears, being stuck close to a field all one's life, that you
start making decisions that aren't being examined critically enough. You can
get very introverted. So I'm delighted to see the recent debates.'
I asked him to name the things he would never do. Cloning was one. (By
cloning he means not egg-splitting but replicating an existing or deceased
person: 'I've never met anyone in the world who is worth cloning, and that's
been my stock answer for 10 years.')
Another was implanting human embryos in animals. He would also be very wary
of genetically 'typing' foetuses if that meant them being marked down for
abortion. Better, he said, to intervene and attempt to cure the genetic
abnormality.
'I think all of us are striving to improve life, not to do down life.
There's a natural tendency for many people to say No, because they've grown
up in a certain set of circumstances.
'But what amazes me is the intelligence of the ordinary citizen. When it is
explained clearly, they can then ask the same questions we ask.'
We are interfering with nature already, I said finally. Is there some
philosophical absolute here which we call 'the human being' which should not
be further penetrated by medical science?
'We're nowhere near that point yet, if there is a point - nowhere near. The
colour of skin is about the only characteristic you could usefully select.
All the other things about brain, intelligence - these won't come through
molecular biology.
'I don't think the things we can do at the moment are enough to make us
challenge the deep concept of the human because the interference is so
minimal.
'Unfortunately, Man has many deficiencies, diseases and disorders that in my
view do not enhance the value of Man. We have to come to the idea that we
may be able to use all our knowledge to make Man a little better, to avoid
disease, or to confer ability. But, my word, that's when the philosophical
discussion will really start]
'That question will come when we have learned two fundamental steps: how to
put genes into embryos, and how to tell exactly what those genes will do.
And I would say that is probably 100 years away - a lifetime, anyway.'
