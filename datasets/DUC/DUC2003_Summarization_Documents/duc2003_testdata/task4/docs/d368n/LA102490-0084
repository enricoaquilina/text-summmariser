The day after a judge's ruling changed their lives, Mark and Crispina Calvert 
looked to all the world like many other young married couples: He went off to 
work and she stayed home with the baby. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a telling sign that the emotional tumult that spilled into this 
house in the wake of a nationally watched test-tube baby case had not yet 
disappeared -- on a sunny California day, the curtains were drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Crispina Calvert said she is tired of cars full of curiosity seekers pulling to 
a stop outside and craning their necks for a glimpse of the black-haired infant 
who was born into a furious, draining custody fight. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll open the curtains sometime, but I'm not quite ready yet," she told The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Since mid-August, the unique surrogate mother case has hijacked the hearts and 
minds of the Calverts and Anna L. Johnson, the woman they hired to carry their 
embryo, as well as a team of lawyers and a judge. On Monday, Orange County 
Superior Court Judge Richard N. Parslow Jr. handed victory to the Calverts, 
ruling that Johnson had no rights to the boy. Johnson, 29, has vowed to keep 
fighting in the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a ton of bricks has been lifted off my shoulders," Crispina 
Calvert said. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone tried to resume normal lives Tuesday, but signs of the emotional 
firefight lingered. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was "solemn and quiet" Monday but "more talkative" on Tuesday and 
"seemed to be returning more to herself," said her lawyer, Richard C. Gilbert. 
Although Johnson was upset, she anticipated Monday's decision and was 
emotionally prepared for it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who has been on disability from her job as a licensed vocational 
nurse, spent part of Tuesday on the telephone, Gilbert said, looking for a new 
apartment, since she has been staying temporarily in Mission Viejo, and for a 
new job. 
</P>
<P>
He said Johnson has "mixed feelings" about the prospect of returning to work at 
Western Medical Center, where she met Crispina Calvert, a registered nurse. She 
worries how her co-workers might treat her when she returns, and if it will be 
awkward when she runs into Crispina Calvert in the hallways, Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said he was focusing on the future and feeling certain that Johnson 
will win her case in the appeals court. But even as he prepared his appeal 
Tuesday and returned to work on other cases, anger over Monday's ruling seeped 
into his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it was all very predictable, I'm still angry the judge didn't 
follow the law," Gilbert said. "It's a case of the system failing. I'm 
disappointed. But I'm pinning my hopes on the appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert said he drew strength from a visit he made to church Monday with 
Johnson. Gazing at a crucifix for 20 minutes, he said, he realized something 
that seemed to capture the battle he had just fought. 
</P>
<P>
"Was Mary genetically related to Jesus Christ? And yet everyone recognizes that 
Mary is the mother of Christ. Perhaps that was really the first non-genetic 
(parent-child) case. I just knew more than ever that we were right in what we 
were doing." 
</P>
<P>
One of the Calverts' lawyers, Christian R. Van Deusen, took the second half of 
a Mammoth Lakes fishing trip that had been interrupted when the case gained 
momentum. The other, Robert Walmsley, "hit the grindstone" on other cases, 
spending Tuesday in Los Angeles on a contested adoption case and preparing to 
fly out to Stockton and Sacramento on others later this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I was riding on adrenalin, but then when the arguments were done and all we 
could do was wait for the ruling, there was a real letdown, and I got 
depressed," Walmsley said. "Yesterday, I was still shell-shocked, but today I'm 
back." 
</P>
<P>
The baby's court-appointed lawyer, Harold F. LaFlamme, said he had been unable 
to read books -- his favorite leisure pastime -- or sleep much during the 
Calvert case because he was "operating on maximum brainpower." Now it is a 
"relief" to get back to his usual battery of child-abuse cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The infant's court-appointed guardian, William Steiner, said he was "absolutely 
drained" and "close to burnout," even after three decades of working with 
abused and neglected children. He said he was unprepared for the depth of 
emotion involved when three people wanted the same child. 
</P>
<P>
The hallway outside Parslow's fifth-floor courtroom had been overrun with a 
jostling, shouting mob of news media in the last three weeks, but on Tuesday it 
was finally quiet. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the bailiff and I remarked we were not accosted by 45 different press 
people saying, 'When will you open? Can we set up now?' " said Marci Dambert, 
Parslow's clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the courtroom, it was back to business as usual for Parslow as he began 
a new breach-of-contract trial -- this one involving real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The day after his widely publicized decision, Parslow was teased by other 
judges about when his autograph sessions might begin and who did his makeup, 
Dambert said. At the lunch recess, one judge left him a letter that began, 
"Dear Sol . . . ," a sly poke at Parslow for having been likened to King 
Solomon during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The judge himself declined interviews, noting that it would be inappropriate to 
comment because the case is expected to be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't talked much about it," Dambert said of the normally loquacious 
jurist. "He doesn't get involved in the ego side of it. He's not that type of 
judge." 
</P>
<P>
Crispina Calvert said she thinks that even the baby, Christopher, senses the 
post-battle calm. For the first night in weeks, both mother and child slept 
soundly Monday night, she cradling the tiny infant in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
As Parslow read his decision in court Monday, the mother said, she was 
"shaking, and Mark's arm was around me, and I could feel his arm shaking." 
During the trial, she has been so drained that she didn't cook much. Her mother 
and sister came over and cooked instead, she said. But Tuesday night, she was 
back to her old ways, cooking one of her husband's favorite Filipino meals: 
beef with coconut milk, spinach and peanut butter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're finally getting kind of back to normal," she said. "Thank God 
that all that is finished."
