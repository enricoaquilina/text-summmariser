poplar are being grown for fuel

Robert Goodwin is at the cutting edge of farming technology. He is one of
five British farmers involved in a pioneering project to grow willow and
poplar as a fuel crop that is commercially viable and kind to the
environment.
Winter is a busy time on Goodwin's 75-hectare cereal farm in Essex, 50 miles
north-east of London. This is when the one-year-old trees have to be cut
back, or coppiced, so the stumps sprout. The new shoots, which can grow up
to four metres in the first year, will be harvested after two to five years
and turned into woodchips to be burned for electricity.
Coppicing of woodland goes back to the middle ages. But growing tree crops
for fuel on arable land has only taken root in Europe in the past few years.
Sweden, with vast forests and a strong commitment to renewable energy,
already has about 9,000 hectares under commercial production.
Now farmers in the European Union are becoming interested because of the
introduction of compulsory set-aside, under which they can grow non-food
crops without forfeiting subsidies. The National Farmers' Union will debate
the issue at its annual meeting in London today.
Cereals and oilseeds, straw and farm waste are all being tried for fuel. But
arable coppice is seen in Britain as having the greatest potential, in terms
of cost and impact on the environment. The government is funding the Pounds
1.1m five-farm project and last year included coppice in the list of
non-fossil fuels from which electricity companies are obliged to obtain some
of their power.
Goodwin, whose family has grown willow for cricket bats for a century, is
enthusiastic about the new use of the tree. 'As far as its environmental
attractiveness is concerned, I don't see anything coming close to it,' he
says.
Although weed-killer is used to protect the young trees in their first year,
coppice does not need constant applications of agrochemicals during its
30-year lifespan. The nutrients in soil previously used to grow cereals,
coupled with annual leaf fall, can replace fertiliser. Sewage sludge can
also be used, offering one solution to the problem of disposal that will
arise when dumping sludge at sea is banned in 1998.
The trees attract wildlife. 'We have found more than 40 species of bird
within our plantations,' saysGoodwin. 'We wouldn't have seen a fraction of
those under cereal production.' Access is provided for walkers and riders to
open space around the trees, and there should be none of the visual
objections associated with wind turbines.
The burning process is surprisingly clean, too. Coppice releases no more
carbon dioxide when burned than it absorbs during growth, emissions of
nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide are low and the ash can be recycled as
fertiliser. The wood crop produces about 30 times the energy used to grow
and harvest it, compared with an energy ratio of less than two-to-one for
the diesel substitute made from oilseed rape.
Establishing a plantation is currently expensive at Pounds 1,300 or more a
hectare. But grants are available from the Forestry Authority. The
government is also considering encouraging coppice production on fixed
set-aside land by 'rolling up' five years' worth of subsidies into a lump
sum of about Pounds 1,550 a hectare in the first year. The expectation is
that coppice will require little or no financial support once established as
a commercial crop.
With such attractions, many farmers are contemplating coppice as a way of
sustaining rural employment. But most are hesitant until there is a proven
market. That is why a group of farmers and businessmen set up Border
Biofuels in 1992 to build power plants fuelled by woodchips.
The company is applying for a licence for a 5MW plant - enough to supply
electricity to a small town - near St Boswells in the Scottish Borders.
Initially the Pounds 6m plant would burn forestry residue but this would
gradually be replaced by coppice. The company hopes to assemble 30 or more
farmers growing up to 2,000 hectares to supply the plant.
'It's a commercial crop with a margin comparable to cereals, subject to the
market being established,' says Harry Frew, a director. Once coppice took
off, cuttings would become widely available and the high cost to new
entrants of about 10p a cutting could be slashed to 1p or 2p.
Several regional electricity companies are interested as well. South Western
Electricity (Sweb) is applying to build a 2.5MW power plant in Cornwall,
using 18,000 tonnes of dry coppice a year from local growers. It has plans
for three other wood-fuelled plants of 5MW to 10MW in Hampshire, Suffolk and
Northamptonshire.
'We're keen to break this chicken-and-egg situation of no-crop-no-market and
no-market-no-crop,' says Gerry Swarbrick, power resources manager. 'We
believe renewables deserve a chance to demonstrate themselves on a
commercial basis. We expect these technologies will one day stand on their
own two feet.'
There is a long way to go. The UK government aims to stimulate a modest
1,500MW of new electricity-generating capacity from renewable sources by the
end of the decade - about 3 per cent of the country's electricity needs.
Coppice would initially be a tiny part of that, with only about 100 hectares
so far being grown.
But the government-sponsored Renewable Energy Advisory Group presented a
striking vision of its potential as the technology improves. It forecast
that if 2.8m hectares - 16 per cent of agricultural land - were turned over
to coppice by 2010, the energy created could amount to 22 per cent of
electricity consumption.
