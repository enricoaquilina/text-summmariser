  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 22 and 25 March. 
  Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 22 March reports that the 
Matanzas 
sugar industry has fulfilled the sugarcane planting plan for 
March 10 days early. The number of caballerias scheduled to be 
planted in March was 390, but 458 caballerias have been planted. 
Thus, the plan has been surpassed by 17 percent. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 22 March reports that thanks to 
the help of workers from Santiago de Cuba in harvesting 
approximately 17 caballerias planted in plantains, Ciego de 
Avila Province will send 200,000 quintals of plantains to the 
markets of Santiago de Cuba Province this year. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 22 March reports the following: 
  Tourism sector workers in Varadero have donated to the 
public 
health sector more than $17,000 made in tips during February. 
  A solidarity group from northern Italy has made a donation 
to 
Cuba valued at more than $15,000. The donation, which includes 
medicine, powdered milk, soap, and disinfectants, is earmarked 
for polyclinics in Camaguey Province. 
  The German airline LTU announced that it will increase 
tourist flights to Cuba in 1994. LTU is one of the biggest 
airline companies in the world dedicated to tourism. Cuba is one 
of the LTU's most important long distance stops. The company 
markets over 850 rooms at the Tuxpan and Bella Costa Hotels in 
Varadero and at the Carisol and Los Corales complexes in 
Santiago de Cuba. 
  Armando Puello, president of the Dominican Republic's 
tourism 
association, highlighted the increased links between Dominican 
companies and the tourist hub of Santiago de Cuba. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 23 March reports that after six 
years of work, the Cubanacan Travel Agency on 22 March was 
introduced in Havana City as Fantastico, the new name with which 
it will operate as of this date. According to Fausto Garcia 
Diez, manager of this agency which is subordinate to the 
Cubanacan Corporation, the agency aspires to receive no less 
than 300,000 tourists and to collect $11 million in 1994. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 24 March reports that 51 
foreign 
and 184 national companies are participating in the commercial 
fair running from 22 to 27 March at the Convention Palace in 
Havana. The fair seeks to increase the flow of currency in our 
economy and to show the results of joint ventures with foreign 
companies in the spheres of foods, containers, packing, 
refrigeration, and printing equipment. The presence of 
businessmen from 12 countries, among them Brazil, Mexico, and 
Spain, reflects solidarity with Cuba. 
  In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that Cuba has one of 
the lowest fertility rates in the world, despite the fact that 
it has one of the highest wedding rates in Latin America. 
Moreover, the report adds, the prominent Cuban jurist Holga Mesa 
has said that for every 10 births, there are nine abortions in 
Cuba. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 24 March reports that 
because 20 caballerias of tomatoes in the Caujery Valley are 
infected with white blight, the Guantanamo Province tomato 
harvest will be 60,000 quintals less than projected. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 25 March reports that rice, 
cane, and other crops in Sancti Spiritus Province this year will 
receive some 70,000 tons of organic fertilizers known as 
bioearth [bio-tierra] to replace the imported chemical products. 
It adds that the country must produce at least 1 million tons of 
bioearth to be used on agricultural land to reduce the demand 
for industrial fertilizers. Bioearth is a mixture of ash, 
vegetable waste, and microorganisms which increase the amount of 
potassium, phosphorous, and silica in the soil.
