look at Wessex Water's plans to market freeze-dried human waste as soil

Unlikely though it may seem, a combination of European Union regulations and
green consumerism could result in freeze-dried sewage sludge for sale in
supermarkets.
This product idea, based on converting human waste into soil fertiliser, is
a result of the response of Wessex Water, one of Britain's privatised water
companies, to the EU's 1991 urban waste water directive banning dumping of
sewage sludge at sea by the end of 1998.
A third of the 1.1m dry tonnes of sludge produced in Britain was dumped at
sea in 1991; last year, 22 per cent was disposed of in this way.
The directive also demands an increased number of sewage treatment works to
cover coastal towns by 2006. The amount of sludge produced by the treatment
process is expected to double as a result.
The water industry has been forced to develop a number of processes - some
more traditional than others - to deal with the sludge in a way which is
environmentally acceptable and cost-effective. Clive Coombes, a process
scientist with WS Atkins, the UK engineering consultants, wrote in Water
Bulletin, a trade journal, last year: 'Sludge treatment to produce materials
that can be marketed at a profit is something of a Holy Grail for the water
industry.'
Richard Lacey, Wessex Water's divisional manager for waste water, says:
'This is a problem for the whole of the UK water industry. Millions of
pounds are being spent doing something about it.'
Almost half of the UK's sewage sludge is now used to fertilise agricultural
land. Liquid sludge is rich in phosphates and nitrogen. But it has a number
of inherent disadvantages; chief among these are smell, a content that
includes heavy metals and the ability to pollute water courses. It is also,
in its bulky wet form, expensive to transport.
Wessex Water ended 25 years of dumping Bristol's sludge into the sea when it
built a Pounds 7.5m biodrier 18 months ago. The Swiss-built equipment, four
times larger than any other in Europe and the only one on mainland Britain,
dries, pasteurises and sieves the fermenting sludge into odourless,
even-sized granules of one-twentieth the volume.
The drying gases used in the process are recycled, as is 70 per cent of the
heat used. Methane gas is produced by heating the fermenting sludge. The
surplus energy created from this is sold to the national grid under the
non-fossil fuel obligation, earning Wessex Water an estimated Pounds 1m a
year.
The biodrier now produces between 30 and 40 tonnes of granules a day from 45
per cent of all Wessex Water's liquid sludge. The process means the end
product is easy to transport. The company has reduced its lorry loads of
sludge per year from 150,000 pre-biodrier to 100,000.
Most of Biogran, the name of the granules, is sold for use on agricultural
land, but purchasers also include the Forestry Commission, British Coal (for
use on land reclamation sites) and golf courses. In one of Wessex Water's
promotional pictures, a group of golfers happily putt away while sludge is
spread on the course.
At a cost of approximately Pounds 100 per tonne of Biogran, Wessex Water
intends to make a good return on its initial investment. To help it do so,
the company aims to branch out into the horticultural and domestic markets.
It is holding talks with the Department of the Environment and the European
Commission to redesignate the product as suitable for these markets.
Biogran's use is currently controlled, along with other sludge products, by
the UK department's sewage to agricultural land regulations.
According to Lacey, the biodrier process changes the nature of the sludge
'beyond all recognition'. Samples are currently being tested in Brussels,
and Lacey says he hopes for a decision on the redesignation by the summer.
The company even plans to apply for an ecolabel, a badge of environmental
approval for supermarket-type goods awarded by the UK ecolabelling board and
replicated throughout the EU.
'We feel that we've entered the easier markets, so to speak, and have been
successful. Now we want a chance to enter the harder horticultural and
domestic markets,' says Lacey.
So far, Wessex Water has built only one other biodrier for a water authority
in Jersey, one of the Channel Islands. Other water companies have developed
different methods to meet the EU directive.
Environment department estimates suggest that incineration will increase by
the largest percentage after the sea option is no longer available. Thames
Water awarded contracts valued at Pounds 125m last month for two
incinerators to deal with the 4m tonnes of sludge being disposed of in the
North Sea. The company said that deployment of the sludge to agricultural
land was limited because of the lack of available land within the Thames
region.
At Anglian Water, trials involving composting the sludge with other
biodegradable materials such as vegetable or 'green' waste are taking place.
Peter Matthews, director of water services at Anglian, is an adviser to the
Japanese sewage works association. He says that while technology there -
able to convert sludge into material suitable for jewellery - is impressive,
it is suitable only for large conurbations such as Tokyo. The Japanese, he
says, are envious of the British capacity for sludge recycling on to the
land. 'In this country, we have very good opportunities for doing other
land-based things with sludge.'
