farming on trial - Alison Maitland reports on Rhone-Poulenc's 10-year
experiment in producing crops without chemicals

When Rhone-Poulenc, one of Europe's largest agrochemicals groups, started an
experiment in organic farming at its research base in Essex, the public
response was understandably sceptical. Alongside laboratories testing 10,000
herbicide components a year was a project designed to demonstrate
scientifically whether farming without chemicals could be profitable,
effective and good for the environment.
Five years into the experiment, Mr Lister Noble, manager of the 57-hectare
Boarded Barns Farm, is as conscious as ever of the need for credibility as
he unveils the first detailed conclusions of the 10-year comparison with
conventionally-grown cereal crops.
'If I haven't got my heart in it, then there's no comparison. I do really
want to make the organic side pay,' he says.
Driving round the site, Rhone-Poulenc's only commercial farm, Mr Noble
bubbles with enthusiasm at the progress of the organic wheat and oats. The
land had to be left uncultivated for two years before organic cropping could
begin, to remove all traces of chemicals. So this year's grain harvest will
be only the third, even though the project began in 1989.
'This year is the first year that we're starting to see trends and drawing
observations,' he says.
The organic crops appear less regimented and slightly less robust than their
conventional rivals in five neighbouring fields on the farm, which has a
predominantly chalky boulder clay soil topped by a medium-heavy loam.
However, Mr Noble says weeds have not been as big a problem as he feared.
Organic wheat production, although well below the conventional yield of
about eight tonnes a hectare, was better than he expected. 'I thought the
first organic crop was going to be really weedy but it wasn't. It yielded
over five tonnes a hectare, which is rated with some of the best organic
yields in the UK.'
Second year yields were almost as good, but the protein level was too low to
qualify the wheat for bread making. Mr Noble attributes this to a lack of
nitrogen in the soil. H used pelleted chicken feather manure and seaweed
extract to fertilise the soil in the first year but abandoned that in the
second on the advice of some organic experts. Now he is considering using it
again to improve the quality - and saleability - of the wheat.
Since one of the biggest difficulties with organic farming is low soil
fertility, he is particularly pleased that new regulations from Brussels
allow organic farmers to grow clover - a rich soil nutrient - on land they
are paid to set aside from arable production. This will prove an economical
way of increasing nitrogen levels during rotations between cereal crops.
Every aspect of the project is being monitored by outside experts, ranging
from university research departments to Adas, the government's farm advisory
service, and the British Trust for Ornithology.
To demonstrate impartiality, Mr Noble asked Elm Farm, the research arm of
the Soil Association, Britain's leading organic campaign body, to choose the
five fields for the organic experiment.
Independent experts have analysed and tasted bread made from the two types
of wheat. They found no differences in the calorific value of the breads,
although the organic wholemeal loaves did not rise as well and textures and
flavours differed. As far as environmental effects are concerned, different
species of spider have been found in the organic fields and more bird
species on the farm generally, but it is too early to draw clear
conclusions.
That is not the case when it comes to profitability. The average annual cost
of producing organic wheat at Boarded Barns Farm has been nearly Pounds 17
higher a tonne than for the conventional wheat over the past five years.
The project involved start-up costs for separate machinery such as a Pounds
14,000 sprayer to ensure no chemicals are sprayed by accident on to the
organic crops. In addition, loss of young crops to pests, disease and
weeding machinery means that organic seed must be applied at 250kg a
hectare, compared with 180kg on conventional fields.
However, the variable costs of the organic wheat crop in 1992 and 1993, such
as seed, fertiliser, machinery and hired labour, proved lower than those of
the conventional crop. The really costly problem is having to leave fields
uncropped during conversion to organic methods and again between crops, to
restore soil fertility. Mr Noble converted the fields gradually, keeping
some under conventional crops for the first two years to boost gross
margins. 'The organic side would have looked pretty sick (financially) if we
hadn't included the conventional crops,' he says.
Even so, the organic side of the farm has produced a cumulative gross margin
 -the value of output less variable costs - of only Pounds 2,557 a hectare
since 1989 compared with Pounds 5,487 from the conventional side.
'There's got to be a massive subsidy to make this farm pay, growing organic
crops,' Mr Noble concludes. Britain, unlike other European countries such as
Germany, does not pay state subsidies to existing organic farmers, although
the government is implementing a Pounds 1.5m-a-year scheme in August to
encourage conventional farmers to convert to organic.
Mr Noble himself favours 'taking the best of both (organic and conventional)
systems.' He believes lessons can be learned by conventional farmers from
the organic experiment, such as its use of a weeding machine which acts like
a giant rake, lifting young weeds out of the soil before they have a chance
to root firmly. This aerates the soil and loosens the surface, helping to
release plant nutrients. 'On a conventional farm, they could use this if
there's not a high weed population. If it doesn't work, they could then use
a herbicide.'
The experiment may continue beyond 10 years, Mr Noble says. 'We might find
there's mileage in it.' Rhone-Poulenc has clearly seen which way the wind is
blowing. It is developing agrochemicals with low active ingredients and
pesticides that attack specific targets. Another idea being pursued is for a
protective dressing to be applied to seeds so that the crop they produce
does not need to be sprayed.
The group is also making diagnostic kits to help farmers decide the precise
timing and levels of spray in environmentally sensitive areas. According to
Mr Noble: 'If the farmer wants to use fewer inputs, he will need quite a lot
of advice and help.'
