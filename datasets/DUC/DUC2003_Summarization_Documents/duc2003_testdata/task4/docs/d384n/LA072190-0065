The proposed U.S. space station will begin to wear out while being built, 
requiring an unrealistic number of spacewalks for repairs before astronauts are 
even aboard to do them, a NASA study released Friday said. 
</P>
<P>
The findings raise questions about the feasibility of the proposed $30-billion 
space station, seen as the centerpiece of NASA's future space program, at a 
time when the space agency is already reeling from a series of setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
But space station director Richard Kohrs said he was confident the agency could 
overcome the potential problem and reduce the need for maintenance to a more 
realistic level. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident we'll get it down. It's going to take us two or three months but 
we . . . will be well within reason," Kohrs said. 
</P>
<P>
John Pike of the American Federation of Scientists was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they still have some serious unsolved problems that they're going to 
have to solve before they get the show on the road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
NASA is already under fire because the space shuttle fleet has been grounded by 
fuel leaks and a defect in the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope has blurred 
the observatory's potentially revolutionary view of the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
The blunders have triggered a storm of criticism in Congress, which is 
considering NASA's $15-billion proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hopes to begin building the 
500-foot-long space station Freedom in 1996 or 1997 as an orbiting outpost 
where astronauts can conduct scientific experiments and stage exploration into 
the solar system.
