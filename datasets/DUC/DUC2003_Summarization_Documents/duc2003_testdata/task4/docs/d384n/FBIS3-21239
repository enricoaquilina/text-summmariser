<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  The first flight of the U.S. space shuttle in April, 1981, 
heralded the era of winged space transfer and return vehicles. 
This successful flight spurred the research and development of 
winged transfer and return vehicles in various other countries 
and led to the launching of Buran by the former Soviet Union and 
the research and development of Hermes in Europe. 
  There are two conceivable types of space transfer and return 
vehicles--the winged type and the capsule type. The winged type 
is more effective when operation flexibility is required in 
missions, such as conducting experiments with large-sized 
equipment or quickly and accurately retrieving flying objects 
that elude high gravity loads. 
  Japan started research on a winged transfer and return 
vehicle around 1986 and has compiled the concept of its own 
unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle launched by an 
expendable launch vehicle, commonly called HOPE: H-II Orbiting 
Plane. 
  HOPE will be unmanned, have wings and be launched with an 
H-II launch vehicle or an H-II derivative launch vehicle. It 
will repair and refuel artificial satellites in space, conduct 
various kinds of experiments and observations utilizing the 
space environment, and transport materials to and retrieve 
materials from the Space Station. After carrying out various 
kinds of tasks, HOPE will reenter the atmosphere and land on the 
earth horizontally just as airplanes do. 
<H3>  Report of the Advisory Panel on Space Transfer and Return 
Systems in the Space Activities Commission </H3>
  The Space Activities Commission approved on 20 July 1993, a 
report compiled by the Advisory Panel on Space Transfer and 
Return Systems (Chairman: Shigebumi Saito, Professor Emeritus at 
the University of Tokyo), calling for the research and 
development of such an unmanned winged transfer and return 
vehicle. 
  The advisory panel was set up by the Commission in June last 
year to study and discuss Japan's future policy for the research 
and development of space transfer and return systems. The Panel 
comprises 25 experts not only in the field of aeronautics and 
space, but also in other disrelated fields, including economics 
and law. The Panel has held five meetings beginning in November 
last year. 
  The following are the recommendations of the advisory panel 
in their report: 
<H5>  (1) Significance of Space Development </H5>
  The development of outer space within the range of the earth 
is man's exploration of future resources. The scientific 
activities in space to uncover the truth herald a new era for 
civilization and will bring more richness. 
  It is necessary for Japan, as an economic superpower and a 
science and technology power, to play an active part in the 
tackling of space development to fully utilize outer space 
within the range of the earth and thus contributing to 
international society. 
<H3>  (2) Significance and Necessity of Space Transfer and Return 
System </H3>
  The space transfer and return system is the base of space 
infrastructure, which is a basic system that is capable of 
handling a wide variety of missions. An infrastructure is 
necessary for efficient and flexible space development 
activities. 
  The transfer and return system is necessary for the service 
on orbits such as the verification, repair, re-supply, 
replacement and retrieval of satellites. The system is also 
needed to conduct experiments and observation, utilizing the 
space environment, and to transport cargo to a space station. 
The system is indispensable for Japan's stable implementation of 
space development activities in outer space within the range of 
the earth. 
  The research and development of such a system will largely 
contribute to the maintenance and development of transport 
technology, which is the keystone of space activities, as well 
as to the promotion of science and technology. 
<H3>  (3) Basic Concept of Research and Development of the 
Japanese Space Transfer and Return System </H3>
  It is important to promote the research and development of 
HOPE for practical purposes, this being an unmanned winged 
transfer and return vehicle launched by an expendable launch 
vehicle, in the early 21st century. The needs for the transfer 
and return of cargo in space are likely to increase in the early 
2000s. Today, no other country is capable of providing an 
unmanned transfer and return system. Japan could build its own 
unique status in the world's space activities by the development 
of the unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle HOPE. 
Furthermore, the unmanned winged transfer and return vehicle 
technology could ensure Japan's steady development of space 
technology for the future as basic technology for a manned 
transfer and return vehicle, a fully re-usable transport system 
and a space plane. 
<H5>  (4) Concrete Policy of Research and Development </H5>
  As a basic policy, Japan should divide the plans into two 
phases: the first stage is for the flight experiment R&amp;D 
plan; 
the second stage is for the development plan for practical use. 
At the first stage, it should be accomplished to acquire the key 
technology for HOPE within this century through the flight of 
the space re-entry flight experiment vehicle commonly called 
HOPE-X: HOPE-Experiment, which would enable Japan to establish 
the technology in the phases of launching, re-entering and 
landing. At the second stage, it should be accomplished to 
develop HOPE by means of adding the necessary mission 
capabilities after the first stage. The shift to the second 
stage should be strictly scrutinized by the Space Activities 
Commission, which should make policy judgment by fully checking 
technical achievement in the first stage. 
  The key roles in the research and development of the 
unmanned 
winged transfer and return vehicle should be played jointly by 
the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) and the National Space 
Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). 
<H5>  Outline of HOPE </H5>
  The winged transfer and return vehicle HOPE will be operated 
unmanned in whole processes, beginning with its launching, 
followed by entry into orbit, change of orbit, de-orbiting, 
returning and landing. 
  NASDA plans to set the gross weight of HOPE, to be launched 
by an H-II derivative launch vehicle, at about 20 tons. NASDA 
says HOPE should be able to transfer three to five tons of cargo 
to and from the Space Station, etc. 
  The dry weight of the HOPE vehicle, subtracting the weight 
of 
propellant and cargo from the gross weight, will be set at about 
ten tons and the vehicle structure weight, including heat 
protection materials, will be at about five tons. 
  The length of HOPE will be about 15 meters, the width of its 
wings about ten meters and its fuselage will have a diameter of 
about three meters. Tip fins with a height of about three meters 
will be installed at both ends of the main wings. 
  HOPE's total flight time, beginning with its launch followed 
by its stay in the orbit and ending with the landing, will be 
between four to seven days. 
  At the time of return, HOPE will de-orbit, using an orbit 
changing engine, reenter the atmosphere at an altitude of about 
120 kilometers and go through the aerodynamic heating control 
and balanced gliding phases. Adjusting its energy, the vehicle 
will finally reach the landing strip. 
  Two practical HOPE planes would be operated, and each would 
be launched once a year and would have a life of ten years. 
  Needed to develop HOPE are the aerodynamic technology to 
determine a vehicle shape that is able to cope with all speeds 
from hyper-sonic to low speed and the heat structure technology 
to endure aerodynamic heating at the time of reentry into the 
atmosphere. Also needed are guidance control technology for the 
automatic navigation of HOPE in all flight processes and the 
technology of long-life propulsion. Finally, a system technology 
to balance and combine the above is needed. 
  Therefore, as the first stage Japan is studying plans to 
develop critical technology and to conduct an orbital reentry 
experiment (OREX), automatic landing flight experiment (ALFLEX) 
and hyper-sonic flight experiment (HYFLEX), using small models 
to verify developed technology. Following the three kinds of 
flight tests, a flight test using an actual sized experimental 
model (HOPE-X) is planned as the goal of the first stage. 
<H5>  Postscript </H5>
  The establishment of the space transfer and return system 
is, 
thus, indispensable for Japan's future space activities and its 
contribution to the international society in the space 
development field. 
  The Science and Technology Agency, on the basis of the 
report 
compiled by the Advisory Panel on Space Transfer and Return 
System, is to promote research and development, aiming at 
putting into practical use the unmanned winged transfer and 
return vehicle HOPE, launched by an expendable launch vehicle in 
the early 21st century.
