  [Text] Tehran, May 22 (AFP) -- An Iranian delegation is to 
visit Iraq on June 11 to discuss the fate of POWs from the 
1980-1988 war, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati said. 
  Velayati, quoted on Sunday by ETELLA'AT newspaper, said the 
visit was initially scheduled to take place next week, but that 
it had been postponed at the request of Baghdad. The minister 
did not say whether or not he would be heading the delegation. 
  Tehran radio said on May 4 that Velayati was preparing a 
trip 
to Iraq to discuss bilateral ties and the fate of thousands of 
prisoners of war from both countries. If the visit takes place, 
it would be the first by Velayati to Iraq since the 1991 Gulf 
War, when U.S.-led forces drove Iraqi troops from Kuwait. 
  The POW issue is the main obstacle to improved relations 
between the two neighbors. Tehran says Iraq is still holding 
8,000 of its citizens, military and civilian, including soldiers 
captured almost 20 years ago in border skirmishes. But Iraq has 
denied holding any and claims 20,000 of its own troops are being 
held in Iran. 
  Iran said last week that Iraq had freed three Iranian 
prisoners, the first such release in two years. Iran has 
unilaterally released hundreds of Iraqi POWs during the past two 
years.
