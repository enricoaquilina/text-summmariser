THE allied air attack on southern Iraq yesterday comes as Baghdad was
showing unmistakable signs of renewed military confidence. There have been
intensive efforts to repair the damage done to the country's armed forces
and defensive infrastructure by the US-led coalition two years ago.
Western experts say lack of access to spares and new equipment has precluded
a recovery of military firepower, in sharp contrast to the build-up of new
Russian and other weapons in neighbouring Iran.
However, President Saddam Hussein is thought to have given high priority to
rebuilding Iraq's shattered network of air defences.
Even at the expense of sustaining further damage, Mr Saddam would relish the
propaganda benefit both internally and in the Arab world if his forces
succeeded in shooting down attacking US, British or French aircraft.
Experts do not believe he is contemplating a large-scale military
engagement. In spite of rhetoric from Baghdad suggesting renewed ambitions
over Kuwait, there has been no evidence of force movements to suggest any
such drastic step.
Mr David Bolton, director of the London-based Royal United Services
Institute for Defence Studies, said that in the run-up to yesterday's raids
President Saddam appeared to be aiming at gaining support among other
Islamic states by provoking the US and its allies into making an attack on
questionable authority.
Alternatively, if the coalition forces had decided against an attack, his
calculation was that he could influence neighbouring countries by a show of
political strength.
Either way, Mr Bolton said, President Saddam's tactic was above all an
attempt to undermine the sanctions regime and avert further economic
decline, which could threaten his own survival.
Iraq has been unable to replace the heavy equipment destroyed by allied
bombing in early 1991 or captured at the end of the war. These included some
3,000 tanks, more than 1,800 armoured vehicles and more than 2,100 artillery
pieces. Under the ceasefire terms, it had to submit lists of stocks and
equipment relating to its chemical, biological and nuclear weapon programmes
as well as ballistic missiles with ranges of more than 90 miles.
All these have been in the process of destruction. But Iraq is suspected by
western intelligence of hiding Scud-B missiles from the inspectors. It
initially declared holdings of 52 missiles - all but one being longer-range
Al-Hussein variants of the Scud - and subsequently admitted to a further 92.
Iraq bought more than 800 Scuds from the Soviet Union during its 1980-88 war
with Iran. It is uncertain how many it had left after that war and the 1991
Scud attacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia, especially since a number were
cannibalised to build the extended-range versions.
However, some analysts think it is unlikely President Saddam would resort to
using Scuds. That would instantly betray a breach of UN terms and reinforce
the legitimacy of any attack on him.
Iraqi armed forces have been regrouped. The military leadership has been
reshuffled and the army streamlined into about 30 armoured, mechanised and
infantry divisions, compared with more than 50 at the time of the 1990-91
Gulf crisis.
The country is still reckoned to have some 2,000 battle tanks and 2,000
artillery weapons, including Brazilian-made rocket launchers. Up to half of
Iraqi land forces are currently believed to be deployed in the north of the
country.
In air strength it clearly remains extremely vulnerable.
More than 100 of its combat aircraft were destroyed on the ground in the
1991 war, 35 were lost in combat and 112 went to Iran and have not been
returned.
It is left with about 300-350 fixed-wing combat aircraft including some
capable fighters such as the Mirage F-1 and MiG-29 but mostly of older
vintage and in poor condition. They are no match for the western aircraft
deployed in Saudi Arabia, aboard the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk in the
Gulf and in south-eastern Turkey.
Iraq has, however, no lack of airfields to operate from. It has about 30-40
major air bases, has done a lot of work to repair bomb damage and has
started to rebuild hardened aircraft shelters targeted by allied precision
bombers.
Military communications and other infrastructure have also been restored.
Stocks built up before the 1991 war are thought to have been used to rebuild
air defences.
Iraq has large numbers of anti-aircraft guns - some 5,500, according to the
International Institute for Strategic Studies - and the allies are
considered unlikely this time round to run the risk of low-level attacks.
The Iraqis also possess sizeable stocks of mostly Soviet-supplied air
defence missiles, although many of these are of 1960s vintage.
These include the batteries that recently provoked wrath at the UN when Iraq
deployed them in the no-fly zone patrolled by western aircraft south of the
32nd parallel.
