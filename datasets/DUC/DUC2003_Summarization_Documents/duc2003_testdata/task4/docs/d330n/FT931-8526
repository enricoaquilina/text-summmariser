A UN inspection team yesterday made a surprise visit to an undeclared
military factory south of Baghdad and said it had gathered fresh information
on Iraq's ballistic missile programme, Reuter reports from Baghdad.
'We had a very busy day. We collected a very good deal of information,' Mr
Patrice Palanque, the team leader, said.
He did not say exactly where the factory was but he added: 'This is a new
site. To my knowledge it was not visited before (by previous UN inspection
teams).'
It was Mr Palanque's fifth day in the field checking if materials produced
by Iraq military factories breached the terms of the Gulf war ceasefire.
Mr Mark Silver, Mr Palanque's deputy, said that while they were inspecting
the factory on the ground, UN helicopters watched the site closely from
above.
Neither gave details of the new information but said it might fill gaps in
their knowledge of Iraqi missiles.
Under Gulf war ceasefire terms, Iraq is allowed to keep only missiles with a
range shorter than 150km. The rest will have to be scrapped along with the
means to produce them.
Mr Palanque and his 13-member team arrived in Baghdad on Friday to check
that Iraq is not storing or secretly producing missiles which are prohibited
under the ceasefire terms.
Iran said 1,000 Iraqi military men who fled to its territory during the 1991
Gulf war would return home today.
Iran's official IRNA news agency said the Middle East representative of the
International Committee of the Red Cross had been informed of the planned
repatriation.
IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said 400 Iraqi military men returned home from
Iran in November.
It did not say if either group included pilots of scores of Iraqi aircraft,
including advanced fighters and bombers, which flew to Iran for safety when
US-led allies launched air and missile attacks on Iraq to force it to pull
out of Kuwait.
Iran, which fought Iraq from 1980 to 1988, remained neutral in the Gulf war.
