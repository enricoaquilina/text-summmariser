NEW THEORY MAY BURST SOME COSMIC BUBBLES; 
</P>

ASTRONOMY: PRINCETON SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THEY HAVE SOLVED THE BAFFLING MYSTERY 
OF SOME GIANT STRUCTURES IN THE UNIVERSE. IT'S A MATTER OF SIMPLE GRAVITY, THEY 
SAY.

In recent years, scientists have been baffled by the discovery of huge bubbles 
in the universe that seem to be devoid of matter and by giant walls of galaxies 
that stretch on for hundreds of millions of light-years. No one could determine 
what mysterious forces would have created such giant structures. 
</P>
<P>
Some theorists have suggested that massive explosions might have swept some 
areas clean, creating the bubbles and pushing matter together to form great 
walls of galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists at Princeton University believe they now have the answer. Aided 
by a powerful computer, they have concluded that nothing more than gravity was 
needed to form the great structures that astronomers are now finding throughout 
the universe. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no violent pumping of energy into the early universe" to create the 
features, astrophysicist J. Richard Gott said in a telephone interview. He said 
research he has conducted with his graduate student, Changbom Park, shows that 
gravity, acting on very slight fluctuations in the distribution of matter a 
fraction of a second after the Big Bang, would account for the great structures 
now seen in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
"Gravity works very quietly," Gott said. "It just takes time." 
</P>
<P>
The finding could prove anticlimactic for scientists who have searched for an 
exotic explanation for the huge voids, which have tantalized the world of 
astronomy ever since they were discovered four years ago. The discovery of the 
bubbles was hailed literally around the world by the popular press as well as 
scientific journals because it suggested that something terribly mysterious had 
happened in the earliest universe, creating giant structures that staggered the 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
But if the Princeton team is correct, it was nothing more than the normal 
functioning of one of the four fundamental forces of nature. 
</P>
<P>
During the lifetime of the universe, simple gravity would have caused small 
pockets of matter to accumulate other particles, growing into stars and 
clusters of stars and even great walls of galaxies such as one discovered last 
year that is more than half a billion light-years long. 
</P>
<P>
By simulating the accretion of matter over the lifetime of the universe, Gott 
and Park have created computer images that are remarkably similar to 
observational data from astronomers in the field. Their work is being published 
today in the British scientific journal of the Royal Astronomical Society. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is the credibility of the basic cosmological models that theorists 
have used for years to comprehend the universe. Gott's findings fit nicely with 
current theories. If he is wrong, theorists will have to come up with a new 
explanation for why a universe that began as a tightly compacted -- and 
presumably homogeneous -- primordial soup would have led to the development of 
such irregular structures as scientists are now finding. 
</P>
<P>
Other scientists who are using computers to try to simulate the evolution of 
the universe tend to grant the Princeton research considerable credibility, but 
not everyone is convinced. 
</P>
<P>
"I retain some healthy skepticism," said astrophysicist Margaret Geller, who 
along with John Huchra of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in 
Cambridge discovered the "bubbles" several years ago and the "Great Wall" of 
galaxies announced last November. Geller said in a telephone interview that she 
had seen some of Gott's earlier work and she does not think the images emerging 
from his computer match the observational data. 
</P>
<P>
Edmund Bertschinger of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has 
carried out research similar to Gott's but on a smaller scale, also remains a 
little skeptical but believes the great mystery may well be much closer to 
being resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the Princeton work) should be treated as preliminary because nobody else 
has done a simulation this large," Bertschinger said. "But it's interesting 
work and it suggests that gravity is capable of making more complicated 
structures than we had thought." 
</P>
<P>
Gott insisted that his findings also fit nicely with the first results from the 
Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), a spacecraft launched in November to study 
the background radiation left over from the Big Bang. One of the things COBE is 
looking for is evidence of cataclysmic events like energy-releasing explosions 
that could have swept particles from the Big Bang into tighter formations, 
leading eventually to the formation of such things as galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
The first results from COBE, released in mid-January, showed no trace of such 
events. 
</P>
<P>
And that has puzzled scientists who had expected COBE to find some evidence of 
extraordinary events in the background radiation left over from the Big Bang. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm completely mystified (by) how the present-day structure has come to exist 
without having left some trace," John C. Mather of NASA's Goddard Space Flight 
Center said in announcing the first results during the winter meeting of the 
American Astronomical Society in Arlington, Va. "There should have been some 
kind of energy release (after the Big Bang). But there isn't anything there." 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't necessary, Gott said this week, because his research shows that 
gravity alone could have led to the formation of structures like the Great 
Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not at all surprised by COBE," he said. "It is just what I would have 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
Gott's research is based on the assumption that even in the earliest universe 
there would have been some slight fluctuation in the concentration of matter. 
At least one part in every 200,000 should have been a little different, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"These (fluctuations) led to density fluctuations that can start to grow and 
they keep growing" because some areas would have slightly higher mass -- and 
thus stronger gravitational pull -- than others," Gott said. 
</P>
<P>
Gott and Park used the Princeton computer to simulate what would have happened 
if the earliest universe had had even slight fluctuations in density. 
</P>
<P>
The computer was told to simulate the effect of gravity on 4 million particles 
over a slice of the universe 2 billion light-years across. The data included 
slight fluctuations in density, and the computer was programmed to follow the 
evolution of the particles for the equivalent of 13 billion years. It took the 
computer 14 hours to complete the task. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the simulated universe had reached the theoretical age of today's 
universe, the computer was spitting out images that Gott says "look 
astonishingly like the observations" of Geller and Huchra. 
</P>
<P>
While the Princeton findings are not as exotic as some theories offered by 
other cosmologists, the end result is "wonderful," Gott said. 
</P>
<P>
"It means these superclusters (of galaxies) are fossil remnants of the pattern 
of fluctuations that existed in the early universe," he said. "It's our 
earliest look back at the beginning of the universe."
