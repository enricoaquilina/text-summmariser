Four European science organisations are joining forces to put on Cosmorama,
a touring exhibition which will visit 20 countries over four years from
1993.
'Our aim is to represent in one single exhibition man's present knowledge of
the universe,' says Brian Southworth of Cern, the European Particle Physics
Laboratory, who is chairman of the organising committee.
'We want to show all our delight at the things we already know and all the
mystery of the things we do not yet know.'
Cosmorama will contain large animated displays - Inside the Big Bang, Inside
the Milky Way, Inside the Solar System and Inside the Living Cell - to
represent the work of the four organisations: Cern, ESO (European Southern
Observatory), ESA (European Space Agency) and EMBL (European Molecular
Biology Laboratory).
There will also be operating scientific instruments, including spark
chambers to reveal the cosmic rays irradiating the earth. 'But we are making
the presentation of the laboratories themselves secondary to the overall
scientific aim of the exhibition,' Southworth says.
Nigel Calder, a well-known British science writer, has written the storyline
to knit everything together. Visitors will be directed around the exhibition
in their local language, with Calder's commentary transmitted by infra-red
to individual headsets.
The budget for the exhibition and its touring expenses will be about Pounds
2m, which the organisers hope to raise mainly from corporate sponsors. The
20 host cities will spend an extra Pounds 2.5m to meet local costs.
Cosmorama's tour is scheduled to start at the Heureka Science Centre near
Helsinki in March 1993 and finish in Moscow four years later. Its UK visit -
to Birmingham - will be in mid-1994. Three 13-metre vehicles, nicknamed the
Spacetrain, will move it from city to city.
The exhibition will spend six weeks at each venue and will be updated
continuously to feature new discoveries - for example a comet founded by ESO
astronomers or a genetic discovery at EMBL.
The organisers estimate that 1.5m people will visit the show.
