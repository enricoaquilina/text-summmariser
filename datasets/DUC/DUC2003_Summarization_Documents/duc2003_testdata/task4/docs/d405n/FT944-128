The Hubble Space Telescope - previously derided as a Dollars 2.5bn white
elephant in orbit - is redeeming its reputation in spectacular fashion. The
images sent back this year, after astronauts repaired the telescope's
defective mirror, show a myriad of astronomical objects too distant to be
seen with the most powerful Earth-bound observatories.
Hubble's latest observations have thrown cosmologists into a spin, because
they appear to contradict the leading theory for the origin and development
of the universe. Most troubling is their implication that the universe is
only 8bn years old, when many astronomers are confident from other evidence
that the oldest stars have been shining for about 15bn years.
Of course the universe cannot be younger than the stars in it. So, if
further observations confirm these findings, cosmologists will have to
change their views of the universe's birth in a cosmic fireball - the Big
Bang - and its subsequent expansion.
The basic idea of the Big Bang - that everything has grown from an
infinitely small point containing an unimaginably large amount of energy -
is not under serious threat.
But other popular concepts of contemporary cosmology may not survive. One is
the 'flat universe' containing just enough matter for gravity eventually to
stop it expanding but too little to pull everything back together again in a
Big Crunch. The latest Hubble observations are likely to revive support for
the less dense 'open universe' model, in which things will fly apart rapidly
for ever.
They may even tempt scientists to reconsider the idea, originally put
forward by Albert Einstein, of a 'cosmological constant'. This is a fudge
factor, hated and rejected by most cosmologists because they cannot give it
any theoretical foundation, which would counteract the force of gravity and
push the universe apart more rapidly with time.
The Hubble observations are the first phase of an international programme to
assess the scale, size and age of the universe with the space telescope. The
research team found 20 individual stars of a type called Cepheid variables
in the distant M100 galaxy. Astronomers use such stars as 'standard candles'
for measuring interstellar distances, because they pulsate with a frequency
that depends directly on their intrinsic brightness.
By comparing this absolute brightness with the star's apparent brightness
when seen from Earth, the astronomers can estimate its distance - 56m
light-years in the case of the M100 galaxy. They combine this figure with
the star's 'red shift', which shows how fast it is moving away from us, to
calculate Hubble's Constant, the rate at which the universe is expanding.
Finally, to estimate the universe's age, they must adjust the rate for any
deceleration or acceleration since its formation.
The age of 8bn years is derived from the observations by standard
cosmological theory. It can be pushed back by another 3bn years by giving
the universe a very low density (though this might contradict other
astronomical observations). But an age of 15bn years to match the oldest
stars would require an accelerating force - Einstein's dreaded cosmological
constant.
Scientists have reacted very cautiously to the findings, published at the
end of October in the journal Nature - so cautiously that Nature attacked
their silence in an editorial a month later. 'Cosmologists had better say
something,' the journal said.
However, cosmologists themselves say they are waiting for more Hubble
observations, using 'standard candles' in other distant galaxies, to confirm
the first results and reduce their margin of error.
'Within a year or two, we ought to have a more definite measurement,' says
Sir Martin Rees of Cambridge University, Britain's new Astronomer-Royal. 'If
it turns out that there is still a big discrepancy with the age of the
oldest stars, then cosmologists will have problems maintaining their
standard theory of the universe.'
The universe's age is the most controversial issue addressed so far with the
Hubble telescope. But the bus-sized instrument has taken many more
spectacular pictures through its new corrective lenses.
Some of the best shots, released this month by the US space agency Nasa,
show parts of the universe billions of light years away - and therefore
billions of years in the past. They reveal for the first time the shape of
galaxies emerging in the young universe.
'There is a menagerie of strange objects that have no counterpart in today's
universe,' said Mark Dickinson of the Space Telescope Science Institute in
Baltimore. Most of the stars are arranged in disorganised groups that look
like torn fragments of present-day spiral galaxies but may in fact be their
precursors. Confusingly, mature elliptical galaxies also seem to have
existed within 2bn years of the Big Bang, very similar to today's.
Although it is far too soon for cosmologists to have made sense of the
primeval galactic menagerie, this new evidence suggests that galaxies
started to form very early in the life of the universe. If so, it will lend
more support to the idea of a low-density open universe with a less even
distribution of matter than the popular 'flat universe' model.
Yet another fragment of Hubble evidence in favour of a an ever expanding
universe came in November, when astronomers published the results of a
search for small dim stars, too faint to be seen from Earth, which they
thought might make up some of the universe's 'missing mass'. They found far
fewer than expected.
Unless a space gremlin strikes, Hubble will provide another stunning set of
observations during 1995. The age of the universe should be clearer a year
from now, but the telescope will probably have thrown up another conundrum
by then to silence the cosmologists.
