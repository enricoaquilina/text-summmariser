<F P=106> [Report by Marc Deger: "GATT: Employers Organization Wants </F>
To Extend Social Clause"] 
  [Text] On the eve of the launch of the World Trade 
Organization [WTO], French employers are discussing the urgent 
need for the introduction of a social clause into the principles 
governing international trade. 
  "The mere prospect of the PRC joining GATT and then the WTO 
in the near future makes the solution of this problem a matter 
of the utmost urgency," Francois de Laage de Meux, president of 
the CNPF [National Council of French Employers] International 
Commission, stresses. 
  Although the establishment of the future WTO, which should 
replace GATT by 1 July 1995 at the latest according to the final 
act of the Uruguay Round, has gained political acceptance, its 
sphere of competence still has to be defined. 
<H5>  Governing the "Fairness of Trade" </H5>
  Gerard Longuet [the foreign trade and industry minister] 
said 
at the last cabinet meeting that "during the Marrakesh 
conference, France will pay particular attention to including on 
the WTO's agenda all questions which may have an impact on the 
fairness of trade." 
  Indeed there are four such questions: environmental 
protection, social clause, monetary parity, and unfair 
competition. With regard to the environment, an agreement was 
reached in Geneva last week on the setting up of a multilateral 
negotiation group. 
  With regard to monetary parity, the IMF's preserve, a 
decision in Marrakesh is out of the question. Unfair 
competition (agreements, dominant monopolistic positions) could 
be discussed but without necessarily immediately starting 
negotiations. 
<H5>  Multilateral Social Code of Ethics Being Planned </H5>
  That leaves the social clause on which Paris and Washington 
seem to have similar views. Although the content of the 
provisions has not been specified, the developing countries see 
it as a new means of "imperialist" domination. 
  Francois de Laage de Meux, president of the CNPF's 
International Commission, states that the "CNPF's target is not 
the wage disparities due to differences in development." 
However, the future members of the WTO could agree on "a 
multilateral social code of ethics adopting the International 
Labor Organization's [ILO] main conventions." 
  For instance those relating to the prohibition of child 
labor 
and enforced labor, or the obligation for collective negotiation 
and trade union freedom. And the employers' leader added that, 
not only in the PRC, but also in some other countries (India, 
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Peru), enforced prison labor 
and child labor affect relatively large sections of the 
population. 
  The CNPF adds that other ILO conventions should also be 
included in the WTO's agenda: minimum wages, paid leave, rest 
days, equal pay, maternity provisions. It is difficult to see 
how the developing countries could avoid feeling that they are 
the targets.
