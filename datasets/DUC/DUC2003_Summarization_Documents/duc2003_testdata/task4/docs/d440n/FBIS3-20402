<F P=106> [Lucy Walker article: "Pressure on Workers' Rights </F>
Threatens Fragile GATT Deal"] 
  [Text] A Disagreement over plans to incorporate workers 
rights into international free trade rules threatens to shatter 
a fragile coalition of support for the Uruguay Round of GATT, 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, little more than a 
fortnight before the world trade agreement is due to be signed. 
  Plans to put workers' rights on the agenda of the proposed 
World Trade Organisation are being pushed vigorously by the 
United States and France, but have angered almost 100 developing 
countries. 
  India's ambassador to GATT, Balkrishnon Zutshi, has warned 
that divisions over the need for a "social clause" could wreck 
the Uruguay Round agreement due to be signed by ministers from 
119 countries in Marrakesch next month after eight years of 
negotiation. 
  The GATT's 45-year-old improvised structure is to be 
subsumed 
into a new, more powerful, world trade watchdog, the World Trade 
Organisation, at the meeting in Morocco between 12 and 15 April. 
  Peter Sutherland, the Director General of GATT, who is 
expected to become the first head of the WTO, has given cautious 
endorsement to the introduction of a social clause in world 
trade legislation -- once the WTO is operational. However, 
aggressive lobbying by Washington has forced the European Union 
[EU] to bring forward the discussion. The EU wants to prevent 
the Clinton Administration stealing a march on it to set the 
agenda, unopposed, before Marrakesch. 
  The United States argues that the trade liberalising 
benefits 
of the Uruguay Round should not boost countries which produce 
cheap goods by exploiting workers. It wants to see child and 
forced labour banned and trade union rights guaranteed. 
Countries that do not meet international social standards 
should be penalised by losing trade privileges. 
  Developing countries, which now comprise more than 
two-thirds 
of GATT members, protest that export revenue is a vital 
ingredient in new social reform programmes. 
  Some countries stand to lose more than others. Wouldbe GATT 
member China has been criticised for its sweatshop work regime 
and a host of other Asian countries are likely to fall foul of 
Western standards which legislate against child labour. 
Introducing a social clause into the GATT has the backing of a 
worldwide coalition of trade union organisations. The 
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, World 
Confederation of Labour, and European Trade Union Confederation, 
argue that in order to "improve social conditions, the most 
appropriate way to prevent social dumping is to include social 
clauses in trade agreements." 
  They say that: "Only in the last resort would trade 
sanctions 
be used as a penalty for non co-operation." 
  The unions also have an unlikely ally in Sir Leon Brittan, 
the European Trade Commissioner, who believes a social clause 
should be put firmly on the WTO agenda. "It will be a more 
political organisation, with a wider remit and more frequent 
direct ministerial involvement, than has been the case for 
GATT," he told members of the European Parliament. 
  Brittan, however, warns against heavy-handed bullying by the 
West. He said: "I think that if these principles are more 
widely understood, developing country governments will come to 
accept that the WTO [World Trade Organisation] should have a 
social dimension." 
  This view is not yet universally accepted, however. The 
European Employers, Federation (UNICE) is wary of carving social 
standards into stone, urging the need to avoid simplistic 
solutions. 
  "The issues of social clauses are important; they uphold the 
aims of protecting children, and other areas of civil liberty. 
But we wouldn't go along with putting this into GATT yet," said 
a spokeswoman for the business lobby. UNICE argues instead for 
faster growth and higher living standards as the route to 
improved conditions. 
  Euro-MP Bartho Pronk, a Dutch Christian Democrat, says that 
in order to be fair and effective the social clause should be 
limited to fundamental and minimum standards. 
  Pronk argues that compliance with the social clause should 
only be applied to countries seeking preferential trading status 
under the GATT or another -- bilateral or regional -- trading 
arrangements. The idea is not new, notes Pronk. Levi Strauss, 
perhaps the best known brand of denim clothing, and the Swiss 
retailer Migros already insist that suppliers and 
sub-contractors respect minimum standards, including a ban on 
child labour. But he says the EU must decide first whether a 
social clause in GATT, or other trade agreements, such as the 
Union's generalised system of preferences, is an instrument of 
trade or social policy. 
  Low wages alone are insufficient reason for the introduction 
of a social clause. Pronk says: "While huge disparities in 
labour costs do exist within the international economy I am of 
the view that this should not be the basis of a social clause. 
To do so would be to penalise the less developed countries for 
their level of development and would open the social clause to 
criticism that it is Western protectionism in another form."
