The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) launched a
global campaign yesterday to eradicate child labour, including a boycott of
exports made by exploited, under-age workers, Reuter reports from Geneva.
Mr Enzo Friso, general secretary of the world's largest international labour
grouping, took the case for a link between trade and labour conditions to Mr
Peter Sutherland, chief of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'This
shameful phenomenon has grown over the last years,' Mr Friso told a news
briefing in Geneva. 'It is a serious problem which requires state
intervention.
'We are going to campaign for a boycott to stop goods made by children from
gaining access to foreign markets,' he added.
In a new report, the Brussels-based ICFTU says from 100m to 200m children
under 15 are working in streets, factories and mines, mainly in South Asia
and Latin America.
They include children working in coal mines in Colombia, gold mines in Peru,
as construction workers in Bangladesh, as 'slaves' in Pakistan weaving
carpets, sweet vendors in Mexico, and in garment factories in the
Philippines.
The 13-page report, 'Child Labour: the world's best kept secret', contains
documentation from ICFTU affiliates on abuses in India, Bangladesh, Nepal,
Mexico and the Philippines.
'A number of multinationals are currently under investigation by ICFTU
experts,' it says. 'All companies discovered to be using child labour will
be exposed and the companies will be the target of special union campaigns.'
Mr Bjorne Grimsrud, ICFTU campaign organiser, declined to name suspected
multinationals but said: 'It is important to get to the sub-contractors
level because that is where you find the child labour.'
In a statement, ICFTU said the campaign would include an international
boycott of hand-woven carpets from Nepal, India and Pakistan, unless they
were labelled with a guarantee that child workers were not involved in
production.
The ICFTU has 174 labour union affiliates in 124 countries, representing
120m workers. During the cold war it campaigned for workers' rights in
Communist countries.
The appeal was made on the fringes of the annual meeting of the
International Labour Organisation, whose director general, Mr Michel
Hansenne, is also pressing for workers' rights to be closely tied to global
economic and trade decisions.
Mr Friso called for a 'social clause' to be used as an international weapon
against child exploitation and other abuses of workers' rights at the future
World Trade Organisation. 'We want a social clause . . . to prevent the
import of goods from a country when its government does not take measures
against exploitation of children,' he said.
