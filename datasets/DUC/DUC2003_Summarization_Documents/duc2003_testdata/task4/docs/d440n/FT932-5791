The 163-nation International Labour Organisation, whose three-week annual
conference begins in Geneva today, has yet to find a firm foothold in the
post cold-war world.
Created by western governments, employers and unions in 1919 to demonstrate
the caring face of capitalism, in response to the newly formed 'workers'
state' of Soviet Russia, its aims include full and productive employment, a
'minimum living wage', tripartism and collective bargaining, and basic
social protection.
Yet today, as the latest ILO World Labour Report indicates, unemployment and
poverty are increasing, child labour remains a scourge, and up to 33m
workers are in forced labour, such as debt bondage where workers are trapped
by debt to an employer. Health and safety conditions remain dismal in much
of the world, as last month's fire in a Bangkok toy factory, in which more
than 200 workers were killed, made tragically clear. In the western
industrialised countries, trade union membership is declining and tripartism
is on the retreat.
Critics from both left and right question the ILO's priorities,
effectiveness and, in particular, the role of international labour
standards. 'The machine churning out conventions has gone mad,' says one
western government official. 'There's no point in adopting more and more
detailed conventions if they have no effect on labour conditions.'
The ILO's 173 conventions and 180 recommendations cover basic human and
worker rights - freedom of association, elimination of child labour and
forced labour, non-discrimination - as well as detailed norms on health and
safety, social security and wage determination. This year's annual
conference is considering standards on prevention of serious industrial
accidents and on protection of part-time workers.
But governments have no obligation to ratify conventions and there are no
penalties attached to breaching them. Egregious violations of the most basic
human rights - such as the murder or jailing of trade unionists - are
punished by no more than a public rebuke. The ILO's worst sanction is the
so-called 'special paragraph', which singles out the country - last year,
Sudan - for the attention of the annual conference.
The British government has been criticised eight times for violating the
ILO's freedom of association convention, notably for its ban on unions at
the Government Communications Headquarters in Cheltenham. Mr Marcello
Malentacchi, general secretary of the International Metalworkers'
Federation, warned in a speech last April that the ILO was in danger of
being marginalised.
In addition, the ILO, which employs 1,800 people and has an annual budget of
nearly Dollars 300m, has come under fire for its sluggish bureaucracy and
cumbersome tripartite structure, in which employers and unions as well as
governments are represented. Some argue that, as a result, the ILO has been
slow to respond effectively to the globalisation of the world economy and
changing patterns of employment.
There is also concern that the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank have been able to seize the initiative on labour issues in developing
nations and in eastern Europe, often with scant regard for ILO principles of
social justice, democracy and human rights.
The ILO is now embroiled in an important debate on its direction. The
employers' side wants the ILO to place less emphasis on standard-setting,
which it argues can hamper job creation, and pay more attention to promoting
employment. Mr Jean-Jacques Oechslin, chairman of the employers' group, says
the ILO should be helping with training programmes and encouraging improved
labour mobility. 'The biggest problem in industrialised and developing
countries is employment,' he says. 'This can't be tackled by voting for
conventions. It has to be done by action in the field.'
Mr Eddy Laurijssen, director of the International Confederation of Free
Trade Unions and secretary of the workers' group in the ILO, says that
growing joblessness has often coincided with falling employment standards.
He says the ILO should be pushing social issues to the top of the
international agenda, especially with the IMF and World Bank, and making
standards more effective.
Mr Michel Hansenne, the ILO's Belgian director-general, who was last week
re-elected for a second five-year term, says standards are the backbone of
the organisation and must remain so. He concedes, however, that with the
exception of the 15 or so core human rights standards, such as freedom of
association, these need not always take the form of international
conventions.
He also defends the ILO's preference for measured disapproval of rule
breaches and behind-the-scenes persuasion. 'I don't think it would be wise
to transform ourselves into a public accuser,' he says. Countries would lose
confidence in the ILO and might prefer to denounce conventions rather than
be pilloried for breaches of them.
Nevertheless, critics compare the organisation's quietly launched 'global
offensive' against child labour, which may affect 100m to 200m children
worldwide, with the high-profile campaign by Unicef, the UN children's fund,
for a consumer boycott of carpets made by children.
In the US, trade preferences can be withdrawn from countries which abuse
worker rights and there are moves in Congress to ban all imports of goods
made by children. The workers' group in the ILO wants the organisation to
back a 'social clause' in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which
would permit trading partners to impose trade sanctions on countries which
exploit their workers and thereby gain competitive advantage.
Mr Hansenne points out that from the start the ILO's role was to combat
'social dumping' by setting international norms but says the Gatt social
clause debate is in danger of confusing two different issues.
The first, of central ILO concern, is whether a new mechanism is needed to
enforce basic human rights standards worldwide. Such a social clause in the
Gatt would include, for example, the ILO's core standards (such as freedom
of association and elimination of forced labour) that embody universally
accepted fundamental human rights.
The second is what international fair competition rules there should be in
an open trading system, and the extent to which these should cover labour
conditions such as minimum wages or social security protection. This debate,
while important, does not relate to enforcement of ILO norms, says Mr
Hansenne.
Meanwhile, the ILO has already embarked on reorganisation to try to improve
its effectiveness. Technical assistance is to be tied more directly to the
promotion of standards. And the organisation is moving 'closer to the
customer' with its so-called 'active partnership' policy. This seeks to
promote agreements among governments, unions and employers on priorities for
labour and social policies and technical assistance in each country.
In a linked move, the first of 14 regional teams has been set up in Budapest
to help the ILO cope with burgeoning demands from central and eastern
European countries. These demands range from assistance in setting up
tripartite industrial relations structures, to helping establish labour
exchange networks and drafting social security legislation.
The debate on the organisation's future will culminate next year when the
ILO celebrates its 75th birthday, and the 50th anniversary of the
Declaration of Philadelphia, which elaborated its constitution. By the time
of the World Summit for Social Development in 1995, Mr Hansenne hopes a
rejuvenated ILO will show the way towards a 'new world order' which can
marry economic development with respect for human rights. But to exert
greater influence on governments and employers, the ILO will have to define
its role more clearly and be prepared to make its voice heard.
