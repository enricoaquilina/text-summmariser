negotiations surrounding the troubled passage of Nafta as domestic politics

A weary US trade negotiator emerged this week from five hours of
inconclusive talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement. He turned to
waiting reporters and said: 'I have a quote for you: Canada stinks. Mexico
stinks. Nafta stinks. I've cancelled my vacation three times because of
these talks, and now, I'm out of here.'
As talks in Washington have broken up for negotiators to snatch delayed
summer holidays, the outburst says much about the frustration that has built
up over months of glacial progress.
Three deadlines for completion of negotiations on side agreements to the
main treaty, covering minimum labour and environmental standards, have come
and gone in the past month. Trade lobbyists in Washington find it hard to
assesses whether the talks are close to completion, or close to collapse.
One spoke yesterday of 'wildly fluctuating assessments' circulating around
Capitol Hill.
But as negotiators have whittled away at the handful of outstanding labour
and environmental issues separating the US, Mexico and Canada, it seems all
three countries have domestic political barriers which cast doubt on a
successful outcome.
In the US, President Clinton is paralysed by an issue that divides the
Democratic party down the middle. With a bruising battle over the budget
just behind him, he is bracing himself for the controversial passage of
healthcare reform. Many advisers are urging him not to waste political
capital on Nafta, which they see as less pivotal.
Those in the party with either labour or environmental interests see Nafta
as a threat to jobs or to efforts to enforce higher environmental standards.
Mr Clinton is under pressure to deliver a deal which 'has teeth', both in
reversing environmental degradation in the maquiladoras (free-trade zones)
along the US-Mexico border, and in preventing labour abuses in factories
being relocated to Mexico.
For Mexico, the Nafta deal was intended to provide President Carlos Salinas
with a springboard for a like-minded reformist president to win the election
due in September next year. But after the long delays, officials stress the
agreement is not indispensable to stability and growth.
Mrs Kim Campbell, Canada's new prime minister, faces federal elections
within three months. During the recession of the past four years, which has
deeply dented the government's popularity, the US-Canada free-trade
agreement agreed in 1989 has been blamed by Canadian voters for many ills.
They think Nafta will make matters worse as factories and jobs continue to
be lost across the border. Mrs Campbell is unlikely to approve any Nafta
deal which can be interpreted as 'caving in' to the US.
For all three leaders, political constraints are proving inimical to signing
a Nafta deal. It is ironic that the agreement, once trumpeted as a
'win-win-win' deal for all involved, should now be seen as a liability.
Part of the 'win-win-win' outcome was to derive from labour-intensive
industries migrating to Mexico, while highly skilled production would be
concentrated in the US and Canada. But the prospect of job losses triggered
a furore in low-technology US industries, among trade unions, and among
environmental lobbyists. It is what prompted Mr Ross Perot, the former
presidential candidate, to talk of 'the sucking sound of jobs heading
south'. Environmentalists are convinced that it will be 'dirty industry'
that migrates in search of a less rigorous legislative environment in
Mexico.
Mr Ralph Nader, long-time US consumer rights campaigner and head of the
Sierra Club environmental group, criticises Mexico's cheap labour. He says
its 'comparative advantage' stems from its failure to enforce its child
labour law, and he insists that no trade agreement will compel Mexican
companies to enforce their worker, health or safety laws.
In contrast, many economists forecast net job gains accruing from Nafta in
both Mexico and the US. They also challenge claims of dirty industry
migration.
Using US commerce department figures that each Dollars 1bn of US exports
generates 20,000 US jobs, they say the Mexican market has been responsible
for the creation of nearly 500,000 US jobs in the past few years. Exports to
Mexico rose last year to Dollars 44bn.
But statistics appear to count for little as the battle intensifies to win
US congressional backing for Nafta. . Few congressmen believe Nafta is yet
ripe for passage. According to Mr John Dingell, Democrat chairman of the
House energy and commerce committee, and an opponent of the treaty: 'Every
sign I see is that the votes are not present for Nafta to be carried. Given
that, I think the president is rather prudently holding back.'
Any winning coalition in the House of Representatives and the Senate would
need to comprise most of the Republican members, together with about half of
the Democrats. In the budget vote there was a complete absence of Republican
support, which meant everysingle Democratic vote was needed - Vice-President
Al Gore cast the decisive vote. Building a coalition is a risky strategy for
Mr Clinton, both because Republican votes cannot be relied upon and because
reliance on his opponents would damage his relationship with fellow
Democrats.
'I think the president should take a hard look at whether he wants to pass
Nafta with a Republican majority,' Mr Dingell warned.
About 50 of the 176 Republicans in the House, and perhaps as many as nine of
the 44 Republican senators currently seem likely to vote against the treaty.
The votes of potential Nafta supporters on the Democratic side, notably that
of Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader who wields considerable
political power, remain conditional on the negotiation of satisfactory side
agreements.
Some encouraging signals can be seen across the country however. The
nation's governors, particularly those in the west, appear to be in favour
of the accord. A recent survey by the Heritage Foundation showed 40 of 50
governors strongly support the agreement, with 10 undecided or not
responding.
Many of those in favour are impatient at President Clinton's hesitancy. The
protracted delay in the appointment by the administration of a 'Nafta tsar'
to co-ordinate the lobbying effort is symbolic of inaction. The fact that
the Chicago-based Mr William Daley has been offered the post is one of
Washington's less well-kept secrets, but Mr Daley appears reluctant to say
yes until he is confident Mr Clinton is fully committed to the Nafta.
Supporters of the treaty have also been frustrated by the administration's
behaviour. Industrialists who might be expected to campaign vigorously on
its behalf are angry that only labour and environmental groups have been
consulted about the side agreements.
An administration blunder is also looming in the appeal it is lodging
against a ruling by Washington federal judge Charles Richey. In June, he
upheld a claim by environmentalists that the administration must prepare an
environmental impact statement on Nafta, which could take years.
Initially, the ruling was thought to put the entire Nafta deal in jeopardy.
Negotiators then drew comfort from legal opinion that the ruling was likely
to be overturned on appeal. However, several business lobbyists for Nafta
who have seen details of the administration's intended brief have taken the
unusual step of preparing an appeal of their own.
The Nafta deal is nevertheless not yet lost. Canadian officials said after
this week's talks that the three countries were 'very, very close' to an
agreement, but that 'there are a couple of really tough issues which people
have to think through'.
There is also the conviction among the negotiators that if Mr Clinton
decided that regardless of political cost, the agreement was still i the
national interest, then it could be pushed successfully through Congress.
But doubts remain over his commitment. As one journalist shouted across the
White House lawn at the passing president: 'Sir, have you given up on
Nafta?' He smiled, but gave no answer.
