The Assembly on Monday approved a bill aimed at cracking down on the latest 
proliferation of garment industry sweatshops in Orange and Los Angeles counties 
by making designer-name garment houses responsible for child labor and overtime 
abuses committed by their independent suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-West Los Angeles), was 
introduced in March after a series of articles in The Times revealed that many 
independent contractors still run sweatshops paying as little as $1.45 an hour 
to children and immigrants, including Southeast Asians relocating to such 
Orange County communities as Garden Grove, Santa Ana and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who represents those areas, joined 
his Republican colleagues in voting against the bill on Monday, but a 
Democratic majority gave Hayden's measure the 44-30 margin needed to pass the 
lower house and be sent to the Senate for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Under provisions of the bill, name-brand clothing manufacturers would be held 
"jointly liable" for labor and safety violations committed by their 
subcontractors, many of whom pay immigrant children and women by the piece of 
clothing sewn in their homes or in crowded, fire-prone shops. Depending on the 
complexity of the job and the speed of the stitcher, the piece rate often 
translates into less than the California minimum wage of $4.25 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, these independent jobbers have avoided paying fines by simply 
folding their operations when caught and cited by state labor officials, 
leaving many of the exploited workers stranded even without their minimum 
wages. But Hayden's bill would change that by placing the burden of the fines 
and back pay on the manufacturers, who hired the independent jobbers in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden and supporters of the bill -- the California Labor Federation and the 
International Ladies' Garments Workers' Union -- say the change is necessary 
because of widespread labor abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an industry where there's a lot of documented lawlessness -- 
child-labor violations, unsafe working conditions, fire hazards, people not 
getting paid what they deserve," Hayden said. "And it's the very structure of 
the industry that's out of control. 
</P>
<P>
"This (the bill) is to make the manufacturer liable for the rampant lawlessness 
instead of what they now do, which is reap the benefit but take none of the 
burden," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden added that his bill was intended to close a "gaping hole" in the 
garment-manufacturing registration law of 1980, which was enacted after reports 
of widespread labor abuses in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The bill received support from Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los 
Angeles), whose district encompasses the downtown Los Angeles garment district. 
"On any given day, you can go to any one of these buildings and see the most 
deplorable working conditions imaginable," she said, adding that some shops 
have structural problems, blocked exits and piles of flammable materials. 
</P>
<P>
But Pringle, who said he was equally opposed to the labor abuses, maintained 
that the Hayden bill would place an inappropriate burden on the manufacturers, 
who cannot be assumed to know about the alleged infractions of their 
subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not where the person who makes the contract specifically knows that 
the independent contractor is breaking the laws," he argued. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody is doing something wrong, they should be punished for it and not 
everybody up and down the line," Pringle added. 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County legislators voting against Hayden's bill were Doris Allen 
(R-Cypress); Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos); Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach); 
Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad); Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach); Ross 
Johnson (R-La Habra) and John R. Lewis (R-Orange). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Hayden's bill now goes to the Senate, where it will be examined by a committee 
and then the full upper house. If the bill is amended, it will be sent back to 
the Assembly for agreement before being forwarded to Gov. George Deukmejian, 
who can either veto it or sign the measure into law. 'We're going to have to 
work to get the governor's attention on this, to show it is good for 
responsible businesses and the sort of thing that is overdue,' Hayden has said.
