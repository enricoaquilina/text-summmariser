<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="32" NOVEL> In the case of spaceborne SAR, however, the effects of Earth rotation and Earth curvature produce coupling in the radar returns between the range direction and the azimuth direction; as a result, azimuth compression of the radar signal becomes very complicated.</s>

<s docid="FBIS3-40210" num="33" NOVEL> In general, digital image processing for spaceborne SAR involves range processing, azimuth processing, motion compensation and multi-look processing, of which the most difficult problems are azimuth processing and motion compensation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="19" NOVEL> In oceanography, the most important issues are to recognize the different phenomena that occur on the ocean surface and to have a good understanding of the available resources in the ocean.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="20" NOVEL> These are also the objectives of ocean monitoring and surveillance.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="21" NOVEL> The traditional approaches for ocean monitoring and surveillance involve the use of surveillance ships, observation stations, ocean buoys, etc., to collect data that reflect the ocean environment and resources.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="22" NOVEL> However, these approaches are expensive, time-consuming and can only cover a limited area; consequently, they are not suited for wide-area, real-time, synchronous, continuous and dense observations.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="23" NOVEL> Because of the immense dimensions and constant motion of the ocean, space-borne remote sensors have distinct advantages over other monitoring techniques.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="24" NOVEL> These advantages are: 1) unlike most conventional techniques which can only perform point-wise or line-wise monitoring, space-borne sensors provide an economical and convenient way to perform wide-area monitoring; and 2) they have real-time monitoring capability.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="25" NOVEL> Today, the simple ocean-surface monitoring technique has been replaced by the integrated technique which makes use of space-borne sensors, surface sensors and underwater sensors; in particular, space-borne monitoring is now becoming the principal technique.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="28" NOVEL> In this paper, the main accomplishments are summarized, and an argument is made that since it is unlikely for China to launch its own remote-sensing satellites within the next few years, the best course would be to promote the research and application of remote-sensing technology in this country by making maximum use of the data collected by other countries.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="32" NOVEL> 1. Monitoring the Dynamic Ocean Environment Currently, satellite sensors can only detect changes on the ocean surface; internal conditions of the ocean are inferred from variations in the surface phenomena.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="33" NOVEL> The important phenomena include: 1) surface wind fields, wave fields, flow fields, tides, water pockets, front movement, vortices and internal waves; and 2) surface terrain, surface height and ice formation in the ocean.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="34" NOVEL> Like other dynamic processes, the dynamic process of the ocean has its own characteristic length and time scales.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="35" NOVEL> In general, the length scale in the horizontal direction spans from several tens of centimeters to several thousand kilometers, with a span ratio of 10[.sup]6[/]-10[.sup]7[/]; the length scale in the vertical direction is typically 1/100 to 1/1000 that of the horizontal scale; the span of the time scale is even larger, from several seconds to several years, with a span ratio of 10[.sup]8[/] to 10[.sup]9[/].</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="36" NOVEL> Based on these unique characteristics, the technical specifications of ocean-monitoring satellites must satisfy the following requirements: (1) To achieve global monitoring, the earth resource satellites in general are placed in near-circular, sun-synchronous orbits.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="37" NOVEL> (2) The scan distance and scan width of the ocean surface should be matched to the horizontal length span ratio, but because of the large variations in the span ratio associated with the different dynamic processes, and the limitations of the satellite orbit and the onboard detectors, it is necessary to consider a compromise value for the satellite design.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="38" NOVEL> (3) The accuracy of the vertical length span ratio is primarily determined by the stability of the satellite orbit and the measurement accuracy.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="39" NOVEL> (4) The operating life and the repetition period of the satellite orbit (including the back-up satellite) should be matched to the time span ratio.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="40" NOVEL> Because of the large variations in the time span ratio associated with the different dynamic processes, it is impossible to satisfy all requirements simultaneously; therefore, a compromise must again be considered.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="42" NOVEL> (5) The observation of the key elements of the dynamic phenomena is based on the principle of measuring the roughness of the ocean surface; generally, active microwave detectors with all-weather capability are used.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="43" NOVEL> 2. Observation of Ocean Color Ocean water contains organic and inorganic materials of different concentration.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="46" NOVEL> Observation of ocean color usually refers to the measurement of chlorophyll concentration, the content of suspended mud and sand, the pollutants, the soluble organic materials, the depth of water and underwater terrains.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="47" NOVEL> The requirements on satellite orbit and altitude for observing ocean color are similar to those for measuring the dynamic environment, the only difference is that the repetition period can be somewhat longer.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="48" NOVEL> The detectors used for observing ocean color elements generally operate in the visible-light band.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="49" NOVEL> The commonly used techniques for measuring the chlorophyll content in the ocean are the blue-green spectral response method and the fluorescent peak response method; both techniques require fine resolution of the spectral band and high sensitivity of the measuring instrument.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="50" NOVEL> 3. Mapping of the Coastal Belt and Offshore Islands The coastal belt consists of the land and sea region along the shoreline.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="51" NOVEL> The main objectives of mapping the coastal belt are to monitor changes in the shoreline, the configuration of the beaches and reefs, the building environment along the shore, the water depth of shallow sea and underwater terrain, the geological structure and the distribution of vegetation.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="52" NOVEL> The technical requirement for mapping the coastal belt and offshore islands is the same as that for mapping land areas.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="53"> Improvement is being made to the multi-band scanning radiometer currently used for mapping to provide higher ground resolution and three-dimensional mapping capability; also, the development of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology (which has already been implemented on the Japanese remote-sensing satellite JERS-1 launched in February 1992) will further improve the mapping capability of the coastal belt and offshore islands.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="56"> Satellite Remote Sensing in Oceanography During the past 10 years, significant advances have been made in satellite remote-sensing technology.</s>

Deficiencies of the NOAA and Landsat Satellites in Oceanography Applications (1) The accuracy of the AVHRR detector of the NOAA satellite in measuring ocean surface temperature is rather poor; also, the detector is subject to cloud cover limitations and therefore cannot make continuous temperature measurements.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="77" NOVEL> In monitoring ice conditions, the surface resolution and geopositioning accuracy of the detector are poor; therefore it is difficult to obtain information on ice movement.</s>

<s docid="FBIS4-20436" num="78" NOVEL> In measuring ocean color, the spectral resolution and sensitivity of the detector are both quite low, hence it is difficult to obtain quantitative measures of chlorophyll concentration.</s>
