	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians voted Friday to elect a key
assembly expected to be dominated by hard-line clergymen who favor
unhindered powers for Iran's supreme leader.
	   The state-controlled media reported an ``unprecedented and
unique'' turnout but gave no figures. However, Associated Press
reporters found many polling stations empty and others with few
voters.
	   Friday's election is for the 86-seat Assembly of Experts, whose
job is to oversee the work of the supreme leader, a post currently
held by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   In practice, the supreme leader has the final say in all matters
_ and hard-line clergymen want to keep it that way. But moderate
clerics led by President Mohammad Khatami are calling for a more
accountable leader in a political tug-of-war that has gripped Iran
since his election last year.
	   ``We want to have a say in our destiny,'' said Farhad Qaemaqami,
who waited with about 30 others to vote at a mosque in the upscale
Fereshteh neighborhood. ``I will vote for somebody who will have
some kind of influence over the (supreme) leader.''
	   But Khatami's camp appeared to have lost this battle even before
the polls: a conservative supervisory council that vetted a list of
396 prospective candidates approved 161 contestants, only about 30
of them moderates.
	   Khatami, who was among the early voters, pointed that out to
reporters after casting his ballot in the Husseinieh Jamaran
meeting hall attached to a mosque in northern Tehran.
	   ``Definitely, there could have been more qualified people than
were allowed, but nonetheless we still have a chance to choose our
favored candidates,'' said Khatami, who drove to the polling booth
dressed in the clergy's black robe and turban.
	   He shook hands and chatted with election officials before
sitting in front of a white ballot box to pick a 16-man panel for
the Tehran district from a list of 32 candidates.
	   Tehran radio said people queued in long lines to vote and
authorities expect to run out of ballot papers. ``People voted for
Islam,'' the radio said. ``People's participation is unprecedented
and unique.''
	   In Bojnourd and Astaneh Ashrafiyeh cities in the north, people
braved heavy rains and strong winds to stand in long lines at
polling stations, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said.
	   The upbeat reports contrasted with predictions of low voter
turnout from a disappointed public that had little to choose from,
unlike in the 1997 presidential polls when 20 million people voted
for the reformist Khatami.
	   A hard-line newspapers had said only about 39 percent of the 38
million eligible voters are expected to show up for Friday's vote.
	   ``They are all liars. I am powerless to do anything against them
so it's best to keep quiet,'' said Siavaash Mohseni, 24, a
university student who said he didn't vote. ``They have already
selected the people they want to put in the assembly.''
	   A low turnout would likely be seen as a rebuff of the hard-line
policies of Khamenei, who succeeded the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution that installed
the rule of Shiite clergy in Iran.
	   Khatami's popular efforts to ease the revolution's social,
political and media restrictions are opposed bitterly by
hard-liners loathe to give up control over Iran's judiciary,
security agencies and other key institutions.
	   Voting in the 33,312 polling stations in the country's 28
provinces is scheduled to close at 6 p.m. (1430 GMT). First
official results are not expected until Saturday.
