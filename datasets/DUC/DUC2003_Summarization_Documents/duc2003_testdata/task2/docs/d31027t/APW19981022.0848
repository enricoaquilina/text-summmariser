	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Fearing an embarrassing low turnout in a key
election Friday, senior conservative clerics fervently urged
Iranians to vote in large numbers to show confidence in the
19-year-old Islamic regime.
	   The hard-line controlled state Tehran radio spent half its hour
long main news program Thursday broadcasting calls for people to
show their ``brave presence'' at polling stations to elect the
Assembly of Experts.
	   Besides the presidential polls, the election for the 86-member
assembly is the most important in Iran because the caucus elects
and supervises the country's supreme leader, who has the final say
in government decisions.
	   Among those urging people to vote was Grand Ayatollah Kazem
Lankarani, who called it a ``divine duty'' and warned that ``the
revolution's enemies are waiting to strike a strong blow at our
regime.''
	   Despite the urging, the lackluster election campaign has failed
to draw much excitement because of lack of competition: most of the
161 candidates _ all clergymen _ are hard-liners who were selected
by a supervisory Council of Guardians controlled by conservatives.
	   In vetting 396 aspirants, the council eliminated most supporters
of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate clergyman with wide
popular support.
	   Khatami's followers want to make the supreme leader more
accountable to the people while the hard-liners prefer a much more
hands-off approach.
	   The conflict is the latest chapter in a pervasive power struggle
in the ruling clergy between Khatami and conservative clergymen who
control most of the major state institutions such as the judiciary
and security agencies.
	   Since his elections last year, Khatami has stunned the
hard-liners with bold and popular attempts to ease social,
political and media restrictions that were imposed after the 1979
Islamic Revolution installed the government of theologians.
	   By eliminating the moderates for Friday's assembly election, the
conservatives were hoping to prevent a repeat of the stinging
defeat in 1997 presidential election when 20 million out of 30
million people voted for Khatami against a hard-line rival.
	   But then the hard-liners began to fear a low turnout would look
bad after some moderate groups decided to boycott the vote to
protest the dumping of moderate candidates as well as to call into
question the legitimacy of the conservatives.
	   Other moderates believe that people must vote to at least keep
the most stringent hard-liners out of the assembly, such as
Mohammad Yazdi, head of the judiciary, and Ahmad Jannati, head of
the Council of Guardians.
	   The moderates also do not want their candidates _ few as they
are _ to suffer because of a low turnout.
	   Candidates linked to the moderate camp include former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani and Parliament member Majid Ansari, 44, who
wants the assembly to submit regular reports of its work and to
open its sessions to public.
	   Fewer than 10 million of a little more than 38 million eligible
voters are expected to take part. Even the hard-line Abrar daily
estimated that 15 million people will vote, a turnout of 39
percent.
	   Hoping to save the day, Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
issued his final appeal Wednesday.
	   ``The people, by their huge turnout at the elections of the
Assembly of Experts will inject a new life into the revolution,''
he said.
	   Some 100,000 security forces will be deployed around the
country's 28 provinces for the voting in 33,312 polling stations.
First official results are not expected until Saturday.
