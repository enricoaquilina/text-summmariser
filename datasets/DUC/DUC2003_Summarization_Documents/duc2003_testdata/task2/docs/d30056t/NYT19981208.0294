   MOSCOW _ The severed heads of four kidnapping victims _
identified as three Britons and a New Zealander _ were found
Tuesday on the side of a road in Chechnya, the breakaway region on
Russia's southern border that emerged undefeated from a brutal war
two years ago only to be engulfed by a wave of kidnappings and
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The gruesome killings heightened alarm and outrage about the
volatile situation in the region, which spun out of Moscow's
control long ago. Until now, local kidnappers have usually kept
their hostages alive in hopes of receiving ransom money, which has
become a major source of income in an economy devastated by
Russia's 21-month war against Chechen secessionists.
</P>
<P>
   Although the corpses have not yet been found, Chechen officials
said Tuesday that they had been able to identify the victims as
four employees of a British telecommunications company. They were
kidnapped from their house in the Chechen capital, Grozny, by two
dozen armed men on Oct. 3, after a shootout with their bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   The British government, in a statement Tuesday night condemning
the ``repugnant murders,'' said it was awaiting final confirmation
of the victims' identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a horrifying crime, committed against the international
community,'' said Manolis Chikhkiyev, an aide to Ruslan Aushev,
president of Ingushetia, a region that borders Chechnya. ``Ordinary
criminals wouldn't kill their hostages, which means that this
situation is much deeper and more complex.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 100 kidnap victims _ including several foreigners,
as well as Russian servicemen _ are still being held in Chechnya
and neighboring regions in the northern Caucasus. In neighboring
Dagestan, kidnappers seized Herbert Gregg, an American teacher, on
Nov. 12 as he was leaving a local orphanage. His whereabouts are
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Chechen government has mounted a new
campaign to crack down on the kidnapping gangs, an effort that was
set back in October by a car bomb that killed the leader of its
special anti-terrorist squad.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov, has accused his
political opposition and ``foreign agents'' of using kidnapping as
a weapon in its campaign to unseat him. But the crime wave is also
attributed to competing local chieftans, Muslim extremists and
other groups that have been feeding off the lawlessness and anarchy
that has swept the region.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, a Russian official, Akmal Saidov, was found
strangled to death several days after he had been abducted. The
motive was judged to be political after a note signed by the
``wolves of Islam'' was reportedly found on his body, vowing death
to those who work for the Russian secret service.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of kidnapping has left Chechnya isolated from the rest of
the world, as journalists, aid workers and foreign investors keep a
wary distance from a region now so impoverished that according to
one local resident, some people are reduced to a diet of animal
feed.
</P>
<P>
   Yelena Masyuk, one of three Russian television journalist
kidnapped and then released last year after payment of $2 million
in ransom, said at an international conference last May that the
kidnappings had cost Chechnya the sympathy it had won when Russian
troops were bombing its capital and killing its civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chechens made $16 million on journalists last year, but they
lost much more,'' she said. ``They lost the journalists' confidence
that they had had during the war.'' The result, she said, was ``an
information blockade'' against the region and its 1 million
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Russian government, while refusing to
recognize Chechen independence, has virtually no authority in the
region, and has dispersed little of the money it pledged for
postwar reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   There have been successes in the war against the kidnappers _
such as the release last month of President Boris Yeltsin's
personal envoy to the region, Valentin Vlasov, after six months of
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, 55 Russian servicemen who had been held
captive have been returned to Moscow. And in September, a pair of
British aid workers were flown back to England, where they told
harrowing tales of abuse by their captors.
</P>
<P>
   Most released hostages have reported that their captors were
careful to keep them alive, if barely, so as to be able to collect
their reward. One hostage, released this year after several months
of captivity and speaking on condition of anonymity, described
being held in cold, wet basements, wearing the same set of clothes
until they rotted on his body.
</P>
<P>
   Masked guards would deliver meager food rations at irregular
intervals, and periodically move their prisoners to different
locations, always at night. In his case, the motive for the
kidnapping was clear. ``Their goal was only money,'' he said, ``and
they don't hide this.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But even the hostage releases have only added fuel to the
politically charged atmosphere in the region, as competing groups
accuse each other of getting rich on the ransoms. Last month,
Maskhadov accused a Russian financier, Boris Berezovsky, of fueling
the kidnapping industry by paying out huge ransoms.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky _ who has played an open role in negotiating the
release of a number of hostages _ has routinely denied the charges,
although he has said he provided humanitarian assistance, computers
and textbooks to Chechnya in an effort to secure good will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to do everything possible on my side to stop this
mess,'' he said Tuesday. ``Until this case, we were lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian Interior Ministry officials have insisted that Vlasov
was released after a special operation mounted with the aid of
troops from Ingushetia, without the participation of any Chechen
forces. However, Chechen officials contend that in this case, too,
a ransom was paid. ``Money has been paid in every case,'' said
Sharip Yusupov, a Chechen living in Moscow, who for five years was
Chechnya's representative in the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Yusupov said he thought the brazen killing of the four
telecommunications specialists was a sign that the kidnappers no
longer expect to get ransom money from Russian officials. ``The
kidnapping industry is no longer profitable,'' he said, ``which
left these people without a `master.' They were caught in a
squeeze.''
</P>
<P>
   According to another theory, the kidnappers may have killed
their victims because they feared they were about to be caught.
Maskhadov, at a news conference in Grozny Tuesday, said that a
captured suspect had begun to give information last week about the
location of the kidnappers. In London, a spokesman for Granger
Telecom, the British company that employed the men, said they had
had word last week that the hostages were safe.
