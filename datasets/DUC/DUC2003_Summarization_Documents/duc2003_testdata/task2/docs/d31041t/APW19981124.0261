	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Ailing Philippine Airlines and
prospective investor Cathay Pacific Airways have clashed over the
laying off of PAL workers, prompting PAL to revive talks with
another foreign airline, an official said Tuesday.
	   PAL earlier accepted a preliminary investment offer from Cathay
Pacific, and the companies announced Nov. 10 that they would draw
up a comprehensive plan to rehabilitate the Philippine flag
carrier.
	   President Joseph Estrada's executive secretary, Ronaldo Zamora,
said the two airlines have disagreed on how many of PAL's more than
8,000 workers should be laid off to make the airline viable.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said that Hong Kong-based
Cathay Pacific wants to trim PAL's work force to about 5,000, but
PAL chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan did not want to cut
the number of workers below 8,000 to avoid antagonizing the
company's unions.
	   Cathay Pacific also wants to lay off about 200 PAL pilots, a
proposal also opposed by Tan, Zamora said. Tan wants to retain the
200 pilots because they stood by him when the majority of PAL's
pilots staged a devastating strike in June.
	   Tan has gone to the United States to try to revive talks with
Northwest Airlines, which earlier expressed interest in investing
in PAL, Zamora said.
	   Zamora said Northwest was larger than Cathay Pacific ``and maybe
its first action would not be to fire employees.''
	   PAL spokesman Rolando Estabillo did not comment on the reported
disagreement but said negotiations between the two companies were
continuing. He said Cathay Pacific was still studying PAL's
financial records.
	   Katherine Wang, a spokeswoman for Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong,
said it has not asked PAL to lay off workers. She said the
companies must first reach agreement on Cathay Pacific's entry into
PAL before such operational details can be discussed.
	   ``Our view is that the manpower requirements of PAL are to be
discussed over the long term. Cathay Pacific has no definite plan
as far as staffing is concerned,'' Wang said.
	   She declined to comment on Zamora's and Espiritu's statements
and said Cathay Pacific's negotiations with PAL ``will still carry
on.''
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 after failing to
persuade its largest union to accept a management-proposed recovery
plan under which its collective bargaining agreement would be
suspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of the
company's stock.
	   The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL to
resume domestic flights on Oct. 7 and international flights later.
As part of the plan, the union agreed to allow an unspecified
number of workers to be retrenched as long as the laid-off workers
get separation benefits agreed by both sides.
	   In June, PAL was embroiled in a crippling three-week pilots'
strike that brought the company close to financial ruin. At the
height of the strike, PAL laid off 5,000 of its 13,000 workers to
minimize its losses.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of
debt due to mounting losses worsened by its labor problems and
Asia's currency crisis.
