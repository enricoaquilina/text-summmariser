CONGRESS WORKS ON TAX-CUT PLAN THAT MAY WIN BIPARTISAN SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Republican plan for a big tax cut having
died without coming to a vote in the Senate, Congress scrambled
Friday to put together a far smaller tax package that could win
bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up hope that the Senate would act on an $80
billion, five-year Republican tax cut plan passed last month by the
House, the House Ways and Means Committee on Friday hurriedly
considered and then passed, on a unanimous voice vote, a narrow
bill to address some of the tax issues that both parties consider
most pressing.
</P>
<P>
   The package would extend a series of expiring tax credits,
accelerate an existing plan to allow self-employed people to deduct
100 percent of their health-insurance premiums and provide a break
to farmers who are hard hit by a downturn in agricultural prices.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the committee's chairman, said he
hoped that the bill would sail through the House, be adopted by the
Senate and be signed into law by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's plan, which could be voted on by the full House
as soon as Saturday, would cost $5.1 billion over five years and
$9.2 billion over 10 years. Unlike the original House plan, which
called for the $80 billion tax cut to be paid for out of projected
budget surpluses, the package approved Friday would be paid for by
raising other taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Archer's plan quickly hit a roadblock when the Senate
Finance Committee decided to draft its own legislation, which
differs in several small but important respects from the House
version. With Congress racing to deal with a long list of issues
before adjourning next week for the midterm elections, the
measure's fate in the Senate remained uncertain.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The end-of-session wrangling over small-bore and largely
technical tax issues was a long way from what Republicans had hoped
for throughout much of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by projections that the federal budget surplus would
rise substantially in the coming years, they debated cutting taxes
by hundreds of billions of dollars before scaling back their
aspirations in the face of strong opposition from the president,
congressional Democrats and some moderates within their own party.
</P>
<P>
   Even the $80 billion five-year plan passed by the House, though,
ran afoul of Clinton's demand that Congress set aside any budget
surpluses until the nation settles on a plan to deal with the
Social Security system's looming financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, in particular, feared that supporting any
tax cut that relied on the budget surplus would lead Democrats to
accuse them of endangering Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans never formally declared the $80 billion
package dead, with Majority Leader Trent Lott hinting all week that
he might still schedule a vote. But most Republicans have
acknowledged for some time that the bill would never pass the
Senate, largely because the parliamentary rules under which the
legislation would be considered would require 60 votes for it to
succeed. Republicans hold 55 seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed by the Ways and Means Committee would extend,
to the end of next year, a research and development tax credit
strongly favored by business executives. The Senate Finance
Committee's version would extend the credit only until the middle
of next year, but would also extend a number of other credits not
addressed by the House bill.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate versions would pay for the tax
reductions they include largely by closing a loophole used by real
estate investment trusts.
