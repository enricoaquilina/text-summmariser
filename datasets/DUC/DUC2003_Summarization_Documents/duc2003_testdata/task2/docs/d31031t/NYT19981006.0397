EDITORIAL: BUDGET SHOWDOWN IN WASHINGTON

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 7:
</P>
<P>
   In an atmosphere already bitter over impeachment proceedings,
President Clinton and Republican congressional leaders are heading
toward another nasty confrontation on the budget that threatens to
shut down the government.
</P>
<P>
   In this dispute, however, the White House has a strong hand.
Despite his political problems, Clinton is right to insist on
legislation free of objectionable attachments to keep government
operations going past Friday. The most offensive riders under
consideration would damage natural resources, cut programs for
schools and the poor and impose mischievous new curbs on abortion
and contraception.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the latest battle is that Republicans in Congress
have been mired in their own budget disputes all year, with
hard-line conservatives favoring domestic spending cuts, moderates
loath to provoke a veto by Clinton and their leaders reluctant to
hand him a fight that draws attention from his sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of Clinton's continued leverage, the Republicans caved
in Tuesday on the ill-advised $80 billion tax cut approved last
month in the House, which was to have been paid for out of this
year's budget surplus. The question now is whether they will come
to their senses on other destructive measures.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of grave financial crisis around the world, for
instance, it would be foolish to reject full funding for the
International Monetary Fund, which the Senate has already approved.
House Republicans should also back down on cuts in education
programs, fuel assistance for low-income people and gratuitous
gestures like the attempts to weaken the Federal Election
Commission or limit contraceptive coverage in federal employee
health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   As they have done in the past, Western Republicans in the Senate
have added more than 20 last-minute riders to the Interior
Department spending bill that would weaken protections for
fisheries, wilderness areas and national forests. House Republicans
have badly shortchanged the Everglades restoration program. Can
lawmakers be so out of touch that they would try to capitalize on
the president's political difficulties for a backdoor attack on the
environment?
</P>
<P>
   One of the more absurd contentions by Republicans is that they
need to cut programs to make funds available for such emergencies
as assistance to farmers, the troops in Bosnia and the crash
program to update the government's computers for the year 2000. But
Congress has long recognized that emergencies may be met without
cuts in spending elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the spending and environmental areas, at least, Clinton has
set out the right priorities. He should stick to them even if it
means vetoing unacceptable legislation and provoking a fight that
lawmakers do not want.
</P>
