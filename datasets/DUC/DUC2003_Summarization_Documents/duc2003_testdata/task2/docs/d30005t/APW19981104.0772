	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German police raided several locations near
Bonn after receiving word of a terrorist threat against the U.S.
Embassy, but no evidence of a planned attack was found, officials
said Wednesday.
	   Police, including agents of an elite anti-terrorist unit,
checked several suspects during raids in an industrial zone and
other sites Tuesday, but no arrests were made, said Eva Schuebel,
spokeswoman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe.
	   The agency said it had received ``credible information'' that
Middle East terrorists had stockpiled arms and explosives at the
sites, but none were found.
	   The agency's investigation is continuing, Schuebel said.
	   ``For now, we can no longer speak of an immediate threat to the
U.S. Embassy,'' she said.
	   The embassy had no comment.
	   Security was tightened at U.S. installations worldwide after the
Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Saudi
dissident Osama Bin Laden is wanted by U.S. officials for those
attacks.
	   A suspected top aide of bin Laden, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, is
jailed in Germany pending a U.S. extradition request, raising
concern about reprisals on German soil.
	   U.S. authorities charge Salim helped finance, train and arm
members of a terrorist organization, including the alleged bombers
of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   In September, German police stepped up security at the U.S.
consulate in Hamburg after receiving a tip about a possible threat.
