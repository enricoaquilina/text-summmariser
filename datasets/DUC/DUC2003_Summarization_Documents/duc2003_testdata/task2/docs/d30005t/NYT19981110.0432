   NEW YORK _ A federal district judge agreed Tuesday to review
complaints by lawyers for three men arrested after the bombings of
two U.S. embassies in Africa that their jail conditions in
Manhattan are unconstitutional and inhumane.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Leonard Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan said he
had received an eight-page letter from lawyers for two of three
defendants in custody in Manhattan. The lawyers complained that
their clients were being held in total isolation for almost 24
hours a day in a unit called 10 South, the most restrictive holding
area in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are allowed only brief periods of exercise in a
barren room, called the rat cage, a defense lawyer, Michael Young,
wrote in the letter. A second lawyer, Leonard Joy, concurred with
the views in the letter, which was made public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to review the conditions, Sand said, ``Certainly it
has to be addressed, that is, the condition of confinement for all
of the defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge made his comments in the first hearing in the bombing
case since last week's indictment by a federal grand jury of Osama
bin Laden, who the authorities believe was the mastermind of the
embassy attacks. Bin Laden remains at large and is believed to be
living in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban, the
Islamic fundamentalist movement that rules that country.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing conditions at the Manhattan jail, the lawyers said
that two of the defendants have not been able to call their
families, while the third has been allowed to make only one phone
call. The lawyers added that the defendants cannot have visitors,
write letters, or receive mail or books.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmishing continued in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot give my client a dictionary,'' a third lawyer, Bruce
McIntyre, who represents Wadih el Hage, told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage has been charged with conspiring to kill Americans
abroad and has been described by the government as a former
personal secretary to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The two other defendants in court Tuesday _ Mohammed Saddiq Odeh
and Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali _ have each been charged with
separate counts of murder in the deaths of more than 200 people in
the embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7.
</P>
<P>
   All three men have pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Fitzgerald, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the judge
that the government would have a response by Friday, and his
comments suggested that the government will be prepared to make
some modifications in the restrictions.
