	   MARIJA BISTRICA, Croatia (AP) _ Bestowing on him the ``radiant
badge of martyrdom,'' Pope John Paul II on Saturday honored
Croatia's World War II cardinal, a hero to Roman Catholics, but
long a symbol of divisions in the Balkans.
	   Before a huge crowd spread over several muddy hillsides
overlooking Croatia's main shrine to the Virgin Mary, John Paul
beatified Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, elevating him to the last
step before possible sainthood.
	   More than 400,000 people stood solemnly under damp trees at the
open-air site, as far as a kilometer (half-mile) from the altar.
	   John Paul appealed to a country that has suffered from war and
ethnic divisions ``to forgive and reconcile and to purify one's
memory of hatred'' and ``the desire for revenge.''
	   The pope said Stepinac ``having endured in his own body and his
own spirit the atrocities of the communist system is now entrusted
to the memory of his fellow countrymen with the radiant badge of
martyrdom.''
	   Stepinac was hailed as a hero by Catholics for his resistance to
communism and refusal to separate the Croatian church from the
Vatican. But his beatification, the last step before possible
sainthood, is controversial because many Serbs and Jews accuse him
of sympathizing with the Nazis.
	   While serving as Zagreb's archbishop in 1941, Stepinac supported
Croatia's German-backed fascist puppet government led by dictator
Ante Pavelic. By 1942, however, Stepinac denounced the regime's
genocidal policies, which led to the extermination of thousands of
Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents.
	   He died at 62 in 1960 while under house arrest following his
conviction on charges of collaborating with the Nazis. Stepinac's
own notes and recent studies say he spoke out against the
atrocities, and worked to save lives, but many Serbs still consider
him a war criminal.
	   The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a U.S.-based Nazi-hunting group,
also had asked the Vatican to postpone the beatification pending
further study of the cardinal's actions, although some local Jews
defended Stepinac.
	   John Paul addressed the criticism in his homily, quoting from a
1943 address by the cardinal condemning injustices and the killing
of innocents. He said Stepinac's figure summed up ``the whole
tragedy which befell the Croatian people and Europe in the course
of this century marked by the three great evils of fascism,
national socialism and communism.''
	   ``He is now in the joy of heaven, surrounded by those who, like
him, fought the good fight, purifying their faith in the crucible
of suffering,'' said John Paul, speaking from an altar before a
5-meter (15-foot) high portrait of Stepinac.
	   The pope, who battled communism in his own Polish homeland,
stressed Stepinac's treatment by Yugoslavia's communist regime
after the war, saying the last 15 years of his life ``were a
continual succession of trials.''
	   Some 80 percent of Croatia's 4.7 million population is Catholic,
and the Vatican looks at the country as a Catholic bastion in the
Balkans, amid Orthodox Christians and Muslims.
	   Stipe Dorotic, a 38-year electrician from eastern Croatia, who
attended the ceremony said hoped that the beatification ``will
enable Croats to face the future with more confidence and faith.''
	   Croatia was a part of communist-run Yugoslavia until 1991, when
it proclaimed independence. The Vatican was one of the first states
to recognize its independence.
	   The secession of Croatia, and later of neighboring Bosnia, led
to bloody wars in which tens of thousands of people were killed.
	   It is John Paul's second visit to Croatia, following a 1994
pilgrimage. He flew to Sarajevo last year, realizing his desire to
pay tribute to those who suffered during the war.
	   He also toured Slovenia in the former Yugoslavia, but has not
been to Serbia, apparently because of resistance from Orthodox
leaders.
