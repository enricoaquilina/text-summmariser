POPE CALLS FOR PEACE AND INTERNATIONAL AID IN THE BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>

   SPLIT, Croatia _ At a seaside mass here Pope John Paul II called
for reconciliation throughout the former Yugoslavia and urged the
world to do more for the victims of the Balkan war that ended not
long ago in Croatia and that has most recently raged in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could we not recall with anxious concern the continuing
tragedy taking place in nearby Kosovo?'' the pope asked from a vast
podium built to look like a ship's prow before hundreds of
thousands of believers squeezed along the shore and onto boats
bobbing in the water. ``May understanding, mutual respect,
forgiveness and reconciliation at last take the place of violence
and destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged the international community to ``not fail to provide
its timely help.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit was joyously welcomed by Croats and the
nationalist government of President Franjo Tudjman. Tudjman's
popularity has waned even among Catholics under his strong-armed
leadership and the country's economic and social troubles. The
archbishop of Zagreb, Monsignor Josip Bozanic, 49, who was
appointed a year ago, has frequently spoken out against corruption
in the government and other failings.
</P>
<P>
   The Croatian president took every opportunity to place himself
at the pope's side during the three-day visit. He had a private
audience on Saturday afternoon in his residential palace in Zagreb,
a modernist glass-and-brick house built for Tito in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope did not give his host a blank check. At the mass,
and later in his farewell remarks at the airport, John Paul II
rather pointedly called on Croats to make ``society and its civil
institutions more democratic'' in a country that is rarely
described as open and free.
</P>
<P>
   ``After long years of dictatorship and the terrible experiences
of violence which the peoples of this region have undergone,'' the
pontiff said at the airport, ``it is now necessary to make every
effort to construct a democracy based on the moral values inscribed
in the very nature of the human being.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the visit, however, the pope's attention was focused
on another, more remote conflict, namely the Catholic Church's
struggle against Communism during the Cold War, which the
Polish-born pope experienced first-hand. The pope arrived in
Croatia, a country of 4 million that is more than 75 percent
Catholic, on Friday to beatify one of Croatia's national heros,
Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who was persecuted by Tito after World
War II and died under house arrest in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Beatification is the final step before sainthood, and the homage
was highly controversial. Though many historians say that Stepinac
helped save the lives of hundreds of Jews and others during the
war, he was tried as a Nazi collaborator by the Communists. He is
still viewed by Orthodox Serbs as the symbol of the Croatian
Catholic Church's complicity with the Ustashe, the World War II
fascist regime that killed tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of
Serbs, Jews and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Tudjman government has sought to rehabilitate the Ustashe
regime as the founder of the modern, independent Croatian state.
Croatia's centuries-old Serbian minority has mostly left or been
driven out of Tudjman's state.

   In 1994, when the pope made his first papal visit to Croatia,
the country was still in the throes of a war started when Croatia
broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991 and lost a third of its
territory to Serbs. Earlier this year, the United Nations returned
control of the last Serb-dominated area in Croatia, Eastern
Slavonia, to the Croatian government. Prosperity has not yet
returned along with the fragile peace.
</P>
<P>
   As the pope lamented Croatia's tragic past and uncertain
present, he also reminded Catholics not to follow the West too
closely in its search for a better future. At a meeting with the
Croatian Bishop's Conference after the Sunday mass, John Paul II
reminded Croatian church leaders to keep followers in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, in the new democratic climate, it is necessary to give
strong support to the new evangelization, so that the human person,
the family and society as a whole will not be harmed and fall into
the trap of consumerism and hedonism'' the pope said.
