   TRIPOLI, Libya _ Outwardly at least, nearly everything on
display in Libya these days seems calculated to project defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Posters plastered on downtown streets mock six years of U.N.
sanctions, hailing as heroes African leaders who have flown to
Libya in violation of an international ban on air travel here.
</P>
<P>
   The new backdrop for state television broadcasts is now a map of
Africa, not the Arab world, a slap at Arab neighbors accused of
being too timid to join Libya's quest to get the sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
   A sign affixed to the seaside Grand Hotel captures the spirit
exactly, if ungrammatically. ``Hand's Off Libya!'' it declares.
</P>
<P>
   And yet behind this stubborn facade there are indications that
the Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, might at last be close to
accepting a compromise that could bring an end to his country's
isolation, imposed for its failure to hand over two suspects wanted
in the bombing of Pam Am flight 103 over the tiny Scottish village
of Lockerbie in 1988, in which 270 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has sent mixed signals about it, Gadhafi may be
carefully weighing a deal, proposed in August by the United States
and Britain, that would require Libya to surrender the two suspects
for a trial in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has agreed to the offer in principle, after many years of
refusing to hand the suspects over for trial in Britain or the
United States. But it is insisting on certain guarantees, including
a promise that the suspects would serve their sentences in the
Netherlands or Libya if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tripoli-based diplomats say they believe that Gadhafi is
sincere in wanting to go forward with the arrangement, in part
because many ordinary Libyans have begun to get fed up with the
U.N. penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite sure that the Libyans want to solve the problem,'' a
Western ambassador here said. ``Perhaps at the beginning the
embargo didn't make things too hard for the regime. But over time,
I think, it's becoming harder and harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. sanctions ban only international flights to and from
Libya and the sale of arms and certain other restricted goods.
Other trade, including oil, moves freely between Libya and other
countries by road and sea.
</P>
<P>
   If Libya does not agree to the U.S.-British proposal, the
Security Council has warned that it will consider tightening
sanctions further, with measures that could include a ban on
Libya's sales of oil.
</P>
<P>
   But because backing even for the current measures is clearly
withering not only in Africa but in other countries around the
world, it is far from clear that the Security Council could make
good on that threat. That raises the possibility that even with
discomfort at home, Gadhafi may ultimately conclude that his best
option is to wait the crisis out.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, one clear indication that Libya is acting in
earnest, diplomats say, is the government's dismissal in September
of a lawyer, Ibrahim Legwell, who for seven years headed the
suspects' defense team.
</P>
<P>
   Legwell had criticized the U.S.-British proposal as inadequate,
and in an interview in his offices here, he said that the fact that
he had been replaced reflected a desire for greater flexibility.
``It seems that the government doesn't like somebody who says no,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A new team of lawyers, headed by Kamel al-Makhour, traveled to
New York in October to discuss with U.N. legal officials the
arrangements for a possible trial. And in their first televised
appearance in four years, the two Libyans accused of carrying out
the bombing told the London-based Arabic-language satellite channel
MBC in October that they were ready to stand trial if their safety
was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published on Oct. 18 in the Sunday Times of
London, Gadhafi was quoted as saying that he wanted to see an end
to confrontation with the West over the Lockerbie case. ``Our
people want peace,'' he said. ``They want to be friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In another interview, broadcast on Oct. 22 on the BBC, the
Libyan leader Gadhafi distanced himself from whoever may have
carried out the 1988 bombing, saying that the bombers may have been
taking ``their own revenge'' against the United States for its 1986
air and missile raid on Libya.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the fate of the two suspects, Abdel Basset Megrahi
and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, who the United States and Britain have
said were Libyan intelligence agents. The two were indicted in 1991
after an investigation concluded that they had carried out the
bombing by planting an explosive in a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Their former lawyer, Legwell, said that the two men had spent
the last six years ``not in custody exactly'' but without passports
and suspended _ albeit with pay _ from their jobs with Libyan Arab
Airways.
</P>
<P>
   After Libya refused to extradite the two, Britain and the United
States successfully pushed for the U.N. sanctions, which were
imposed in 1992 and include a ban on arms sales and all
international flights. But those measures have failed to persuade
Gadhafi to hand over the suspects and, in the meantime,
international support for the sanctions has withered in some
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi himself has violated the flight ban on several
occasions, but the United Nations has responded with little more
than a scolding. And in the last two months, several African
leaders _ including the heads of state of Niger, Chad, Mali, the
Central African Republic, Eritrea, Gambia and Uganda _ have
defiantly traveled to Libya by plane, acts that were officially
condoned by the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-member Arab League has been less daring, trying to serve
as an intermediary in discussions with Britain and the United
States, but choosing at a meeting last month not to flout the
sanctions. It was that decision that infuriated Gadhafi, who during
his 29 years in power has always been an ardent proponent of Arab
unity.
</P>
<P>
   Within a matter of days, the Libyan leader pronounced that ``the
Arab world is finished,'' the map of the Arab world was removed
from state television, and the government announced that it had
eliminated its Ministry of Arab Unity. This week it even advised
the Arab League that it had decided to downgrade its ``permanent''
status at the organization to that of a ``resident delegation.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews here, Arab and Western diplomats acknowledged that
such pique underscored an unpredictability that made it impossible
to know whether Gadhafi would ultimately accept the U.S.-British
plan. But they said they believed that Gadhafi had been genuinely
surprised by the offer, extended on Aug. 24.

</P>
<P>
   Although the plan is essentially the same one Gadhafi himself
long proposed, the Libyan leader initially dismissed it as one
bound to be ridden with tricks. It calls for the two suspects to be
tried in the Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law and
promises that the U.N. sanctions will be lifted as soon as the
suspects are surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has described the offer as non-negotiable. But
the Libyan leader has raised many questions, including how the
appeals would be handled, where the suspects would be imprisoned if
convicted, and how their rights would be protected.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say they believe that Gadhafi is plainly concerned
that the two men will be used by prosecutors to make a case against
Libya itself, which some in the West believe had a hand in the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they say, any Libyan reluctance to accept the deal is
almost certainly counterbalanced by worries that a refusal might
well prompt the United Nations to make good on a threat to tighten
the sanctions, which Libyans see as less and less tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   One Libyan government official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, conceded in an interview that if Libyans were asked
their frank opinion, the vast majority would say that the suspects
should be surrendered to bring an end to sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   While the sanctions do not bar Libya from selling oil, which
provides 95 percent of its export earnings, they have made life
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of arms and certain other goods, including airplane parts,
are prohibited, and domestic air service within Libya _ with a
territory larger than Alaska _ has ground nearly to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   And since international air travel is also banned, Libyans who
want to travel abroad must begin their journey either by ferry, on
an overloaded vessel that makes an overnight crossing from Tripoli
to the Mediterranean island of Malta, or with an arduous overland
journey across the border into Egypt or Tunisia.
