Reports say three top Libyan officials jailed in Lockerbie case
</HEADLINE>

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Newspapers reported Wednesday that three top
Libyan officials have been tried and jailed in the Lockerbie case,
but Libyan dissidents said the reports appeared to be a political
ploy by Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
	   An Egyptian source, who like the Libyans spoke on condition of
anonymity, said he heard nothing about any such trials during
meetings with leading officials on a just-ended trip to the Libyan
capital Tripoli.
	   The reported jailing of the three officials comes as Gadhafi is
under pressure to accept a plan to turn over for trial two other
Libyans wanted for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that led to 270 deaths.
	   Two London newspapers, The Guardian and the leading Arabic daily
Al-Hayat, reported Wednesday that three top intelligence chiefs at
the time of the airliner bombing had been convicted and imprisoned
in Libya.
	   The Guardian said Abdullah al-Senussi, Musa Koussa and Mohammed
al-Misrati were sentenced to between five and seven years in prison
earlier this month.
	   Quoting ``well-placed sources,'' the Guardian said the charge
filed against the three was ``dereliction of duty'' but gave no
further details.
	   Al-Hayat's report said it had questioned Libyan Justice Minister
Mohamed Belgasim al-Zuwiy about the purported trials, but he had
replied only ``trials are going on all the time.''
	   Both the Guardian and Al-Hayat suggested that the jailing of the
three was aimed at blocking their testimony at a trial of the two
Libyan suspects which, under a plan approved by the U.N. Security
Council, would be heard by Scottish judges in the Netherlands.
	   After refusing for years to turn over the two men for trial in
the United States or Britain, Libya recently accepted in principle
the proposed trial in The Hague, Netherlands, but has delayed in
actually turning over the two suspects.
	   The two suspects accused by the United States and Britain, Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, were allegedly
Libyan intelligence agents.
	   The Libyan dissidents said the jailings were probably a total
invention leaked by Gadhafi's government.
	   One dissident said the three men had been close associates of
Gadhafi for decades and were ``too valuable for Gadhafi to dispose
of them.''
	   Al-Senousi was head of the Libyan intelligence service and
Koussa was in charge of its foreign operations during the 1988
bombing. The third man, al-Misrati, was a senior official in the
Revolutionary Committees, Gadhafi's ruling party.
	   The dissidents said Gadhafi's long resistance to turning over
the two suspects stemmed from fear that their testimony would
directly implicate his government in the bombing.
	   Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 to force it to
hand over the two defendants in the Lockerbie case. The sanctions
include a ban on air links with Libya, an arms embargo and a
partial ban on the sale of oil equipment.
