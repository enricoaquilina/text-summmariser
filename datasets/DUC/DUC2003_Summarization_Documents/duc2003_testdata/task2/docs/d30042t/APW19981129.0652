Nation of Islam leader meets Gadhafi

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Louis Farrakhan, the leader of a U.S. Muslim
group, met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday and
congratulated him on his recovery from a hip injury, state-run
Libyan radio reported.
	   Improved health will enable Gadhafi to ``carry on his leading
role in the service of Islamic causes in the world,'' Farrakhan was
quoted as saying by the radio, monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp.
	   Later, state-run television showed Gadhafi _ dressed in a brown
robe and holding a cane _ meeting Farrakhan at his ceremonial tent
in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The broadcast was monitored in
Cairo.
	   Gadhafi underwent surgery last July after injuring his hip,
reportedly while exercising.
	   The visit was Farrakhan's fifth to Libya in the past three
years. The leader of the U.S.-based Nation of Islam most recently
visited in December 1997.
	   It was not immediately clear how Farrakhan arrived in Libya or
how long he would stay. Most visitors arrive by ferry from Malta or
travel overland from Egypt or Tunisia; U.N. sanctions imposed in
1992 ban air travel to and from the country.
	   Farrakhan repeatedly has urged an end to the sanctions, which
were imposed to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans
wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Citing the sanctions and U.S. regulations, the Treasury
Department prohibited Farrakhan from accepting a dlrs 250,000 prize
he was awarded by Gadhafi in September 1996 for human rights work.
The Treasury also barred his group from accepting Gadhafi's offer
of a dlrs 1 billion gift for Nation of Islam activities.
