ECONOMIC LEADERS DIFFER IN STRATEGY ON CRISIS

   WASHINGTON _ As financial leaders from the world's major
economies, as well as from many of the most shell-shocked, gathered
Saturday for talks, the Clinton administration faced unusual
challenges from Europe, Japan and emerging-market nations, which
are all arriving with different and even contradictory strategies
for stabilizing the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The clash of approaches, which began to play out as Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin sat down Saturday morning with Japan's
finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, reflects both the extraordinary
tension and the behind-the-scenes power struggles under way as the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank open their annual
meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   After months of market plunges, currency devaluations, bank
failures and bankruptcies around the globe, governments are
searching desperately for some kind of coordinated approach that
can halt some of the most virulent economic turmoil in half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   But it will not be easy, officials concede. As the meetings
opened, Miyazawa announced a $30 billion Japanese program to aid
stricken countries throughout Asia. The program includes government
loans, the purchase of bonds issued by Asian nations and guarantees
that private bank loans will be repaid.
</P>
<P>
   While Southeast Asian countries immediately hailed the move, the
Clinton administration's response was lukewarm. Rubin had said on
Friday, even before the announcement, that Japan's action was
``constructive,'' but that getting its own banks in order and its
huge economy restarted was ``by vast multiples more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa, a former prime minister who has 40 years of experience
dealing with the United States, shot back Saturday that President
Clinton's proposals for new strategies on how the IMF could choke
off crises before they start ``would not be very convincing unless
the United States' commitments to the IMF are lived up to.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Congress' refusal so far to approve $18
billion in new money for the fund, an issue that Senate and House
conferees will be debating as the meetings go on here this week.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will take the unusual step of participating
directly on Monday in a critical meeting of finance ministers and
central bankers from 22 nations. And on Tuesday he will speak to
the entire IMF, which represents 182 nations, in his second major
speech on the world economy in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton set the urgent tone of the meetings on Friday, when he
declared that the world was on a ``financial precipice.'' But
Clinton, who last spring was resisting advice that he become far
more publicly involved in managing the world's financial chaos,
insisted that it was not too late to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to have a worldwide recession if those of us
that enjoy growth will take the initiative and move now,'' he said
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic initiative to stop the financial contagion may come
within days as the IMF, the Treasury Department and Brazil's
finance minister, Pedro Malan, put the final touches on a package
of $30 billion or more to stabilize the Brazilian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin met with Malan at the Treasury late on Friday, and there
was considerable speculation that the package could be announced as
soon as voting is completed on Sunday in Brazil's presidential
election. The vote is expected to result in the re-election of
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say they fear that a financial
meltdown in Brazil would take the rest of Latin America with it,
and bring the crisis to the United States' own borders.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the cacophony of competing ideas suggests that it
will be extraordinarily difficult to get nations facing a varied
array of problems _ deep recession and mass unemployment in
Southeast Asia, political paralysis in Russia and Indonesia, huge
bank failures in Japan, an incipient currency crisis in Brazil, but
continued prosperity in Western Europe and the United States _ to
settle on a common agenda.

<P>
   The United States, for example, is insisting that there be no
backing away from a decade-long move toward freer and more open
financial markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the Japanese and Southeast Asians are talking about
``capital controls'' that would reimpose government regulation
preventing investors from moving billions in short-term investments
from one country to another with a few taps on the computer
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The French, meanwhile, want to increase the power of the
committee that oversees the IMF, while Russia is threatening to
default on its loans unless it is quickly given billions that the
fund suspended when President Boris Yeltsin fired his team of
economic reformers and violated the terms of his accord for Western
aid.
</P>
<P>
   A senior IMF official said last month that Russia's threats are
``a form of blackmail, but the enormous turbulence touched off by
the Russian financial debacle in September gives real teeth to
Russia's threats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Rubin are hoping to craft their own strategies to
calm the financial markets and keep the worst effects of the
recession from hitting U.S. shores, where exports and corporate
profits are already badly affected.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate of those strategies would allow the IMF to
launch pre-emptive strikes to bolster the finances of fundamentally
healthy economies where the global economic contagion seems likely
to hit next.
</P>
<P>
   Currently the fund intervenes with billions in emergency aid
only after disaster strikes and investors are fleeing. But by that
time, the country's currency is already under heavy attack, and
putting together a bailout can cost far more and often involves
austerity measures _ from budget cuts to sky-high interest rates _
that lead to soaring unemployment and political backlash.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposal will first be debated by the Group
of Seven industrial nations and then, if it gathers much support,
by a larger meeting of 22 nations, including most of the major
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Japanese official noted Saturday that the
president's plan ``seems aimed mostly at Latin America'' and
probably would ``not meet a lot of enthusiasm in Europe and Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the Europeans are debating how to respond to calls
from Washington for a lowering of interest rates, a step Japan and
the United States have already taken _ though with the most modest
of reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Brown, Britain's finance minister, hinted late in the
week before last that London may follow suit. But Germany,
traditionally far more concerned about inflation, has declined to
follow suit. The German government is playing an unusually small
role here as its incoming chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, prepares
to assemble an economic team.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast Asian nations _ which only five years ago were the
subject of a much-discussed World Bank study called ``The East
Asian Miracle'' _ arrived here in shock and confusion about what to
do next. The first nation to be hit by trouble, Thailand, is mired
in difficulties, but looks good in comparison with most of the
region's other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia is suffering economic turmoil, and Indonesia's economy
is plunging so deeply into recession that the IMF is backing away
from many of its demands on its government.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my country,'' said one Indonesian during a
question-and-answer period at the opening session of the meetings
here, ``IMF means I'm Finished.''
