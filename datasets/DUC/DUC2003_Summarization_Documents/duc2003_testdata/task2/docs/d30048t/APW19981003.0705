	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States and other economic powers
moved ahead Saturday toward an overhaul of the world's financial
system to prevent widening market turmoil from pushing more
countries into recession.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac to lobby personally
for a set of proposals he put forward Friday. Central to the U.S.
idea is to use the International Monetary Fund to provide more
money, faster, to countries threatened with a flight of panicked
investors.
	   Blair and Chirac said they liked the U.S. approach, and other
countries as well have had favorable reactions in discussions with
administration economic officials, presidential spokesman Joe
Lockhart said.
	   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, who helped develop the proposals, sought the
endorsements of finance ministers and central bank presidents from
the world's seven richest countries.
	   After hearing Rubin explain the suggestion that new IMF credit
lines be established for countries threatened with investor flight,
Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters: ``He asked
me to support it, and I said I would.''
	   The Group of Seven meeting, at historic Blair House across
Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House was expected to be pivotal
in trying to develop strategies to halt a 15-month economic crisis,
as are sessions beginning Sunday of the 182-nation IMF and World
Bank. The World Bank generally loans money for development projects
in poor countries, and the IMF oversees rescue efforts for
countries experiencing financial difficulties.
	   A collapse of currencies and stock markets triggered by a flight
of foreign investment money has pushed several Asian nations into
steep recession, leveled the Russian economy and is now threatening
to strike Brazil and other nations in Latin America.
	   While other countries had their own ideas about how to address
the current market turmoil, Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin
said he believes the crisis' urgency is molding ``a growing
consensus about what needs to be done.''
	   Britain's top finance official, Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown, also sounded a note of urgency and suggested that the
Bank of England might act as early as next week to cut interest
rates. That would follow the lead of the Federal Reserve, which cut
a key U.S. rate by a quarter-point last Tuesday to help ward off
recession in the United States.
	   ``As we meet here in Washington, we are conscious that more than
a quarter of the world is in recession, that the second largest
economy in the world, Japan, is in recession and that the social
casualties of the Asian crisis are rising in numbers,'' Brown said.
He told reporters ``strong, decisive and united leadership'' is
needed to turn talk into action.
	   Finance ministers from 24 developing countries appealed for
lower interest rates from major industrial nations as a way to take
pressure off their foreign debt burdens and ``help restore
confidence in international finance markets.''
	   Still, it was far from certain that all differences will be
resolved in coming days. U.S. officials already have rejected a
French proposal to turn the IMF's interim committee into a more
permanent crisis-coordination body.
	   ``My guess is we won't find a silver bullet, but we will come
out with a process,'' World Bank President James Wolfensohn said.
	   The U.S. proposal does prescribe new money for the IMF but would
require Congress to approve the administration's request of dlrs 18
billion to replenish IMF resources depleted by the need to assemble
more than dlrs 100 billion in bailouts for Thailand, Indonesia,
South Korea and Russia.
	   That approval is in doubt given significant Republican
opposition in the House. GOP Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said
Clinton's call for quicker release of IMF money is precisely the
wrong approach for an agency that has failed so far to halt the
crisis from widening.
	   Other aspects of change being considered are to increase banking
supervision in poor countries and provide more loans to help
stricken corporations in crisis countries get back on their feet.
	   The United States also was pushing to get the IMF and other
donors behind a rescue for Brazil of perhaps dlrs 30 billion, which
could be announced soon after Sunday's presidential elections
there.
	   Rubin and Greenspan pressed the case for Japan to act more
forcefully in Saturday's discussions with Miyazawa. U.S. officials
have said troubled Asian countries cannot hope to resume growth
unless Japan cleans up its banking troubles and emerges from its
own recession.
	   In a Treasury statement, Rubin welcomed Japan's offer of dlrs 30
billion in new loans to support other Asian nations and said
Miyazawa ``explained his government's intention to take all
possible steps to promote financial stability.''
