   The New York Times said in editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has little time to
savor his apparent first-round re-election victory Sunday. He must
take rapid and unpopular steps to save the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilians voted for Cardoso because they trusted his economic
management more than that of his main rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva. da Silva, who leads the Workers Party, campaigned for a more
closed economy. His prescriptions struck many Brazilians as
well-meaning but unrealistic. But Cardoso avoided a runoff by the
smallest of margins, and his allies failed to win in many important
states. The new Congress, which will take office in February, is
likely to be less cooperative than the current one.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has made great economic strides under policies initiated
by Cardoso, first as finance minister and then as president.
Inflation, a perennial problem, has fallen from 3,000 percent a
year to around zero. As the economy has grown, many Brazilians have
prospered.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that success came from a policy of tying the Brazilian
currency, the real, to the dollar, and allowing it to fall about 7
percent a year. Unfortunately, it appears that the depreciation
rate was not enough to keep up with economic realities. Brazil has
been running a large trade deficit as well as a big budget deficit.
Now, with markets fearful, its debts have become crucial. More than
$300 million a day is draining out of the country despite interest
rates of 40 percent, which have stopped economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso and the Congress must take fiscal discipline seriously.
In May the Congress rejected his social security and civil service
reforms. Then he abandoned restraints during his election campaign,
and spending soared. Now Congress must simplify taxes and improve
income tax collection rates _ especially crucial because these
taxes will come from the better-off in a country with one of the
world's most unequal income distributions.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil must also control spending, especially on pensions for
the bloated public sector. Putting Brazil's finances in order will
be painful, but not as painful as economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund should calm investors by coming
up with a bailout to stem the hemorrhage of Brazil's reserves. But
it must be contingent on Brazil's own reforms. It is unlikely,
however, that the international community can find enough money to
support the overvalued real forever. The real will probably
eventually have to be devalued, but it is understandable that
Brazilians, who remember hyperinflation, fear an immediate and
perhaps uncontrolled devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The perception now is that Latin America could go the way of
Asia if Brazil sinks, and such perceptions can create their own
problems. There are good reasons for the world to help Brazil, but
Brazil must also deal with its own problems.
