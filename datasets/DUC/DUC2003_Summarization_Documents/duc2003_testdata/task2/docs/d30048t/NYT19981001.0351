   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ When Josue da Silva stepped up to the
consumer society four years ago, the ground underfoot felt solid
and endless.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years inflation in Brazil was under
control, and he and his wife had steady jobs. They moved out of a
cramped room behind a store into an apartment and signed to buy
furniture, appliances, a stereo system and even a car.
</P>
<P>
   But these days the foundation beneath da Silva is about the size
of his wife's shoes. Out of work since June, he relies on the $40 a
day that Mrs. da Silva earns cleaning houses, and he walks the
streets of Sao Paulo desperate for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed commitments that I don't have any way of getting out
of,'' da Silva, a former salesman in a building-supply store, said.
``How could I know that in 1998 I'd be stopped dead? Our lives have
turned around more than 800 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   As Brazilians prepare to vote on Sunday, polls predict that
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, highly acclaimed for putting
inflation under control, will handily win re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the voters' preferences is a kaleidoscope of doubts
and difficulties that Brazilians face as their economy grinds to a
virtual halt, and they prepare for the humiliation of ceding some
degree of sovereignty for an expected $30 billion in aid from the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The president's closest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, 52, a
union leader from the leftist Workers' Party, opposes the bailout
and says the administration lacks an effective industrial and
employment policy. Polls project that he will take 24 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   While presidents and prime ministers, central bankers and
economists debate whether low inflation should be a higher priority
than economic growth, Brazilians ask the same question on a deeply
personal level. After years of failed economic projects and
hyperinflation of more than 200 percent a month just four years
ago, Brazilians see the global future as inevitable, although they
are not sure where they will land in this modern borderless world
of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The middle of a storm is not the time to change the ship's
captain,'' said Emir Sader, a sociology professor at the University
of Sao Paulo and at the State University of Rio de Janeiro,
explaining the support for Cardoso. ``It doesn't mean the boat is
not sinking, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month Cardoso pledged to push Social Security and tax
overhauls through Congress and to thin the Civil Service rolls. His
plans mirror those that he made four years ago, which were partly
sacrificed because of his crusade for a constitutional amendment
that let him seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in trimming government spending heightened Brazil's
vulnerability to the credit problem that is affecting emerging
markets. The overnight doubling of effective interest rates to more
than 40 percent a year last month has stopped the economy in its
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden drain of confidence, vividly illustrated by the
steady exit of $30 billion in foreign reserves since Russia's
collapse last month, raised doubts about the direction of the
economy that Brazilians once thought was doing well.
</P>
<P>
   Nilton Bonder, a rabbi and the writer of ``The Kabbalah of
Money,'' said he felt as if Brazil had been seduced by
globalization as a first-world nation and had lowered trade
barriers without any strategy to modernize industry.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bonder noted, some companies in once formidable
industries like textiles and toys have slowed production and begun
importing from China, ``doing what's best for the company rather
than what's best for Brazil.'' He said he could not imagine what
Brazil's long-term global role would be.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, also questioned conventional economic wisdom, wondering
how setting up a country like Brazil for recession, with a steep
increase in interest rates and cutbacks in government services,
could be considered correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Structural reform is supposed to help the supply side of the
economy, not be a precondition for increasing demand,'' Krugman
wrote recently. He likened the solutions for saving Japan, South
Korea and other economies in crisis to ``trying to bail out a
sinking ship with teaspoons.''
</P>
<P>
   As the election approaches, Brazilians have hunkered down as if
for a tidal wave, expecting that the loss of employment, benefits
and government services, combined with the industrial slowdown,
will hit them all at once after Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Though nobody has laid out the details of Social Security
changes, pensioners like Nilton Tambara, 54, a retired metalworker,
fear becoming its targets.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso had proposed that age rather than the number of years
worked should determine eligibility for retirement. In a famous
gaffe this year he used the word ``bums'' to describe workers who
wanted to retire. Though Cardoso apologized for the remark, workers
like Tambara felt under attack.
</P>
<P>
   Tambara said he began working at 11 and paid into the Social
Security system for 33 of the 41 years that he had worked before
starting to collect his pension. He said Brazilian men, on average,
lived to 65.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazil is the ninth-largest economy in the world,
one-quarter of the adults live on one minimum salary of $110 a
month. Seven of 10 Brazilians who will vote next week have had less
than a primary-level education.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution of income, among the most skewed in the world,
continues in retirement, when 15 percent of those who collect
Social Security receive 50 percent of the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there any way to stay calm in this country?'' Tambara
asked. ``The categories that the government talks about _ the rich,
the middle class and the poor _ don't exist. It's just the rich and
the miserable.''
