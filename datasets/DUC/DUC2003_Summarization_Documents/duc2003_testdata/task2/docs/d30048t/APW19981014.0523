IMF executive says world economic motor still ticking

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The chief executive of the International
Monetary Fund said Wednesday there should be a slight improvement
in global economic fortunes next year spearheaded by Europe and the
United States.
	   Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, predicted world growth
of around 2.5 percent in 1999, creeping up from the recently
revised-down figure for this year of 2 percent.
	   Camdessus was in the Spanish capital to attend the fourth
meeting of the so-called Montevideo Circle, an informal gathering
of top ranking politicians and officials who annually hold a
behind-closed-door brainstorming session on Latin American issues.
	   The IMF chief told reporters that Europe and the United States _
``the two motors of the world economy'' _ were still going strong,
despite some slowdown in America and Great Britain.
	   He said Asia should be able to keep its economic head just above
water, avoiding negative growth next year.
	   Camdessus said the immediate task was to ensure that Latin
America weathered the financial storm that began in Thailand 15
months ago before spreading from Asia to precipitate Russia's
recent collapse.
	   ``It is a vital obligation to prevent the Latin domino from
falling,'' Camdessus said, praising Spain's recent offer to help
fund emergency credits to the region under threat from investor
flight.
	   He said he hoped other European countries with business
interests in Latin America _ such as Italy, France and Germany _
would follow the Spanish example.
	   The IMF and the Brazilian government are putting the final
touches to an emergency three-year-package that should be ratified
within weeks, Camdessus said. The package has been estimated to
total dlrs 30 billion.
	   ``Brazil will not collapse,'' he said, adding that Argentina and
Chile were among the keenest to see the IMF reach agreement with
their giant neighbor.
	   Less upbeat about Russia, Camdessus said the Fund was still
working toward a financing package, but that the government still
lacked a program. This, he said, would take time, and appealed to
governments to provide humanitarian aid in the interim.
	   The IMF has put together bailout packages totaling over $100
billion during what Camdessus called ``the most uncertain year
ever.''
	   He said the crisis has underlined the need for prevention, and
the transformation of the Fund's primary role away from that of
``the firefighter who arrives when the fire is already burning.''
	   Greater private sector involvement in the prevention and
resolution of future economic crisis would help, Camdessus said.
``Now, the private sector tends to run away and leave the work to
the governments,'' he said.
	   Camdessus also said he was aware of recent criticism of
excessive IMF secrecy, but he said his own efforts to open up the
Fund have been blocked by governments demanding discretion.
	   Camdessus said that those who viewed the crisis as a critique of
the Fund's promotion of world economic liberalization were
mistaken. The man who has headed the IMF for 12 years said that it
simply demonstrated the need to carry through liberalization
programs properly.
