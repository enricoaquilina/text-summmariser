CHINA DEFENDS ARREST OF PROMINENT DISSIDENT 
</HEADLINE>

   BEIJING _ In response to criticism from home and abroad, Chinese
officials broke their silence Wednesday to defend their arrest this
week of a prominent dissident who was trying to form an opposition
political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xu Wenli is suspected of involvement in activities damaging to
national security and has violated relevant criminal codes of the
People's Republic of China,'' said a statement from the Foreign
Ministry, which on Tuesday declined to comment on the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden arrest on Monday night of Xu, as well as several
other activists involved with him in trying to form the China
Democratic Party, set off strong protests from human rights groups,
other Chinese dissidents and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view his detention for peacefully exercising fundamental
freedoms guaranteed by international human rights instruments as a
serious step in the wrong direction,'' State Department spokesman
James P. Rubin said in Washington on Tuesday. &UR;  &LR;  U.S. officials in
Beijing urged the government to release Xu and asked for
clarification as to the exact nature of his crime.
</P>
<P>
   China signed the International Covenant of Civil and Political
Rights with great fanfare in October, and Xu's arrest is seen by
human rights groups as a test of the nation's commitment to its
tenets.
</P>
<P>
   Dissidents in and out of China rose to Xu's defense, with more
than a dozen activists around the country announcing that they
would begin fasts in support of Xu and another leader of the China
Democratic Party, Qin Yongmin, who was arrested in his home in
Wuhan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 200 dissidents signed a letter to the Chinese government
protesting the detentions, said the Information Center for Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Democratic Party organizers were also detained on
Monday, although two of them were released early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the two more prominent dissidents, Xu and Qin, are likely to
face a much longer haul since both have been charged with
``criminal acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu's wife, He Xintong, said Wednesday night that she had still
not been informed of the specific charge against her husband,
although she surmised from the aggressive behavior of the arresting
officers that the sentence ``could be long.''
</P>
<P>
   Qin's family was told that he was charged with ``plotting to
subvert the government,'' a crime that for serious offenses
commands sentences of three years to life.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the Chinese criminal code, this charge comes under a grab-bag
section called ``threatening state security,'' which makes almost
any political activity that questions or hampers the authority of
the Communist Party illegal, from ``violent or nonviolent
activities aimed at overthrowing the government authorities,'' to
``activities designed to change the basic nature of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu's and Qin's trouble almost certainly stems from their efforts
to gain recognition for the China Democratic Party, a loose network
of pro-democracy activists in more than a dozen cities around China
that was formed this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months they have become increasingly aggressive
and defiant in their attempts to register the party with the
government, submitting repeated applications even after local
authorities had declared the concept of an opposition party
illegal. They say the Chinese Constitution does not specifically
forbid the formation of new political parties, although there have
been no new parties since the founding of the People's Republic in
1949.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the by-laws of the China Democratic Party are fairly
tame; they carefully acknowledge the central role of the Communist
Party, but also support free speech and free elections for public
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband thought the time was right to begin working to form
a new party, since China recently signed the covenant on human
rights,'' Ms. He said. In September, a few Democratic Party members
got some slightly encouraging signals from local governments, which
initially accepted their applications to form a social organization
to develop a party. But in recent weeks, as organizers like Xu
became more insistent and defiant, harassment by the police
increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this past week we felt something was going to happen,''
Ms. He said. ``It seemed that anyone who came to visit us was later
detained for a while. And there have been a lot more cars from the
Public Security Bureau parked outside than is usual.''
