	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ More than 100 people held a
candlelight vigil outside the Indonesian Embassy Thursday,
demanding that President B.J. Habibie put an end to violence in
East Timor.
	   They shouted, ``Free East Timor!'' and held banners that read
``Stop Military Oppression!'' as a small group of police watched
nearby.
	   The peaceful protest in Kuala Lumpur was to commemorate the
anniversary of a 1991 massacre of anti-Indonesian protesters.
	   Seven years ago, Indonesian troops fired on pro-independence
protesters in Dili, the East Timor capital. A government report put
the death toll at 50. Human rights activists say about 200 people
were killed.
	   Earlier, a coalition of Asian activists denounced an offer by
Habibie to give East Timor some autonomy in exchange for
recognition of Jakarta's sovereignty over the region.
	   ``We call for the Habibie administration to take genuine steps
for a peaceful solution in East Timor,'' said Nadiah Bamadhaj, of
the Malaysian East Timor Solidarity Group.
	   The activists also urged the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
group to address the problem. APEC officials have begun meeting in
Kuala Lumpur ahead of the Nov. 17-18 summit.
	   ``There is still ongoing struggle in East Timor,'' said Gus
Miclat, of the Manila-based Asia-Pacific Coalition for East Timor.
``We hope the APEC leaders would address that.''
	   The coalition called for the release of the nearly 200 jailed
activists, including rebel leader Xanana Gusmao. He is serving a
20-year prison term for fighting Indonesian troops.
	   At the candlelight vigil, Miclat read aloud a message to the
protesters that he said was obtained from Xanana in prison.
	   In the letter, Xanana called Habibie's efforts ``an
unprecedented step,'' but said human rights abuses had to stop.
	   ``Jakarta must commit itself to ending the activities of its
soldiers, intelligence agents and paramilitary groups that continue
to terrorize the population,'' Xanana said.
	   Meanwhile, some 10,000 mourners gathered at a graveyard in Dili,
the provincial capital of East Timor, to lay flowers on the graves
of the dead. They lit candles as police watched from a distance.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troops
intervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days of
Portuguese rule.
