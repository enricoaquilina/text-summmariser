	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military said Friday that
it was ready to act against a threat from an East Timor rebel group
to launch terrorist attacks.
	   ``We will not tolerate any activity that threatens economic or
military installations in East Timor or elsewhere in Indonesia,''
said military spokesman Maj. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif.
	   In the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, an East Timorese group
opposed to Indonesian rule in the disputed territory said Thursday
that it was ready to resort to terrorism if Jakarta does not let
six East Timorese asylum-seekers leave the country.
	   Azancot de Menezes, the exiled Lisbon representative of the
Timor Socialist Party, said his group was ready to coordinate the
attacks with pro-independence guerrillas based inside East Timor.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, after the departure of
Portugal's colonial administration.
	   The pro-independence Timor Socialist Party wants Indonesia to
permit the departure of six East Timorese holed up in the Austrian
Embassy in Jakarta.
	   The party's secretary-general, Avelino da Silva, his wife and
two daughters ages 4 and 6, and two other East Timorese clambered
over the embassy compound's walls 14 months ago.
	   Indonesia's military have accused Da Silva and his wife of being
members of a bomb-making gang, known as the Black Brigade.
	   The group allegedly planned to blow up civilian targets in their
fight for East Timor's independence.
	   The Indonesian government has refused to let them leave the
country and says they should be prosecuted.
	   Meanwhile, military officials said an Indonesian soldier was
killed early Friday in Manufahi, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
southeast of Dili, East Timor capital.
	   The military blamed pro-independence rebels in the killing of
the native East Timorese soldier, whose name was still not known.
The rebels also took his gun, said Col. Suhartono Suratman, chief
of the local military.
	   Last Friday, two soldiers and one civilian were beaten to death
by pro-independence activists in Manufahi, he said, without giving
further details.
	   In Lisbon, Jamsheed Marker, the U.N. envoy for East Timor, said
late Thursday that Portugal and Indonesia are mulling a new United
Nations proposal that envisages broad autonomy for East Timor.
	   ``We've reached a very important, and I might even say critical,
moment in the talks,'' Marker told reporters.
	   Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to mediate a settlement
on East Timor, was on the second day of a three-day visit for talks
with Portuguese officials and East Timorese exiles.
