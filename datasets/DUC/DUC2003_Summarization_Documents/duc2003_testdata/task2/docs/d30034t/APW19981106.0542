East Timor settlement talks at pivotal stage, U.N. envoy says
</HEADLINE>

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal and Indonesia are mulling a new
proposal to settle their dispute over East Timor, and talks between
the two sides are at a crucial stage, according to a U.N. envoy.
	   Envoy Jamsheed Marker said late Thursday that the U.N. proposal
envisages broad autonomy for the disputed Southeast Asian
territory.
	   ``We've reached a very important, and I might even say critical,
moment in the talks,'' Marker told reporters after a dinner with
President Jorge Sampaio.
	   He said the U.N. plan includes ``a proposal for very
wide-ranging autonomy for East Timor,'' a former Portuguese colony
that Indonesia invaded in 1975 and later annexed.
	   Lisbon and Jakarta have agreed to discuss the proposal which was
``couched in legal terms'' and could provide the foundation for a
future Constitution for East Timor, Marker said, though he declined
to give further details.
	   Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to mediate a settlement
on East Timor, was on the second day of a three-day visit for talks
with Portuguese officials and East Timorese exiles.
	   After the May resignation of authoritarian President Suharto,
Indonesia proposed granting some degree of autonomy to the
territory of 800,000 people, but insisted on retaining control over
its defense, economic and foreign policy.
	   Portugal and East Timorese pro-independence groups rejected that
proposal and insisted a referendum be held inside the territory to
decide its future.
