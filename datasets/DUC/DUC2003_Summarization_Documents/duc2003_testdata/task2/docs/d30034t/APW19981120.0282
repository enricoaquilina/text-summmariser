Indonesian lawmakers chide Portuguese effort to extradite Suharto

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian legislators on Friday
chided a Portuguese effort to extradite former President Suharto,
describing the proposal as impossible and unreasonable.
	   Portugal's attorney general's office is examining a request from
lawmaker Nuno Correia da Silva that Suharto be extradited for
alleged human rights abuses committed in East Timor _ a former
Portuguese territory annexed by Indonesia in 1976.
	   Sara Pina, a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said his
office was looking at whether it's possible in Portuguese law.
	   Roestandi, a three-star general and chairman of the military
faction at Indonesia's Parliament, said such a handover would be
``impossible.''
	   ``Moreover, it is unreasonable because the East Timor issue is
an internal affair of Indonesia,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Aisyah Amini, chairperson of the Parliament's
commission dealing with foreign affairs, also criticized the
proposal.
	   ``The East Timor issue is not personal affair of Suharto, but
the problem of the nation,'' she said.
	   Suharto, 77, ruled Indonesia with an iron fist from 1966 to last
May when he was forced to quit following a wave of protests and
riots in which 1,200 people died.
	   Suharto's successor and onetime protege, President B.J. Habibie,
has offered to grant autonomy to the half-island territory in
return for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty
there.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, after
invading during a 1975 civil war that broke out when Portugal
colonizers left.
	   Indonesian troops have been accused of widespread abuses in East
Timor, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) east of Jakarta.
	   Correia da Silva of Portugal's rightist Popular Party likens the
bid to extradite Suharto with attempts in Britain to extradite
former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet to Spain on charges
that include genocide.
	   Pinochet is in London awaiting a House of Lords panel decision
on whether to extradite him.
