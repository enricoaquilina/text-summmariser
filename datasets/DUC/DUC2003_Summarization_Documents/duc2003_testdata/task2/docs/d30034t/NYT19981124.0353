   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia's National Commission on Human
Rights will investigate accusations that soldiers executed as many
as 50 people this month in the troubled province of East Timor in a
military operation against armed rebels, the government said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Marzuki Darusman, the commission's vice president, said a senior
commission member would investigate allegations of the executions
and of arbitrary arrests by the armed forces between Nov. 10 and
Nov. 16 in the subdistrict of Alas on East Timor's southern coast.
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigator would be Clementino Dos Reis Amaral, a
commission member from East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``very reliable sources,'' the former Portuguese governor
of East Timor, Mario Carrascalao, said Tuesday that he has been
told that 42 people had been executed and more than 40 wounded and
that 200 others were missing in the Alas area.
</P>
<P>
   Carrascalao, speaking in Jakarta, said he was willing to go
himself to help investigate the allegations. He said the area where
the killings were reported was also a site for resettlement of
Javanese under a contentious government program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know the real truth about what happened,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross said Tuesday that a
team it sent to the area had found ``no confirmation of large-scale
atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, the former colonial ruler of East Timor, suspended
U.N.-brokered talks with Indonesia in New York on Friday after
receiving the first reports that civilians had been killed in an
area where guerrillas are active. Carrascalao said the talks were
to resume today.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed the
following year in a move never recognized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the East Timor capital, Dili, as many as 2,000 East Timorese
students continue to occupy the local parliament building in
protest against the alleged killings by the Indonesian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian-based East Timor Human Rights Center, considered
the main watchdog group for East Timorese rights, issued a
statement Tuesday accusing the Indonesian military of executing 50
East Timorese and arresting 30 others, including two teen-age
girls. It said it had identified 14 of those killed and expressed
grave fears for the safety of the detainees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The killings and arrests in the Alas subdistrict have followed
the recent buildup of Indonesian troops in the area,'' the report
said, adding that the alleged killings may have been in retaliation
for an attack on the troops by rebels of the East Timorese Armed
Resistance in which three Indonesian soldiers were killed and 13
captured.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that following the rebel attack on Nov. 9,
troops attacked a village on Nov. 13, arresting and later killing
the chief and four other people.
</P>
<P>
   A report in the Dili-based newspaper Suara Timor Timur quotes
the Indonesian military chief of East Timor, Col. Tono Suratman, as
confirming the death of the chief, Vicente Xavier, and calling him
a ringleader of the rebel attacks.
