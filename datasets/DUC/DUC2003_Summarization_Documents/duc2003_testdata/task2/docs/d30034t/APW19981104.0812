United Nations envoy sees progress on East Timor dispute
</HEADLINE>

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A U.N. envoy said Wednesday he was
making progress in his efforts to mediate a settlement between
Portugal and Indonesia on the disputed territory of East Timor,
news reports said.
	   ``Progress has been made and we'll pursue the (East) Timor issue
with great commitment,'' United Nations mediator Jamsheed Marker
was quoted as saying by the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   Marker, who was appointed 20 months ago to break the
long-standing deadlock over East Timor, was in Lisbon for three
days of talks with government officials, lawmakers and exiled East
Timorese independence activists.
	   He said he was skeptical about recent reports of an Indonesian
army offensive against a small band of pro-independence guerillas
operating out of the jungle in East Timor's interior.
	   ``From what I know from the talks I've had with the Indonesian
authorities, I think it's quite unlikely they carried out such an
action,'' Marker was quoted as saying by Lusa.
	   East Timorese opponents of Indonesia's rule claimed Sunday that
some 2,000 Indonesian troops supported by helicopters launched an
attack on the rebels. Jakarta denied the claim.
	   Portuguese officials expressed concern about the reports, saying
they could undermine confidence-building measures.
	   Indonesia invaded the territory of 800,000 people in December
1975, a few months after the departure of Portugal's colonial
administration. It annexed the territory, 1,200 miles (1,900
kilometers) east of Jakarta, a month later.
	   The resignation of authoritarian Indonesian President Suharto in
May and the democratic changes introduced under his successor, B.J.
Habibie, have brought fresh impetus to negotiations for a solution.
