LEONID METEOR SHOWERS ARRIVE, THOUGH NOT EXACTLY AS EXPECTED

<P>
   The much-anticipated storm of Leonid meteors swept over Earth on
Tuesday, a bit ahead of schedule, leaving many sky watchers
disappointed but others dazzled by fireballs as bright as the full
moon.
</P>
<P>
   The Leonids, so named because they appear to come from the
constellation Leo, flash through the sky in large numbers every
year about this date, but once in about every 33 years the swarm is
often so dense that tens or hundreds of meteors are seen each hour.
</P>
<P>
   The last such storm was in 1966, and a good show was expected
this year. Another good Leonid display might occur a year from now,
astronomers have forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The Leonid meteors, most of them smaller than grains of sand,
are fragments knocked loose from Comet 55P/Temple-Tuttle each time
it makes a close approach to the Sun every 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from regions that were in nighttime darkness Tuesday
during the peak of the meteor storm suggested wide variations in
the storm's apparent intensity. But nowhere did the reported rate
of meteor sightings greatly exceed 2,000 per hour _ barely
one-tenth the rate at which meteors hit the atmosphere during the
great 1966 Leonid storm.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of damage to any of the roughly
600 satellites orbiting the Earth that are used for communications,
military surveillance, climate and weather monitoring, astronomy
and navigation. The odds of any given satellite being hit by a
meteoroid were calculated as about one in a thousand _ a small risk
but one that caused some concern because of the high value of many
satellites. Satellite experts said that some damage might take days
to detect, but that satellites generally seemed to have escaped
disabling harm.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts that the Leonids would put on their best show over
Japan and China were only partly realized; according to news agency
reports, people in parts of Thailand saw many bright meteor trails,
while the view from Tokyo was disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   The meteor display was unexpectedly good over southern Europe,
and came several hours earlier than predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge,
Mass., which is a worldwide clearinghouse for reports from
astronomers, said that observers at La Palma in the Canary Islands
saw about 2,000 meteors per hour at the peak. But observers in
Portugal counted only a few more than 300 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brian Marsden of the astrophysical observatory said the
Leonid display included an unusually high proportion of fireballs,
a few of which reached the brightness of the full moon during their
speedy crossing of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Interfax news agency reported that a meteorite weighing
several ounces was seen to land during the Leonid storm in front of
a car in the city of Rustavi in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But Marsden expressed doubt that the meteorite was part of the
storm. ``We sometimes see sporadic meteorites during these storms
that are not related to the main body of meteoroids,'' he said.
``This sounds like one.''
</P>
<P>
   Only very rarely is a meteoroid large enough and dense enough to
survive its fiery trip through the atmosphere and reach the ground.
Old records suggest, however, that as many as half a dozen people
(and one dog) may have been killed by meteors during the course of
human history. But there is ample geological evidence that huge
meteoroids have hit the Earth in the distant past, and probably
will again.
