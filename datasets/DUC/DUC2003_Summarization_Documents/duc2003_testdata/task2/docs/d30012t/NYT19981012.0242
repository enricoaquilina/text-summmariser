THE LEONIDS: A VIEWER'S GUIDE

<P>
   Unfortunately for residents of the United States, the Leonid
storm on Nov. 17 is expected to begin at 2:43 p.m. Eastern standard
time and is likely to last for only an hour or so.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, therefore, the entire show will be during
daylight hours and will be invisible, unless unusually bright
bolides, or exploding fireballs, flash through the sky.
</P>
<P>
   People in East Asia, however, will have ringside seats, and if
skies are clear, they are likely to witness a great meteor display
under ideal conditions: a dark, moonless night.
</P>
<P>
   Although some forecasters predict that there will be an even
better Leonid storm the next November _ actually, the second
installment of this year's storm _ it will be visible only from
Europe and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But the storm next month may include some especially bright
fireballs, said Joe Rao, a lecturer at New York's Hayden
Planetarium, in an article in the November issue of Sky &AMP; Telescope
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Some meteor enthusiasts and astronomers plan to travel to Asia
this year and to Europe in 1999 to see the events. The next chance
of a really spectacular Leonid show anywhere on Earth will not come
for another century.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States will not be the best vantage point
for Leonid watching on Nov. 17, people willing to get up a few
hours before dawn on that day and the next may see more meteorites
than they would on a normal night.
</P>
<P>
   The closest approach the Earth will make to the center of the
meteoroid swarm is 790,500 miles _ more than three times the
distance of the Moon from the Earth, but many dust fragments are
likely to stray into collisions with the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald K. Yeomans of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif., who tracks space objects of various kinds,
cautioned that spectators in the United States should not expect
too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think the Leonid storm this year will be as good
as the one in 1966, which was the best one this century, but we
think the 1998 shower will be more modest _ perhaps something
between 200 and 5,000 meteors per hour,'' Yeomans said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, sky watchers clocked a rate of up to 100,000 meteors an
hour at the peak of the Leonid storm.
</P>
<P>
   For meteor fans, Rao recommends watching the darkest part of the
eastern sky from about 1 a.m. until dawn, on both Nov. 17 and 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you do, set that alarm clock,'' he advised. ``Not
until 2098 or perhaps 2131 will hopes for a Leonid storm again be
justified.''
