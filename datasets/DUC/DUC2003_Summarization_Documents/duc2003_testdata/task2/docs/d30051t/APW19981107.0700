	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia must cooperate with a
U.N. war crimes panel investigating allegations of atrocities in
the rebellious Yugoslav province of Kosovo, a U.S. official said
Saturday.
	   ``In the U.N. Security Council, there is unanimous consent of
all its members that investigators ... have full authority to do
their job in Kosovo,'' said David Scheffer, the State Department's
war crimes envoy at a panel discussion held in Belgrade.
	   President Slobodan Milosevic has defied international pressure
to allow prosecutors from the Netherlands-based tribunal to enter
Kosovo, where hundreds have died in fighting that erupted in
Februrary between separatist ethnic Albanians and Yugoslav forces.
	   Tribunal investigators have said they want to look into claims
on atrocities on both sides.
	   Speaking at the round-table discussion organized by the
Belgrade-based nongovernmental Humanitarian Law Center, Scheffer
said there were reasons to believe that ``serious violations of
international law'' were committed in Kosovo.
	   Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour and a team of
investigators planned a weeklong mission in Kosovo to begin last
Wednesday but were refused visas.
	   Arbour and Scheffer have threatened Yugoslavia with U.N.
sanctions if the authorities continue to defy demands for unlimited
access.
	   ``Since February this year, between 600 and 1,000 people died in
Kosovo, many more were wounded,'' Scheffer said.
	   The tribunal maintains it has a legal right to carry out
investigations throughout Yugoslavia.
	   The wars in the former Yugoslav republics prompted the Security
Council to create the tribunal in 1993 with a mandate to prosecute
breaches of international humanitarian law committed anywhere in
the former Yugoslavia since 1991. Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the
largest of Yugoslavia's two remaining republics.
