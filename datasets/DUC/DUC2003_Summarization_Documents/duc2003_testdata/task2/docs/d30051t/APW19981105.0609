	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The president of the U.N. war
crimes tribunal angrily branded Yugoslavia a ``rogue state''
Thursday after Belgrade refused to allow investigators to probe
alleged atrocities in Kosovo.
	   Authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia confirmed they
would not allow Louise Arbour, chief prosecutor of the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal, and a team of investigators to carry out
investigations in the troubled region.
	   ``This conduct is a further example of the FRY's utter disregard
for the norms of the international community,'' said tribunal
president Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States.
	   ``Essentially, it has become a rogue state, one that holds the
international rule of law in contempt,'' she said.
	   Arbour would not say what her next step would be. She said her
visa request was a matter of courtesy and that she has a legal
right to carry out investigations throughout the former Yugoslavia.
	   Arbour had asked for visas for herself and 11 members of her
staff so that they could conduct on-site investigations and
interview witnesses. She vowed to continue investigating ``using
all means available to us,'' but did not elaborate.
	   Hundreds have been killed and hundreds of thousands made
homeless in seven months of fighting between Serb forces and
secessionist ethnic Albanian rebels in the southern Yugoslav
province of Kosovo. U.N. investigators want to check reports of
atrocities on both sides.
	   Kirk McDonald said she would report the non-issuance of visas to
the Security Council, which set up the tribunal in 1993, and urge
it to take ``forceful'' action to force Belgrade into line.
	   ``In the final analysis, it is clear to me that I have an
obligation, now that the prosecutor has reported non-compliance, to
bring this matter to the Security Council,'' Kirk McDonald said.
	   She said Belgrade's defiance of the tribunal amounted to ``a
challenge to the authority of the Security Council'' which has
ordered a tribunal investigation of alleged atrocities in Kosovo
and told Yugoslav authorities to cooperate.
	   The visa holdup prompted Kirk McDonald, of Texas, to cancel a
planned visit to Belgrade to speak to a conference on war crimes
trials.
	   ``This move by the Yugoslav government will have serious legal
consequences,'' said Natasa Kandic, chairwoman of the Humanitarian
Law Center organizing the conference.
	   ``With it, the Yugoslav government acted directly contrary to
the U.N. Security Council Resolution demanding free access to
international investigators to Kosovo,'' she said. ``Relations
between the tribunal and authorities here have now become strained
in the extreme.''
