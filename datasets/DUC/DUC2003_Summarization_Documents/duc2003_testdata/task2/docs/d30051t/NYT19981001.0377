   GOLUBOVAC, Yugoslavia _ A 42-year-old man who says he is the
lone survivor of a massacre in which 13 ethnic Albanians were
summarily shot and killed in this village in Kosovo recalled
Thursday how he was herded into a garden with other men and told to
lie flat on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Heads to the fence, feet toward the house! Serbian policemen
barked, he recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the severely wounded man said as he recounted the tale
from his mattress on the floor of his home Thursday, police kicked
the prone men with their boots and beat them with the wooden
handles of shovels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept yelling, `Who among you is Kosovo Liberation Army?
If you tell us, we will release everyone else,''' the man recalled
of the events of last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, the shooting started. First, the man to his right
was shot, then two men farther down the row. And then the whole row
from left to right, then down the row again, from right to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the two shots for each man, they kicked one, and he was
alive.'' he said. ``They shot him again. When they kicked me, I
didn't move.''
</P>
<P>
   The survivor, the father of eight children, was advised by
Western diplomats who interviewed him on Tuesday and by a
researcher for Human Rights Watch who saw him Thursday not to give
his name to a reporter for fear of jeopardizing his safety.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats and the researcher for the New York-based rights
organization said the man could suffer reprisals from Serbian
policemen who are at checkpoints on the roads and in the hills
around the village if he revealed his identity.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that because of the clarity and first-hand nature
of the man's evidence, they consider him a key potential witness
for a proceeding at the international war crimes tribunal in The
Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of the men and the massacre of 18 members of an
Albanian family on the same day in villages about four miles apart
in the Drenica region of Kosovo, a province where guerrillas are
fighting for independence from Serbia, prompted calls from Western
leaders for war-crimes investigations by The Hague tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Washington called on the government of the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, to allow impartial forensic experts to visit
the sites to determine what happened. The Milosevic government has
denounced the war crimes tribunal and consistently denied access to
forensic experts, asserting that there was no need for them because
no war crimes had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Two investigators from the war crimes tribunal who have been in
Kosovo for a week were expected to see the survivor Thursday. But
the investigators who got into Kosovo, after long negotiations with
the Yugoslavia government for their visas, left for Belgrade, the
capital, Thursday without interviewing the survivor or inspecting
the site where the Deliaj family was massacred.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at The Hague, Jim Landale, said he had no
information on why the investigators left before pursuing the two
cases. ``We are confirming that we are investigating these
incidents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher for Human Rights Watch, Peter Bouckaert, who has
experience in interviewing survivors of atrocities in Africa, said
after listening to the man's account that the coherence of his
story and his lack of exaggeration made him an important witness
for the tribunal. Significantly, he said, details of the story
tallied with evidence in the garden of spent bullets from an
automatic weapon and pools of blood along the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, said
in New York Thursday that it was troubling that the tribunal had
not seized the opportunity to listen to the survivor or inspect the
two killing sites. ``This is not a historical inquiry,'' Roth said
of the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The survivor, who has a shock of black hair and full black
mustache, has essentially been a captive in his house since he
hobbled the half-mile back home Saturday afternoon. He is too
frightened to go to the hospital even though his leg wound reaches
to the bone and gangrene is starting to develop. His left arm is
also wounded from the second bullet.
</P>
<P>
   The International Committee for the Red Cross visited him on
Tuesday with some bandages and medicines but has not been back
since, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The man described the events leading up to the shootings as the
climax of a Serbian attack on the village that began last Friday
morning with shelling from across the hills. Men, women and
children fled to the forest and spent the night under the trees.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, he said, everyone was ordered by Serbian
forces to come out of the forest and gather in a field. The women
and children were separated from the men, and then the men were
whittled down into a smaller group.
</P>
<P>
   There were about ``30 to 40 police'' doing the sorting of the
men, he said. They wore the blue camouflage uniforms of the Serbian
security police, and some had yellow insignia on their shoulders
signifying rank, he said. Some wore black bandannas around their
foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was one person in charge, he said: ``I don't
know. They were all speaking.'' Toward the end of the selection,
one policeman was making the choices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The final group of men were ordered to walk about half a mile
from the field to a dirt road at a spot just outside the garden of
the house where the killings occurred. They were told to kneel with
their heads down to the ground, he said. They were kept there about
two hours, he said.
</P>
<P>
   They were then forced to walk through the wide wooden gate of
the garden and lie on their stomachs with their hands held behind
their necks.
</P>
<P>
   When the beating with the shovels started, the victims began to
scream, he said. Those who turned their faces to the policemen were
beaten much more, he said. ``I was screaming and shouting, but I
didn't turn my face, only once.''
</P>
<P>
   The man said that after a while, ``somebody new came to the
garden.''
</P>
<P>
   He presumed, he said, that it was the ``new'' policeman who did
the firing. A diplomat who interviewed him on Tuesday said he
understood from the man's account that one or more policemen did
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were executed one by one,'' he said. ``Some were begging to
be released. Nobody tried to get up.'' The clatter was that of an
automatic weapon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly silence fell, he said. He could hear the policemen
leave the garden and then depart the village with a burst of
machine-gun fire.
</P>
<P>
   A builder by trade, the man said his brother was one of the 13
who was shot to death. His brother's body was brought home along
the same route he had used to escape.
</P>
<P>
   The survivor's face crumpled slightly when he was asked if he
would testify at The Hague. He was most afraid, he said, for the
safety of his wife and children, who would most likely become
targets of Serbian revenge.
