	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The General Assembly voted Friday to
select three judges to fill a new trial chamber of the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal, whose caseload could grow with atrocities
committed during the Kosovo conflict.
	   Representatives of the 185-member assembly cast secret ballots,
choosing among nine candidates nominated by their home countries.
The three will rule on cases concerning crimes committed in the
former Yugoslavia. Their terms will end Nov. 16, 2001.
	   None of the original nine candidates emerged from the first
round of balloting with the 94 `yes' votes needed for a majority,
meaning a second round was required. Poland and Ecuador withdrew
their candidates for the second round, narrowing the field down to
seven.
	   The remaining candidates were Mohamed Bennouna of Morocco, David
Anthony Hunt of Australia, Per-Johan Viktor Lindholm of Finland,
Hugo Anibal Llanos Mansilla of Chile, Patrick Lipton Robinson of
Jamaica, Waldo Bandara Srinihal Wadugodapitiya of Sri Lanka and
Peter H. Wilkitzki of Germany.
