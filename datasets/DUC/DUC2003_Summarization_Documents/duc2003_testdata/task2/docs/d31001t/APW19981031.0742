	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela
acknowledged Saturday the African National Congress violated human
rights during apartheid, setting him at odds with his deputy
president over a report that has divided much of South Africa.
	   The disagreement stems from Thursday's release of the report by
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on horrors committed during
apartheid. Rather than act as a salve and an aid to reconciliation,
the report has caused divisiveness, even among former
comrades-in-arms who fought apartheid.
	   As expected, the report called apartheid a ``crime against
humanity.'' But it also blamed the ANC for gross human rights
violations during its anti-apartheid struggle, saying the group
tortured suspected spies and dissidents and killed innocent
civilians with land mines and bombs. Some suspected traitors were
killed in the ANC's camps abroad.
	   Mbeki _ who became ANC president last year and will likely be
elected South Africa's next president in 1999 when Mandela retires
_ took a hard line Saturday against the report, and indicated all
ANC members must do the same.
