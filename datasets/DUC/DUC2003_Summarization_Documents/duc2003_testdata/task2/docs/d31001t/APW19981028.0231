	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A panel investigating
apartheid-era atrocities said Wednesday it will not implicate the
last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, in human rights abuses
after he threatened a court challenge.
	   De Klerk said he would sue to block the long-awaited final
report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was due
for release Thursday.
	   The man who helped negotiate the end of apartheid objected to a
finding by the commission that he was ``an accessory after the
fact'' to bombings in the 1980s of the headquarters of a church
group and of a labor federation.
	   Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman, said
the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge,
and would ``excise'' de Klerk's name from the report to avoid
delaying its release.
	   ``It upsets me deeply,'' Tutu said. ``We have been scrupulously
fair to Mr. de Klerk and we reject the contention that we have been
engaged in a vendetta against him.
	   ``But we must and will respect the courts and his rights under
the constitution. We fought hard for those rights and we can be
proud in South Africa that Mr. de Klerk now shares in them,'' he
said in a statement.
	   ``All we are doing is postponing dealing with the matter,'' Tutu
later told The Associated Press. ``The name will eventually appear
after all the hoo-ha has died down.''
	   De Klerk, reached in London, said he could not comment before
speaking with his lawyers because the matter was in the courts.
	   The commission was charged with promoting reconciliation by
laying bare apartheid's horrors. It has held hearings around the
country for more than two years, listening to victims and
perpetrators seeking amnesty.
	   The release of the 3,500-page report represents a milestone for
South Africa's transformation from white minority rule to
democracy.
	   De Klerk's challenge was only part of the storm of criticism
prompted by leaks of the report. The African National Congress, the
liberation movement that helped defeat apartheid and now runs the
country, on Tuesday angrily rejected a finding that it too was
guilty of human rights violations in its armed struggle.
	   The report will be a broad and detailed summary of South
Africa's human rights history, from 1960 to 1994, when all-race
elections ended white minority rule. It will parcel out moral
condemnations and recommend individual prosecutions.
	   Other threatened legal challenges have led to fewer individuals
being named as rights violators than planned, The Star of
Johannesburg reported Wednesday.
	   In commenting on the newspaper report, Tutu said that more than
400 people had been notified they would be implicated to give them
a chance to respond. Only 15 successfully argued themselves out of
the report, he said.
