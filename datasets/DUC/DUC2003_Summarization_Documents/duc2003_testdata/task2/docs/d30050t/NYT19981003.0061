SENATE DEMOCRATS VULNERABLE IN TIGHT RACES

   LOS ANGELES _ In 1992, in a good year for Democrats, Barbara
Boxer won her seat in the U.S. Senate with 48 percent of the vote.
In the six years since, she has been a reliably outspoken liberal
from a state that is less so, and has never managed to lift her job
approval ratings above 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in what is shaping up as a bad year for Democrats, Ms.
Boxer is struggling to hold her own against a comparative neophyte,
the Republican state treasurer, Matt Fong. Their contest has become
one of a handful of closely watched races that will determine
whether the Republicans can win a filibuster-proof 60-seat majority
that could shape the congressional landscape for years.
</P>
<P>
   As the House of Representatives prepares to debate whether to
open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Clinton's conduct
in the Monica Lewinsky matter, much attention has focused on the
plight of House Democrats in swing districts.
</P>
<P>
   But from California to Wisconsin, from Illinois to Nevada, from
Kentucky to South Carolina, Senate seats now held by Democrats are
also in jeopardy, raising the possibility of the biggest Republican
majority in the Senate since the administration of Warren G.
Harding in 1921-23, when the party held 59 seats in a 96-member
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that the Republicans have more opportunities, and
better opportunities,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of a
respected independent political newsletter in Washington. ``The
Democrats are definitely still on the defensive, and it shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's own job approval ratings jumped to near his
highest ever after the release of his videotaped grand jury
testimony last month, that support has generally not carried over
to Democratic incumbents around the country, some of whom, like
Boxer and Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, were vulnerable
long before Clinton's current troubles ever surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate alone, Democrats have lost 11 seats since
Clinton's 1992 victory, and Republicans hold a 55-45 majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publicly, the congressional Democrats defend the president a
bit,'' said Ross Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers
University and a leading expert on the Senate. ``But privately,
they're angry and worried and scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case of the ship leaving the sinking rats.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior Democratic senator, now in his fourth term, summed up
the situation this way, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
``When I came here, there were 64 Democratic senators,'' the
senator said. ``Now we'll be lucky to get 42.''
</P>
<P>
   With its magisterial pace, rarefied folkways and six-year
election cycles, the Senate has always been less subject to the
vicissitudes of voter sentiment than the House, whose entire
membership faces re-election every two years.
</P>
<P>
   But when changes in the Senate do occur, experience has shown
that they can be big changes.
</P>
<P>
   In years like 1980, for example, when the Republicans took a
majority as Ronald Reagan was elected president, or 1986, when the
party lost control of the Senate (and lost more seats there than it
did in the House), or 1994, when the Democrats lost control of both
houses after the failure of Clinton's proposed health care
overhaul, ``all the close races went one way,'' Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans win all the close Senate races where they are now
thought to be in striking distance, experts say they could well
make the net gain of five seats needed to reach 60, the number of
votes needed to cut off floor debate and block a Democratic
filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's about a 30 percent chance of that happening,''
said Jennifer E. Duffy, the Senate editor of the Cook Political
Report, another highly regarded nonpartisan newsletter in
Washington. ``A gain of three seats is the worst they'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34 Senate seats up this year, 10 are considered safely
Republican and 9 safely Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio seat being vacated by John Glenn, a Democrat who is
retiring, is considered a likely bet for Gov. George Voinovich, a
Republican, while the Republican seat in Indiana being surrendered
by Dan Coats is likely to be won by former Gov. Evan Bayh, a
Democrat seeking to reclaim the office once held by his father,
Birch.
</P>
<P>
   That means Republicans would have to hold onto all 5 of the
remaining seats the party now holds, from New York, North Carolina,
Missouri, Colorado and Georgia, and pick up 6 of the remaining 8
Democratic-held seats to achieve the net gain of 5 seats needed to
reach 60. Their best bets are Illinois, California, Kentucky,
Nevada, Wisconsin, Washington state and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators are in trouble for a range of reasons, from
changing voter demographics, which have left incumbents like Harry
Reid of Nevada and Ernest Hollings of South Carolina facing
electorates decidedly more Republican than the ones that chose them
to begin with, to the failure of some senators, like Boxer and
Moseley-Braun, to solidify their original base of support.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley-Braun, like Boxer a member of the 1992 ``Year of the
Woman'' class and the first black woman ever elected to the Senate,
is running 10 points behind her Republican challenger, state Sen.
Peter Fitzgerald, in the latest polls, and national Democratic
officials seem to have all but conceded the seat. In Washington
state, another member of the 1992 class, Patty Murray, holds only a
slight lead over her Republican challenger, Rep. Linda Smith.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, Russell Feingold, the Democratic co-sponsor of the
campaign finance reform bill that bears his name, is testing that
proposition in his own race, eschewing ``soft-money'' contributions
from his national party. He recently let his opponent, Rep. Mark
Neumann, broadcast a heavy dose of unanswered television
commercials. Ms. Duffy of the Cook Report moved that race into the
toss-up category last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky seat being vacated by Sen. Wendell Ford, a
Democrat, appears to be a tossup between Representative Scotty
Baesler, a Democrat, and Jim Bunning, a Republican, with the most
recent independent poll showing a virtual dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's situation is fairly typical, with some problems of her
own making and others exacerbated by Clinton, to whom she is
related by marriage. Her daughter, Nicole, is married to Tony
Rodham, Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, and the senator took some
heat for her initially low-key comments about the Lewinsky scandal,
especially given her past outspoken opposition to Sen. Bob Packwood
and Judge Clarence Thomas over allegations of sexual harassment
against them.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's Aug. 17 admission of an ``inappropriate''
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Ms. Boxer eventually condemned his
behavior in strong terms on the Senate floor, but not until well
after her California colleague, Dianne Feinstein, had issued her
own stinging rebuke of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Fong, who was elected state treasurer just four years ago
and whose inexperience on the stump showed in his first debate with
Boxer this summer, is hardly a powerhouse candidate. Boxer has held
roughly a 2-to-1 fund-raising advantage over him throughout the
year, and he barely eked out a victory in the Republican primary in
June against Darrel Issa, a millionaire businessman.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Barbara Boxer were all that strong politically, she'd be
way ahead of Matt Fong,'' Rothenberg said. ``She would have put him
away long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, recent polls have shown the candidates in either a dead
heat, or Fong slightly ahead among likely voters, though a
Democratic operative not affiliated with either campaign said that
recent private Democratic polls had shown Ms. Boxer opening a
single-digit lead.
</P>
<P>
   Fong began his television advertising campaign last week, with
ads in English, Cantonese, Mandarin and Spanish touting his support
for education and aimed at making inroads among minority voters
whom Republicans often overlook, though only the English-language
version stresses the necessity for children to ``read, write and
speak English so they are prepared to get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Boxer has been on the air for about three weeks,
most recently with a 30-second commercial, narrated by actor Martin
Sheen, that denounces Fong as ``the gun lobby's favorite
candidate'' and touts her support for new bans on assault weapons
and cheap handguns. Unlike Feinstein, Boxer has largely failed to
move beyond her liberal base and establish a strong anti-crime
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Boxer's first ad was perhaps even more
revealing. Broadcast in her home turf of San Francisco and
featuring footage from old family home movies, it was a soft-edged
hymn to her support for children, in the form of after-school
programs to keep them ``out of gangs, and criminal background
checks for child-care workers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about her losing a lot of her base from '92 and
having to get it back,'' said Ms. Duffy of the Cook Report. ``This
was for the soccer moms she should already have.''
</P>
<P>
   The national Republican Senatorial Committee is closely watching
California as a promising contest, along with Nevada, Wisconsin and
a handful of others, said a spokesman for the committee, Mike
Russell. He declined to speculate about how much the party might
spend to help Fong make his case, but acknowledged that ``it's
certainly a race where those kinds of resources could make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Boxer, you have a candidate who is stuck at 45 percent or
below, and has no real room to grow, since most people in the state
already know her and have fixed opinions of her,'' Russell said.
``Matt is not only a sharp candidate, but as an Asian-American can
chew into her base.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Republicans could win control of 60 seats, that
would be far from the most lopsided margin in Senate history. After
the election of 1936, at the height of the New Deal, the Democrats
held 75 seats, to 17 for the Republicans and the remaining split
among minor parties. And after Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 landslide,
the Democrats had 68 seats to 32 for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Baker of Rutgers noted, maverick Republicans like
Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine, James Jeffords of
Vermont and John Chafee of Rhode Island so regularly break ranks
that even 60 Republican seats would not be enough to guarantee an
ironclad defense against a Democratic filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an individualistic institution,'' he said. ``It's
such a place of personalities and individuals, and there's a real
aversion on the part of senators to appear to be part of a herd, or
part of an unshakable bloc of votes.''
