<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep. Charles Schumer are locked in an
extraordinarily tight race for the U.S. Senate. The outcome
apparently rests with a small group of undecided voters, many of
whom are not yet paying attention to the contest, a statewide New
York Times/CBS News Poll has found.
</P>
<P>
   With a month to go until the election, the poll found a large
number of respondents _ 60 percent _ either had no opinion about
Schumer, or did not know enough about him to offer an opinion. At
the same time, a sizable number of voters continue to voice
reservations about D'Amato's ethics and ideology, including many
undecided voters and some respondents who identified themselves as
the senator's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest two dynamics that will shape the New York
contest in its final weeks: a struggle by both camps to define
Schumer's public personality among voters who do not know him, and
an attempt by Schumer to exploit the obvious and strong liabilities
D'Amato carries as a three-term Republican senator in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this closely watched contest is shaping up as a
replay of the 1992 Senate race, when D'Amato ran against Robert
Abrams, the former state attorney general. A Times poll in the
third week of October 1992 found D'Amato in an effective tie with
his Democratic challenger. D'Amato ultimately defeated Abrams by a
single percentage point after a searing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest Times/CBS News poll points to a number of ways
in which this contest is different from 1992, and that is not
necessarily good news for D'Amato. An equal number of voters now
view D'Amato and Schumer as being serious when it comes to dealing
with crime, evidence that the nine-term Brooklyn congressman has
achieved some success in neutralizing a traditionally Republican
issue.
</P>
<P>
   While D'Amato continues to be widely viewed as ``the kind of
person who gets things done for the voters'' _ clearly one of his
biggest political advantages going into the last couple of months _
a substantial number of respondents said he was lacking in honesty
and integrity, and that he did not care ``about the needs and
problems of people like you.'' Schumer scored strongly on both
measures.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most strikingly, D'Amato's intense effort to derail
Schumer's campaign with a series of attacks these past three weeks
_ from portraying him as a liberal to spotlighting votes he has
missed in Washington as he campaigned in New York this year _ has
yet to show obvious effect on the public's view of the congressman.
Only 18 percent of respondents had an unfavorable rating of
Schumer, compared to 22 percent who had a favorable rating. By
contrast, in a poll conducted in the third week of October of 1992,
Abrams was viewed unfavorably by one in three voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the current poll, D'Amato is viewed favorably by 27 percent
and unfavorably by 36 percent, virtually the same marks he received
six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By almost every measure that pollsters use to try to analyze an
election _ registered voters, likely voters, and taking into
account how undecided New Yorkers might be leaning toward _ this
contest is a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Among registered voters, Schumer is supported by 44 percent,
compared to 41 percent for D'Amato. There were 12 percent
undecided. Among those respondents considered most likely to vote,
based on their past behavior and current level of interest in the
contest, the margin is 47 percent for Schumer to 43 percent for
D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS News statewide telephone poll was conducted from
last Thursday through Tuesday with 1,461 adults, of whom 1,066 said
they were registered to vote. It has a margin of sampling error of
plus or minus three points. Therefore, among registered voters,
Schumer could be ahead by as much as nine points _ or D'Amato could
be ahead by three points.
