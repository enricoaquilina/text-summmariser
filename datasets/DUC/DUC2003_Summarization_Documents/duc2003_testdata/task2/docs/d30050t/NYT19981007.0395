   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Louise Slaughter has not been a big fan of her
fellow Democrat Bill Clinton. She thinks that he was a major reason
the Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994, that he has struck
one too many deals with the Republicans, and that his behavior has
been reckless and abhorrent. Two months ago, she was on the verge
of urging him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   But as the House prepares to vote on whether to open an
impeachment inquiry into the president, Ms. Slaughter, from
Rochester, N.Y., finds herself deeply torn. As much as she would
not mind seeing Bill Clinton out of office, she worries that
Congress is about to start down a path the Founding Fathers never
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in what happens to Bill Clinton,'' she
said. ``It's the country and the Constitution I'm concerned
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Maloney, D-Conn., is in a different bind. He is locked
in one of the toughest races of any House member, against a
challenger who has made Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky a
major campaign issue. Yet Maloney also believes that the majority
of his constituents are fed up with demeaning investigations into
the president.
</P>
<P>
   So while the freshman congressman could support a limited
investigation, he remains painfully uncertain about how to vote on
what may be the only alternative available to him: a Republican
plan that would allow an open-ended inquiry that he fears could
drag on for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do that, we'll just be opening the door to the partisan
mischief that has been going on for so long around this place,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Across Capitol Hill on Wednesday, the fence sitters in
Washington's impeachment debate were consulting constitutional
scholars, meeting with colleagues and spouses, rereading the
Federalist Papers and studying their political tea leaves,
searching for any inspiration that could help tip their mental
scales one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Most were preparing to follow party lines, but among that
dwindling group of undecideds are two large groups of Democrats
facing different pressures.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are people like Ms. Slaughter, who have become
deeply disaffected with Clinton, and who believe he has done little
to advance the congressional Democrats' agenda and now feel
hesitant about helping him out of his bind.
</P>
<P>
   On the other are people like Maloney, who are locked in tough
re-election fights and who are concerned that appearing soft on
Clinton will infuriate swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will I do before I decide?'' asked Rep. Bill Pascrell
Jr., D-N.J., who is also among the fence sitters. ``I'll pray. And
then I'll move on.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview in her Capitol Hill office, Ms. Slaughter said
Clinton would not be a factor in her decision. ``He happens to be
occupying the important spot there, and I want to do what I can to
preserve the presidency,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she recalled with evident disgust a phone call in August
from a White House official who was looking for ``Senator
Slaughter'' and who expressed surprise that she had an office in
Rochester. ``That's how far down the list I am, I guess,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said Clinton's poor relations with congressional
Democrats had hurt the party's congressional candidates in 1996 and
1994. ``He didn't say this, but Dick Morris said it for him: Bill
Clinton didn't care who ran for Congress,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Slaughter said she was prepared in August to call on Clinton
to resign, but backed away after seeing his videotaped performance
for the grand jury. ``I thought his rights were, frankly, abridged
terribly,'' she said. ``No other human being in the United States
would have been subjected to that.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Ms. Slaughter said, she had been speaking to
constitutional scholars about impeachment precedents, and meeting
with small groups of colleagues from both parties who remain
undecided. At this moment, she is leaning toward voting against an
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to get by an election, or get by a hard spot
here,'' she said. ``What we do here has ramifications far beyond
our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said he had been studying the report of the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, reviewing Clinton's rebuttals
and videotaped testimony, talking with friends on the House
Judiciary Committee and trying to listen to constituents. The
latter group, he says, falls into three equal subgroups: those who
want the matter dropped, those who want Clinton impeached, and
those who want some lesser punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney, a former state senator, represents a western
Connecticut district that was held by Republicans for many years,
including Gov. John Rowland, until Maloney wrested it from Rep.
Gary Franks in the Clinton landslide of 1996. Since then, Maloney
has tiptoed across party lines on many occasions, including to
support a Republican tax-cut plan this year.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney's Republican opponent, state Sen. Mark Nielsen, has
called on Clinton to resign, and said Wednesday that he would make
it an issue if Maloney votes against an impeachment inquiry. ``The
Congress can't turn a blind eye to President Clinton's
criminality,'' he said. ``And the congressman from the 5th District
can't be a part of the Clinton defense strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney contends that such talk only turns voters off and that a
more thoughtful approach is what will sell in November. ``I have
said this doesn't belong in politics,'' he said. ``I read the
Constitution in a given way. It isn't anything goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said he would support a six-month inquiry with
well-defined parameters, which could include the Lewinsky matter
and any other matters referred by the independent counsel. If the
House can agree to such a bipartisan plan, Maloney said, his
decision on Thursday will be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not what I'm expecting,'' he said.
