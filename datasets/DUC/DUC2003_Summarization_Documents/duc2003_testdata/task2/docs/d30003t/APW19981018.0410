	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ President Fidel Castro said Sunday he
disagreed with the arrest in London of former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet, calling it a case of ``international meddling.''
	   Castro compared the action with the establishment in Rome in
August of an International Criminal Court, a move Cuba has
expressed reservations about.
	   ``It seems to me that what has happened there (in London) is
universal meddling,'' Castro told reporters covering the
Ibero-American summit being held here Sunday. Castro had just
finished breakfast with King Juan Carlos of Spain in a city hotel.
	   He said the case seemed to be ``unprecedented and unusual.''
	   Pinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday by
British police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge. The
judge is probing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chile
under his rule in the 1970s and 80s.
	   Castro, Latin America's only remaining authoritarian leader,
said he lacked details on the case against Pinochet, but said he
thought it placed the government of Chile and President Eduardo
Frei in an uncomfortable position while Frei is attending the
summit.
	   Castro said the International Criminal Court ought to be
independent of the U.N. Security Council, because ``we already know
who commands there,'' an obvious reference to the United States.
	   The United States was one of only seven countries that voted
against creating the court.
	   ``The (Pinochet) case is serious ... the problem is delicate''
and the reactions of the Chilean Parliament and armed forces bear
watching, Castro said.
	   He expressed surprise that the British had arrested Pinochet,
especially since he had provided support for England during its
1982 war with Argentina over the Malvina or Falkland Islands.
Although Chile maintained neutrality during the war, it was accused
of providing military intelligence to the British.
	   Castro joked that he would have thought police could have waited
another 24 hours to avoid having the arrest of Pinochet overshadow
the summit being held here.
	   ``Now they are talking about the arrest of Pinochet instead of
the summit,'' he said.
	   Pinochet left government in 1990, but remained as army chief
until March when he became a senator-for-life.
	   The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's arrest,
insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic
passport and had immunity from arrest.
