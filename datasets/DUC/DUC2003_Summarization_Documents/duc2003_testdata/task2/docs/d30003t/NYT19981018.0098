   LONDON _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator
arrested here at the request of a Spanish judge, remained
sequestered under police guard Sunday, awaiting a potentially
devastating court hearing to weigh his extradition on charges of
genocide, terrorism and murder.
</P>
<P>
   British officials have not said where Pinochet is, but scores of
Chilean emigres gathered Sunday outside the upscale London Clinic
where the 82-year-old general underwent back surgery Oct. 9. The
demonstrators jubilantly demanded Pinochet's extradition to Spain
and held up photographs of some of the ``disappeared'' among the
3,000 people shot or abducted during his 17-year dictatorship, from
1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's detention late Friday has left Prime Minister Tony
Blair's Labor government seemingly embarrassed by the diplomatic
implications of an arrest that has enraged the government of Chile
_ which Britain regards as an ally _ and confronted European
officials with uncomfortable implications for their handling of
human rights violators from closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What goes for Gen. Pinochet also goes for all the Mladics and
Karadzics who are still in hiding and will be, one day or another,
arrested and judged for their crimes,'' said Jacques Poos, the
Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, referring to the Radovan Karadzic
and Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb leaders indicted on war crimes
charges by the United Nations War Crime Tribunal in The Hague. Both
have consistently eluded arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, however, seemed uncomfortable about turning the
general's detention into any new crusade. Neither Blair nor Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook made public statements about the arrest,
sheltering behind official statements that it was purely a
``judicial matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrest has reopened a traditional divide between Labor and
the opposition Tories who, while in office until 1997, regularly
allowed Pinochet to enter Britain without fanfare either for
medical treatment or to pursue arms deals with British defense
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's government had been under strong pressure from Labor
supporters and human rights groups to display its public commitment
to ethical foreign policies by acting against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Word of his presence here produced an outcry in newspapers
generally supportive of Labor and among Labor legislators. Indeed,
Trade Minister Peter Mandelson termed Pinochet a ``brutal
dictator'' in a television interview Sunday and said his claim of
diplomatic immunity against arrest ``for most people in this
country would be pretty gut-wrenching stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Howard, a former Tory Interior Minister who took no
action during Pinochet's earlier visits, said the arrest reflected
the behavior of ``a very arrogant government'' that may be
``displaying its utter contempt for our legal system and for the
rule of law'' to appease a political constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was placed under arrest after a senior Spanish judge,
Baltasar Garzon, sent a request to detain him in connection with
possible extradition hearings. The warrant on which he was arrested
alleges that Pinochet ``did murder Spanish citizens in Chile within
the jurisdiction of the government of Spain,'' and was guilty of
``crimes of genocide and terrorism that includes murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Garzon and a Spanish colleague, Judge Manuel Garcia Castellon,
are expected to travel to London to question him, possibly in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Chile has protested the arrest, insisting that, as a senator for
life, Pinochet enjoyed diplomatic immunity under his diplomatic
passport. But, said Alun Michael, a senior official in the Home
Office, ``a diplomatic passport does not, of course, guarantee
diplomatic immunity.''
</P>
<P>
   British officials deny that the detention was politically
inspired. Michael said Sunday that ``there has been no intervention
which has been inappropriate at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Under British law, the authorities must decide within 40 days
whether to proceed with extradition. The first step is a
magistrates' court hearing where Pinochet's accusers set out their
reasons for extradition. No date for this hearing has been set.
Then, Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, must decide whether to order
the extradition.
