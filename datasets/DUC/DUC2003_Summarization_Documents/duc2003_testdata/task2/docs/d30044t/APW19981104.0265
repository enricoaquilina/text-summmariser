Russian lawmakers urge political asylum for Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament on Wednesday asked President
Boris Yeltsin to offer political asylum to Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan, who is wanted in Turkey on charges of heading a
terrorist organization.
	   Turkey officially asked Russia last week to extradite Ocalan,
who leads the banned Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has been
fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984. The conflict
has killed an estimated 37,000 people.
	   Communist lawmaker Yuri Nikiforenko initiated the move seeking
asylum for Ocalan.
	   ``This man has done a lot for the Kurdish people,'' he said.
	   The State Duma, parliament's lower house, supported
Nikiforenko's proposal by a unanimous vote.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry last month condemned the Turkish
government's raids against Kurdish rebels in Iraq and demanded that
Turkey withdraw its troops.
	   Ocalan's whereabouts are unclear. Turkey says he recently left
Syria for Russia, but Russian officials have refused to confirm
that he is in the country.
	   Turkish newspapers have said Ocalan was in hiding in a suburb 30
kilometers (18 miles) west of Moscow.
	   Ocalan issued a statement last month saying he was somewhere in
the Kurdish regions that stretch over parts of Turkey, Iraq, Iran
and Syria.
