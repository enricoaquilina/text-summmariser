	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Seven female members of a Kurdish group
were on a three-day hunger strike Tuesday in support of a
controversial Kurdish leader, whom they claim is being persecuted.
	   The women, who began their protest Monday at the Freedom for the
Women of Kurdistan building in the Armenian capital, were dancing,
singing and watching Kurdish television on Tuesday.
	   The walls in the room were adorned with portraits of Abdullah
Ocalan, who leads the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. The
group has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984.
	   ``Fighting against imperialism, fascism and the colonial policy
of Turkey, we are approaching the victory in the cause of
liberation of our people,'' the women said in a statement.
	   Kurds elsewhere were also demonstrating in support of Ocalan,
said the PKK leader in Armenia Mraz Khumoyan. Ocalan has been
labeled a terrorist by Turkey and the United States.
	   Turkish leaders say Ocalan is currently hiding in Russia, but
Russian officials have refused to confirm that he is in the
country.
	   Last week, Russia's parliament passed an appeal asking President
Boris Yeltsin to offer political asylum to Ocalan. Officials say
Yeltsin is unlikely to heed parliament's appeal.
