	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament on Wednesday asked President
Boris Yeltsin to offer political asylum to Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan, who is wanted in Turkey on charges of heading a
terrorist organization.
	   Turkey officially asked Russia last week to extradite Ocalan,
who leads the banned Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, which has been
fighting for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984. The conflict
has killed an estimated 37,000 people.
	   Communist lawmaker Yuri Nikiforenko initiated the move seeking
asylum after Ocalan wrote the State Duma, parliament's lower house,
thanking it for supporting his cause. Ocalan had officially
requested asylum, Interfax reported.
	   ``This man has done a lot for the Kurdish people,'' Nikiforenko
said.
	   The Duma supported Nikiforenko's proposal by a unanimous vote.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry last month condemned the Turkish
government's raids against Kurdish rebels in Iraq and demanded that
Turkey withdraw its troops.
	   In his letter to the Duma, Ocalan accused the Turkish government
of trying ``to annihilate the leadership of the Kurdish Workers
Party, drown in blood the national liberation struggle by the
Kurdish people and thus pave the way for their control of the
entire Middle East.''
	   Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit criticized the Duma
vote, and said he hoped President Boris Yeltsin would `take on a
realistic and constructive approach.''
	   ``Instead of forging ties with a terrorist organization like the
PKK, (Russia) should keep good relations with a country like
Turkey,'' Ecevit told reporters in Ankara, the Turkish capital.
	   Ocalan's whereabouts are unclear. Turkey says he recently left
Syria for Russia, but Russian officials have refused to confirm
that he is in the country.
	   Turkish newspapers have said Ocalan was in hiding in a suburb 30
kilometers (18 miles) west of Moscow.
	   Ocalan issued a statement last month saying he was somewhere in
the Kurdish regions that stretch over parts of Turkey, Iraq, Iran
and Syria.
