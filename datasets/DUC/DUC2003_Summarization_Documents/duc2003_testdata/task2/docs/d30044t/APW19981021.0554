Turkey still suspicious despite deal with Syria

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said Wednesday
Turkey was remaining cautious towards neighboring Syria despite a
deal with Damascus to crack down on a Kurdish rebel group.
	   Turkey and Syria stuck the deal Tuesday, ending a weeks-long
standoff. Under the deal, Syria agreed to brand the Kurdish Workers
Party, or PKK, a ``terrorist'' group and to clamp down its activity
in Syria.
	   ``These results are very important,'' Cem told a group of
businessmen.''But we have to be careful about their applications.
We shall be observing developments with caution.''
	   Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan
had left Syria for Russia, which would be a sign Damascus was
meeting Turkish demands. Sabah newspaper he was hiding in
Odintsovo, 30 kilometers (18 miles) west of Moscow. Russian
officials, however, said they had no information on Ocalan entering
Russia.
	   Ocalan's PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey since 1984
in a war that has claimed 37,000 lives.
