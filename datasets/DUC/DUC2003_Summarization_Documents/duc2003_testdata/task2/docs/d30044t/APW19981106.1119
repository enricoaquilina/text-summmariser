Turkey protests Greek deputies' invitation
</HEADLINE>

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The foreign ministry on Friday protested
the invitation by 109 Greek deputies to a Kurdish rebel leader to
visit Greece.
	   In a statement, the ministry said that the invitation ``would
only encourage terrorist activities.''
	   ``We strongly protest the action of the Greek parliamentarians
and await the Greek government decision to clarify its position
toward this invitation,'' the statement read.
	   The open invitation to Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed
Kurdistan Worker's Party, was issued Thursday.
	   Turkey has in the past accused Greece of harboring and training
Kurdish rebels who have been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast since 1984. Close to 37,000 people have died in the
conflict.
	   Greece denies the charges, though the group's political wing has
an office in Athens.
	   Turkey and Greece are at odds over numerous issues, including
the division of Cyprus and territorial disputes in the Aegean.
	   Turkish officials claim that Ocalan is currently hiding in
Russia.
