	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ A fire turned a dance hall jammed with
teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and
injuring 162 others in Sweden's second-largest city.
	   Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed off that figure
Friday evening. ''The earlier information that police gave out was
wrong,'' Hans Carlsson, the lead detective in the case, told a news
conference.
