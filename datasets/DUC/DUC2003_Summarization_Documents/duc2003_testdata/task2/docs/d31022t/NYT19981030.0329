   GOTEBORG, Sweden _ They were teen-agers whose parents had
brought them here from homes torn by war or terror _ from Bosnia,
Eritrea, Somalia and others _ and in their new country they formed
new bonds, through school and music and parties.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 of the young people died and more than 190 were
seriously injured late Thursday night when fire and smoke engulfed
an overcrowded makeshift discotheque that had only one unlocked
door.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was the deadliest this country has seen in decades, and
it was all the more painful because it highlighted the profound
divide between native Swedes and the rainbow of immigrants who have
found refuge here over the decades.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the victims were teenagers between the ages of 13
and 17, who had packed into a Halloween hip-hop party at a hall
owned by a Macedonian civic organization. Most of the victims died
from smoke inhalation as they trampled each other in a panicked
attempt to escape, but others were scorched by the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters and police said they still had not determined the
fire's cause. Though its explosive speed initially led
investigators to suspect arson, later Friday they said evidence
pointed to electrical short-circuits in the lighting or sound
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were dancing and then suddenly people were screaming and
running and pushing,'' said Sara Afeworki, 15, who came here from
Eritrea six years ago. ``There were two exits, but the one in the
back was covered up. The only way out was a small door at the
front, and there were 400 people.''
</P>
<P>
   At candlelight memorials outside the discotheque, and at local
hospitals, Kurds found themselves clinging in grief to classmates
from Romania, Uganda and many other places that refugees have fled
in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors described watching their friends jump from the windows
on the building's second floor. Others, who managed to get out the
door, recalled a horrifying chaos within the building as they found
themselves choking and clawing their way toward fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It the most frightening thing I have ever been through,'' said
Arya Shafai, a 15-year-old Iranian, as he recuperated in a bed at
the nearby Salgrenska Hospital. Arya said he would probably not
have escaped, except that three larger teen-agers managed to pull
him out from a mass of collapsed bodies around him. The boy who
came to the party with him, Gilsad, never got out. ``He was just so
small, you know,'' said Arya, his voice trailing off.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors and police officials said the hall had been rented out
by a group of Kurdish students, who organized a hip-hop party and
charged an entrance fee of about $5. The hall was not supposed to
hold more than 150 people; about 400 were inside when the fire
broke out shortly before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the dancers, including Arya, said they saw a lamp
exploding just before the panic began. Others said they had seen a
speaker fall over and appear to be malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   Disk jockeys quickly began urging people to leave the building,
but survivors said the hall was so crowded that the teenagers had
little idea at first about what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said something about tear gas,'' said Andrea
Guajardo, a 15-year-old Chilean girl who had come with her Iranian
classmate, Yusra Morabet. ``We got out of the building and thought
things were actually okay. Then we looked up and saw people banging
on the windows of the second floor and then trying to jump out.''
</P>
<P>
   When police and rescue workers showed up a few minutes after
midnight, they found many young people relentlessly holding onto
companions who had collapsed or even died in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people were holding onto dead and dying friends,'' said
Sten Schaaf, a police officer who coordinated part of the rescue
operation, which lasted until about 5 a.m. Friday. ``In such
situations, you just can't tear them apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Swedish Prime Minister Goren Persson toured the charred remains
of the discotheque this afternoon and came out visibly shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all burned out, with only a skeleton left,'' he told
Swedish reporters. ``On the floor were shoes and boots _ boots just
like our children have. It was only then that you could really
understand what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Birgitta Bahl, speaker of Sweden's Parliament, noted with
particular sadness that the tragedy had befallen people who had
come to Sweden in the hope of escaping violent death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is especially moving that many of the families who lost
their children had come here to seek refuge from violence and
suppression,'' Ms. Bahl said. Swedish officials quickly set up
psychological counseling centers around the city Friday, and
churches in almost every neighborhood held bereavement services
this evening.
</P>
<P>
   Yet chaos and confusion continued to dominate efforts at picking
up the pieces. Officials said Friday night they had only been able
to positively identify a handful of the dead teen-agers so far,
because many of partygoers either had no identification cards or
false ones with false ages.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many dazed students and parents wandered around the
hospitals here fearful that missing friends or children had died
but unable to know for sure. Police officials said it may be
several days before they know the names of every victim.
