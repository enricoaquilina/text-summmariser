Death toll in Swedish fire rises to 62

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ After clinging to life for three days,
two youths trapped in a dance-hall fire died early Monday, bringing
the death toll in the inferno to 62.
	   With another 17 people still in intensive care, the figure could
still go higher in what is already Sweden's worst fire disaster of
modern times.
	   The dead, as young as 12 and none older than 20, were among an
estimated 400 people who were at a disco dance in a rented
second-floor hall when an explosive fire broke out shortly before
midnight Thursday.
	   The hall had been rented out for the night by the tenant, the
local association of Macedonian immigrants, to teen-agers who
arranged the dance.
	   The hall had a legal capacity of only 150 and officials say it
is possible that the arrangers who allowed the hall to be severely
overcrowded could be charged with contributing to others' deaths.
	   ``It's important that people have a clear understanding that the
authorities' approval of the premises was not a joke,'' chief
prosecutor Ulf Noren, who is leading the fire investigation, was
quoted as saying in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter.
	   However, Noren said, a decision on that question would wait
until the cause of the fire has been determined.
	   The fire's ferociously quick spread has prompted wide
speculation that it was set. But witnesses have given widely
varying accounts _ some saying it appeared to start in the
equipment used by the disc jockey and others saying there was smoke
coming up fom the emergency exit's stairway before the flames raced
through the hall.
	   The emergency exit was blocked by flames, forcing the panicked
dancers to try to flee down the one remaining stairway or leap out
of second-story windows.
	   Most of those at the dance were immigrants or children of
immigrant parents.
