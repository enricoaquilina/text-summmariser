   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26:
</P>
<P>
   The murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian is the latest depraved assault
on the small number of courageous physicians who still risk their
safety to perform legal abortions in this country. Slepian was one
of only three doctors who performed abortions in the Buffalo, N.Y.,
area, and harassment and threats against him by anti-abortion
groups had become routine over the past decade. He persevered
through courage and a belief in the right of his patients to choose
whether to bear a child.
</P>
<P>
   But a principled commitment to provide a constitutionally
protected service could not stop the assassin's bullet that tore
through his kitchen window and into his back Friday night. His
death shows again how tentative the right to abortion has become in
the face of terrorism by anti-choice fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   Their repeated acts of terrorism must be met with the severest
possible crackdown by law-enforcement authorities. If an armed
police officer has to be stationed outside every abortion
provider's home and office, 24 hours a day, let it be done. This is
an assault not only on individual doctors but on the rights and
liberties of all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the FBI joined Canadian authorities to investigate a
series of unsolved sniper shootings of doctors in Canada and
western New York dating to 1994. In January, a week after the 25th
anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision, a clinic
bombing in Birmingham, Ala., killed a security guard and severely
wounded a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, three doctors, including Slepian, three clinic
employees and a clinic escort have been murdered. There have been
more than a dozen attempted murders of abortion providers in the
last five years. Arson and bombings at clinics have become so
common that many no longer make the national news.
</P>
<P>
   It is bad enough that conservatives in Congress and in state
legislatures are working to dismantle reproductive rights by
banning certain procedures, such as so-called partial birth
abortion, and by requiring waiting periods and parental consent
before an abortion can be obtained. But those restrictions are at
least imposed by the normal give and take of political and judicial
struggle in a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   What is outrageous is the attempt to shut down abortions by
illegal means _ by shooting the doctors or bombing the clinics or
harassing the women seeking to exercise their constitutional right.
Some anti-abortion groups, to their credit, have denounced the
bombings and shootings, but others seem reluctant to issue the
strong condemnations that are warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one particularly virulent anti-abortion Web site lists
the names of doctors it says perform abortions, or ``crimes against
humanity,'' with a code indicating whether they are ``working,''
``wounded'' or a ``fatality.'' Such incendiary rhetoric, and
frequent accusations by some anti-abortionists that abortion
providers are committing murder, can only fuel more terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The increase of anti-choice laws and ongoing campaigns of
harassment by protest groups, even short of murder, have worked to
make abortions harder to obtain. More than 80 percent of counties
in this country have no abortion provider. In 45 states, the number
of doctors who performed abortions declined between 1982 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian was among those who took a stand against restricting
reproductive freedom and paid with his life. Unless these brave
doctors are better protected, fewer doctors in the next generation
will be willing to place themselves and their families in such
danger. That is what the terrorists want. They must not be allowed
to succeed.
