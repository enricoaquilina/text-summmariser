ABORTION CLINIC IN BUFFALO VOWS TO CONTINUE SLAIN DOCTOR'S WORK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ With federal marshals posted outside and
protesters waving pictures of aborted fetuses from the sidewalk,
the clinic where Dr. Barnett A. Slepian performed abortions until
he was slain on Friday night reopened here Tuesday and its director
vowed to continue his work.
</P>
<P>
   Short-staffed even before Slepian was fatally shot by a sniper
who hid in a wooded field behind his home, the clinic, Buffalo
Women's Gynecological Services, scrambled to find doctors to cover
his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But the clinic performed no abortions Tuesday and saw only a few
patients, said the director, Marilynn Buckham. Instead, she said,
the staff spent the day mourning. ``We needed to talk about the
loss of our friend,'' she said after a series of staff meetings.
``We discussed how badly we felt.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief and tearful interview in her office, Ms. Buckham said
she had received calls from doctors around the country who offered
to perform there and said some would be flying to Buffalo as early
as Wednesday. ``We will be doing abortions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The sniper attack that killed Slepian left many women here, most
of them poor or working-class, expressing outrage that a bullet had
deprived them at least temporarily of one of the few options they
had to end an unwanted or unhealthy pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic is the only one left in Buffalo, New York State's
second-largest city, that specializes in abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The anger could be seen in people like Karen Jones, 25, who
dropped off a friend at the clinic Tuesday morning, only to be
swarmed by anti-abortion protesters who screamed, ``Be strong!''
and ``Save the baby!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's none of their business if someone wants to have an
abortion,'' she said, nervously taking a drag from a cigarette as
she sat in her car, awaiting her friend. ``Are they going to be
around to help raise the baby? No they won't. This decision is
between a woman and her God.''
</P>
<P>
   As the staff at the clinic scheduled appointments for the rest
of the week _ one staff member said the clinic was fully booked for
Thursday and Friday _ local and federal investigators reported
little progress in their search for the sniper who shot Slepian,
52, through an undraped window as he stood in his kitchen in the
nearby suburb of Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were working on the theory that his killing is
linked to four other sniper attacks since 1994 on doctors who
perform abortions here and in Canada. Three of the attacks took
place in Canada, and one in Rochester, though no one was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, according to a friend, Lynne Slepian, the doctor's
widow, was trying to spend time alone with their four young sons,
talking about what had happened to their father and the
consequences for their family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, she is worried about the kids' safety and
well-being,'' said the friend, Ellen Fink. ``Yes, she is worried
about how she is going to support them. But that is tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government dispatched United States. Marshals here
Tuesday to assist clinic workers in their efforts to reopen Tuesday
morning, though there was no visible protection from local law
enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said that the marshals would be on hand to
protect doctors who plan to arrive here from around the country to
fill in for Slepian. They gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to provide a high level of security for the doctors
and patients who come here,'' said one federal law enforcement
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   As for the women who live in this poor end of town, Slepian's
death stirred not only sadness but also practical concerns about
what they will do should they or their daughters become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Ashley, 43, recalled that teen-age a friends showed up at
the clinic about a year ago, only to be confronted by anti-abortion
protesters who convinced her to keep the baby.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she said, the young women was so unprepared to be a
mother that child welfare authorities took the child away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told her that they would help her,'' Ms. Ashely said of
the anti-abortion protesters. ``But they didn't do anything. They
left that girl on her own. What you had was a child trying to raise
a child.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Doctor Slepian helped a lot of people. Women around
her don't have many options now. I think what you are going to see
is young girls trying to give themselves abortions. It's like we're
going back to the old days.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Roseboro, 31, remembers showing up at the clinic as a
young girl to get an abortion after the man she lived with left
her. As far as she is concerned, Slepian gave her a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had had that child, I'd be stuck on welfare or
something,'' she said. ``I was a child. I couldn't take care of my
own self. How could I take care of a child? I think it was the best
decision I could have made.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Hodlen sees the issue in terms of class and race. More
affluent women, she says, can go to private doctors who will
perform abortions. But poor women like herself have had to rely on
people like Slepian.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a kind man, a good man,'' she said. ``I think a lot of
people in this community feel a sense of loss. This is an outrage.
The anti-abortion people say they want to save lives, but they have
also taken lives now.''
