FAA ORDERS AIRLINES TO CHECK MD-11 COCKPIT SWITCHES 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday
abruptly ordered airlines that fly MD-11s to inspect two cockpit
switches because one model in wide use can give off smoke at
certain settings.
</P>
<P>
   But such switches did not cause the crash of the MD-11 being
flown as Swissair Flight 111 on Sept. 2, aviation authorities said,
because the cockpit switches in that plane had already been
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Swissair crash, near Halifax, Nova Scotia, the FAA has
been reviewing trouble reports on the plane and recommendations
from the manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas; its action Thursday was
to make one of those recommendations mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   The switches are dimmer switches for cockpit instruments. ``The
real safety issue is not fire, it's smoke in the cockpit,'' said
FAA spokesman Les Dorr. He added that Thursday's order was
``typical of several hundred'' that are issued each year, and was
not considered a major safety issue.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said the cost to the industry would be about $60 a
plane. The order covers the 65 MD-11s registered in this country
but not the 109 others around the world _ including Swissair's
surviving models. The agency said it did not know how many airlines
had already done the work.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA issued the order as a final rule, but said it would
accept public comment for 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the
Swissair crash, which involved smoke in the cockpit and killed all
229 people aboard.
