	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair lawyers are looking at
procedures for making payments of up to around dlrs 137,000 to
families of those killed in last month's crash off Nova Scotia, a
spokesman for the airline said Tuesday.
	   The compensation payments correspond to Swissair's liability
under its general conditions of carriage and are independent of any
responsibility for the crash, spokesman Martin Kaspar said.
	   No date could be given for payments, which would be deductible
from a future settlement, he added. Exact entitlements have yet to
be established.
	   All 229 passengers and crew aboard Flight 111 from New York to
Geneva were killed when the airliner plunged into the sea off
Peggy's Cove. The causes of the crash have not been determined.
	   Immediately after the crash, Swissair offered families an
immediate dlrs 20,000 payment to cover their expenses. More than
130 families have taken up that offer, Kaspar said.
	   Swissair is among carriers that over the last few years have
opted out of a dlrs 75,000 liability cap for people killed or
injured during international flights.
	   The airline and manufacturers Boeing have already been served
with a dlrs 50 million lawsuit by former boxing champion Jake
LaMotta, who lost his son.
	   The lawsuit claims the companies should have known about wiring
problems on the McDonnell Douglas aircraft _ a possible cause of
the accident _ and did little to correct them.
