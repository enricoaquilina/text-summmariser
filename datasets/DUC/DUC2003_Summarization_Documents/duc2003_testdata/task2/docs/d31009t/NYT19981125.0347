   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The government of Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz, plagued since its inception 17 months ago by competing
pressures from Islamic groups and the rigidly secular military,
lost a vote of confidence in Parliament and fell Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 314-214 vote came after Yilmaz was implicated in a
corruption scandal in which he is said to have helped gangsters buy
a state-owned bank. He has denied all charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   President Suleyman Demirel was expected to ask Yilmaz to stay on
as prime minister until an interim government can be formed to take
the country to an early election in April. But with both Turkey's
center-right and center-left parties divided by bitter rivalries,
there seemed little prospect that a stable government could emerge
from the election.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the military is likely to retain ultimate political
power here. Its commanders view themselves as the final bulwark
against religious fundamentalism. Critics, however, say their
political role restricts the growth of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of spectacular revelations about ties between
criminals and successive Turkish governments, many Turks have
become deeply cynical about politics. Some believe that supporting
the Islamic party is the best way to show their disgust with the
political establishment. Military commanders, however, may not
allow the party to come to power even if it wins the election.
</P>
<P>
   Yilmaz had sought to ease military-backed restrictions on
Islamic symbols, which he evidently believed were too strict and
risked creating a political backlash. He urged the military to stop
insisting that female university students be forbidden to wear head
scarves, but powerful generals quickly slapped him down. Similar
conflicts are likely to afflict the next government.
</P>
<P>
   Demirel could name an interim prime minister within a few days.
According to press reports, leading candidates include Hikmet
Cetin, the speaker of parliament, and former Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
   During his term of office, Yilmaz managed to bring Turkey's
inflation rate down from nearly 100 percent annually to about 77
percent. Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on an
economic package for 1999 were to have begun Friday in New York,
but were canceled Wednesday. Gunes Taner, the Cabinet minister who
was to have led Turkey's delegation, was implicated in the
corruption scandal that brought down the government.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights violations continued during Yilmaz's term, but
apparently decreased steadily. The human rights organization
Amnesty International recently praised the steps he took to curb
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yilmaz was not able to push through major reforms to a
political system that many Turks believe is encrusted and
self-centered, he will be remembered as the prime minister on whose
watch the country's most-wanted fugitive was captured. The
fugitive, Abdullah Ocalan, who leads a rebel army that has been
fighting for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey, is in
custody in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yilmaz is perceived as pro-Western, Turkey's relations
with Europe deteriorated during his term. After the European Union
refused to name Turkey as a candidate for membership last year,
Yilmaz reacted with a bitterness that alienated some European
leaders. Relations seemed to be improving until the capture of
Ocalan last month. When Italian leaders refused to extradite him
for trial in Turkey, Yilmaz and other Turks accused Italy of
embracing terrorism and threatened it with an economic boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The Yilmaz government was fragile from the start, depending on
the support of Deniz Baykal, a power broker who controls a faction
in Parliament but declined to join the ruling coalition. When
Baykal withdrew his support several weeks ago, the government's
fate was sealed.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Baykal acted after a series of charges that cast doubt on the
government's integrity. The charges stemmed from a complex scandal
that has been spreading for the last two years. It is centered
around allegations that Turkish leaders have for years maintained
ties to gangsters, using them to commit political murders and
allowing them in return to smuggle drugs and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The charge that brought down the government Wednesday was based
on testimony from an alleged Turkish crime boss who is being held
in France. He released audiotapes suggesting that Yilmaz and Taner
helped one of his front men buy a bank from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Yilmaz was installed in June 1997 after the military pressured
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, leader of the Islamic party, into
resigning from office. But his government was not able to agree on
a strategy to counter rising Islamic influence here. Polls suggest
that if an election were held today, the Islamic party would finish
strongly and perhaps even in first place, as it did in the last
election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of secular parties are expected to try to patch together
an electoral alliance in the hope of heading off another victory by
the Islamic party.
</P>
<P>
   Yilmaz has said he will campaign on the strength of his
government's economic successes and its role in the capture of
Ocalan. He is also anxious to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the people who will very soon make the real
judgment about our government,'' he said after Wednesday's vote.
