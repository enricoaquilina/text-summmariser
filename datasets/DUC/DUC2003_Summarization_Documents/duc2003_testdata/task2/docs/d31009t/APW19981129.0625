Turkish leader warns against political vacuum

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ One of Turkey's leading politicians warned
Sunday that a political vacuum could cripple the domestic battle to
keep Islamists at bay and the fight abroad for the extradition of a
Kurdish rebel leader.
	   In the midst of Turkey's uphill battle to get Italy to hand over
a Kurdish rebel leader, the government collapsed Wednesday under
the weight of corruption scandals. No party has a majority to
govern alone in the deeply divided parliament.
	   Acting Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit on Sunday called on Turkey's
two center-right parties, led by arch-rivals acting Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz and former Premier Tansu Ciller, to join him in a
governing coalition.
	   ``To deal with internal and foreign questions, Turkey needs, as
soon as possible, a solid and healthy government,'' Bulent Ecevit
told reporters.
	   Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left Party, warned that the
Islamists might return to power if secular parties don't cooperate.
The military last year forced out the country's first Islamic-led
government.
	   The Islamic party, Virtue, is the largest party in parliament.
	   The military gets a chance Monday to have its say when it meets
with Demirel and the acting cabinet. It is up to Demirel, who met
Sunday with Yilmaz for a second time, to name the new premier.
