	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The head of Turkey's pro-Islamic party
said Thursday he would not insist on his rightful chance to lead
Turkey's next government, heading off a confrontation with the
military that would only deepen the nation's political crisis.
	   Parliament toppled Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's 17-month-old
government Wednesday in a no-confidence vote over a mafia scandal,
setting off a furious round of deal-making among pro-secular
parties to piece together a new governing coalition.
	   ``The no-confidence vote has dragged Turkey into grave political
chaos,'' Yilmaz declared.
	   By tradition, the job of establishing a new government should go
to the Islamic Virtue Party since it has the most seats in
Parliament. Few believe the all-powerful, staunchly secular
military would agree to that.
	   Although Turkey's people are overwhelmingly Muslim, its
constitution mandates a strictly secular republic.
	   Within hours of the government's collapse, Virtue leader Recai
Kutan met with President Suleyman Demirel, who is charged with
picking a political leader who can command a governing majority in
Parliament.
	   ``We have told the president that we will not be insistent. It's
fine if we're in the new government. It's fine if we're not,''
Kutan said.
	   Kutan said the next administration should be a caretaker
government with the support of all parties, which would lead the
country until the next national elections.
	   Turkey's generals pressured the nation's first Islamic-led
government out of office last year, after it came to power in a
coalition with former Premier Tansu Ciller.
	   Mrs. Ciller, head of the center-right True Path Party and a key
contender for power, said after meeting with Demirel later Thursday
that she favored a strong, ``broad-based'' coalition capable of
tackling problems until the elections. She would not elaborate.
	   Bulent Ecevit, the deputy premier in the outgoing government and
leader of a center-left party, declared himself in favor of a
coalition between Yilmaz and Mrs Ciller. He also indicated that he
was willing to take part in that alliance.
	   Some reports have suggested a scenario in which Ecevit would
head a three-party alliance with Yilmaz and Mrs. Ciller as the most
likely option.
