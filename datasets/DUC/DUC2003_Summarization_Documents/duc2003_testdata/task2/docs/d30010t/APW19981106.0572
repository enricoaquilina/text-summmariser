	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car bomb blew up Friday in a Jerusalem market
crowded with Israelis shopping for the Sabbath. The blast killed
two assailants, wounded 21 Israelis and prompted Israel to suspend
implementation of the peace accord with the Palestinians.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has been trying to
sabotage the agreement, claimed responsibility for the 9:45 a.m.
(0745 gmt) attack in the Mahane Yehuda market.
	   Palestinian officials condemned the attack, but accused Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of political blackmail for holding up
the agreement that was to give the Palestinians another 13 percent
of the West Bank by the end of January.
	   In the attack, a red Fiat drove slowly toward the main
intersection at the market entrance, smoke coming out of the hood
and windows. ``People started to shout `car on fire,''' said Yair
Cohen, a bus company employee.
	   Rahel Zaken, waiting in line at a bakery to buy Sabbath bread,
turned toward the street and got a glimpse of the driver. ``I saw
his eyes. He looked right at me,'' said Zaken, a 32-year-old
secretary. Seconds later, an explosion shook the area.
	   ``I fell to the ground and stumbled over one of the beggars and
crawled away on my hands and legs,'' she said. She was hospitalized
after complainging of ringing in the ears.
	   Others said they heard two explosions, followed by fast pops,
like the sound of firecrackers. Israel radio said two suitcases
filled with explosives were recovered near the car, suggesting the
blast went off prematurely and that the assailants had planned to
set off a more powerful explosion.
	   Friday's bombing marked the third time in less than three weeks
that Hamas tried, but failed, to carry out an attack with large
numbers of Israeli casualties, suggesting that a recent crackdown
by Israel and the Palestinian Authority has produced results.
	   A charred, dismembered corpse, covered by tires, lay several
meters (yards) away. Streams of soot-black water ran in the street.
Another bare-legged body lay in the street, face down, in a pool of
blood below the head. Rescue workers covered the body with sodden
pieces of cardboard box and plastic shopping bags.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said the two dead were the
assailants. Asked about Hamas' apparent difficulty to launch a
large-scale attack, he said: ``We can't depend on miracles.''
	   The explosion turned the car into a mass of twisted metal, and a
large cloud of smoke engulfed the area.
	   ``There was hysteria, people were running,'' said Eliad Duan, an
Israeli border policeman. Soldiers and police held back the crowds.
``It's dangerous _ stay back!'' they shouted.
	   At police barricades set up along Jerusalem's busiest
thoroughfare, soldiers and police held back crowds of people, some
frantic about loved ones who had been shopping in the crowded
market only hours before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
	   ``Please, please, is there a girl with red hair who is hurt?''
an older, heavyset woman said tearfully, trying to push her way
past police. A young female soldier patted her arm consolingly.
	   Two policemen led away an elderly woman who gripped a blue
plastic shopping bag filled with groceries.
	   A small crowd of protesters shouted, ``Death to Arabs! Death to
Arafat!'' Police tried to grab one of them, but he escaped into the
crowd.
	   Just a block away from Friday's blast, shoppers went about their
business. ``We can't stop with what we are doing when this
happens,'' one young female shopper said.
	   In July 1997, two Islamic militants blew themselves up just a
few meters (yards) from the site of the latest explosion, killing
themselves and 16 shoppers.
	   When Friday's blast rocked downtown Jerusalem, the Israeli
Cabinet had just gathered about a mile (kilometer) away, at
Netanyahu's office, to discuss the peace agreement under which
Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange
for a Palestinian campaign against Islamic militants.
	   The agreement cannot be implemented until it is ratified by the
Cabinet. Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said at the start of the
session that he had expected a vote later Friday.
	   However, the session broke off when word of the attack reached
the ministers. The meeting was resumed shortly after noon, with
ministers deciding to suspend the ratification process.
	   The Cabinet said in a statement will only reconvene after ``it
verifies that the Palestinian Authority takes vigorous steps for an
all-out war against terrorist organizations and their
infrastructure.''
	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, condemned the
attack, but said Israel was playing into the hands of the militants
by suspending the peace process.
	   He also said the Palestinians were doing all they could to stop
the violence. ``I wished that the Israeli government would not
point its finger at the Palestinian Authority,'' Erekat said.
	   Bar-Illan said ratification was possible as early as next week
if the Palestinians take decisive steps against militants.
	   The Cabinet also demanded clarifications from Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on the procedure for revoking clauses in the PLO
founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The Wye River agreement refers to the procedure, but is vague
enough to allow different interpretations. It says the Palestine
National Council and other Palestinian organizations will meet in
mid-December to ``reaffirm'' a letter by Arafat to U.S. President
Bill Clinton in which the Palestinian leader spells out which
clauses are being annulled.
	   The Palestinians dispute Israel's contention that the agreement
calls for the PNC to hold a vote on the clauses.
	   The Cabinet also said it would act to strengthen Jerusalem as
Israel's capital. Israel radio initially said the ministers decided
to begin construction of the controversial Jewish neighborhood of
Har Homa in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem next. Bar-Illan said
construction would be authorized ``in the near future,'' but would
not give a date.
