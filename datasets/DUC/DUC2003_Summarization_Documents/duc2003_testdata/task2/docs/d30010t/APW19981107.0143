Mubarak says peace unlikely under Netanyahu

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's president says there is ``virtually
nobody'' who believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
will implement the latest peace deal with Palestinians.
	   In an interview published Saturday, President Hosni Mubarak said
if Netanyahu wants to change that perception he must boldly face
the setback to peace caused by Friday's car bombing in Jerusalem
that killed the two bombers and injured 21.
	   ``I tell the Israelis that the solution does not lie in freezing
negotiations,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying by the government-run
Egyptian Mail newspaper.
	   Mubarak is a key player in Middle East peace negotiations and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat regularly consults him. Mubarak's
comments reflect the popular Arab feeling that Israel is insincere
about peace, and that it only looks for excuses to retain control
over West Bank.
	   Mubarak said explosions are a worldwide occurrence. But ``does
life come to a halt? On the contrary. The peace foes who are many
should be denied the chance,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Following Friday's bombing, Netanyahu's right-wing Cabinet
suspended the ratification of an interim peace deal he reached last
month with Arafat at Wye River in the United States.
	   Under the accord, Israel agreed to relinquish a further 13
percent of the West Bank and Arafat promised to develop a plan to
uproot terrorists on Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   Mubarak said that even as the accord was signed Oct. 23 he was
cautioning that implementation of the deal was more important than
words.
	   ``This is because I felt apprehensive what occurred (in
Jerusalem) would happen,'' he said.
	   However, that is no reason to go back on the accord, he said.
	   ``I tell ... Netanyahu that there is virtually nobody who trusts
that you will carry out the Wye River accord. Should you want to
change this perception, you have to take the initiative and make
practical steps to comply with ... the agreement,'' Mubarak was
quoted as saying.
	   Failure to do so will only ensure recurrence of violence, he
said.
	   ``The Palestinians are beset with frustrations from all sides.
So when a ray of hope appears for them on the horizon, they should
be supported, not the other way round,'' he said.
	   On normalizing Arab-Israeli ties, Mubarak said the two peoples
should accept the idea first before anything is imposed by
``supreme decrees.''
	   And people can only be won over by ``sowing the seeds of trust,
by handing over land to their rightful owners and respecting
treaties and accords.'' he said.
