	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian stocks dropped sharply
Monday in the lowest trading volume of the year despite the almost
certain re-election of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
	   Brazil's largest stock exchange, Sao Paulo Bovespa, lost 4.5
percent while the smaller Rio de Janeiro stock exchange fell 3.4
percent.
	   Although Cardoso seems to have clinched a first-round win,
investors feared that he would put off any announcement of the
harsh economic measures deemed necessary until the second round of
voting for a number of governors, senators and federal deputies
takes place on Oct. 25.
	   ``Cardoso has won in the first round, but the market is thinking
that all the measures we are waiting for will only take place after
the second round,'' said Fabio Lara, director at Schahin Cury
brokerage in Sao Paulo.
	   Lara said that the Cardoso government doesn't want to announce
anything detrimental _ such as tax increases _ to its allied
candidates in the state governments until they are through the
second round of voting.
