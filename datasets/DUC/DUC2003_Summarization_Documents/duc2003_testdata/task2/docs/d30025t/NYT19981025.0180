ELECTION OF RIVALS IN BRAZIL HURTS CARDOSO REFORM PLANS

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Rivals of President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso won important victories in gubernatorial races Sunday,
handing the recently re-elected president a complex landscape for
pushing through long-delayed government and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In Sao Paulo, however, Brazil's most populous and wealthiest
state, Mario Covas appeared likely to win re-election as governor,
defeating former Sao Paulo mayor Paulo Maluf.
</P>
<P>
   Although Maluf's party forms part of the president's governing
coalition, Cardoso had endorsed Covas. Maluf is known as a big
spender with presidential ambitions of his own. His victory could
have complicated Cardoso's efforts to control state spending and
win congressional approval for reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Despite considerable foreign pressure on Brazil to demonstrate
how it will restructure government to reduce deficits, Cardoso has
put off publicly announcing his plans, fearing they could damage
the chances of his allies in the elections. The delay costs Brazil
heavily; each day, the country loses hundreds of billions of
dollars in foreign reserves, and the longer the country maintains
interest rates over 40 percent, the deeper its recession and debt.
</P>
<P>
   With Brazil's solvency seen as crucial to maintaining economic
stability of Latin America and protecting the United States from
recession, the United States and the International Monetary Fund
are preparing to chip in toward an aid package of at least $30
billion to shore up Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso won re-election on the first round of national voting
earlier this month, but partial results showed left-of-center
candidates leading in some of the most developed states of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pedro Piva, of the president's Brazilian Social Democracy
Party, called Sunday's elections ``a warning sign for the
government,'' adding, ``I think we're going to have difficulties
ahead to approve this package.''
</P>
<P>
   The governors are important both because they control a
considerable share of the national budget and act as natural
leaders of their parties in Congress. States will be called upon to
cut their budgets by as much as 20 to 30 percent, which will mean
laying off civil servants. Current laws allow the states to fire
workers if the payroll exceeds 60 percent of the state budget;
under a new law the administration is proposing, layoffs would
become mandatory once that ceiling was reached.
</P>
<P>
   In Rio de Janeiro, Anthony Garotinho, a former mayor of the city
of Campos who belongs to the leftist Democratic Workers Party, was
leading over Cesar Maia, a former Rio mayor belonging to a
conservative grouping.
</P>
<P>
   In Rio Grande do Sul in the south, Olivio Dutra of the Workers'
Party was also leading over the incumbent, Antonio Britto, a
Cardoso ally.
</P>
<P>
   In Minas Gerais, former President Itamar Franco was leading by a
wide margin over the incumbent Eduardo Azeredo, also of Cardoso's
centrist Brazilian Social Democracy Party. Franco's party belongs
to the governing coalition, but Franco has been critical of
Cardoso's economic policies and personally stung by the president's
re-election.

<P>
   In 1993, during Franco's presidency, he named Cardoso finance
minister and launched the economic plan that would make Cardoso a
national hero to a people weary of hyperinflation. But Franco was
deeply humiliated at his party's convention earlier this year, when
he sought to run for president against Cardoso. He was not only
turned down, but laughed at.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Sen. Maguito Vilela, of Franco's Brazilian
Democratic Movement Party, said backing for Cardoso's reforms would
not be automatic. The party would not support tax increases, he
said, noting that one tax slated for increase, on financial
transfers, was initially approved as a temporary measure to finance
hospitals, but ended up going to offset the deficit. ``It just
burdened people and didn't do anything to improve health care,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Brazilian television precisely which measures his party
would endorse, Vilela said, ``If it means more sacrifice for the
people,'' his party ``will not support it.''
