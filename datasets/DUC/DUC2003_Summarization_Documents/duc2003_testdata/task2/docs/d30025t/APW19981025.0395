	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ With President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's economic austerity plan at a critical point for Brazil,
voters went to the polls Sunday to elect governors in 12 states and
the Federal District of Brasilia.
	   Voting was calm after polls opened at 8 a.m. (1000 GMT), showing
little of the illegal but last-minute campaigning that pervaded the
first-round election on Oct. 4. Even so, army troops were deployed
at voting stations in four northern states to ensure peace.
	   The austerity plan was very much on the minds of the 64 million
Brazilians expected to vote. Paulo Garrini, a business
administration student in Sao Paulo, said it was one reason he
voted for incumbent Gov. Mario Covas, a Cardoso ally.
	   ``Covas made it clear he will support Cardoso in the austerity
measures the country needs, no matter how painful they may be,''
Garrini said.
	   But many voters are indifferent, believing that hard times are
ahead _ no matter what their choice at the polls.
	   Caught up in the financial turmoil that began more than a year
ago in Southeast Asia, Brazil believes it needs to slash government
spending and raise taxes quickly to shore up its flagging economy
and restore investor confidence.
	   The difficulty, however, of pushing through such unpopular
measures at election time became evident when Cardoso repeatedly
put off announcing the austerity package. Such measures were
initially expected after first-round elections, in which Cardoso
was re-elected and 14 state governors were chosen.
	   After the election, Cardoso said the package could be announced
by Oct. 20. But with 13 government-allied candidates facing tough
run-offs, he postponed it until after the Oct. 25 second-round
elections.
	   David Fleischer, a professor of political science at the
University of Brasilia said it was a smart move on the president's
part.
	   ``Governors have far more power and a direct hold on their
states than the president has over the whole country,'' said
Fleischer. ``Their influence and political weight should not be
underestimated.''
	   Another reason Cardoso needs allies at the state level is to
curb their overspending, which accounts for a big chunk of the
government's dlrs 65 billion budget deficit.
	   Even without announcing harsh budget cutting measures, the
situation still looks fairly grim for Cardoso allies in Brazil's
four most developed states _ Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas
Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul.
	   In Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse with
more than 34 million inhabitants, Covas came from behind in the
polls to pass Paulo Maluf, a populist candidate with a taste for
extravagant public works projects.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, polls put opposition candidate Anthony
Garotinho well ahead of Cardoso ally Cesar Maia.
	   ``Whoever wins, it's going to be difficult because it doesn't
look like there's going to be much money to spend,'' said Paulo
Benevides, a 22-year-old college student. He said he planned to
vote for Maia, Rio's mayor.
