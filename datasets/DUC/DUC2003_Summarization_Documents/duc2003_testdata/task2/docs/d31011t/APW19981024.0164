	   SAN MIGUEL, Philippines (AP) _ Typhoon Babs raced toward
southern China on Saturday, leaving behind a trail of destruction
on the Philippines' main island where at least 129 people died and
hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes.
	   Philippines President Joseph Estrada declared Catanduanes and
three other other provinces and a city in the worst hit area on the
southern tip of Luzon under a state of calamity.
	   He was expected to add more provinces to the list once the full
extent of the damage was determined. Officials in calamity zones
will be able to use emergency funds and freeze prices of
commodities with little red tape.
	   Disaster officials said the toll on lives and property would
rise as telephone service is restored and roads blocked by
landslides and flooding are reopened in the worst hit areas.
	   Typhoon Babs gained strength as it headed for southern China,
packing sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160
kph (100 mph), the Manila weather bureau said.
	   At 4 p.m. (0800 GMT), it was located about 370 kilometers (230
miles) west-northwest of Vigan in Ilocos Sur province. Moving at 11
kph (7 mph), it is expected to be 300 kilometers (187 miles)
south-southeast of Hong Kong by Sunday afternoon.
	   Of the 129 deaths reported so far in the Philippines, 67 were
attributed to landslides on Catanduanes island where Babs first
landed on Thursday, the Office of Civil Defense said.
	   ``Catanduanes received the first punch and it was a hard hit,''
said Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who is overseeing the
relief and rescue work.
	   The worst landslides hit San Miguel, a coconut and
abaca-producing town along the Bato River, as residents attempted
to escape rapidly rising flood waters by climbing hills behind the
village.
	   The powerful winds flattened the abaca and tore away the leaves
of the coconut trees, making them look like giant umbrellas with
blown-away tops. Virtually every house was damaged.
	   The dead were to be buried later Saturday in two mass graves.
	   ``Entire families were killed,'' said Eddie Tapel, a local
official. ``Many children will have to quit school because their
families have no more income.''
	   Thirty other people died in landslides in nearby Camarines Sur
province and another 102 people were injured by flying debris in
Sorsogon province, both located in the impoverished Bicol region
along the Philippines' eastern coast.
	   More than 320,000 people in the area were forced out of their
homes, disaster relief officials said. Tens of thousands of others
were stranded as ports were shut and ships forbidden to sail.
	   The fatalities included 18 drownings, three people hit by
falling trees, two people electrocuted by power lines, two children
killed by a landslide in central Iloilo province, and a fireman
crushed to death after his van overturned on a slippery road,
officials said.
	   In the metropolitan Manila area, Estrada ordered at least 10,000
people living along swollen creeks and rivers out of their homes
and into government shelters.
	   Many areas in Manila and nearby provinces were still under water
early Saturday. In Pampanga province north of the capital, 35
villages in the township of Candaba were submerged, Mayor Ben Gatus
said.
	   Babs also pounded areas around Mount Pinatubo volcano with heavy
rain, unleashing 1.5-meter (5 foot) avalanches of volcanic material
from the mountain's slopes. Most of the material was carried safely
away by swollen rivers.
	   It was second devastating storm in the Philippines in a week.
Last week, Super Typhoon Zeb killed at least 74 people in the
northern Philippines and 43 more in Taiwan and Japan.
