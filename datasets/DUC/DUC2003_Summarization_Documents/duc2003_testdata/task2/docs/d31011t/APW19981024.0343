	   SAN MIGUEL, Philippines (AP) _ From a distance, the smashed
coconut and abaca trees scattered on the hills look like broken
matchsticks _ a painful reminder of the destruction left by Typhoon
Babs in Catanduanes.
	   The island province was the first hit by the typhoon, which
stalled directly above it for nearly 12 hours.
	   The storm drenched the hillsides, turning them into a deadly
mush that cascaded down on helpless residents seeking higher ground
from the rising floodwaters.
	   At least 69 people from the province died, most of them buried
in landslides. Throughout the Philippines, at least 129 died.
	   At the height of the storm, water in the Bato River, which
snakes through the hills of Catanduanes to the sea, rose more than
nine meters (30 feet), reaching the ceilings of some houses.
	   Most of the buildings are now roofless and many are without
walls.
	   But residents were busy Saturday repairing roofs or making
makeshift shelters where their homes once stood. Some used wire
from toppled electrical lines for hanging clothes.
	   Everyone was drying something _ furniture, mats, clothes, rice,
abaca fiber. Others scraped mud off the floors of their homes.
	   Long areas of the shoreline were choked with large and small
trees uprooted by the typhoon. The bark had been scraped clean as
they rolled down the mountains to the river and onto the sea.
	   The entire island was without electricity. A power barge that
supplied electricity to outlying towns was swept down the river and
washed out to sea by the punishing wind and waves.
	   Eddie Tapel, a provincial council member, said entire families
were killed in the landslides in San Miguel, including many of his
relatives.
	   ``Many children will have to quit school because their families
have no more income,'' he said.
	   Many people in the area rely mostly on abaca _ a type of hemp _
coconuts and fishing for their livelihood.
	   The abaca trees are now destroyed, and all that is left of most
of the coconut trees is the spindly fronds which Filipinos use to
make garden brooms.
	   ``In all my 61 years, I haven't experienced a more destructive
typhoon,'' said San Miguel Vice Mayor Alfredo Santillan.
	   The last major one, he said, struck in October 1970 but passed
through Catanduanes in a few hours.
	   That typhoon packed 275-kph (170-mph) winds and left 2,361 dead
in the northern Philippines.
	   ``We'll just have to bear it,'' Santillan said. ``We will
recover, but it will take a long while.''
