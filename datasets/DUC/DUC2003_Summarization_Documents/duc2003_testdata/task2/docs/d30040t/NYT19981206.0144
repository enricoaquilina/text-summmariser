   RAFAH, Gaza Strip _ Cruising at 19,000 feet on Saturday in the
cockpit of the first Palestinian Airlines flight to depart from
Gaza's new international airport, Capt. Jamal Al-How from the
Jabaliya refugee camp could not restrain himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this historic moment, taking off for the first time in
history from a Palestinian airport, all the languages of the world
cannot express my pride and joy,'' he declared. ``I thank the
heroic Palestinian people, which sacrificed everything it had so
that we could reach this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, applause rang through the cabin as the 48-seat Fokker
50 propeller plane, painted with the Palestinian national colors of
red, green, black and white, took to the air. Mohammad Abdel Salam
from Bethlehem, the steward, greeted the passengers of Flight 152,
inaugurating regular service from the Gaza airport, which was
ceremonially opened last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome aboard the first flight from Yasser Arafat
International Airport, bound for Amman,'' Abdel Salam said over the
loudspeaker. ``Thank you for choosing Palestinian Airlines, and we
wish you all a pleasant flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. In the not-too-distant past, the combination
of the words ``Palestinian'' and ``airplane'' evoked images of
gun-waving hijackers from the PLO. Now the Palestinians are running
their own airline from Gaza, with planes flown by former PLO
pilots, and Palestinian security men checking bags and passengers
for would-be terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1996, the tiny Palestinian airline was an
outgrowth of the accords with Israel on Palestinian self-rule. It
has two Fokker 50s received from the Netherlands, and a Boeing 727
donated by Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, which is still
being prepared for service.
</P>
<P>
   Starting operations in 1997 without a home airport, the
airline's first flights left from Port Said in Egypt, ferrying
Muslim pilgrims to Saudi Arabia. Regular service began a few months
later from the Egyptian town of El Arish to Amman and to the Saudi
Arabian city of Jidda. Departing passengers had to make a
night-long trek by bus from Gaza to El Arish, moving slowly through
Palestinian, Israeli and Egyptian checkpoints to board flights that
took far less time than the ground journey.
</P>
<P>
   Flying from Gaza for the first time on Saturday, passengers
remarked on the simple convenience of going directly from home to
their local airport, avoiding Israeli interrogations and security
checks at border crossings and at Ben-Gurion airport near Tel Aviv,
Israel. It enhanced their sense that, while there was no
Palestinian state yet, something like one was emerging from the
often-troubled negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove here with my family, like anyone else in the world,''
said Ahmad al-Ghandour, a department head in the Palestinian
Authority. ``I'm leaving like people do everywhere else, on your
own plane, with your own passport.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahfouz Othman, a psychiatrist from Rafah, said that he was
relieved of the anxiety that often plagued his departures in the
past, when he was worried that he might be turned back or detained.
``I feel that I'm keeping my dignity; these are Palestinians like
us,'' he said as he handed his passport to a Palestinian police
officer. ``At a personal, human level, this is a changing point in
our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Not entirely. A short while after Othman spoke, Palestinian
security officers and Israeli counterparts keeping watch at the
airport got into a dispute about departure procedures, delaying
take-off for three-and-a-half hours.
</P>
<P>
   Fayez Zaidan, the airline chairman, came to the passenger lounge
to encourage his customers. ``We are with you facing the
Israelis,'' he told them. ``This is your airport.'' In the end, the
passengers were bused to the adjacent Rafah border terminal where
they went through passport control under Israeli supervision,
before returning to the plane. A few hours later, returning
passengers were delayed two hours at the same terminal for Israeli
security and document checks.
</P>
<P>
   But the first-day hitches did not mar the patriotic spirit on
the first flight from Gaza, and its passengers were greeted with
roses in Amman. Regular flights to Jidda and Cairo, Egypt, are
scheduled to start in the next few days. The airline expects to
carry thousands to the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in
March, and there are long-range plans to expand service to Cyprus,
Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always imagined that it would come,'' said Zaidan, who is
also head of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority. ``There were
many obstacles and difficulties. I'm very happy that I could
achieve this goal of establishing a civil aviation authority from
zero, an airport from zero, an airline from zero. We did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has sent some of its 400 employees to train in
Morocco and Jordan, but the core of its crews and staff served in
what was once the air wing of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, or worked in airlines in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians also gained experience in the 1980s in Maldives
Airways, which was effectively owned by the PLO, and in Air Bissau,
a government-owned carrier in Africa in which the PLO was a major
partner.
</P>
<P>
   When it was still a guerrilla movement, the PLO sent volunteers
to flight academies in Pakistan and Yugoslavia, and in the 1980s,
Palestinian fighter pilots served in the air forces of Syria, Libya
and Yemen. The PLO air fleet consisted then of small transport
planes and helicopters, used mostly for travel between the
organization's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any revolution struggling for freedom, we were fighting
for the liberation of Palestine,'' said Yassin al-Hawamdi, a pilot.
``Now we're building up a state.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, Palestinians do not control their skies.
Take-offs and landings must be reported to the Israelis. Flights
from Gaza are barred from crossing Israel's southern air-space
because there are military installations en route, compelling
flights to Amman to detour over the Sinai peninsula, meaning that
they take about 90 minutes. Sophisticated landing equipment is
still being held in an Israeli port, and planes only land and take
off at the Gaza airport in daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the Palestinian Airlines staff, operating their national
carrier from their soil is a source of great satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have traveled everywhere, to 70 countries,'' said Abdel
Salam, the steward, who worked 15 years for Kuwait Airways. ``Now I
feel different. I'm taking care of my own people. We waited a long
time to realize our dream.''
