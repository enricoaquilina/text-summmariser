<P>
   For 11 days last month, Hurricane Georges plowed across the
Caribbean, killing at least 500 people and inflicting property
damage estimated at more than $5 billion as it weaved through
nearly a dozen countries before expiring as an early fall rainstorm
over Georgia. It was a disaster _ although not for the entire
region and not necessarily for the tourist industry on which the
area's economy depends.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, damage, though extensive, was selective. Indeed,
the majority of Caribbean islands were not affected at all by the
storm and its winds, which reached a peak of 135 miles an hour.
Georges may have inflicted widespread destruction throughout the
Greater Antilles, but ``most of our 32 member states were
untouched,'' said Jean Holder, secretary general of the Caribbean
Tourism Organization. ``So over all, our position, as usual, is a
good one, and we want the traveling public to be in no doubt as to
that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire Windward Islands group of the Eastern Caribbean, for
example, was bypassed by the storm, meaning that visitors thinking
of traveling to Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, the Grenadines,
Martinique, St. Lucia or St. Vincent have no reason to change
plans. Similarly, Trinidad and Tobago, the Dutch islands of Aruba,
Bonaire and Curacao and Margarita Island just off Venezuela were
all outside the hurricane zone. The Bahamas, Cayman Islands,
Jamaica and the Turks and Caicos Islands also were not affected by
Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the larger islands that suffered a direct hit, such as
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, many important tourist destinations
were spared. Though parts of the southeastern Dominican Republic
were severely damaged, for instance, and will not return to full
normal operations for weeks, all of the hotels, restaurants and
attractions in popular northern-coast towns such as Puerto Plata
are reported to be functioning normally. So, as always, it is
advisable to check with travel agents, hotel chains and national
tourist offices about conditions at specific locales and
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Though hotels were the section of the tourism infrastructure
that proved most vulnerable to Georges' depredations, as is clear
in the country-by-country assessment below, the storm also forced
the closing of several major airports, including the regional hub
in San Juan. But at American Airlines, the principal carrier in the
region, and its affiliate, American Eagle, Caribbean service is
pretty much back to normal, said Al Becker, a company spokesman,
except for La Romana, in the eastern Dominican Republic. There, he
said, regular daily jet flights from Miami are not scheduled to
resume until December, though prop service from San Juan has been
restored.
</P>
<P>
   According to airline and tourism officials, a few other airports
remained available on a limited basis into October because, for
instance, damage to landing towers, radar equipment or runway
lights prevents after-dark landings. Mayaguez, in Puerto Rico, and
St. Croix, in the United States Virgin Islands, fell into that
category, but have now returned to normal operations. In St. Kitts,
where an extensive renovation and expansion of Robert L. Bradshaw
International Airport had been completed just weeks before the
storm struck, restrictions are still in force.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is God's hand,'' Dwyer Astaphan, minister of tourism for
St. Kitts and Nevis, said resignedly early this month. ``We
received damage to the tower and also to our terminal, but
procurement is in process right now, and there is no reason why we
cannot be completely finished with repairs by Dec. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines, on the other hand, say they were virtually
unaffected. Many vessels were still on summer routes in the
Mediterranean and Alaska when Georges was ripping through, and will
be returning to the Caribbean only this month. ``The only place we
really ran into problems was Key West,'' said Rich Steck, a
spokesman for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, ``and since they really
have got their hands full now and are closed to tourism anyway, we
are going to be substituting other destinations, such as Nassau,
until things are under better control there.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one pier at the harbor in San Juan, which is second
only to South Florida as a home port for cruise ships, suffered
damage, according to officials of the Puerto Rican government. But
that has caused no inconvenience because ``we have enough other
docks to receive cruises'' at the main harbor, said Jorge Davila,
executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Co. The damage at
Port Zante in St. Kitts, opened in 1997, was somewhat more serious,
officials there said, but not enough to require cancellation of
cruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first cruise ship to come in was on Oct. 8, a Norwegian
Cruise Line Vessel with a capacity of 1,534 passengers,'' Astaphan
said. Those returning vessels are tying up not at Port Zante but at
old piers nearby. ``I am advised they will be replaced within three
to five months,'' he said. ``In the interim, vessels with up to
1,600 passengers can tie up at the old pier, which is where they
tied up previously.''
</P>
<P>
   On islands that bore the brunt of the storm, beaches, tropical
forests, golf courses and nature reserves were also damaged. So
even though hotels in the affected areas may be functioning again,
the landscape may not appear as lush as it normally does, and some
visitors may therefore wish to postpone trips. On the other hand,
tourism authorities on several islands say they may institute
cut-rate packages this winter to lure back reluctant travelers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, damage to fields and crops on several islands means
that some food items may be unavailable at hotels or considerably
more expensive. In the end, then, whether or not to go to the
Caribbean during the coming high season is largely a matter of
individual preference. A survey of the most affected islands
follows, adhering to the same northwesterly course as the
hurricane:

<P>
   ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA _ Most of the destruction in this nation
involved residences: Officials estimate that more than half of all
homes suffered some damage. But at least half of Antigua's 28 main
hotels were also affected. Most are back in business, but the
Caribbean Hotel Association reports that several do not plan to
reopen until December. Among them are the Pineapple Beach Club, the
Inn at English Harbor, Coco Point Lodge, the Galleon Beach Club and
the Hawksbill Beach Resort.
</P>
<P>
   ST. KITTS and NEVIS _ Both of the islands that make up the
smallest country in the Caribbean were struck with considerable
force, which damaged residences and government buildings. ``Every
area was impacted, some more than others,'' Astaphan said.
Government officials estimate that 85 percent of homes suffered
some damage, most of it to roofs, and put preliminary estimates of
repairs at nearly $500 million. On Nevis, the smaller of the pair,
many of the elegant plantation homes that attract upscale visitors
have recovered quickly. But the island's main resort, the Four
Seasons, is not expected to reopen until Dec. 15, due in part to
beach erosion. Nearly half the buildings at the Hurricane Cove
Bungalows are said to have been leveled, but the hotel remains
open.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Fort Thomas Hotel and Jack Tar Village Resort and
Casino on St. Kitts are closed. Officials said the Fort Thomas
probably will not open this season and that the Jack Tar, the
biggest property on the island, is likely to remain closed until
May.
</P>
<P>
   NETHERLANDS ANTILLES _ On St. Maarten, Princess Juliana Airport
remained open throughout the storm, an indication that the island
was pummeled by less than full-force winds. Almost all of the 19
hotels and condominiums are said to have full power, water and
telephone service, although some residential areas were still
without electricity early in October, and the Millennium Beach
Resort and Maho Beach Hotel and Casino are expected to be closed at
least until December.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, tiny St. Eustatius was hard hit by the storm. As a
result, one-sixth of the island's homes lost roofs, residents were
still being advised to boil water as of mid-October, and extensive
damage to natural foliage was reported. Hotels and restaurants,
however, are fully operational.
</P>
<P>
   UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS _ Early reports of widespread
damage on all three main islands have proved exaggerated. Such
well-known destinations as Caneel Bay on St. John, the Buccaneer on
St. Croix and the Ritz-Carlton on St. Thomas briefly stopped taking
guests and reservations, but returned to normal after a quick
cleanup. Airline service is normal and all attractions are open.
</P>
<P>
   PUERTO RICO _ By official tally, more than $2 billion in damages
was inflicted to property across the island. In the San Juan area,
several hotels suffered significant damage and, according to the
Caribbean Hotel Association, remain closed for repairs, among them
the Condado Plaza, Crowne Plaza, Ramada Hotel Condado and Radisson
Normandie. Farther away, the hotels most seriously affected
appeared to be the Hyatt Dorado Beach, which tourism officials
expect will reopen Nov. 9, and the Hyatt Regency Cerromar, whose
tentative reopening date is Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant problem in the wake of the storm was the
lack of electricity. An extraordinarily high level of preparedness
mitigated some of the havoc caused by Georges on other islands, but
could not prevent damage to power lines and generators. Telephone
service was restored almost immediately; water supplies returned
shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``By Oct. 25, we expect that complete electrical service will
pretty much be restored in metropolitan San Juan,'' said Davila of
the Puerto Rico Tourism Company. But, he added, it may take a
little bit longer in the central mountains, where some paradores,
or inns, are. The luxury Horned Dorset Primavera Hotel, in Rincon,
suffered no structural damage, but was closed until Oct. 8 because
it had no utilities.
</P>
<P>
   DOMINICAN REPUBLIC _ The highest human toll, more than 280 dead
and at least 100,000 homeless according to official estimates, was
inflicted here, and the country remains in a state of shock and
mourning. Also, the government has come under fire for its alleged
lack of preparedness, and the population has complained about slow
restoration of public services, electricity in particular.
</P>
<P>
   The most severe damage to tourist facilities was concentrated in
the east, around La Romana and Punta Cana. The area's best-known
resort, Casa de Campo, is one of several hotels still closed,
though a reopening date of Dec. 20 has been set for ``a limited
inventory'' of the hotel's 300 rooms and 150 villas. The Allegro
Resort Bavaro and the Viva Dominicus expect to be fully operational
by mid-November, but the Casa del Mar is scheduled to remain closed
until Dec. 1, and officials say the Allegro Resort Caribbean
Village Decameron should be able to resume operations by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   HAITI _ The tourist infrastructure in the Western Hemisphere's
poorest nation is so ramshackle even under ordinary circumstances
that it has been hard to detect Georges' impact. Hotels in
Port-au-Prince, the capital, were suffering frequent power failures
and breakdowns in telephone service in mid-October, a normal state
of affairs there. Georges appears to have done its most severe
damage in the Artibonite Valley, far off the tourist track. Royal
Caribbean canceled at least one cruise to Labadie, on the north
coast, but that was because of reports of civil unrest, not
hurricane damage, said Steck, of Royal Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA _ It is off-limits to American tourists, but still draws
more than one million visitors a year from other countries.
According to reports from Havana, hotels there were affected only
marginally. Some hotels in northern coastal resorts such as Cayo
Coco, however, reported to have suffered some damage, but have now
reopened.
