   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ In many ways, the capital of Puerto Rico
does not look strikingly different from cities in the 50 states
like Miami, Houston and parts of New York. There are plenty of
modern new office buildings, condominiums and fast-food places.
And, just as in those other cities, Puerto Rico has lots of modest
neighborhoods, away from the modern facades, with people who are
just getting by.
</P>
<P>
   But Hurricane Georges, which hit the island last month and
caused several billion dollars in damages, has brought out one big
difference: while nearly every home in the 50 states is insured,
insurance executives and government officials estimate that only 30
percent or 40 percent of those here are covered.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that much of the cost of Hurricane Georges in
Puerto Rico will not be shouldered by insurance companies. Instead,
it will be borne mostly by the people of the island and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in Washington, using tax dollars
collected everywhere but here, because under Puerto Rico's special
commonwealth status, its people do not pay Federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a different kind of insurance here,'' said Lemuel
Toledo, a broker and consultant who has been in the insurance
business for nearly 30 years. ``It's called Federal aid.''
</P>
<P>
   While mainland insurers are expected to spend six times what the
federal government does for damage from Hurricane Georges in the
Gulf Coast states, the government will spend just as much in Puerto
Rico as the insurers do: about $1.7 billion each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, every time a storm hits an area that is
uninsured, or underinsured, taxpayers have to come in and foot much
of the bill,'' said Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for the Insurance
Information Institute, an industry group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And something else is increasing federal costs from hurricanes
both here and along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Insurers, reeling
from heavy losses from previous hurricanes, have raised their
deductibles to 2 percent of the amount of coverage, up from the old
standards of $250 or $500. For a $100,000 policy the deductible is
now $2,000. One condo complex on the beach here with $25 million in
coverage has a deductible of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency says that people with
big deductibles who need emergency repairs to live in their homes
can get government help, and that many homeowners and condo
associations may be eligible for federally subsidized loans.
</P>
<P>
   The reason many people in Puerto Rico do not have insurance on
their homes, officials and insurers here say, is mostly a matter of
money. While there are plenty of expensive houses and limousines on
the island, most people have little money. Annual income averages
$8,500, less than half the average in Mississippi, the poorest
state. But in Mississippi, the majority of homeowners has mortgages
and is required by banks to buy insurance. Here, people often build
modest homes without mortgages _ sometimes worth less than $20,000,
and they frequently go without insurance. Moreover, when people
here buy insurance they most often buy bare-bones policies that do
not cover furniture or theft.
</P>
<P>
   But other reasons also account for the difference. Not only do
most poorer Puerto Ricans count on federal aid to bail them out of
disasters, they are also victims, consumer advocates say, of
insurers here who essentially ignore lower-income homeowners to
concentrate on wealthier clients whose homes are sturdier and who
buy policies with higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   That practice, they say, is a form of discrimination often
referred to as redlining, a term that grew out of the practice _
now outlawed _ by insurance companies and banks in places like
Philadelphia, Detroit and New York of drawing red lines on maps
around neighborhoods they decided to exclude.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the poor neighborhoods on the outskirts of San Juan,
people say insurance salesmen never come calling. Residents say
they do not really understand insurance and they assume they cannot
afford it.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Toa Baja, Tanya Davila sat in a kitchen chair in
the shade of her concrete-and-wood three-bedroom house, waiting for
a representative of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Hurricane Georges ripped off most of her house's tin roofing and
most of her belongings were ruined. The house, Ms. Davila said, is
worth about $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me to buy insurance,'' she said. ``Nobody
ever came to talk to us about insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davila, 42, said she did not know anyone who had homeowner's
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't buy disaster insurance because they know the
government is going to take care of them,'' she said. ```If I can
get something for free, why pay for it?' That's not my opinion. But
that's the way a lot of people think.''
</P>
<P>
   In a section of neatly kept homes in the nearby town of Catano,
Petra Gonzalez, 78, said she was hoping that FEMA would repair the
roof on her $25,000 wood-and-tin house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't build this house thinking the government would take
care of me if something happened,'' she said. ``I never imagined
anything like this could happen. That's the truth. I'm a poor
person. I'm an elderly person. My husband is gone. If the
government doesn't help me, there's nothing I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some insurers and brokers acknowledged that it was difficult, if
not impossible, to get insurance on the many inexpensive wooden
houses in Puerto Rico. Nor do insurers regard poor sections as
prime markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd rather deal with the upper- middle-class guy with a
$250,000 home and four cars than the guy with a $30,000 home and
one car,'' said Toledo, who now concentrates on commercial
insurance. ``It takes the same amount of time, but there is so much
more premium and so much more commission.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not redlining, Toledo contended. ``Redlining means
somebody asks for insurance and you don't sell it,'' he said. ``But
if nobody asks, you're not redlining.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Garcia, the insurance commissioner of Puerto Rico,
also sees no discrimination. ``This is a free-competition market,''
Garcia said. ``The companies are at liberty to write whatever risks
they want to write. People either buy it or they don't. I can't
force them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, J. Robert Hunter, the director of
insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, said insurers had
never publicly acknowledged redlining. Yet several big companies
have paid millions to settle suits accusing them of redlining and
agreed to open offices in places where there had been no insurance
sales force for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on in Puerto Rico has all the characteristics of
red-lining,'' said Hunter, who has made several trips here to work
as an adviser to the Puerto Rican government.

<P>
</P>
<P>
   Jose J. Villamil, a Wharton-educated economist who heads a
consulting company, Estudios Tecnicos, which works with the
government and private industry, said he did not believe that
insurers were deliberately discriminating against the poor. But
Villamil said some of the remedies imposed in redlining lawsuits
should be applied in Puerto Rico anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has a role to play in terms of putting pressure
on the companies,'' he said. ``The companies should be more
pro-active in educating people about insurance and in providing
access to insurance. Maybe they should develop products more in
line with people's capacity to buy insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen companies, mostly Puerto Rican, sell insurance on
the island. Royal Group, a British insurer with more than 100 years
of experience in the Caribbean, is among the leaders. Only two big
United States companies, Nationwide Insurance Enterprise and
American International Group, sell homeowners' coverage in Puerto
Rico, though Allstate Corp. is preparing to start selling here.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of handicapping the risks on an island that lies
in the path of hurricanes and in an earthquake zone, combined with
the relatively small size of the Puerto Rico market at 3.8 million
people, have kept the other big American players away, said
Goldstein of the industry group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If insurers felt they could add to their bottom line,'' he
said, ``they'd be in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance companies began imposing higher deductibles after
Hurricane Andrew walloped southern Florida with $15.5 billion in
insured losses in 1992. To get regulatory approval for the change,
insurers in the United States threatened to cut back on the number
of policies they wrote. In Puerto Rico, the insurers said that
without the 2 percent deductible, the cost of reinsurance would
force them to raise premiums beyond the reach of many.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, a former Texas insurance commissioner, said the high
deductibles ``may have been a necessary stopgap'' immediately after
Hurricane Andrew. But the insurance companies could reduce the
deductible now without harm to their profit margins, he said
adding, ``Reinsurance prices have come way down in the last two or
three years.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Hunter said, consumers should be given the choice,
as they are in some states, of accepting either the high deductible
or paying higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Jose de la Cruz Skerrett, a plaintiff's lawyer who has often
opposed insurance companies in court, estimates that with the 2
percent deductible, 80 percent of the losses from Hurricane Georges
in Puerto Rico will turn out to be uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   For some condo owners, the high deductible means significant
costs. At the 13-story Solemar condominium on the beach in San
Juan, Ivan Tort, president of the board, estimates damages at
$60,000 _ well below the $100,000 deductible on the condo's $5
million policy. So all the repairs are going to have to be paid by
owners of the condo's 30 apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live on an island,'' Tort said, ``it comes with the
turf.''
</P>
<P>
   At the 403-apartment Condado del Mar condominium nearby, Luis
del Valle is not so sanguine. Del Valle estimates damage at $1.5
million. But he says much of the building was unharmed and that the
deductible _ now figured at $500,000 _ should not be based on the
total value of the complex but only on the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think this is fair,'' del Valle said. ``Yes, we have
a contract, but we believe there are some ambiguities. We're going
to court. We're talking about a lot of money here.'' &QL;
