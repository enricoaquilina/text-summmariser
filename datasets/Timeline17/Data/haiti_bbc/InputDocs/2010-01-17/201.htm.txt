Abdoulaye Wade said Haitians could `` return to their origin '' Senegal 's president says he will offer free land and `` repatriation '' to people affected by the earthquake in Haiti . 
President Abdoulaye Wade said Haitians were sons and daughters of Africa since Haiti was founded by slaves , including some thought to be from Senegal . 
`` The president is offering voluntary repatriation to any Haitian that wants to return to their origin , '' said Mr Wade 's spokesman , Mamadou Bemba Ndiaye . 
Tuesday 's earthquake killed tens of thousands and left many more homeless . 
Buildings have been reduced to rubble , the distribution of aid is slow , and people have been flooding out of the devastated capital , Port-au-Prince . 
`` Senegal is ready to offer them parcels of land - even an entire region . 
It all depends on how many Haitians come , '' Mr Bemba Ndiaye said . 
`` If it 's just a few individuals , then we will likely offer them housing or small pieces of land . 
If they come en masse we are ready to give them a region . '' 
The spokesman emphasised that if a region was given , it would be in a fertile part of the country rather than in its parched deserts , the Associated Press news agency reported .
