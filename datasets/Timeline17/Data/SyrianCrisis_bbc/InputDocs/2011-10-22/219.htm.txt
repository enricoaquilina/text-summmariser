Syria crisis : Iran 's Ahmadinejad criticises killings President Ahmadinejad -LRB- R -RRB- of Iran has so far hesitated to criticise the crackdown by his Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad -LRB- L -RRB- Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has criticised the killings in its ally Syria sparked by the government 's violent crackdown on dissent . 
In his most outspoken comments yet , Mr Ahmadinejad told CNN : `` Nobody has the right to kill others , neither the government nor its opponents . '' 
He said Iran would encourage all sides to reach an understanding , but warned the US not to intervene in Syria . 
Syria has close ties with Iran , which suppressed its own protests in 2009 . 
Iran has also put down or prevented about a dozen protests since the wave of anti-government uprisings in the Middle East began earlier this year . 
`` We are going to make greater efforts to encourage both the government of Syria and the other side , all parties , to reach an understanding , '' Mr Ahmadinejad said in the interview with CNN . 
He warned against any outside intervention in Syria , in particular by the US . 
`` The positions of the United States are not going to help . 
They have never helped , '' he said . 
Iran has been muted in its criticisms of Syria , its most important ally in the region . 
However in September , Mr Ahmadinejad spoke of `` needed reforms '' , while the Iranian foreign minister called on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to `` be accountable to his people 's legitimate demands '' . 
Shia Iran is regarded with suspicion by its Sunni Arab neighbors . 
Syria 's government is dominated by the Alawite sect , an offshoot of Shia Islam . 
Hopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .
