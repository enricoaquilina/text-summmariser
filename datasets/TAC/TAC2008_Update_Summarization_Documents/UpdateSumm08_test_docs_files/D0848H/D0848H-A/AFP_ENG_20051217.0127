Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip 
Erdogan defended Saturday author Orhan Pamuk's right to free speech, 
but rejected European Union pressure on Ankara to halt the 
controversial trial of the internationally renowned novelist.
</P>
<P>
"My stance on freedom of thought is clear because I myself have 
become a victim (of restrictions) in this context," Erdogan was 
quoted as saying by Anatolia news agency in the central city of 
Konya.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that the EU, which sees Pamuk's trial as a 
test for Turkey's commitment to democracy and human rights, "is 
trying to put our judiciary under pressure," Anatolia reported.
</P>
<P>
"This is wrong," Erdogan said. "Either right or wrong, the case 
is now before the justice... Let's see the outcome and then make 
comments."
</P>
<P>
Pamuk, Turkey's best-known writer and winner of many 
international awards, appeared before court in Istanbul Friday on 
charges of denigrating Turkish national identity for telling a Swiss 
magazine that "one million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were killed in 
these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it."
</P>
<P>
The case was adjourned to February to await a decision by the 
justice ministry, whose authorization is needed to proceed with the 
trial.
</P>
<P>
European Parliament members, who attended the hearing, 
criticized the government for having squandered the opportunity to 
demonstrate its respect for freedom of speech by failing to halt the 
trial.
</P>
<P>
Turkey began membership talks on October 4, but critics say the 
country has yet to fully embrace the EU's democarcy norms despite 
the far-reaching reforms it has already undertaken.
</P>
<P>
Erdogan has defended freedom of speech citing his own conviction 
for "inciting religious hatred" by reciting a poem with Islamic 
messages during a political rally in 1997, which earned him a 
four-month stint in prison.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul called on the EU not to judge 
Turkey's record by a single case.
</P>
<P>
"Let's not be unfair towards Turkey," he told the Sabah daily. 
"There is no conviction (in the Pamuk case) yet. There is no one in 
jail in Turkey because of (exercising) freedom of expression."
</P>
<P>
Gul pledged more efforts to ensure that the reforms Turkey 
undertook to boost its EU bid are properly implemented on the 
ground.
</P>
<P>
"It's our duty to strengthen the reform process," he said. "The 
changes adopted so far are not cosmetic, but there is still more to 
be done."
</P>
<P>
Erdogan said he had also asked the interior minister to 
investigate the apparent security lapses at Friday's trial, which 
was marred by nationalist militants heaping abuse on the writer and 
foreign observers.
</P>
<P>
Slogans accusing Pamuk of being a "traitor" followed him to the 
courtroom, and along the way a woman hit him on the head with a 
file. His car was pelted with eggs as he left.
</P>
<P>
British parliamentarian Denis MacShane, a former Europe 
minister, said he had been punched in the face by a hostile lawyer 
inside the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
Erdogan denounced the scenes as "ugliness" and said the police 
had committed "a serious mistake" by allowing such incidents.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish press accused the authorities of damaging Turkey's 
image by failing both to stop the trial and to ensure security at 
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
"Orhan Pamuk's trial and the scenes at the courthouse leave me 
with the impression that some people within the state favour such 
incidents in order to  undermine (Turkey's) EU membership bid," a 
Sabah columnist wrote.
