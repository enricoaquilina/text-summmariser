EDITORIAL: MEDICARE DRUG PLAN GIVES WITH ONE HAND, TAKES WITH THE OTHER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush administration is about as likely to admit the Republican
Medicare drug assistance plan that was rushed through Congress has
flaws as it is to say, "Uh, you know there
were some questions about the intelligence on Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Senior citizens who are trying to sort through their drug coverage
options face many problems, a main one being that those
options are complicated and difficult to compare. Another, it now
turns out, is that many drug companies that have been
giving drugs (or selling them at low cost) to seniors
in order to promote their products while giving elderly people
a break aren't going to offer such programs anymore.
</P>
<P>
Why? The companies fear they may find themselves wrestling with Uncle
Sam if they try to maintain what they're doing for
seniors while participating in government programs at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The government's logic evidently is that if the companies waive drug
costs, then they might be considered to be making illegal
kickbacks. The thinking is that the companies might be setting
aside their fees to induce patients to take drugs that
were more expensive than ones offered by competitors. If the
patients then signed up for the Medicare program, the government
-- and taxpayers -- would have to pay the difference.
</P>
<P>
Confusing? Oh, it's not as bad as it will be for
a lot of seniors. Consider, among many facts in an
N&amp;O report from staff writer Jean P. Fisher, that the
Medicare Part D plan is going to be run by
dozens of private insurance companies across the country. In North
Carolina, 16 companies are offering 38 different plans. Individuals who
have less than $14,355 in annual income get free or
reduced premiums. That income figure is maddeningly low, of course,
and seniors who are just a little above it, or
even a good bit above it, may be in dire
straits indeed. Drug companies that offer patient assistance programs typically
have a higher income cutoff, about $19,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
The concept of covering prescription costs through Medicare is worthwhile. But
the plan now going into effect smacks of a political
taint: The president and his party vowed to do something
about drug costs for seniors but wanted at the same
time to protect drug manufacturers and insurance companies no matter
what. It's a mess. It's hopelessly confusing. It's a plan
that won't help nearly as many people as it should
help, and will leave some worse off than they are
now.
</P>
<P>
Instead of turning the tide against a movement toward a national
health care system -- which is what this administration and
the drug and insurance industries are desperately trying to do
-- this program will only encourage it.
</P>
<P>
The next edition of Congress, which unfortunately won't be in until
after the 2006 elections, will have a repair job on
its hands. And its members will have plenty of reason
to get busy. It's the right thing to do for
senior citizens for whom a reliable supply of affordable medicine
can be a cost-effective life-saver. It's also politically smart, as
anyone can tell who's paying any attention to the considerable
voting clout elderly Americans have.
