TRYING OUT A POWER SOURCE OF THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>

As a fuel cell housed in a metal box about the
size of a small SUV hummed quietly in the parking
lot of the Babylon, N.Y., Town Hall with puffs of
steam floating out of its exhaust pipe, the chairman of
the Long Island Power Authority, Richard Kessel, announced early this
month that the utility was seeking a company to build
and operate a 10-megawatt fuel cell that would provide enough
energy to power 10,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first project of its kind in America,"
Kessel said of the plan to feed fuel cell energy
directly to the power grid. "We're taking fuel cells to
a new level."
</P>
<P>
Fuel cells are "clean" energy generators that convert hydrogen to electricity
by a chemical process, requiring no combustion. The exhaust is
water, heat and some carbon dioxide. Currently, most fuel cells
extract the hydrogen from natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The proposed plant, to be situated at a substation in West
Babylon, is to replace a "farm" of 75 smaller fuel
cells now being tested there. LIPA does not expect homeowner
electricity rates to increase as a result of the new
project, Kessel said, even though fuel cells generate electricity at
a higher cost than combustion generators.
</P>
<P>
Three days after the announcement, in the quiet living room of
a house in West Islip, Sister Gertrude O'Brien flipped a
switch on the reading lamp over her easy chair. The
lamp, one of several appliances in the house powered by
the fuel cell sitting in the middle of the backyard,
dutifully lighted the room. "I think it's kind of ugly,"
Sister Gertrude said of the bulky fuel cell out back,
"but I would say that the benefits greatly outweigh the
aesthetics."
</P>
<P>
Those benefits were visible on a day in December when a
car hit a utility pole nearby. The whole neighborhood lost
power, but Sister Gertrude and the two other nuns who
live in the house could turn on their lights and
watch television.
</P>
<P>
Next door, when the Rev. Douglas Dower returned to his home
that same night, he noticed all the homes on his
block were dark. When he got inside, he checked his
appliances.
</P>
<P>
"When I opened the refrigerator door, the light went on and
everything inside was still cold," Dower said.
</P>
<P>
The fuel cell in his yard, hooked up through conduits and
pipes in the cellar to provide heat, light and power
to essential appliances in his home, did not need the
LIPA grid.
</P>
<P>
Sister Gertrude and Father Doug, as they are called at Good
Samaritan Hospital where they both work, live in hospital-owned homes
that are two of several fuel cell test sites across
the Island. Others include buildings at Brookhaven National Laboratory, a
McDonald's restaurant and the Babylon Town Hall.
</P>
<P>
Baron Davis, who lives with his wife and two young sons
in a home they rent in Mineola, N.Y., first came
to live on Long Island from Anchorage, Alaska, in August
2003, landing at Newark (N.J.) Liberty International Airport only 20
minutes after a widespread blackout had knocked out power to
most of the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
With nowhere else to go, Davis rented a car and drove
with his sons to the Mineola home where the family
had just moved. "It was a nightmare, I couldn't even
see road signs," Davis said of that harrowing six-hour drive.
</P>
<P>
But he is feeling more secure these days. Since early January,
Davis' home has been one of seven in Mineola, owned
by Winthrop Hospital, that are powered and heated partly by
a fuel cell.
</P>
<P>
"They basically created a ditch and connected pipes over a week,"
he said of the installation by Plug Power Inc., the
Albany-based company that manufactured the fuel cells for the tests.
"It really didn't create any problems."
</P>
<P>
The fuel cell power has been more reliable so far. Before
the fuel cell was hooked up, the lights in the
house would flicker every day, he said, and he often
had to reboot his computer.
</P>
<P>
"Ever since they've had this on, I haven't seen any glitches,"
Davis, an unemployed electrical engineer, said of the fuel cell.
"No lights flickering on and off anymore."
</P>
<P>
But fuel cells like those used in Long Island homes are
too expensive, about $75,000, and require servicing too often to
be a viable residential alternative right now, according to Roger
Saillant, president and chief executive of Plug Power. The main
function of the tests is to improve the technology.
</P>
<P>
"You can compare it to the combustion engine in a car
-- billions have been built, there's an opportunity to learn
from each one of them," Saillant said. "Of all the
fuel cells in all the world, there's probably not 2,000
of them."
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
The LIPA plan to use fuel cells to supply the grid
is part of an effort to generate 25 percent of
the utility's energy using renewable sources by 2014, a goal
set by the New York state Public Service Commission last
year, Kessel said.
</P>
<P>
The utility has also already contracted with Florida Power and Light
to build a windmill farm -- 40 to 50 windmill
turbines -- about six miles from the Island's south shore,
near Robert Moses State Park, providing 140 megawatts of power
to the grid. Long Island's power demands averaged about 2,989
megawatts per hour in 2004 during peak hours.
</P>
<P>
But while windmills create electricity from ocean winds, the fuel cells
used for LIPA's project will use a fossil fuel to
operate: natural gas. The public service commission includes fuel cells
in its policy, a commission spokesman, David Flanagan, said, to
spur the development of cells that will one day run
on renewable resources like methane or electrical current.
</P>
<P>
Gordian Raacke, head of the environmental group Renewable Energy Long Island,
discussed the future of fuel cells at the Babylon Town
Hall news conference, where he praised LIPA's newest energy project.
</P>
<P>
Raacke powers his East End home with solar panels. Under a
LIPA plan that allows homeowners using solar energy to "run
their meters backward," Raacke feeds electricity back to the grid
and gets credits on his electric bill instead of charges.
"I don't pay anything for electricity," he said. "When the
day is overcast and I need energy, I use the
credits."
</P>
<P>
The fuel cell of the future, Raacke believes, will be able
to extract and store hydrogen from solar- and wind-generated energy,
so if he had one in his house, he would
not need to tap the grid on a cloudy day.
"Fuel cell technology provides an important link in the alternative
energy chain," he said. "It closes the loop."
</P>
<P>
Saillant of Plug Power said it is indeed possible for fuel
cells to store hydrogen gas taken from a mixture of
water and the electrical current generated by wind turbines and
solar panels. Ideally, the stored gas would be used on
a calm or overcast day to continue powering and heating
the home.
</P>
<P>
But he estimates that fuel cells not requiring natural gas are,
under the best federal-financing conditions, at least 15 years away.
</P>
<P>
For now in Mineola, Davis is happy with the first month
of fuel cell power in his home. "Having experienced a
major outage, I can really appreciate this," he said.
