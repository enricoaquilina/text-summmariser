Lawmaker's Abramoff Ties Investigated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As federal officials pursue a wide-ranging
investigation into the activities of Washington lobbyist Jack
Abramoff, his arrest on fraud charges in the purchase of a Florida
casino boat company has increasingly focused attention on a
little-known congressman from rural Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert W. Ney, R-Ohio, placed comments in the Congressional
Record favorable to Abramoff's 2000 purchase of the casino boat
company, SunCruz Casinos. Two years later, Ney sponsored legislation
to reopen a casino for a Texas Indian tribe that Abramoff represented.
</P>
<P>
Ney approved a 2002 license for an Israeli telecommunications
company to install antennas for the House. The company later paid
Abramoff $280,000 for lobbying. It also donated $50,000 to a charity
that Abramoff sometimes used to secretly pay for some of his lobbying
activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ney accepted many favors from Abramoff, among them
campaign contributions, dinners at the lobbyist's downtown restaurant,
skybox fund-raisers, including one at his MCI Center box here, and a
golfing trip to Scotland in August 2002. If statements made by
Abramoff to tribal officials and in an e-mail are to be believed, Ney
sought the Scotland trip after he agreed to help Abramoff's Texas
Indian clients. Abramoff then arranged for his charity to pay for the
trip, according to documents released by a Senate committee
investigating the lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
Ney is under investigation by Florida federal prosecutors looking
into Abramoff's acquisition of SunCruz, according to sources familiar
with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Abramoff and his business partner Adam Kidan were indicted in August
on fraud charges related to the purchase.
</P>
<P>
Ney declined to be interviewed. He has said his actions benefiting
Abramoff had nothing to do with the favors he received. He said he was
misled by Abramoff and his associates.
</P>
<P>
``I am absolutely outraged by the dishonest and duplicitous words
and actions of Jack Abramoff,'' Ney said last year when Abramoff's
statements about Ney first came up in e-mails released by the Senate
Indian Affairs Committee. ``As the testimony at both committee
hearings has revealed, Jack Abramoff repeatedly lied to advance his
own financial interests.''
</P>
<P>
Abramoff, whose attorneys declined to comment for this article, has
publicly denied that he misled Ney.
</P>
<P>
This spring, Ney hired a prominent Washington criminal defense
lawyer, Mark Tuohey, to handle inquiries from the Justice Department
and congressional investigators pursuing the widening scandal. Tuohey
has not returned phone calls in recent weeks to discuss his client.
</P>
<P>
A six-term congressman from rural eastern Ohio, Ney, 51, does not
have a national profile. A former teacher and public safety director
for his hometown of Bellaire, Ney was an Ohio legislator in 1994 when
he defeated the Democratic incumbent in the congressional district
once represented by Wayne Hays (D).
</P>
<P>
But to members of Congress, Ney is known as the mayor of Capitol
Hill. Ney is House Administration Committee chairman, a powerful
position that doles out budgets, equipment, offices and parking spaces
to House members. These perks are used by House Republican leaders to
keep their rank and file in line.
</P>
<P>
Ney became chairman of the committee thanks to his political
patron, Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who recently stepped down as House
majority leader after he was indicted on a charge of conspiracy to
violate a Texas campaign law. Shortly after Ney arrived in the House
in 1994, he became a part of DeLay's Retain Our Majority Program
(ROMP), a fund-raising effort in which GOP colleagues donated to
Republicans such as Ney in districts without a safe majority. After
lines were redrawn to make Ney's district more Republican, he returned
the favor, donating to other vulnerable House Republicans. That helped
him earn his chairmanship in 2001, leapfrogging over a colleague with
more seniority.
</P>
<P>
Ney and Abramoff, whom DeLay once described as ``one of my closest
and dearest friends,'' crossed paths as early as 1996. That year Ney
took a trip to Montenegro sponsored by a foundation that had links to
Abramoff, who was a lobbyist for Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
A few years later, Ney paid some unusual attention to another
Abramoff client, the Florida gambling boat company SunCruz, which was
headquartered more than 1,000 miles outside of Ney's congressional
district. Abramoff and his business partner were trying to buy the
cruise ship fleet from Konstantinos ``Gus'' Boulis, but Boulis was
demanding unwelcome additional terms.
</P>
<P>
In March 2000, Ney used the Congressional Record to assail Boulis.
</P>
<P>
``On the Ohio River we have gaming interests that run clean
operations and provide quality entertainment,'' Ney wrote. ``I don't
want to see the actions of one bad apple in Florida, or anywhere else
to affect the business aspect of this industry or hurt any innocent
casino patron in our country.''
</P>
<P>
Ney's remarks were orchestrated by Michael Scanlon, a former DeLay
spokesman who had just been hired to work for Abramoff at Preston
Gates &amp; Ellis LLP. Scanlon had approached Ney through his chief of
staff, Neil Volz, according to sources who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. Volz has repeatedly declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
A few months later, Boulis agreed in principle to sell SunCruz to
Abramoff and Kidan for $147.5 million. The deal closed in the fall.
But Abramoff and Kidan failed to make good on a $23 million payment
owed to Boulis, court records show.
</P>
<P>
When Boulis was being difficult in the negotiations, Ney again made
an official statement, this time heaping praise on Kidan.
</P>
<P>
``Since my previous statement, I have come to learn that SunCruz
Casino now finds itself under new ownership and, more importantly,
that its new owner has a renowned reputation for honesty and
integrity,'' Ney said in the Congressional Record on Oct. 26, 2000.
``The new owner, Mr. Adam Kidan, is most well known for his successful
enterprise, Dial-a-Mattress, but he is also well known as a solid
individual and a respected member of his community.
</P>
<P>
``While Mr. Kidan certainly has his hands full in his efforts to
clean up SunCruz's reputation, his track record as a businessman and
as a citizen lead me to believe that he will easily transform SunCruz
from a questionable enterprise to an upstanding establishment that the
gaming community can be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
But Kidan's ``track record'' included a string of lawsuits,
judgments, liens, bankruptcies and failed businesses. His
Dial-a-Mattress franchise in the District of Columbia was in
bankruptcy. He had filed personal bankruptcy, and he had surrendered
his law license in New York after he was accused of fraud. And one of
his mentors, Anthony Moscatiello, was alleged by law enforcement to be
an accountant for New York's Gambino crime family.
</P>
<P>
Ney later said he did not know about Kidan's background.
</P>
<P>
Four months after Ney's remarks in the Congressional Record, Boulis
was murdered in Fort Lauderdale. Police did not make any arrests in
the case until September, when they charged four men in the slaying,
including Moscatiello and a business associate of Moscatiello's whom
Kidan had paid $250,000 as catering consultants.
</P>
<P>
Five weeks after the Boulis killing, SunCruz officials, including
Kidan, threw a $1,000-a-head fund-raiser for Ney at Abramoff's skybox
at the MCI Center, according to Abramoff's fund-raising log.
</P>
<P>
In early 2002, Volz left his post as Ney's chief of staff to join
Abramoff's lobbying team. Soon after, in March 2002, Ney agreed to
sponsor legislation that would benefit the Tigua tribe of El Paso, an
Abramoff and Scanlon client. They wanted Ney's help to reopen the
Tiguas' casino, which the state of Texas had shut down.
</P>
<P>
``Just met with Ney!!! We're f'ing gold!!!! He's going to do
Tigua,'' Abramoff told Scanlon in a March 20, 2002, e-mail.
</P>
<P>
Six days later Abramoff directed tribal officials to make three
contributions totaling $32,000 to Ney's campaign and political action
committees. A Ney spokesman recently said that money has been donated
to Ohio charities.
</P>
<P>
On June 7, 2002, Abramoff sent an e-mail to Tigua consultant Marc
Schwartz wrote that ``our friend'' had ``asked if we could help (as in
cover) a Scotland golf trip for him and some staff.''
</P>
<P>
The e-mail does not name ``our friend,'' but Schwartz testified in
the Senate last fall that it was Ney.
</P>
<P>
Abramoff, wrote that ``the trip will be quite expensive (we did
this for another member -- you know who) 2 years ago.'' He was
referring to an earlier Scotland golf trip that Abramoff had arranged
in 2000 for DeLay. Abramoff suggested to Schwartz that the tribe send
$50,000 to a charity he directed, the Capital Athletic Foundation,
which would pay for the trip ``as an educational mission.''
</P>
<P>
Ney later stated on disclosure forms filed with the House that the
August 2002 trip cost $3,200 and was paid for by the National Center
for Public Policy Research, a conservative advocacy group on whose
board Abramoff served. The Washington Post reported last year that the
trip was actually paid for by the Capital Athletic Foundation, which
reported in tax records that it spent $150,225 on the trip.
</P>
<P>
Ney has said he was misled by Abramoff about who paid for the trip.
</P>
<P>
``In April, 2002, I was approached by Mr. Abramoff, who I believed
to be a respected member of the community, and asked to go on a trip
to Scotland which Mr. Abramoff said would help support a charitable
organization, that he founded, through meetings he organized with
Scottish Parliament officials,'' Ney said in a statement last
November.
</P>
<P>
Ney's report to Congress listed as a purpose of the trip: ``speech
to Scottish Parliamentarians.'' However, there is no record of Ney's
speech in the Scottish Parliament's register of official visits kept
by the external liaison office, which is available on the Web. In
addition, at the time of Ney's trip, the Scottish Parliament was out
for its August recess, spokeswoman Sally Coyne said.
</P>
<P>
Ney is not the first public official who has come under scrutiny by
investigators for the Scotland trip. David Safavian, then chief of
staff at the General Services Administration, also went on the trip
with Ney, Abramoff and former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed
Jr. Safavian, who went on to become the chief White House procurement
officer, was indicted this month on charges that he lied to
investigators looking into the Scotland trip when he said that
Abramoff had no business before the his agency.
</P>
<P>
The trip, Ney said in his statement last year, had nothing to do
with legislation for the tribe.
</P>
<P>
``I want to be absolutely clear that at no point, ever, was I made
even remotely aware that any Indian tribe played any role in this
trip,'' Ney said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
Ney said he supported the Tigua legislation at Abramoff's request
after the lobbyist told him the provision was supported by Sen.
Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., who was sponsoring the election reform
bill that would carry the Tigua provision.
</P>
<P>
``I then (in July 2002) personally asked Senator Dodd about this
provision and he expressed no knowledge of it,'' Ney said. ``In short,
I had been misled by Jack Abramoff. I then asked Jack Abramoff why
Senator Dodd was apparently not supporting it and Mr. Abramoff told me
that someone had lied to him. The matter was then closed from my
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
However, the Tiguas say no one told them the matter was closed.
Tigua consultant Schwartz later testified to the Senate Indian Affairs
Committee that Ney remained a strong supporter of the Tigua
legislation and Abramoff long after his conversation with Dodd.
</P>
<P>
Schwartz said that in August 2002 -- a month after Ney's reported
conversation with Dodd and around the time of the Scotland trip --
Abramoff arranged for Ney to meet with Tigua representatives in his
office. Before the meeting, ``in an e-mail to me, Abramoff mentioned
that Congressman Ney didn't want his trip to Scotland brought up, as
he would show his appreciation to the Tribe later,'' Schwartz
testified.
</P>
<P>
The meeting lasted more than 90 minutes, two tribal members
testified at the Senate hearing. The tribal leaders who attended the
meeting were pleased and impressed with the outcome, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
``During that meeting, Congressman Ney was very animated about Mr.
Abramoff's skill and repute as a leader in the lobbying circles,''
Schwartz testified. ``We were told about the impending success of Mr.
Abramoff's legislative plan and how much Congressman Ney wanted to
help to restore the Tribe's ability to conduct gaming on their
reservation.''
</P>
<P>
Two months later, on Oct. 8, after the election bill came out of a
House-Senate conference committee without a Tigua provision, Ney held
a conference call with tribal officials and told them of his
``disbelief that Dodd had gone back on his word'' to support the
provision, Schwartz testified. Ney also expressed his continued
support for the Tiguas, tribal officials said.
</P>
<P>
Ney responded to Schwartz's testimony by saying, ``I, like these
Indian tribes and other members of Congress, was duped by Jack
Abramoff.''
</P>
<P>
Ney later said he was very angry at Abramoff and Scanlon, who he
said had misled him about Dodd. Ney has called Abramoff and Scanlon's
activities in the Tigua episode ``nefarious.''
</P>
<P>
Abramoff shot back by referring to the conference call when he
spoke to the New York Times Magazine this spring. ``It's crazy'' for
Ney to say he was duped, Abramoff said. ``He was on the phone for an
hour and a half!''
</P>
<P>
In the late 1990s, members of Congress became increasingly
frustrated at the lack of cell phone coverage inside the Capitol and
its nearby office buildings.
</P>
<P>
The House decided to let the major wireless companies select -- and
pay for -- a company to install antennas for cellular phones. In 1999,
AT&amp;T Wireless had asked LGC Wireless of San Jose to work with the
House bureaucracy to put the antennas and repeaters into House
buildings. The project was one of the largest of its kind, worth more
than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
At the time, LGC was the world's leading provider of such equipment
and had wired the headquarters of most cellular phone companies,
including Nextel and AT&amp;T. During the next year, LGC worked with the
architect of the Capitol and the House Information Resources office to
develop a plan.
</P>
<P>
Then Foxcom Wireless, an Israeli start-up telecommunications firm,
entered the picture. Foxcom, which has since moved headquarters from
Jerusalem to Vienna, Va., and been renamed MobileAccess Networks,
lobbied for the job.
</P>
<P>
In early 2001, Ney took charge of the House Administration
Committee, which was ultimately responsible for the antenna job.
Sometime that year, exactly when is unclear, Foxcom donated $50,000 to
the Capitol Athletic Foundation, Abramoff's charity. Foxcom officials
have declined to be interviewed about the donation or the wireless
project. A spokesman for Foxcom, now MobileAccess, referred all
questions Monday to Ney's committee.
</P>
<P>
Also that same year, a decision was delayed on the antennas, which
caught House staff by surprise.
</P>
<P>
``We were really surprised, given all the work we put in with LGC
in designing the system,'' said Henry F. ``Bud'' Collins Jr., the
senior network systems engineer for the House. ``Then, all of a sudden
this other company showed up. We had to go through this whole thing
again.''
</P>
<P>
LGC Chief Operating Officer Alex Gray wrote Ney to complain about
the ``highly politicized selection process'' that favored the Israeli
company despite the House's ``Buy American'' posture. ``Only Foxcom
was permitted a full and fair hearing on the merits of its proposal --
essentially a 'back room' deal based on political expediency alone,''
Gray wrote.
</P>
<P>
Assistant House Counsel Carolyn Betz, replying on behalf of Ney,
said in a letter to LGC that in the fall of 2001 the major wireless
companies were receiving ballots to vote on who should get the
contract.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Betz, LGC president and chief executive Ian
Sugarbroad called the election process ``deeply flawed and unfair.''
He said each wireless company was sent a ballot and allowed to vote
for LGC, Foxcom or ``no preference.'' There were no details on the bid
proposals, such as cost, security features, band capacity or critical
performance metrics, Sugarbroad said.
</P>
<P>
Brian Walsh, Ney's spokesman, provided The Post redacted copies of
the ballots. Three show checkmarks in a box next to Foxcom. The other
three ballots are marked ``no preference.''
</P>
<P>
But representatives of all six companies said they voted no
preference, according to interviews and documents. Five of them were
interviewed by The Post, and the sixth made its preference known in a
letter obtained by The Post.
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the companies -- Cingular, Nextel, Sprint, Verizon
Wireless, AT&amp;T Wireless and Voicestream -- said they remained neutral
because both LGC and Foxcom were considered capable of doing the job.
</P>
<P>
Walsh said those statements are ``an absolute contradiction to the
documentation.''
</P>
<P>
Ney awarded the license to Foxcom on Nov. 26, 2002, Walsh said. He
declined to make public a copy of documents relating to the agreement,
noting that the Freedom of Information Act does not apply to Congress.
He noted that the work was paid for by the wireless companies and not
by Congress, and he pointed out that the Senate also chose Foxcom.
</P>
<P>
LGC had no right to appeal. ``This is not a traditional House
procurement and, thus, House procurement policies do not apply,'' Betz
stated in her letter to LGC.
</P>
<P>
Collins, the House engineer who has since retired, said, ``It
almost seemed like the cards were stacked for them.''
</P>
<P>
After the contract was awarded, Foxcom listed Abramoff as its
lobbyist. Over the next two years, Foxcom paid Abramoff's team
$280,000.
