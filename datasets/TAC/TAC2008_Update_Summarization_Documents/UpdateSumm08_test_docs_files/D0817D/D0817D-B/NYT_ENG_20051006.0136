INVESTIGATOR NAMED TO LOOK INTO DRUG CHARGE AGAINST ARMSTRONG
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The governing agency for professional cycling appointed an independent investigator Thursday
to look into accusations that the American cycling champion Lance
Armstrong had used banned drugs.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, 34, the seven-time winner of the Tour de France bicycle
race, retired from competitive cycling in July after his seventh
consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
The governing body, the International Cycling Union, said that Emile Vrijman
and his law firm, Lamsma Veldstra &amp; Lobe, based in
Rotterdam, the Netherlands, would investigate claims by the French newspaper
L'Equipe that six samples of Armstrong's frozen urine from the
1999 Tour de France had tested positive for the hormone
erythropoietin, or EPO, which aids a cyclist's endurance.
</P>
<P>
The urine samples had been saved, frozen and recently tested for
a research project. Even though the samples were anonymous, the
article said paperwork linked the coded samples to Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
The cycling union did not test for EPO until 2001.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who could not be reached for comment on Thursday, has
denied the charges, saying he is the victim of a
"witch hunt." But Dan Osipow, a spokesman for Armstrong's racing
team's sponsor, Discovery Channel, said: "We're pleased that the UCI
is forming this investigation unit to try to get to
the bottom of this case. If appointing this group helps,
we're for it."
</P>
<P>
After the article in L'Equipe appeared, Armstrong said he was considering
racing again, but later changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way I could go to France and get
a fair shake on the roads, in doping control or
in the labs," Armstrong told reporters last month from his
home in Austin, Texas. "There's no way I could go
back there. I would be crazy."
</P>
<P>
The cycling union appointed Vrijman on Sept. 30, but did not
disclose the information on its Web site until Thursday. Vrijman
is the former director of the National Anti-Doping Agency in
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"The UCI has entrusted Mr. Vrijman and his law firm the
task to undertake a comprehensive investigation regarding all issues concerning
the testing conducted by the French laboratory of urine samples
from the 1999 Tour de France," the cycling union said
in a statement on its Web site. "The UCI expects
all relevant parties to fully co-operate with the investigation."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, a cancer survivor, was on a 3,300-mile bicycle ride across
the United States on Thursday helping to raise money for
cancer research.
