<P>
The announcement Thursday that Syria was 
to conduct a final pullback of its troops to the eastern Bekaa 
valley of Lebanon falls short of the demands of the international 
community.
</P>
<P>
Following the killing of Lebanon's former prime minister Rafiq 
Hariri, Syria is under renewed pressure to abide by UN Security 
Council Resolution 1559 and end its political and military 
domination of its smaller neighbour.
</P>
<P>
Following are the main points of the resolution:
</P>
<P>
UN Resolution 1559, passed by the Security Council on September 
2, 2004, called for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon 
and respect for its sovereignty. A specific reference to Syria was 
deleted at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, originally proposed by France and the United 
States, said an upcoming elections should be "free and fair... 
according to Lebanese constitutional rules devised without foreign 
interference or influence." 
</P>
<P>
The council "reaffirms its call for the strict respect of 
Lebanon's sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political 
independence under the sole and exclusive authority of the 
government of Lebanon throughout Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution had been amended from its original version to 
ensure its passage. A demand "that Syrian forces withdraw without 
delay from Lebanon" was changed to a demand "that foreign forces 
withdraw without delay from Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
It called "for the disbanding and disarmament of all Lebanese 
and non-Lebanese militias," and "supports the extension of the 
control of the government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory."
</P>
<P>
The resolution was voted by nine of the 15 council members. The 
other six abstained. 
</P>
<P>
In a report published on October 3, UN Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan said: "The government of Syria has informed me that it cannot 
provide me with numbers and timetables for any future withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
"The requirements on the various parties set out in Resolution 
1559 have not been met."
</P>
<P>
Annan said both Beirut and Damascus had indicated that Syrian 
troops were on the ground "at the invitation of Lebanon and that 
their presence is therefore by mutual agreement."
