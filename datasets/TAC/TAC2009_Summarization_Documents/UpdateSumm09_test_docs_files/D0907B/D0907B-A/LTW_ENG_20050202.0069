The following commentaries and editorials are also listed on the
main newsfeature budget that moved Wednesday to the general advisory
category. The editor is Carlos Selva in Los Angeles at (213) 237-7832.

Category codes of stories are in parentheses.

CIA-FUTURE-COMMENT -- Will Porter Goss reform the CIA's clandestine
service? Though the media have focused on senior-level resignations
under the new director, Goss' hiring priorities are a better indicator
of whether meaningful change is arriving at Langley. So far, all signs
show that his CIA will be the CIA of his predecessor: bureaucratically
moribund at headquarters and operationally ineffectual in the field.
The wrong changes for the CIA. 900 words, by Reuel Marc Gerecht (Post
special) (k).

NATIONS-COMMENT -- President Truman understood from the start what
the Bush administration today seems unwilling to concede: that the
benefits of international cooperation are well worth the cost. 890
words, by Stephen Schlesinger (Times special) (k). Upcoming.

GENEVA-COMMENT -- To pretend that the Geneva Conventions apply to
al-Qaida, a non-state actor that targets civilians and disregards
other laws of war, denies the reality of dramatic changes in the
international system. 935 words, by Robert J. Delahunty and John C.
Yoo (Times special) (k). Upcoming.

LANGUAGE-COMMENT -- Otherwise intelligent people are shunning the
virtues of a straightforward sentence or an elegant construction, or
even just a grammatically comprehensible one. 670 words, by Lisa
Simeone (Sun special) (k). Upcoming.

SUPERBOWL-COMMENT -- Over a couple of hours in the dead of winter,
the Super Bowl offers us community in real time; amid challenges
around the globe and partisan hard-lining at home, we can still count
on the fact that George W. Bush and John Kerry will both be watching
the Super Bowl, participating in a unifying, uniquely American ritual.
490 words, by Mike Berland and Doug Shoen (Times special) (k).
Upcoming.

PINKERTON -- Tenuous first step toward a Republic. By James P.
Pinkerton (Newsday) (k). Upcoming.

SCHEER -- Now the United States must get out of Iraq's way. By
Robert Scheer (Times special) (k). Upcoming.

TIMES EDITORIAL, upcoming; POST EDITORIAL, moved (both k).
