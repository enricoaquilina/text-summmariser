Professor Defends His Work on Torture Memos
</HEADLINE>

BERKELEY, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Yoo doesn't come across like a war
criminal, though that's one of the more flamboyant charges leveled
against the smooth young law professor from the University of
California, Berkeley's storied Boalt Hall.
</P>
<P>
With his even tones and calm demeanor, his natty suits and warm
charm, the 37-year-old constitutional scholar is the embodiment of
``reasonable,'' not the first person you'd expect to find at the heart
of an international fight over terrorism, torture and the American
way.
</P>
<P>
But while working for the Department of Justice after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, Yoo helped write a series of legal memos redefining
torture and advising President Bush that the Geneva Convention does
not apply to members of al-Qaida and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., demanded from the Senate floor
last month that Yoo and other civilian officials be held accountable
for their part in what he called the ``torture scandal'' over
treatment of Iraqi detainees by American soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Legal scholar Scott Horton, president of the New York-based
International League for Human Rights, called last month for Yoo and
others to be investigated as war criminals for their part in drafting
the memos.
</P>
<P>
And in a lengthy analysis to be published in the Columbia Law
Review this fall, Jeremy Waldron, an author, scholar and Yoo's former
colleague at the UC Berkeley School of Law, said that the ``defense of
torture'' by Yoo and other prominent lawyers had caused ``dishonor for
our profession.''
</P>
<P>
A year after the abuses at Abu Ghraib came to light, nearly a year
after the torture memos were leaked, debate over how the U.S.
government should treat its prisoners shows no sign of abating.
</P>
<P>
``If you read the history of philosophy from the Greeks to the
present day, the question of when should we be willing to do something
terrible in pursuit of some social good is always posed,'' said Martha
Nussbaum, professor of philosophy and law at the University of
Chicago. ``It would surprise me very much that it would go away.''
</P>
<P>
But as Yoo defends the memos, a measured messenger for some of the
Bush administration's most controversial policies, he said he is
surprised that ``the issue has staying power.''
</P>
<P>
The memos about the Geneva Convention and torture are probably the
two most controversial documents Yoo worked on with a team of other
lawyers when he was a deputy assistant attorney general with the
Office of Legal Counsel from 2001 to 2003. The former bears Yoo's
name; the latter, that of then-Assistant Attorney General Jay S.
Bybee, who now sits on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
Some human rights advocates argue that the administration
commissioned the memos to provide legal cover for increasingly
coercive interrogation techniques used against suspected terrorists.
Yoo vehemently denies such accusations. The administration has
downplayed the memos' import and said that Bush never embraced the
views of the lawyers who wrote them.
</P>
<P>
At the Council on Foreign Relations and West Point, at Columbia Law
School and at his own leafy, liberal campus, Yoo argues that the world
as America knew it ended on Sept. 11, 2001, and that the rules of war
have changed because the enemy has changed.
</P>
<P>
``Al Qaeda as a non-state terror organization is not covered'' by
laws, such as the Geneva Convention, that are honored when the United
States fights a bona fide state, Yoo argued earlier this month during
a debate at Berkeley. Thus, ``our leaders have the option to decide
what system ought to apply.''
</P>
<P>
The debate was a two-on-one bruising in front of an audience that
politely applauded Yoo while cheering his detractors, an event in
which a law student dressed as an Iraqi torture victim greeted
spectators with a sign that read, ``War criminal John Yoo facilitated
torture: He belongs in a prison not a law school.''
</P>
<P>
But a funny thing happened near the end of the forum. Tom Farer,
dean of the Graduate School of International Studies at the University
of Denver, was deep into a verbal salvo when he exhausted his allotted
time but not his argument. Yoo gave up one of his own precious minutes
so that Farer could continue pummeling him.
</P>
<P>
``John cedes a minute,'' Farer said with a smile before launching
back into his attack. ``John is a mensch.''
</P>
<P>
Farer would find little argument, at least on that point. Yoo
inspires deep loyalty in friends, mute collegiality in many fellow
scholars (``You know, I'd really rather not talk about him'') and an
awkward mixture of kindness and dread in some of his most vocal
critics.
</P>
<P>
And although Boalt students circulated a petition last year
demanding that Yoo recant his positions or resign, he also has charmed
many of his liberal pupils with a ready classroom wit. Others have
been disappointed after signing up for one of his courses so they
could hear what a fire-breathing conservative actually sounds like
only to find a mild-mannered professor at the lectern, accessible and
friendly.
</P>
<P>
``A lot of the concern is that people think he's dead wrong,'' said
Ralph Steinhardt, professor of law and international affairs at George
Washington University. ``But you have to understand, from a personal
standpoint, he's a nice guy, has a good sense of humor, dresses nicely
and is as smart as the day is long.''

<P>
A Korean immigrant who came to this country with his parents when
he was 3 months old, Yoo has been a prolific writer of journalism and
scholarship since his undergraduate days on the Harvard Crimson. He is
a regular contributor to the opinion pages of major newspapers,
including the Los Angeles Times, New York Times and Wall Street
Journal.
</P>
<P>
Yoo began teaching constitutional and international law at UC
Berkeley in 1993. But he has spent many of the subsequent years
bouncing back and forth between academia and government. Shortly after
Yoo took the Berkeley job, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas
tapped him for a clerkship.
</P>
<P>
When his clerkship with Thomas ended, he headed to the U.S. Senate
Committee on the Judiciary, where he served as general counsel and
helped Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, with his speeches. Hatch describes
Yoo as ``a terrific human being.'' Yoo calls Hatch ``a genuine
softie.''
</P>
<P>
Yoo completed a public service trifecta -- working in all three
branches of government -- with a stint in the Office of Legal Counsel,
part of the Department of Justice overseen by then-Attorney General
John Ashcroft, before returning to Boalt Hall last year.
</P>
<P>
It was there in the uncertain months after Sept. 11 that Yoo worked
on the memos that transformed him from a rising star in conservative
legal circles to a lightning rod for international controversy.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Many legal scholars and human rights activists -- along with
Berkeley students -- draw a straight line linking the memos and
alleged prisoner abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan and at Guantanamo. Yoo
argues that they do not understand how government really works.
</P>
<P>
``It's a stretch to say that a very limited, tightly held memo
somehow translated into orders that soldiers on the ground violated
human rights,'' Yoo said. ``That's the difference between law and
policy.''
</P>
<P>
To his critics, such an argument is disingenuous, but Yoo continues
to defend the memos because he feels ``some sense of obligation to
explain to the public why government reached some of the conclusions
it did.''
</P>
<P>
``No one goes into government wanting to address these kinds of
questions,'' he said. ``But we were attacked on Sept. 11 with
devastating results. Our government has to think about these things in
order to protect the country.''
