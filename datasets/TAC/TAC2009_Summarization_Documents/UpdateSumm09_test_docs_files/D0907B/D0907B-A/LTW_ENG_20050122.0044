Debate Seeks to Define Torture

<P>
The question Democratic senators put to Condoleezza
Rice last week seemed easy enough to answer: Did the secretary of
State nominee consider interrogation practices such as
``water-boarding,'' in which a prisoner is made to believe he will
drown, to be torture?
</P>
<P>
She declined to answer.
</P>
<P>
``I'm not going to speak to any specific interrogation
techniques,'' Rice said, adding that it was up to the Justice
Department to define torture.
</P>
<P>
About the same time, senators on another committee were asking
nearly identical questions and receiving nearly identical answers from
Alberto R. Gonzales, President Bush's choice for attorney general.
</P>
<P>
The back-to-back confirmation flare-ups spotlight a problem the
Bush administration faces in its policies for detaining and
interrogating terrorism suspects.
</P>
<P>
In the months since the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, the
administration has insisted that America does not and will not use
torture. At the same time, the government has attempted to preserve
maximum leeway in the interrogation of terrorism suspects by not
drawing a clear line between where rough treatment ends and torture
begins.
</P>
<P>
``What the administration is saying is we're not going to torture
people,'' said John C. Yoo, a University of California, Berkeley law
professor who as a deputy assistant attorney general during Bush's
first term worked on torture policies.
</P>
<P>
``What the administration does not want to say, and I think for
good reasons too, is what methods the United States might or might not
use short of torture.''
</P>
<P>
Opponents say it is a moral, political and tactical mistake for the
United States to blur that line. They charge that the administration,
while condemning outright torture, deliberately has sought loopholes
in laws and treaties that would allow U.S. intelligence officers to
use extreme interrogation methods on terrorism suspects held abroad.
</P>
<P>
To protest the administration's Iraq and anti-terror policies --
and what they charged was the evasiveness of Rice and Gonzales under
questioning -- Democratic senators have delayed both confirmation
votes until later this week . As a result, the full Senate likely will
debate the definition of torture in a session that could embarrass the
administration and provide fodder for its international critics.
</P>
<P>
Ambiguity on prisoner treatment is causing discomfort among some of
the administration's allies. Current and former military officers in
particular fear it will result in the mistreatment of captured
American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
``We've dramatically undermined the war effort by getting on the
slippery slope in terms of playing cute with the law, because it's
come back to bite us,'' Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a former military
judge, told Gonzales during a hearing earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Graham said he was an ``ardent'' Iraq war supporter and agreed with
the controversial administration view that the Geneva Convention --
which bans not only torture but also cruel treatment -- should not
apply to terrorists. However, Graham said, ``Humane treatment is the
way to go, the only way we can win this war.''
</P>
<P>
Others say the Bush administration is right to preserve some
secrecy about its methods for interrogating prisoners, lest terrorists
learn how to thwart them.
</P>
<P>
``The only way we can stop future attacks by al-Qaida is by
learning from (captured suspects) what their plans are,'' Yoo said.
``It doesn't make sense to take options off the table at this time.''
</P>
<P>
Others have questioned the effectiveness of harsh interrogation
methods. The FBI has said that the aggressive techniques its agents
witnessed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and elsewhere were not effective in
producing usable information.
</P>
<P>
The United States has recovered al-Qaida training manuals that tell
members what to expect if captured and instruct how not to crack under
pressure -- just as the U.S. military trains its members on how to
withstand questioning if captured.
</P>
<P>
``The last thing you'd want to do is publicly disclose how you
interrogate people, because it would allow them to prepare their
people to resist interrogations,'' Yoo said.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales made the same argument in a written response to senators'
questions after he was faulted for dodging the question during his
oral testimony.
</P>
<P>
A web of laws and treaties governs how prisoners are dealt with at
home and abroad. The torture convention bans torture and ``cruel,
inhumane or degrading'' treatment. The U.S. military code bans cruel
treatment of prisoners, and CIA officials can be prosecuted for crimes
such as assault when they are abroad. The Constitution prohibits cruel
and unusual punishment within the United States.
</P>
<P>
Congress has defined torture as conduct intended to cause
``severe'' pain or suffering, according to the Justice Department,
which noted in its latest memo that ``there is no clear, objective,
consistent measurement'' of pain.
</P>
<P>
But legal experts differed last week over whether cruel treatment
that falls short of torture is prohibited in the case of foreigners
held abroad.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to clarify American standards on torture and
interrogation, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. -- who was tortured as a POW
in North Vietnam -- and Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., wrote an
unambiguous definition last fall: ``No prisoner shall be subject to
torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment that
is prohibited by the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
But the language, included in an intelligence bill, was dropped
after Rice wrote a letter saying it ``provides legal protections to
foreign prisoners to which they are not now entitled.''
</P>
<P>
Under fierce confirmation questioning from Sen. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., Rice offered a different justification for removing the
provision: She said it was unnecessary because similar language was
already included in a defense spending bill that the president had
signed.
</P>
<P>
But Boxer said that provision had eliminated a specific prohibition
on cruelty committed by intelligence officers, who have been
implicated in abuses in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Human Rights First, a New York-based group, said more than 30
detainees have died in U.S. custody in Iraq and Afghanistan, although
not all under the control of intelligence officers or as a result of
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
``Nobody condones or excuses what happened at Abu Ghraib,'' Rice
said. ``The problem of how to deal with unlawful combatants, though,
in a different kind of war, is frankly a very difficult problem.''
</P>
<P>
Rice appears to have had little input on U.S. torture policies.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, according to Kenneth Roth, executive director of the New
York-based Human Rights Watch, it was Rice who in 2003 pushed the
Pentagon's general counsel to reaffirm its ban not only on torture but
also on cruelty.
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Rice and Gonzales are expected to win Senate approval. But the
battle over what constitutes ``cruel, inhumane or degrading
treatment'' -- and whether it is ever allowed -- will continue.
