Nominee for Attorney General promises to abide by treaties on torture if confirmed attorney general

<P>
Attorney General nominee Alberto Gonzales is promising senators that he will
abide by treaties prohibiting the torture of prisoners, despite deriding the
restraints as relics in 2002.
</P>
<P>
White House counsel Gonzales, in line to become the first Hispanic attorney
general, had a hand in much of the White House's post-Sept. 11 terrorism
policies as President George W. Bush's top lawyer.
</P>
<P>
His confirmation hearing Thursday offered Democrats on the Senate Judiciary
Committee a fresh chance to criticize Gonzales and the advice he gave Bush.
Among the most contentious matters is a memo Gonzales wrote in January 2002 in
which he argued that the fight against terrorism "renders obsolete" the Geneva
Conventions' prohibitions against torture.
</P>
<P>
A month later, Bush signed an order declaring he had the authority to bypass the
accords "in this or future conflicts." Bush's order also said the Geneva
treaty's references to prisoners of war did not apply to al-Qaida or "unlawful
combatants" from the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Some of Gonzales' critics say that decision and his memo lead to the torture
scandal at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison and abuses of detainees in U.S. custody in
Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
In testimony prepared for his hearing, Gonzales said Bush has made clear that
the government will defend Americans from terrorists "in a manner consistent
with our nation's values and applicable law, including our treaty
obligations."
</P>
<P>
Gonzales added, "I pledge that, if I am confirmed as attorney general, I will
abide by those commitments," according to the testimony obtained Wednesday by
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Last June, the Justice Department withdrew its 2002 memos arguing that the
president's wartime authority supersedes laws and treaties governing treatment
of prisoners. On Wednesday, former Justice Department officials sought to
distance the White House from its legal conclusions.
</P>
<P>
John Yoo, who helped write the memos while at the department's Office of Legal
Counsel, said that while Gonzales was briefed on drafts, he and other officials
did not attempt to influence the content.
</P>
<P>
"The idea that the Office of Legal Counsel was providing advice that was
dictated, demanded or influenced by the White House, that's just flatly untrue,"
said Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales has repudiated torture before. "The president has stated that this
administration does not condone torture. If anyone engages in such conduct, he
or she will be held accountable," Gonzales said in a White House online event on
July 7.
</P>
<P>
Democrats, not satisfied with just those statements, planned to question
Gonzales extensively.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear he was in the chain receiving this critical documentation relative
to changing American standards on the treatment of prisoners, so he was not a
bystander, he was part of it," said Sen. Richard Durbin.
</P>
<P>
Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, said Bush firmly backs
Gonzales' nomination.
</P>
<P>
"Judge Gonzales is a very trusted adviser to the president (and is) doing an
outstanding job," McClellan told reporters traveling Wednesday with the
president aboard Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
Democrats are expecting Gonzales to be confirmed by the Republican-majority
Senate.
</P>
<P>
"I have found him someone I could work with when he wasn't simply pursuing an
agenda that was thrust upon him," said Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat from New
York.
</P>
<P>
Freshman Sen. Ken Salazar of Colorado, who is Hispanic, was expected to join
Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, in introducing Gonzales at the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
Civil rights and humanitarian groups have portrayed Gonzales as the person
responsible for abuses by Americans against terrorism suspects held as
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Gonzales bears much of the responsibility for creating the legal framework
and permissive atmosphere that led to the torture and abuse at Guantanamo and
elsewhere," said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales' memo from Jan. 25, 2002, argued that the terrorism fight "renders
obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and
renders quaint some of its provisions."
</P>
<P>
In his prepared Senate testimony, Gonzales was repeating the contention that
terrorists are not soldiers and thus are not covered by the conventions.
Nonetheless, according to his testimony, "We must be committed to preserving
civil rights and civil liberties."
</P>
<P>
Democrats wanted to ask Gonzales about other terrorism issues, including the
government's detention of Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen who the government
alleges was part of an al-Qaida plot to set off a radiological bomb. Arrested
after the 2001 attacks, Padilla later was designated an enemy combatant, brought
to the brig in South Carolina and prevented from challenging his detention. He
has sued over his detention.
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans say Democrats are just setting up arguments to use against
Gonzales in case Bush decides to elevate him to the Supreme Court, should a
vacancy occur.
