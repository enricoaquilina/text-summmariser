<HEADLINE>
ROLE IN TORTURE RULING WILL BE KEY ISSUE FOR GONZALES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alberto R. Gonzales, the White House counsel, intervened directly
with Justice Department lawyers in 2002 to obtain a legal
ruling on the extent of the president's authority to permit
extreme interrogation practices in the name of national security, current
and former administration officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales' role in seeking a legal opinion on the definition of
torture and the legal limits of how much force could
be used on terrorist suspects in captivity is expected to
be a central issue in the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation
hearings, which are scheduled to begin on Thursday on his
nomination to be attorney general.
</P>
<P>
The request by Gonzales produced the much-debated Aug. 1, 2002, memorandum
by the Justice Department that defined torture narrowly and said
that Bush could circumvent domestic and international prohibitions against torture
in the name of national security.
</P>
<P>
Until now, administration officials have been unwilling to provide details about
what role Gonzales had in the production of the memorandum
by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. He has
spoken of the memo as a response to questions, without
saying that most of them were his.
</P>
<P>
Current and former officials who talked about the memorandum have been
provided with first-hand accounts about how it was prepared. Some
discussed it in an attempt to clear up what they
viewed as a murky record in advance of Gonzales' confirmation
hearing. Others spoke of the matter apparently believing that the
Justice Department had unfairly taken the blame for the memo.
</P>
<P>
A White House spokeswoman, Erin Healy, said Tuesday that while Gonzales
personally requested the August opinion, he was only seeking "objective
legal advice and did not ask the Office of Legal
Counsel to reach any specific conclusion."
</P>
<P>
As the White House's chief lawyer, Gonzales supervised the production of
a raft of legal memorandums that shaped the administration's legal
framework for conducting its battle against al-Qaida and other terrorist
groups. Of the documents that have been made public, Gonzales
is the author of only one. In that January 2002
memorandum he advised Bush that the Geneva Conventions did not
apply to fighters captured in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a major area of questioning at his confirmation
hearing is expected to be the role he played in
the production of the other documents, like the August 2002
memorandum. The memo concluded that interrogators had great leeway to
question detainees using coercive techniques that they could assert were
not torture.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department last week formally rescinded that memorandum and in
its place issued a legal opinion saying that torture should
be more broadly defined and that there was no need
to say Bush had the authority to sanction torture because
he has unequivocally said that it is not permitted.
</P>
<P>
The revision stated that "Torture is abhorrent both to American law
and values and international norms." It rejected the language in
the earlier memo that said only "organ failure, impairment of
bodily function or even death" constituted torture punishable by law.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said over the last few days that Gonzales had
played a role in the decision to issue the new
legal opinion as well, but they did not offer specifics.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales' request for the original August 2002 memorandum was somewhat unusual,
the officials said, because he went directly to lawyers at
the Office of Legal Counsel, bypassing the deputy attorney general's
office, which is often notified of sensitive requests for legal
opinions made by executive branch agencies, including the White House.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum has become one of the most hotly debated legal
documents in the war on terror. Democrats and human rights
groups have complained that it created a permissive atmosphere that
led eventually to serious abuses of detainees in Iraq, Afghanistan
and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The memorandum was addressed to Gonzales
and was signed by Jay S. Bybee, then the head
of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
Officials dispute how much senior Justice Department officials knew of the
memorandum as it was being prepared. A former and a
current official said that neither Attorney General John Ashcroft nor
his deputy, Larry D. Thompson, were aware of the memorandum
until it was about to be submitted to the White
House. Another former official said, however, that they were given
progress reports as the memorandum took shape.
</P>
<P>
John Yoo, a senior Justice Department lawyer who wrote much of
the memorandum, exchanged draft language with lawyers at the White
House, the officials said. Yoo, now a law professor at
the University of California at Berkeley, said in an article
published Sunday in the San Jose Mercury News that Gonzales
did not apply any pressure on him to tailor the
memorandum to accommodate the White House.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Yoo said that Gonzales was merely seeking to "understand all
available options" in a perilous time when the United States
faced unprecedented threats.
</P>
<P>
But a senior administration official disagreed, saying that the memorandum's conclusions
appeared to align closely with the prevailing White House view
of interrogation practices. These officials said the memo raised questions
about whether the Office of Legal Counsel had maintained its
longstanding tradition of dispensing objective legal advice to its clients
in executive branch agencies.
</P>
<P>
While the nature of Gonzales' specific discussions with the Justice Department
remains unclear, administration officials said that Gonzales' customary way of
dealing with Justice Department lawyers was to pose questions about
issues rather than offer his own conclusions, although one said
his preferences could sometimes be easily inferred from his questions.
</P>
<P>
.......................... Department officials said that the timing of the revised memorandum,
which was posted on the Justice Department's Internet site without
announcement late on Dec. 30, was the result of instructions
from James B. Comey, the deputy attorney general.
</P>
<P>
Comey, the officials said, told lawyers to complete the revised opinion
before the end of the year. At the same time,
officials said that they were mindful that issuance of the
new opinion might help neutralize the issue for Gonzales even
as it served as a sharp critique of the earlier
opinion.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Gonzales talked about the 2002 memo in a meeting with reporters
last June, when the White House sought to defend its
actions at the height of the uproar over abuses of
prisoners in Iraq. Without discussing his own role in soliciting
the document, Gonzales said that the memo was not a
policy directive to officials in the field, but a response
to questions about the scope of the federal law prohibiting
torture and the international convention on torture.
</P>
<P>
"The president has given no order or directive that would immunize
from prosecution anyone engaged in conduct that constitutes torture," Gonzales
said. "All interrogation techniques actually authorized have been carefully vetted,
are lawful, and do not constitute torture."
</P>
<P>
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, who has signaled he intends to vigorously question Gonzales
about his role in the memorandums, said Tuesday that he
has been continually frustrated by the White House in trying
to obtain answers and documents.
</P>
<P>
In a letter Tuesday to Gonzales, Leahy said that "I am
disappointed that, contrary to your promises to me to engage
in an open exchange and answer my questions in connection
with your confirmation process, you have not answered my letters"
requesting documents.
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who is the new chairman of
the committee, said that Leahy's complaints appeared unjustified. He said
that one document was for a final version of a
Jan. 25, 2002, memorandum because the one available is marked
"draft." He said that there is no evidence that there
is any document but the draft.
</P>
<P>
Other requests from Leahy, he said, were for documents that did
not directly bear on Gonzales' actions or views.
</P>
<P>
The Jan. 25, 2002 memorandum is an unsigned draft from Gonzales
to Bush dated Jan. 25, 2002. In it, Gonzales, wrote
that the fight against terrorism had made the Geneva Conventions
"obsolete." In addition, he said the conventions' prisoner-of-war protections need
not apply to al-Qaida suspects and Taliban members captured in
Afghanistan.
