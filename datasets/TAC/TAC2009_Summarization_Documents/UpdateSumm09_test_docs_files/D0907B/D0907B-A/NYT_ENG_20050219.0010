EDITORIAL: TIME FOR AN ACCOUNTING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb.
19:
</P>
<P>
Of all the claims of an electoral mandate made by President
Bush's supporters, none were as bizarre as the one offered
by John Yoo, a former Justice Department lawyer who helped
draft the cynical justifications for the illegal detention and torture
of "unlawful combatants." "The debate is over," Yoo told The
New Yorker, adding: "The issue is dying out. The public
has had its referendum."
</P>
<P>
It's hard to know what is most outrageous about those comments
-- that Yoo actually believes Americans voted for torturing prisoners
or that an official who was at the heart of
this appalling mess feels secure enough to say that. Certainly
the worst possibility is that the public has, indeed, lost
interest.
</P>
<P>
The White House has done everything it can to bury the
issue. Nearly a year after the Abu Ghraib scandal broke,
the administration still drags its feet on public disclosure, stonewalls
congressional requests for documents and suppresses the results of internal
investigations.
</P>
<P>
But the issue is as urgent as ever. Hundreds of men
remain imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, years after any information they
had might have been useful and in defiance of two
Supreme Court decisions. American soldiers hold thousands of Afghan and
Iraqi prisoners under rules that remain murky, to put it
charitably.
</P>
<P>
American intelligence is still secretly detaining prisoners -- a practice that
has become embarrassing enough for the Central Intelligence Agency to
fret publicly about it. And the administration continues to insist
that the president has an imperial right to sweep aside
the law and authorize whatever he wants. That includes flouting
treaties that prohibit sending prisoners to other countries to be
tortured. That abhorrent practice has become more common since 9/11
and is reported to include sending prisoners to Syria, a
repressive nation counted by Washington as a state sponsor of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress from both parties are proposing new laws on
interrogations. Their intentions are honorable, and new legislation may be
needed. But drafts of these measures risk endorsing some terrible
practices, as well as the idea that the president can
declare himself above the law. Anyway, it's too soon for
new laws; we still don't know what happened and who
approved it.
</P>
<P>
But that task is now way beyond the purview of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, which held important hearings on prisoner
abuse. Republican congressional leaders have made it painfully clear that
they will not hold a real investigation. And no probe
by the executive branch can be credible because the stain
of prisoner abuse spreads so far. The Justice Department can't
do it; Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was part of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
We strongly agree with the American Bar Association, which wrote to
President Bush on Feb. 1 to urge the appointment of
an independent, bipartisan commission with subpoena power. The bar association
talked about Iraqi civilians in military custody, but we believe
that a panel should look at all detention centers and
all government agencies.
</P>
<P>
Only a full accounting can begin to heal the nation's image
in the world, clarify the rules, punish those responsible, and
clear the names of the hundreds of thousands of other
uniformed Americans who risk their lives to preserve human dignity
and the rule of law.
