The following commentaries and editorials are also listed on the
main newsfeature budget that moved Thursday to the general advisory
category. The editor is Carlos Selva in Los Angeles at (213) 237-7832.

Category codes of stories are in parentheses.

SOCIAL-COMMENT -- WASHINGTON -- Having tossed America's future
seniors 100 feet overboard, the administration then proposes to toss
them a 50-foot rope: They can invest a portion of their incomes in the
stock market. 835 words, by Harold Meyerson (Post special) (k).

QUAKE-COMMENT -- All the evidence from paleoclimatology and geology
suggests that over the long haul, the climate extremes we face will be
substantially greater than even the strongest in our brief historical
record. There are several measures we should we take to reduce loss of
life and suffering, mitigate economic disruption and protect the
environment and ecosystems in the face of extreme events. 1,430 words,
by William H. Hooke (Post special) (k).

QUAKE-FAITH-COMMENT -- It is the question of questions for
religious belief. Why does God permit a tragedy such as the Indian
Ocean tsunami? Why does he allow the innocent to suffer and the
guiltless to die? 960 words, by Jonathan Sacks (Times special) (k).
Upcoming.

TRIBUNALS-COMMENT -- President Bush's proclamation that suspected
al-Qaida members would be subject to trial by military commission, and
the reaction to it, proves remarkably similar to the arguments that
played out in 1862, when Union forces began convening similar
tribunals to deal with Confederate partisans during the Civil War. 890
words, by Michael W. Kauffman (Sun special) (k). Upcoming.

THOMAS-COMMENT -- Although Clarence Thomas is being mentioned as a
candidate for chief justice, he might be better served by not reaching
that post; serving as an associate justice gives him more freedom to
write opinions. 1,010 words, by John C. Yoo (Times special) (k).
Upcoming.

MORRISON -- You can say this about the position of poet laureate of
California: the pay is lousy, but there's a title. 900 words, by Patt
Morrison (Times) (k). Upcoming.

TIMES EDITORIAL, upcoming; POST EDITORIAL, moved (both k).
