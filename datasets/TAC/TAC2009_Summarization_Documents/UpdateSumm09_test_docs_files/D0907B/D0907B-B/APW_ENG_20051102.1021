U.S. Supreme Court nominee Alito is active in low-profile conservative law society

WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federalist Society has brought together many of Washington's top
conservative thinkers over the last few decades, but Supreme Court nominee
Samuel Alito has been more open than some of his peers about his involvement
with the low-profile legal group.
</P>
<P>
Alito has been a member for at least 15 years and has spoken before both the
national organization and its student chapters on a number of
occasions.
</P>
<P>
That's a welcome change for the group after the last two Supreme Court
nominations.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court Chief John Roberts, the new chief justice, is well-liked by
Federalist Society members but belatedly denied he'd ever been a member of the
organization after he was nominated to the high court, even though he once was
listed in its leadership directory.
</P>
<P>
Harriet Miers, who withdrew her nomination to the court, once testified that she
"wouldn't belong to the Federalist Society" or other "politically charged"
groups that "seem to color your view one way or another."
</P>
<P>
As she tried to salvage her nomination, Miers quickly put out word that she
regarded the Federalist Society as an important White House ally, but the damage
already had been done. Her deprecating remarks from 1989 had further angered
some conservatives already upset about her nomination.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame law professor Rick Garnett, a member of the Federalist Society,
complained recently that the organization doesn't always get the recognition
from the right that it deserves for supplying "in no small part, the
intellectual heft for a large part of today's conservative movement in
politics."
</P>
<P>
"Too often, this administration, present nominees, and even Federalist Society
members nominated for important government positions have treated the society as
if it were something out of 'The DaVinci Code,' or the ultra-secret gaggle of
powerful reactionary Rasputins that some on the left imagine, or just a goofy
band of train-spotters," he wrote in a blog posting.
</P>
<P>
The society, founded in 1982 as a forum for conservative and libertarian lawyers
to exchange ideas and network, keeps its roster private. But Alito been open
about his membership in the group.
</P>
<P>
As a federal appeals court judge, Alito's participation in the society has been
limited to avoid any suggestion of bias on issues that could come before his
court. He moderated a panel discussion about the anti-terrorism laws that make
up the Patriot Act at the society's November 2004 national conference,
introduced a debate on the independent counsel law at the 1989 national
conference, and has addressed the society on other occasions. An article he
wrote on the role of the lawyer in the criminal justice system, based on a
speech he made at the 1997 convention, was published in one of the society's
newsletters.
</P>
<P>
Even with all of that involvement, though, there are no open congratulations
coming from the society's leadership about Alito's nomination to the high
court.
</P>
<P>
"We really don't comment on things in that type of way," said society President
Eugene A Meyer.
</P>
<P>
Leonard Leo, the society's executive vice president, took a leave of absence to
help push through Bush's Supreme Court nominees but Meyer said Leo is back at
work now coordinating the society's next national conference, which begins next
week. Leo made no public comment on Alito's nomination but helped lead a
conference call Monday with conservative groups and legal experts, and will
continue to work for the nomination on his own time.
</P>
<P>
The quiet reaction of the society's leadership notwithstanding, Alito's
Federalist Society membership is seen as "an important signal to conservatives
in the legal community," said John Yoo, a law professor at the University of
California, Berkeley, who worked in the Bush Justice Department during
2001-03.
</P>
<P>
"It shows an interest in thinking deeply about the role of the courts in society
and the proper interpretation of the Constitution based on its text and
history," said Yoo, himself a member of the Federalist Society since his college
days.
</P>
<P>
Yoo said the administration has been sensitive about the society's influence
ever since receiving criticism early on from liberals unhappy with the Bush team
for drawing heavily from the society's ranks for top government jobs and
judicial nominations.
</P>
<P>
Duke law professor Erwin Chemerinsky, a liberal who has spoken at Federalist
Society events, said membership is one more way of letting conservatives know
that Alito is "one of them," although it shouldn't be a basis for questions at
his Senate confirmation hearing.
</P>
<P>
But Ralph Neas, president of the liberal People for the American Way, disagreed,
saying Alito's membership in the society is fair game for the
hearings.
</P>
<P>
"Of course membership in or participation in Federalist Society events doesn't
disqualify someone from office but it can help people understand the judicial
philosophy of the nominee," Neas said. "The Federalist Society likes to pretend
it's just a debating club, but for last 20 years it has been at the forefront of
the efforts to push a right-wing counterrevolution in the courts and undo
decades worth of precedent."
