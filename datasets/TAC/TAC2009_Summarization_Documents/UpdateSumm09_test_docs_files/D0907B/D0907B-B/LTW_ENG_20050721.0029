The following commentaries and editorials are also listed on the
main newsfeature budget that moved Thursday to the general advisory
category. The editor is Carlos Selva in Los Angeles at (213) 237-7832.

Category codes of stories are in parentheses.

SCOTUS-COMMENT -- Whether you want to ban abortion or keep it
legal, whether you want greater federal power or less federal power,
don't bother so much about the Supreme Court; the people you really
need to convince aren't wearing black robes up in Washington, they're
all around you. 805 words, by Rosa Brooks (Times special) (k).
Upcoming.

SCOTUS-ROBERTS-COMMENT -- WASHINGTON -- Perhaps Republicans and
Democrats can agree not only on nominee John G. Roberts the person,
but also on what he represents -- a judge who will bring a measure of
judicial restraint to the Supreme Court that allows our elected
representatives, and not the courts, to make policy on our most
important social issues. 1,035 words, by John Yoo (Post special) (k).

CHINA-COMMENT -- We shouldn't get overly fixated on such
traditional indices of military power as ships and bombs -- not even
atomic bombs; Chinese strategists, in the best tradition of Sun Tzu,
are working on craftier schemes to topple the American hegemon. 735
words, by Max Boot (Times special) (k). Upcoming.

FAMILY-COMMENT -- Whether it is a matter of underfunded pensions or
outsourcing of jobs, more CEOs and policymakers need to view these
issues through a family lens with one guiding question always in mind:
Does this corporate action strengthen or erode the stability of the
family? 740 words, by Steven K. Wisensale (Sun special) (k).

MARTINEZ -- One small dial-up for man. By Andres Martinez (Times)
(k). Upcoming.

There is no Patt MORRISON (Times) column today.

TIMES EDITORIAL, upcoming; POST EDITORIAL, moved (both k).
