Category codes of stories are in parentheses.

TERROR-COMMENT -- In order to prevail against terrorism, we must
develop an offensive strategy that focuses less on controlling
territory or cities and more on new ways to disrupt and destroy
networks, for that is what al-Qaida represents. 800 words, by John Yoo
(Times special)(k). Upcoming.

COURT-COMMENT -- If Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist resigns,
newspapers and talking heads will need to provide instant advice to
President Bush and the Senate on exactly what to do to fill the
vacancy; here's an all-purpose template for the occasion. 550 words,
by Orin S. Kerr (Times special) (k). Upcoming.

COURT-MYTHS-COMMENT -- The intense interest in who President Bush
will nominate to replace Sandra Day O'Connor reflects the reality that
many of the nation's most divisive issues -- abortion rights,
separation of church and state, affirmative action, gay rights -- are
ones in which the Supreme Court has the last word; so we must be sure
to question the nominees closely. 735 words, by Erwin Chemerinsky
(Times special) (k). Upcoming.

HISPANIC-COMMENT -- WASHINGTON -- Politicians are preparing for a
rise in the political clout of the surging U.S. Hispanic population,
but the numbers may not translate into votes due to low registration
rates, lack of citizenship and the fact that many U.S.-born Hispanics
will not be old enough to vote for some time. 1,670 words, by Roberto
Suro (Post special) (k).

DARFUR-COMMENT -- What responsibility do Arabs have to stop
genocide being committed by Arabs? Genocide in Darfur, Sudan,
inflicted on mostly Muslim African tribespeople by nomadic Arab
militias, has prompted peacekeeping troops and many millions in aid
from nations in western and central Africa and various Western
countries. Preventing genocide by Arabs in Darfur is a task for the
civilized world, one in which the Arab countries need to join. 760
words, by Joseph Britt (Post special) (k).

COLUMNISTS-COMMENT -- The reason for the dearth of women columnists
is a function of gender (we're just not that conservative) and timid
editors. 785 words, by Rosa Brooks (Times special) (k). Upcoming.

There are no Andres MARTINEZ (Times) and Patt MORRISON (Times)
columns today.

TIMES EDITORIAL, upcoming; POST EDITORIAL, moved (both k).
