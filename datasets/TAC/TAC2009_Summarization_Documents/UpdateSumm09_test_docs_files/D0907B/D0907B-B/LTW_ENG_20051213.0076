Lawyer Defends Administration's Treatment of Detainees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To his shrillest student critics, University of California,
Berkeley, law professor John Yoo -- a mild-mannered, baby-faced
academic who gravitates toward the driest of legal treatises and the
sharpest of suits -- incarnates the banality of evil. Yoo has been
accused of being a war criminal. Cursed out in public. Warned by
Berkeley police, last spring, that it might not be safe to appear on a
law school panel.
</P>
<P>
``That was pretty wild,'' said Yoo, the author of a new book, ``The
Powers of War and Peace.'' ``That was the most out-of-control thing
that ever happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
As Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice attempts to lessen anger in
Europe over reports that the CIA has operated secret prisons in
European countries, it might not be the best time for Yoo to argue his
contention that the Bush administration has the right to hold ``enemy
combatants'' indefinitely without charges, and question them without a
lawyer present, in wartime. Although even Rice seemed to reverse her
administration's contention that the prohibition on cruel or inhumane
prisoner interrogations didn't apply overseas, Yoo is still ardently
opposed to such a ban, saying it could cripple the effectiveness of
coercive interrogations abroad.
</P>
<P>
And even some of Yoo's fellow conservative intellectuals are
disturbed by his contention that President Bush has the constitutional
power to unilaterally start a war. Yoo has been in perpetual hot water
since the revelation that he helped draft a controversial memo in 2002
-- he was a deputy assistant U.S. attorney general at the time -- that
narrowly defined torture as suffering ``equivalent in intensity to the
pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure,
impairment of bodily function, or even death.''
</P>
<P>
But if being a flak-catcher for the Bush administration's
most-criticized wartime practices has unnerved Yoo, it's not apparent
when he touts his new book, which was released this fall. If he ends
up with more critics than readers, so be it.
</P>
<P>
Yoo does not employ the usual rationale for a strong Bush
presidency. He says in his book that it is not the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks that justify the extraordinary presidential powers he
advocates. In Yoo's view, the constitution itself gives the president
lots of leeway, allowing him to invade Iraq without congressional
permission and to disregard such treaties as the Geneva Convention,
which governs the moral code of conduct of war.
</P>
<P>
``I'm pretty sure that's an argument no one has ever made before,''
Yoo, 38, said recently with evident pride. Most people, he said, ``say
the world's too dangerous and the Constitution's obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
Michael Glennon, a professor of international law at Tufts
University, believes that Yoo ``sees the president essentially as an
elected king.''
</P>
<P>
``It strains the imagination to believe that those who wrote our
Constitution could so quickly forget the danger that flows from
unlimited power,'' Glennon said. ``If the framers truly intended to
create a Sun King, why did they explicitly assign so many powers to
the Congress?''
</P>
<P>
To answer this question, Yoo relies partly on the dictionary.
Although the Constitution gives Congress the exclusive power to
``declare'' war, that wording doesn't mean the president needs to
consult Congress to ``make war'' or ``commence war,'' Yoo's book says.
</P>
<P>
Yoo's critics say this relegates Congress to the role of an
ambassador making a courtesy call: Excuse me, in case you hadn't
noticed, we're bombing you to smithereens.
</P>
<P>
``I like John Yoo, but I disagree with many of the things he says
about the inherent powers of the president,'' said Abraham Sofaer, a
legal adviser to the State Department under the Reagan administration,
who has argued for years for a more aggressive approach against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
``What Yoo seems to be saying is that the president has this whole
set of powers in matters of defense that Congress cannot override,''
said Sofaer, now a senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution. ``I
don't believe there are any powers that the president has that
Congress cannot override.''
</P>
<P>
What most concerns him, Sofaer said, are Yoo's views on the
treatment of detainees.
</P>
<P>
``The torture convention is written specifically for people who
think their emergency is different than any other emergency in human
history,'' Sofaer said. ``You can't just say that because you happen
to be governing the United States during an attack unprecedented since
Pearl Harbor, that all the conventions governing the rules of war go
out the window.''
</P>
<P>
As criticism grows, some of Yoo's positions seem to be getting
lonelier.
</P>
<P>
Yoo opposed the amendment by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that would
ban ``cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.'' The Senate passed the
amendment 90-9, with the backing of, among others, former CIA Director
Stansfield Turner and former CIA Counterterrorism Center Director
Vincent Cannistraro.
</P>
<P>
That doesn't dissuade Yoo. ``In the war against al-Qaida, the
Geneva Convention doesn't apply,'' Yoo explained in November on
C-SPAN. ``Al-Qaida is not a nation. Under the McCain amendment, all we
could do is question people. ... The real effect of the McCain
amendment would be to shut down coercive interrogation.''
</P>
<P>
To Yoo, it is crystal clear who gets to decide the difference
between coercive interrogation and torture abroad.
</P>
<P>
``Outside the United States it would be the president,'' Yoo said.
``If the president thinks that because of an extraordinary need to
protect the country, he needs to order an interrogation, he needs to
be able to do that.
</P>
<P>
''There's torture, and then there's cruel, inhumane and degrading
treatment -- conduct below torture. It's a broad term. I think (the
McCain bill) would prevent anything beyond oral questioning.``
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Yoo's views on presidential powers stand out -- and not just in
ultra-liberal Northern California. He believes, for example, that Bush
has the final say on treaties.
</P>
<P>
''It's up to the president to decide how to interpret international
law and apply it,`` Yoo said, speaking on his cell phone from a
bustling Starbucks in San Francisco. ''President Bush has the sole
power to decide whether to pull the United States out of treaties,
break treaties, terminate treaties.``
</P>
<P>
Or that the real check and balance held by Congress in wartime is
budgetary.
</P>
<P>
''That's the primary check,`` Yoo said. ''If (Sen. John) Kerry
wanted to stop the war, all he had to do was convince his colleagues
to not pay for it.``
</P>
<P>
(End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
As a conversationalist, Yoo is impeccably courteous,
dispassionately affable, unfailingly polite. His prose too is
measured. Even bland.
</P>
<P>
Which is precisely what inflames his critics.
</P>
<P>
''This hyper-technical legal analyses detached from underlying
moral and pragmatic considerations ... is a consequence of the law of
war becoming `overlawyered,' wrote retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Geoffrey
S. Corn, the former special assistant to the judge advocate general
for law of war matters, in a guest column for Jurist, the online legal
news service of the University of Pittsburg School of Law.
</P>
<P>
``Unlike his chief antagonist, Senator John McCain, Yoo has never
worn a uniform,'' wrote Corn, now a professor at South Texas College
of Law.
</P>
<P>
Yoo does have his fans, to be sure. Conservative legal scholar
Robert H. Bork called the book a ``brilliant and path-breaking
analysis.'' Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit -- Yoo served as a clerk for him and
for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas -- called it
``comprehensive,'' ``thoughtful,'' ``provocative.''
</P>
<P>
Even some who ardently disagree with him praise his personal
qualities. Tuft's Glennon considers Yoo a friend.
</P>
<P>
``He's a very gentle soul. He's a teddy bear,'' Glennon said.
``He's extremely courteous in dealing with intellectual adversaries.
He's a creative and original scholar.''
</P>
<P>
However, he added, ``I think his book is just 180 degrees off the
mark.''
