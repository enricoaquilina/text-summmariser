IS U.S. UP TO TASK OF PREVENTING ATTACKS ON HOMELAND?

<TEXT>
<P>
As the nation approaches the fourth anniversary of the
9/11 terrorist attacks, there is fresh unease about the government's
ability to prevent another strike on American soil.
</P>
<P>
The recent bombings in London and Egypt, yet another overhaul of
the federal Homeland Security Department and nervousness about the Iraq
war are prompting fresh debate about whether the country is
making sufficient progress against the terrorist threat.
</P>
<P>
"The key questions are: Are we as safe as we need
to be? Are we as safe as we can be?
And are we as safe as we think we are?"
said Clark Ervin, former inspector general for the Department of
Homeland Security. "The answer to all of these questions, sadly,
is no."
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show the public's expectation of a domestic attack is
rising, with nearly half telling the Gallup Poll they fear
that they or someone in their family will become a
terrorism victim. Also growing are the numbers of Americans who
believe the Iraq war has made the United States less
safe from the terrorism threat. Meanwhile, only 34 percent think
the United States is winning the terror war, a July
Gallup Poll showed.
</P>
<P>
The angst spilled over in Congress recently, when Rep. Norm Dicks,
D-Wash., complained about inaction by the Homeland Security Department in
assessing the threat of a nuclear bomb's detonation in a
major American city.
</P>
<P>
"There is a great deal of anxiety on the Hill and
in the country about how well the Department of Homeland
Security is doing," Dicks told the department's new chief, Michael
Chertoff. "You have got to show the country that there
is a leader now in charge of homeland security. ...
We have got to deal with the major threats ...
the use of a nuclear device, for example."
</P>
<P>
Chertoff defended his early stewardship of homeland security efforts, and in
fact endorsed Dicks' general point, saying the United States must
devote the vast majority of its prevention resources to stopping
catastrophic attacks.
</P>
<P>
To the dismay of big-city officials who want more money spent
on mass transit security, Chertoff has been using his honeymoon
period as homeland security chief to argue that the country
can't afford to waste precious dollars trying to stop subway
bombings.
</P>
<P>
"A fully loaded airplane with jet fuel, a commercial airliner, has
the capacity to kill 3,000 people. A bomb in a
subway car may kill 30 people," Chertoff told the Associated
Press. "When you start to think about your priorities, you're
going to think about making sure you don't have a
catastrophic thing first."
</P>
<P>
Although Chertoff is winning some plaudits for his focus on risk
assessment, critics say the country's overall homeland security remains far
too weak, rife with wasteful spending and unprepared to meet
the challenges of another attack.
</P>
<P>
"America does not have a culture of preparedness," said Jay Carafano,
a security expert at the Heritage Foundation who in a
recent analysis suggested homeland security officials have been manufacturing "symbolic
programs that create the illusion of caring."
</P>
<P>
Government officials say it should not be surprising that it would
take some time for the massive homeland security bureaucracy --
now just two-and-a-half years old -- to get its arms
around the monumental challenge of protecting such a sprawling country
from attack. The Department of Homeland Security, authorized by Congress
in November 2002, is a compilation of 22 separate federal
agencies employing 180,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"It took several decades of organizational and legislative tweaking to revitalize
the ... Department of Defense," said Tom Ridge, the department's
inaugural director and former secretary. Ramping up a national anti-terrorism
effort is necessarily an evolutionary process, Ridge said, because Americans
are slowly coming to grips with the reality of a
newly unsafe world.
</P>
<P>
Ridge and other officials involved in the terrorism fight also contend
they've made major progress. "We are, I will say, far
safer than we were before September 11th," FBI Director Robert
Mueller said last week. (7/27/05)
</P>
<P>
But critics say that, given the potential consequences of a catastrophic
attack, federal officials have not moved smartly enough, or quickly
enough. At the congressional hearing where he lectured Chertoff, Dicks
noted that a nuclear bomb could kill 1 million people
in New York or Washington.
</P>
<P>
This and multiple other hearings in Congress this summer have highlighted
the enormity of the challenge facing homeland security officials, and
the difficulty of choosing among vastly different prevention strategies.
</P>
<P>
Chertoff is attempting to give the Homeland Security Department a harder-nosed
edge by adopting the "risk-assessment" model for determining what merits
taxpayer dollars and what doesn't. He stuck with that line
even in the aftermath of the London subway bombings, angering
big-city politicians who wanted to add millions to mass-transit security.
</P>
<P>
With some reluctance, Congress is also shifting to the risk-assessment standard.
Members of Congress have come under harsh criticism for handing
out millions in homeland security grants to states like Wyoming
and South Dakota -- places that are deemed low security
risks. But for the second straight year they are reducing
the proportion of money going to largely rural states while
beefing up funds for big cities.
</P>
<P>
Even then, however, there are widespread debates over what constitutes the
best use of homeland security money. Should aviation security continue
to be the No. 1 priority? Should more go into
border controls? Is technology the answer?
</P>
<P>
Veronique de Rugy, a critic of homeland security spending from her
perch at the American Enterprise Institute, says federal officials are
right to focus on detecting a nuclear bomb that might
enter the country through one of its ports. But she
says the deployment of 470 radiation portal monitors is a
good example of how the government may be wasting enormous
sums of money.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear security experts don't believe the monitors can detect, with any
reliability, the highly enriched uranium that is at the heart
of a nuclear device, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Have we really spent $800 million for nothing?" she wrote for
the website Tech Central Station. "Possibly."
</P>
<P>
Some say that, given the difficulty of building reliable defenses against
terrorism, the government ought to spend far more on intelligence
aimed at foiling plots before they unfold.
</P>
<P>
According to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, only 8
percent of federal homeland security dollars are devoted to intelligence
and counterterrorism this year. By comparison, 37 percent of the
funds are being spent on border and transportation security operations;
31 percent on protecting critical infrastructure; and 17 percent for
emergency preparedness.
</P>
<P>
Michael O'Hanlon, a security expert at the Brookings Institutions in Washington,
says much more needs to go toward counterterrorism, particularly in
the 25 to 35 largest American cities.
</P>
<P>
O'Hanlon recently recommended that Congress pay for 10,000 additional police in
those cities who, working jointly with the FBI, would be
the eyes and ears that might uncover domestic terrorist cells.
</P>
<P>
"Too many localities, even major ones, assume that they will not
be targets in the future simply because they have not
been the sites of successful attacks in the past," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., offered similar advice last week.
</P>
<P>
"It's more likely to be some local cop coming from the
Dunkin' Donut shop, going behind a super mall ... that
detects a guy climbing out of a dumpster who just
put sarin gas in the ventilation system," said Biden.
</P>
<P>
Others advocate a far more aggressive national strategy that relies on
face-to-face confrontation of terrorists.
</P>
<P>
John Yoo, a deputy assistant attorney general during Bush's first term,
says the United States must become more ruthless and cunning
to counteract the resiliency of the al-Qaeda terrorist network. For
example, he says the United States should carry out simultaneous
assassinations of key al-Qaeda leaders.
</P>
<P>
He also suggests setting up false terrorist organizations that would carry
out fake attacks, issue phony claims of credit for real
attacks, and compete for recruits with al-Qaeda -- all in
an effort to "sow confusion within al-Qaeda's ranks."
</P>
<P>
Yoo acknowledged that setting up bogus websites, issuing fake public statements
and using taxpayer funds for these purposes might run afoul
of existing laws. But Yoo, a staunch Bush supporter, said
the president's current strategies may not be sufficient to protect
American soil.
</P>
<P>
"Al-Qaeda has suffered devastating losses at the hands of the CIA
and the U.S. armed forces," he said in a speech
last month. "But it has not suffered a knockout blow
and may even be recovering."
