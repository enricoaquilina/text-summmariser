JUDGING JOHN ROBERTS: THE BRIEFCASE CARRIES BRIEFS, NOT NECESSARILY IDEOLOGIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CRAWFORD, Texas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a standard response to any inquiry
about the writings or work of Judge John G. Roberts
Jr., the Supreme Court nominee.
</P>
<P>
The White House defends his past work, which has offended both
conservatives and liberals, with a single response: Roberts was representing
his client or the position of the administration in power.
</P>
<P>
To some critics, that is a cop-out. Shouldn't lawyers, they argue,
sometimes be held accountable for their arguments, even when they
are being presented on behalf of someone else? Don't lawyers,
especially when they choose to work for the government, believe
in the cases they represent?
</P>
<P>
Here is the lawyerly response: The answer is yes, except when
it is no.
</P>
<P>
Of course, it is nearly impossible at this point to tell
which opinions and cases Roberts felt strongly committed to. But
many legal scholars say that is just the point. They
argue that the most impressive lawyers are known as much
for their ability to break ideological ranks as for hewing
to them.
</P>
<P>
In fact, these legal scholars say that lawyers, including Roberts, should
be commended for their ability to argue against their natural
grain. That skill, lawyers say, requires more mental dexterity and
creativity than simply advocating for your own opinion.
</P>
<P>
"If only people who are ideologically committed to a particular outcome
argued to the courts, the law would be worse off,"
said Charles Fried, who served as solicitor general in the
Reagan administration and is now a law professor at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
As an example, he cited John W. Davis, who he said
made the Supreme Court argument against integration at the elementary
school level in the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education
case, but who reportedly was not himself an ardent segregationist.
</P>
<P>
"The profession is designed to help the court by making sure
that the best possible arguments -- not misleading arguments, not
arguments that stretch a point, not arguments that hide precedents
-- but that the best possible arguments are presented," Fried
said. "That's the business we're in. It's very much like
if you were a doctor. Do you only cure people
who, when they're cured, will lead their lives as you
were going to lead them?"
</P>
<P>
Still, a trend among prominent prosecutors leaving government for the private
sector is to accept jobs as general counsel to a
particular company -- an approach that reduces the possibility of
having to accept undesirable cases as part of a big
law firm, and offers some evidence that lawyers try to
pick their cases and clients with care.
</P>
<P>
William P. Barr, the attorney general under former President George Bush,
is head of the general counsel's office at Verizon. Louis
J. Freeh, the former director of the FBI, went on
to become general counsel for the bank MBNA. James B.
Comey, the deputy attorney general, will head to Lockheed Martin
Corp. in October as its top lawyer.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some legal experts draw distinctions between cases
lawyers are hired to take, ones that are worked on
pro bono and ones that come in the course of
working within the justice system for a state or federal
government.
</P>
<P>
And within each of those categories there are further caveats: lawyers
who are political appointees in the upper echelons of the
Justice Department, for example, are considered more closely wedded to
the positions argued for the sitting White House than lower-ranking
career officers who work for Democrats and Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
By the same measure, a partner in a law firm who
seeks out a particularly ideological case, either paid or pro
bono, is more likely to be judged as supporting that
case than a junior associate who had it land on
his or her desk.
</P>
<P>
John Yoo, a prominent conservative legal scholar, held up Theodore B.
Olson, the former solicitor general in the current Bush administration,
as a model of a lawyer who should be proud
of virtually all of his arguments.
</P>
<P>
Olson, he said, is "the sort of conservative, ideologically conservative, committed
conservative, who takes pro bono cases that are designed to
advance conservative causes."
</P>
<P>
In particular, Yoo cited the Hopwood case, in which Olson, as
a private lawyer, successfully argued in front of the Supreme
Court that the race-based admissions policy of the University of
Texas was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is, what are people doing in their free
time?" Yoo said. "That's when you are explicitly almost supposed
to take your own personal views into account."
</P>
<P>
Not all lawyers agree.
</P>
<P>
"There are some lawyers who think of themselves as basically instruments
of whoever their clients are, and they pride themselves on
their professional craft, " said Cass Sunstein, a law professor
at the University of Chicago who was an adviser in
the office of legal counsel in the Justice Department from
1980 to 1981.
</P>
<P>
"Then there are lawyers that think generally they'll do their best
for their clients," Sunstein said, "but on some occasions will
refuse to do cases that bother them, or sometimes seek
out cases that make themselves feel good."
</P>
<P>
But according to Fried, the two are not mutually exclusive.
</P>
<P>
"I have turned down many cases where I say, 'You know,
look, forget it, you're just wrong, there's nothing to be
said on your side, I won't do it, find someone
else,"' he said. "But that's rarely the case at the
Supreme Court level, because if a position is that wrong,
it wouldn't have gotten that far."
