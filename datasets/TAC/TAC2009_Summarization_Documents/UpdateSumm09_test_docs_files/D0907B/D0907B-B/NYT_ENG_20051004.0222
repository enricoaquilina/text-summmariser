MIERS A BACKER OF BROAD EXECUTIVE BRANCH POWERS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - As President Bush's counsel, Harriet E. Miers continued the
expansive interpretation of presidential powers favored by her predecessor, Alberto
Gonzales, who backed Bush's authority to hold terrorist suspects without
trial, as well as the White House's right to withhold
more administration documents from public disclosure than in the past.
</P>
<P>
Miers has also been outspoken in her support of reauthorizing the
USA Patriot Act, which gave the executive branch new powers
of surveillance over US citizens.
</P>
<P>
Now, Miers is Bush's choice to join the Supreme Court. That
selection determines how much power a president can wield under
the Constitution. Her nomination, announced Monday, followed the confirmation of
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who supported broad war
powers for the president in a case he heard during
his brief tenure as an appellate judge.
</P>
<P>
The two appointments, both of lawyers with extensive White House experience,
have raised alarm among critics of the Bush administration's broad
reading of executive branch authority.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the president is now seeding the Supreme Court
with people who have been handmaidens in his efforts to
increase the power of the executive without any check or
oversight whatsoever is very disturbing," said Bill Goodman, legal director
of the Center for Constitutional Rights, which sued Bush on
behalf of prisoners at the US facility at Guantanamo Bay.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Miers, too, have invoked her work on Bush's terrorism
policies to assuage fears among some conservatives that she may
be too moderate.
</P>
<P>
"In her work respecting the War on Terror and the threats
posed to our country by misuse of foreign and international
law, Ms. Miers has applied the Constitution as the Framers
wrote it," wrote Leonard Leo of the conservative Federalist Society.
</P>
<P>
A New York University law professor, David Golove, said that executive
power is emerging as a defining issue for the Supreme
Court in the post-Sept.11, 2001, era. In case after case,
the Bush administration has argued that it has the authority
to take measures it deems necessary to stop terrorists, while
others have insisted on maintaining checks and balances.
</P>
<P>
"Executive power issues are going to be coming before the court
that are of tremendous significance," Golove said, pointing to challenges
to Patriot Act surveillance powers, the treatment of Guantanamo Bay
prisoners, and the case of José Padilla, a US citizen
being held without trial under the authority asserted by Bush
to imprison anyone whom the government suspects of being a
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
As the lineup of the Supreme Court evolves, so may its
rulings on how much power the Constitution gives the president.
That prospect has sent analysts hunting for clues in the
records of Bush's nominees.
</P>
<P>
This summer, for example, when Roberts was still an appeals court
judge, he was part of a three-judge panel that ruled
that Bush could bypass the Geneva Conventions, which require that
prisoners of war be given court-martials, and could instead try
a detainee before a military commission. Their holding reversed a
district court's finding that the president had exceeded his authority.
</P>
<P>
And in a speech in April 2005,before a GOP lawyers' group,
Miers said that reauthorizing the entire Patriot Act was "critical,"
because it "has been used in so many ways to
help protect this nation and its people and in the
war on terror."
</P>
<P>
Miers made her speech in the context of bipartisan calls to
amend the law with stronger checks on new surveillance powers.
</P>
<P>
Miers was also part of the administration's legal team when it
developed both the Patriot Act and the detention policy for
suspected terrorists. Her role in those internal deliberations, however, is
unknown to the public.
</P>
<P>
Some conservatives wonder whether Miers personally supports the administration's approach, or
is just backing her client's official policy.
</P>
<P>
Among those raising questions is John Yoo, a former Justice Department
official who helped to draft the Patriot Act and who
wrote a memo arguing that Bush could authorize aggressive interrogation
techniques, despite laws against torture.
</P>
<P>
Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California at
Berkeley, wrote in an article appearing Tuesday in The Washington
Post that Miers might shore up conservative support if the
White House disclosed her private advice to the president about
the extent of his executive power.
</P>
<P>
"She may be one of the key supporters in the Bush
administration of staying the course on legal issues arising from
the war on terrorism," Yoo wrote. "But it is hard
to see how the administration could reveal Miers's position on
these issues, given its tough, five-year struggle to preserve the
confidentiality of executive-branch deliberations."
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Miers argued against expanding government powers in the face
of despite security threats. In July 1992, as the president
of the Texas bar association, Miers warned against responding to
a courtroom shooting spree by infringing "on precious, constitutionally guaranteed
freedoms."
</P>
<P>
"The same liberties that ensure a free society make the innocent
vulnerable to those who prevent rights and privileges and commit
senseless and cruel acts," Miers wrote in Texas Lawyer magazine.
"Those precious liberties include free speech, freedom to assemble, freedom
of liberties, access to public places, the right to bear
arms and freedom from constant surveillance. We are not willing
to sacrifice these rights because of the acts of maniacs."
</P>
<P>
With no one sure where Miers would stand on executive power
as a justice, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, said he will question her
on the issue to make sure she is capable of
"judicial independence."
</P>
<P>
As she prepares for such questions, Miers may look to Roberts's
testimony last month. Promising the Senate that he would bring
an impartial look to cases that involve challenges to executive
power, Roberts cited the late Justice Robert Jackson as a
role model.
</P>
<P>
Before he joined the Supreme Court, Jackson was attorney general under
President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
In 1940, before the US was involved in World War II,
Jackson adopted an expansive reading of executive power by arguing
that Roosevelt had the authority to defy the Neutrality Act
by sending destroyers to Britain for use against Nazi Germany,
Golove said.
</P>
<P>
Yet years later, as a justice on the court during the
Korean War, Jackson ruled that President Harry Truman lacked the
authority to seize steel mills in the name of national
security, even in wartime.
</P>
<P>
"The Constitution is the only interest I have as a judge,"
Roberts said. "The notion that I would compromise my commitment
to that principle that has been the lode star of
my professional life since I became a lawyer... is one
that I reject entirely. That would be inconsistent with the
judicial oath. And Justice Jackson is a perfect example of
that."
