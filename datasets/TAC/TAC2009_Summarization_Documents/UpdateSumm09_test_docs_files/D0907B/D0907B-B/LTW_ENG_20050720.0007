Roberts: a Record of Accomplishment, and Some Contradictions
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1991, John G. Roberts Jr., then deputy solicitor
general in the first Bush administration, told the Supreme Court its
historic decision supporting a woman's right to an abortion was
``wrongly decided and should be overruled.'' In 2003, when Roberts was
up for a judgeship, he played down his earlier statement, explaining
that he only made the administration's case against Roe v. Wade
because that was his responsibility as its lawyer.
</P>
<P>
After 11 years in government service and 10 years at one of
Washington's largest law firms, Roberts has earned a reputation as a
brilliant litigator who argues passionately for his clients'
positions. The question the Senate will debate as it decides whether
to elevate him to the Supreme Court is which of those positions are
also his own.
</P>
<P>
As a long-standing member of the Republican National Lawyers
Association who gave Republican Gov. Jeb Bush private legal advice
during the 2000 presidential election recount in Florida, Roberts'
political loyalties are plain. As a former clerk to then-Associate
Justice William Rehnquist, a protege of former solicitor general
Kenneth Starr and a member of the Federalist Society, his conservative
credentials are solid. But in his first two years on the federal
bench, his opinions have been generally noted for dispassionate
reasoning rather than inflammatory language. Roberts' short time on
the bench, coupled with the relative paucity of his writings, has left
critics and potential supporters with little by which to judge how he
will vote on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
In his confirmation hearings for a federal judgeship in April 2003,
Roberts maintained that he always separates his personal beliefs from
his duty to follow the law -- including Roe v. Wade, which he described
as a long-settled precedent. He reminded the Senate Judiciary
Committee that John Adams once represented a British soldier involved
in the Boston Massacre, proof that ``the positions a lawyer presents
on behalf of a client should not be ascribed to that lawyer,'' and
said his own private legal practice had not been ``ideological in any
sense.'' Roberts said he has represented supporters as well as
opponents of affirmative action, and once helped a group of welfare
recipients get their benefits restored.
</P>
<P>
As President Bush noted Tuesday night, 146 members of the D.C. bar
-- Democrats as well as Republicans -- signed a letter calling him ``one
of the very best and most highly respected appellate lawyers in the
nation,'' hailing his ``unquestioned integrity and fair-mindedness.''
Those strong relationships on both sides of the Beltway's partisan
divide could help smooth his Senate confirmation, enabling him to
persuade conservatives that he won't be the next David Souter without
worrying Democrats that he will be the next Antonin Scalia.
</P>
<P>
Still, his journey to the federal bench did not leave him
unscathed. He never came up for a vote the first time he was nominated
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by the first
President Bush. And his nomination to the same court by the second
President Bush attracted opposition from the liberal Alliance for
Justice and NARAL Pro-America. Many liberals suspect that the
conservative positions he advocated in the Reagan administration were
no different from the positions he would advocate on the court. Many
conservatives think so, too, even though Roberts is less outspoken and
less aggressive than some of the other judges considered for the
court.
</P>
<P>
``I know he's conservative by talking with him about issues,'' said
Fred Fielding, for whom Roberts worked as a White House deputy
counsel. Fielding said Roberts supported expansive presidential
powers, and tended toward a ``more literal reading of the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
C. Boyden Gray of the Committee for Justice, a nonprofit
conservative group established to support Bush nominees to the federal
courts, called him a ``brilliant choice.''
</P>
<P>
John Yoo, a conservative professor of law at University of
California at Berkeley who served in the Justice Department under the
current Bush administration, emphasizes what he called Roberts'
traditional approach to the law. In the 39 cases that Roberts argued
before the Supreme Court -- 25 of which he won -- Yoo said he never
pushed the court to adopt ``big new theories,'' but rather argued the
facts of his cases.
</P>
<P>
``He's the type of person that business conservatives and judicial
restraint conservatives will like, but the social conservatives may
not like,'' Yoo said.
</P>
<P>
``What the social conservatives want is someone who will overturn
Roe. v. Wade and change the court's direction on privacy,'' he added.
``But he represents the Washington establishment. These Washington
establishment people are not revolutionaries and they're not out to
shake up constitutional law. They might make course corrections, but
they're not trying to sail the boat to a different port.''
</P>
<P>
John Glover Roberts, 50, was born in Buffalo and grew up in the
town of Long Beach, Ind. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive, he
graduated first in his high school class, then attended Harvard
University, graduating summa cum laude in only three years. One of his
advisers, William LaPiana -- now a law professor who says he ``probably
disagrees with Roberts about just about everything'' -- recalls him as
a rare font of middle-America conservatism on a campus that was
overwhelmingly liberal. He also recalls Roberts as an unusually modest
and mature young star who already displayed a judicial temperament.
</P>
<P>
Roberts then excelled at Harvard Law School, becoming managing
editor of the prestigious Harvard Law Review, where he was known as
something of a straight-arrow. David Leebron, who is the president of
Rice University and was the editor of the review at the time, recalls
that after working late they would often stop for ice cream. Roberts
always chose the same flavor: vanilla chocolate chip. ``I'm the type
of person who wants to try other things, but he makes his choices and
gets comfortable with them,'' Leebron said.
</P>
<P>
Roberts chose a fairly traditional path to legal prominence. He
clerked for Judge Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
2nd Circuit, in New York, then for Rehnquist. He later worked as a
special assistant to Attorney General William French Smith, then
joined President Ronald Reagan's staff as an aide to White House
counsel Fielding.
</P>
<P>
He joined the Washington law firm of Hogan &amp; Hartson in 1986; then
three years later joined President George H.W. Bush's administration,
arguing cases before the Supreme Court as Solicitor General Starr's
principal deputy.
</P>
<P>
Roberts' remarks criticizing Roe v. Wade were included in a brief
he co-authored arguing that barring federal financing of abortion
counseling fulfilled the intent of a law that had not previously been
interpreted in that manner. Separately, he co-wrote a brief that
claimed an antiabortion group was not discriminating against women by
trying to shut down abortion clinics through protests; the Supreme
Court agreed with his argument. While Starr's deputy from October 1989
to January 1993, Roberts wrote a brief urging the Supreme Court to
accept the constitutionality of prayer at a public school graduation
ceremony. He also co-authored a brief supporting a law criminalizing
the burning of the American flag. In both cases, the Supreme Court
rejected those arguments.
</P>
<P>
In 1990 and 1991, according to his liberal critics, Roberts also
co-wrote briefs arguing against the imposition of a new desegregation
decree for Oklahoma public schools and against the need to inform
defendants that they may be sentenced to longer terms than agreed
under a plea bargain. The Supreme Court rejected the latter argument.
</P>
<P>
When his nomination to the circuit court died at the end of the
first Bush administration, Roberts returned to Hogan &amp; Hartson, where
he headed the firm's appellate practice and frequently argued before
the Supreme Court, winning a lot more than he lost. He also became a
millionaire; his net worth is between $2,780,039.44 and $6,870,000.
</P>
<P>
During his two stints at Hogan &amp; Hartson, he represented varied
corporate and professional clients. The cases he considers most
significant, according to his Senate testimony, involved his
representation of a man convicted of filing false Medicaid claims, the
National Collegiate Athletic Association, the state of Hawaii, a
road-sign manufacturer, the Chrysler Corp., a group of coal companies,
and Litton Systems.
</P>
<P>
Some of his liberal critics point in particular to a brief he wrote
supporting the National Mining Association in its efforts to bar
lawsuits by local citizens against a type of mineral extraction that
involves blasting off the tops of mountains and dumping the debris in
streams.
</P>
<P>
Roberts' name did not appear on any of the briefs during the
Florida presidential vote recount, but sources say he gave Gov. Bush
critical advice on how the Florida Legislature could name George W.
Bush the winner at time when Republicans feared the courts might force
a different choice. Still, Paul Mogin -- his former law school roommate
and co-clerk, and a self-described liberal -- said Roberts was
nonconfrontational when it comes to politics.
</P>
<P>
``I doubt he has any particular agenda that he'd be going into the
court with,'' said Mogin, who asked Roberts to be the best man at his
wedding.
</P>
<P>
After being named to the appellate court in 2003, Roberts' first
writing was a dissenting opinion from a decision by his colleagues on
the U.S. Court of Appeals not to reconsider a three-judge panel's
ruling protecting a rare California toad under the Endangered Species
Act.
</P>
<P>
Roberts did not rule out the possibility that the act had been
correctly applied, but thought the court ought to give a developer
whose freedom of action had been restricted in favor of the toad
another chance to make his argument that the Constitution did not
permit the government to regulate activity affecting what he called
``a hapless toad'' that ``for reasons of its own lives its entire life
in California.''
</P>
<P>
Besides the toad case, earlier this month he backed the
administration's plan to let special panels of military officers
conduct trials of terrorism suspects detained in the U.S. military
prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, overturning a lower-court decision
that had blocked the ``military commissions'' for the past eight
months.
</P>
<P>
The nominee is married to Jane Sullivan. They have two children,
John and Josephine, and have lived for more than a year in a
three-story federal-style house on Meadow Lane in Chevy Chase, Md.,
that he purchased for $1.225 million in 2003. It has a well-trimmed
lawn, and neighbor James McNaughton say Roberts often cuts it himself.
</P>
<P>
``He's Mr. American,'' McNaughton said. ``He's kind of friendly, a
nice fellow. He doesn't buttonhole you and lecture you on politics or
religion.''
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, Elizabeth White, a math specialist at a
Montgomery County elementary school, said he is a ``wonderful husband
and a wonderful, devoted father.''
