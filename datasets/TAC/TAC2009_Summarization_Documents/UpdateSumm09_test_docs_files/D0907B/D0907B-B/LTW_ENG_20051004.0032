The following commentaries and editorials are also listed on the
main newsfeature budget that moved Tuesday to the general advisory
category. The editor is Carlos Selva in Los Angeles at (213) 237-7832.

Category codes of stories are in parentheses.

SCOTUS-COMMENT -- President Bush and administration members know
what Harriett E. Miers thinks about the constitutional issues most
likely to come before the Supreme Court; Democrats in Congress and the
American public do not, and are not likely to learn more, but they
should also have the benefit of that knowledge. 755 words, by Mark A.
Graber (Sun special) (k). Upcoming.

SCOTUS-MIERS-COMMENT -- Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers once
described her method. ``People understand winning or losing. What they
don't understand is that they didn't have a fair hearing.'' It's
elemental, perhaps, but all the constitutional erudition in the best
legal library could not summarize the judicial role better. 810 words,
by Douglas W. Kmiec (Post special) (k).

MIERS-AGAINST-COMMENT -- WASHINGTON -- Supreme Court nominee
Harriet Miers is almost certain to be confirmed. She is not likely to
prove a revolutionary conservative, though, but rather a gradualist
judge, keen to balance conflicting values rather than declaring clear
principles. 900 words, by John Yoo (Post special) (k).

ENERGY-COMMENT -- President Bush's appeal for energy conservation
represents more than a tweaking of policy; it reflects a broader shift
in the president's -- and the nation's -- sense of what's possible,
and what isn't. For all of his efforts to convey the can-do spirit,
Bush finds himself echoing the much-maligned pronouncements of the
Carter era. He's stuck in a new age of limits. 1,755 words, by Bruce
J. Schulman (Post) (k).

RUSSIA-COMMENT -- WASHINGTON -- For the first time in decades
Russia is becoming less, not more, free, and President Bush can't even
bring himself to acknowledge what is happening. 820 words, by Fred
Hiatt (Post) (k).

TERROR-COMMENT -- Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that we do not
have a winning strategy in place in the war against terror. 1,000
words, by Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon (Times) (k). Upcoming.

MILITARY-COMMENT -- In the case of Katrina, the lesson is not that
federalism failed us, but that what we need is better definition and
execution of disaster responsibilities at all levels of government and
more leadership on both the state and federal level to use the laws
that are already in place. 930 words, by John Yoo (Times special) (k).
Moved.

PROFESSORS-COMMENT -- University life traditionally has been a
haven where people are willing to overlook unusual behavior in ``nutty
professors,'' or to accept it as part of the intellectual package; but
what do you do when your odd colleagues are not so lovable -- when
their behavior is less eccentric than downright dysfunctional? 780
words, by Mikita Brottman (Times special) (k). Upcoming.

CATHOLIC-GAYS-COMMENT -- A blanket ban by the Catholic Church on
gay seminarians is unnecessary as well as un-Christian. 880 words, by
Michael McGough (Times special) (k). Upcoming.

TAIWAN-COMMENT -- For 25 years, China and Taiwan have tried to
isolate the other diplomatically by buying the allegiance of small
nations. Today, the battleground is Latin America, where 12 of the
countries that recognize Taiwan are located. 970 words, by David
DeVoss (Times special) (k). Moved.

MEDIA-COMMENT -- Time and again Americans have made clear that
confidential newsgathering is an important part of a free press and
that journalists who protect sources should not be treated as
scofflaws. If the Supreme Court will not intervene, Congress should
recognize that generations have already spoken on this issue and pass
a federal shield law. 775 words, by Nathan Siegel (Post special) (k).

MEDIA-EMOTION-COMMENT -- Much has been made of the surge of emotion
among journalists who covered the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and
to a lesser degree Hurricane Rita. Genuine human emotion drives
journalism to higher levels of inquiry and gives journalists spine.
Yet clearly there are risks to it. It can quickly descend into
manipulative gimmickry, with journalists as professional emoters who
cover events to express their outrage. 825 words, by Tom Rosenstiel
and Bill Kovach (Post special) (k).

TIMES EDITORIAL, upcoming; POST EDITORIAL, moved (both k).
