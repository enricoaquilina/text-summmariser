<P>
Police and investigators probing child molestation charges against
superstar Michael Jackson on Friday launched a fresh search on his
famed Neverland Ranch, detectives said.
</P>
<P>
The reason a warrant was issued for the latest search was not
immediately clear. An initial swoop on the sprawling estate in
California took place just over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The "King of Pop" was not present at the ranch, named after the home
of the eternally youthful children's literary character Peter Pan,
when police swooped, Jackson's entourage told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"At around 9:00 am (1700 GMT), sheriff investigators served a search
warrant at Neverland Ranch ... as part of an ongoing criminal
investigation," said Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department spokesman
Chris Pappas said.
</P>
<P>
The raid is one of a number of searches that have been carried out on
various locations linked to Jackson since he was arrested on November
20 last year.
</P>
<P>
Jackson turned himself in two days after the initial November 18,
2003 swoop on his rural estate and was later charged with having
molested a 12-year-old boy at Neverland in February and March of last
year.
</P>
<P>
In that raid, investigators seized a large number of items to be used
in evidence against him, including the top layer of a mattress that
was used in the mansion.
</P>
<P>
Jackson has pleaded innocent to a 10-count indictment that accused
him child abuse, plying the boy with alcohol to seduce him and with
counts of conspiring to kidnap and illegally imprison the youth and
his family.
</P>
<P>
Jury selection in the celebrity trial was due to begin in Santa
Maria, south of Neverland, on January 31.
</P>
<P>
Jackson fans and those close to the embattled entertainer told AFP
they had no idea what authorities were looking for in their renewed
search of Neverland, but said the raid was a clear sign that
prosecutors lack evidence against Jackson.
</P>
<P>
"I've been talking to the family," said Angel (Eds.: one name), who
heads the  Friends of Michael Jackson Committee.
</P>
<P>
"They think the DA (district attorney) doesn't have enough evidence,
and is trying to get more evidence," she told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Jackson and his three children left the ranch on Thursday for a trip
to the Nevada gambling getaway of Las Vegas, Angel and other members
of the Jackson family entourage told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"Michael wasn't there," Angel said. "He left with the kids. They
didn't know this was going to happen today. They are in Las Vegas
now."
</P>
<P>
Jackson's legal team has accused prosecutor Tom Sneddon of waging a
vendetta against the pop icon, despite a lack of evidence in the
case.
</P>
<P>
His lawyers have complained that investigations and searches are
still being carried out in the case more than a year after Jackson
was arrested and charged, delaying progress in the case.
