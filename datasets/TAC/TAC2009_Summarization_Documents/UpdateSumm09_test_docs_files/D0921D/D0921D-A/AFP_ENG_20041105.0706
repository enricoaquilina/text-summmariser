<P>
A son of late acting legend Marlon Brando was implicated in an
alleged plot by Michael Jackson to kidnap the boy who accused him of
child molestation, a court heard Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bombshell was dropped during a pre-trial hearing in Jackson's
child molestation case when prosecutors revealed they had recently
discovered documents linking Miko Brando with the alleged crime.
</P>
<P>
Brando, 44, the son of the Oscar-winning movie giant, works as a
security guard for the "King of Pop" and received a 20,000-dollar
petty cash payment from Jackson, prosecutor Ronald Zonen told Judge
Rodney Melville.
</P>
<P>
A record of the alleged December 2003 transaction was discovered in
documents seized in a search of the home of Jackson's personal
assistant, the court heard.
</P>
<P>
"Evidence of the movement of cash (is) consistent with count one of
the indictment" against Jackson, Zonen told the court as prosecutors
and Jackson's lawyers haggled over what evidence should be allowed at
trial.
</P>
<P>
Count one on the 10-count criminal indictment alleges that Jackson
and co-conspirators planned to abduct a child, to falsely imprison
someone and to extort someone.
</P>
<P>
While details of the indictment remain secret under a strict gag
order in the case, the charges are thought to involve an alleged plot
to abduct Jackson's young accuser, his younger brother and the boys'
mother.
</P>
<P>
But Jackson lawyer Robert Sanger, arguing that the financial record
should not be seen by Jackson's trial jury, said the payment proved
nothing.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing unusual with someone like Michael Jackson, with
such a large operation like Neverland, to have 20,000 dollars in cash
delivered to them for the purpose of running their daily affairs,"
Sanger said.
</P>
<P>
Jackson has denied 10 counts that include allegations that he
molested a 12-year-old boy at Neverland Ranch in February and March
of last year. He was arrested on November 19, 2003 freed on three
million dollars' bail.
