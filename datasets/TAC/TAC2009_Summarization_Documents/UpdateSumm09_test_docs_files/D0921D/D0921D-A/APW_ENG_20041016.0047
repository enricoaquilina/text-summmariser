Longtime Jackson attorney Steve Cochran leaves defense team
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An attorney who has represented Michael Jackson for more than a
decade has left the pop star's defense team, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
Steve Cochran took a "temporary leave of absence" from the team
defending Jackson from child molestation charges, but will continue
to "collaborate" with lead attorney Thomas Mesereau Jr., Jackson said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to thank attorney Steve Cochran for all of the hard
work he has done on my behalf," Jackson said in a statement released
by his spokeswoman. "He continues to be my friend and close adviser."
</P>
<P>
A reason for the departure was not released. A message left after
business hours at Cochran's Los Angeles office was not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement, Mesereau denied rumors that there was
animosity between him and Cochran. He called Cochran a friend,
"brilliant lawyer, and a great credit to our profession."
</P>
<P>
Mesereau declined further comment when contacted by The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
In April, Jackson fired Mark Geragos and Benjamin Brafman, replacing
the two famous attorneys with Mesereau. The team of Cochran and
Robert Sanger had worked for Jackson in lesser roles throughout the
case.
</P>
<P>
Jackson has pleaded not guilty to child molestation, conspiracy and
administering an intoxicating agent, alcohol.
