Trial over alleged secret taping of Michael Jackson delayed
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A judge Thursday agreed to postpone the trial date for a lawsuit
brought by Michael Jackson and his former lawyer over the alleged
secret recording of them on a charter jet as the singer flew to be
booked on child molestation charges.
</P>
<P>
Jackson and attorney Mark Geragos sued XtraJet Inc. in November,
alleging they were videotaped without their knowledge on a flight to
Santa Barbara so Jackson could surrender on the charges.
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Soussan G. Bruguera moved the trial date from
November to May 23 over the protests of XtraJet.
</P>
<P>
The trial date was postponed due to the singer's criminal case, which
is scheduled for trial in January, and because Geragos is
representing Scott Peterson, the murder defendant accused of killing
his wife and their unborn son.
</P>
<P>
Geragos is no longer representing Jackson, but was his lawyer in
November when Jackson flew from Las Vegas to surrender.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that XtraJet "intentionally and surreptitiously
videotaped and recorded" Jackson and Geragos, including the recording
of "privileged attorney-client communications."
</P>
<P>
XtraJet's attorney, Lloyd Kirschbaum called the lawsuit a "publicity
stunt."
</P>
<P>
The videotaping surfaced when representatives of XtraJet showed the
video to several news organizations, claiming they found the tapes
aboard one of their jets. They wanted to know whether it was legal to
distribute or sell them.
</P>
<P>
Jackson's attorney's won a temporary restraining order against
XtraJet that barred any release of the tapes.
</P>
<P>
The judge also granted Jackson's request to remove his claims of
emotional distress. The change prevents attorneys from asking Jackson
any questions about his mental state, said Geragos' attorney, Brian
Kabateck.
</P>
<P>
Jackson also wanted to avoid giving a deposition for the trial, but
the judge denied that request, Kabateck said.
