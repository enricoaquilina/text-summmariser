Japan to Send Fischer to Freedom in Iceland

Bobby Fischer, the fugitive chess legend, reached an
agreement Wednesday with Japanese authorities to avoid deportation to
the United States, his supporters said. Sources familiar with the case
said he will instead be released after eight months in prison here and
flown to freedom in Iceland as early as Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The deal to free Fischer came after Iceland -- a chess-loving nation
that hosted his historic Cold War-era victory over Soviet Boris
Spassky in 1972 -- granted Fischer citizenship this week in a move to
help him evade trial in the United States. Fischer, 62, who grew up in
New York, has dodged a U.S. arrest warrant since playing a chess match
in Yugoslavia in 1992 in violation of U.S. sanctions at the time.
</P>
<P>
Fischer evaded U.S. authorities for more than a decade with the
help of global chess fans from Argentina to the Philippines, who
offered him shelter even as he ventured out every now and then into
the public eye to offer scathing anti-American and anti-Jewish rants.
He was finally nabbed in July at an airport outside Tokyo for
traveling on a voided U.S. passport.
</P>
<P>
Fischer's alleged violation of U.S. sanctions is not considered an
extraditable offense in Japan. American authorities were instead
counting on Japanese laws mandating deportation of persons detained
for traveling on false documents to their countries of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Fischer made a number of failed attempts to block an unwelcome
homecoming to the United States -- including seeking refugee status,
renouncing his U.S. citizenship and unveiling plans to marry his
avowed companion Miyoko Watai, a four-time women's chess champion in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
But Fischer found success in Iceland, where, at his request, the
parliament honored his ``historic connection'' with the tiny island
nation, voting 40 to 0 Monday to grant him citizenship. The move came
despite U.S. protests. ``Mr. Fischer is a true Icelander now,''
Iceland's ambassador to Japan, Thordur Oskarsson, told reporters in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials agreed to allow Fischer to travel to his adopted
homeland as long as he withdraws a still-pending lawsuit he filed
against the Japanese government to block his deportation. John
Bosnitch, chairman of the Tokyo-based Committee to Free Bobby Fischer,
said Fischer would do so Thursday morning before heading directly to
the airport to board a flight to Iceland via Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
``The people of Iceland have rescued Bobby Fischer from
injustice,'' Bosnitch said.
</P>
<P>
The case had become an irritation for Japan, with Fischer alleging
-- falsely, according to the Japanese -- that he had been physically
abused by his captors. A Japanese official familiar with the case said
the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo had been informed of the decision to allow
Fischer's release.

Fischer's resentment of the United States is well known. He has
said he regards it as part of the ``global Jewish conspiracy,''
despite the fact that his mother was Jewish. He has insisted from his
Japanese jail cell that U.S. officials are persecuting him for his
political beliefs.
</P>
<P>
Fischer entered Japan on a valid 90-day visa in April 2004,
according to a copy of his passport on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 6, 2003, he had gone went to the U.S. Embassy in Bern,
Switzerland, and was given additional pages to his passport. But a
letter dated December 2003 from the U.S. Embassy in the Philippines,
where Fischer has a daughter, advised him that his passport was being
revoked. Fischer, according to Bosnitch, never received the letter.

<P>
Now U.S. officials are preparing for a legal rematch. They have
suggested that they may file new tax evasion charges against Fischer --
who has publicly stated that he has not paid U.S. taxes since going
into self-imposed exile 12 years ago, including taxes on the $3
million he won during his rematch against Spassky in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Such charges, U.S. officials say, may fall under extraditable
crimes in Iceland.
