<P>
Iceland said Wednesday it hoped to give 
detained chess legend Bobby Fischer a passport before the weekend 
after granting him citizenship in a move that could allow him to 
avoid a US prison term.
</P>
<P>
Icelandic Ambassador to Japan Thordur Oskarsson told AFP that 
Iceland formally presented documents Wednesday to Japan's foreign 
and justice ministries confirming the US-born genius's Icelandic 
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
On issuing him an Icelandic passport, the ambassador said: "I 
would say we want to deliver to him before the weekend."
</P>
<P>
"The passport is almost ready, but no exact time has been 
fixed," Oskarsson said, adding it would be issued at the Icelandic 
embassy in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, 62, known for his eccentric behavior and outspoken 
criticism of the United States, has been detained in Japan since 
July when he tried to fly out of Tokyo to the Philippines on his 
revoked US passport.
</P>
<P>
If he returns to the United States, he will face 10 years in 
prison over a chess game in 1992 in Yugoslavia in defiance of US 
sanctions imposed over the Balkan wars.
</P>
<P>
Iceland had earlier sent him a passport which showed residency 
status but not full nationality, a document not deemed sufficient to 
save him from deportation to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The chess legend is famous in Iceland for a 1972 match against 
Boris Spassky, then a Soviet citizen, in the capital Reykjavik at 
the height of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, with Japan looking set to deport Fischer, the 
parliament in Iceland voted to grant Fischer citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Justice Minister Chieko Noono said Tuesday it was 
"legally possible" to send Fischer to Iceland as long as he gets 
Icelandic citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The US government expressed disappointment over Iceland's move, 
calling Fischer a "fugitive from justice" who had a federal warrant 
for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Fischer, who is staying at the Ushiku immigration 
lock-up northeast of Tokyo, have said he has lost weight and become 
ragged in detention, growing a long beard. 
</P>
<P>
He was placed into solitary confinement for four days earlier 
this month in a tussle with guards over an egg.
