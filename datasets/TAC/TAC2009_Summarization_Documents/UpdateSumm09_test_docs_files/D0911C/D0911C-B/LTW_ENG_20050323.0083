Japan to Send Fischer to Freedom in Iceland

After a series of strategic moves worthy of one of his
greatest matches, fugitive chess legend Bobby Fischer reached an
agreement with Japanese authorities to avoid deportation to the United
States on Wednesday. He will instead be released after nine months in
prison here and flown to freedom in Iceland as early as Thursday
morning, according to sources familiar with the case.
</P>
<P>
The deal to free Fischer came after Iceland -- a chess-loving nation
that hosted his historic Cold War-era victory over Soviet chess king
Boris Spassky in 1972 -- granted Fischer citizenship this week in a
move helping him evade trial in the United States. Fischer, 62, a New
York-native, has dodged a U.S. arrest warrant since making an
anti-American ``political statement'' by playing a 1992 chess match in
Yugoslavia in alleged violation of then-standing U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Fischer evaded U.S. authorities for more than a decade with the
help of global chess fans from Argentina to the Philippines, who
offered him shelter even as Fischer ventured out every now and then
into the public eye to offer scathing anti-American and anti-Jewish
rants. He was finally nabbed at Narita International Airport outside
Tokyo last July for traveling on a voided U.S. passport.
</P>
<P>
But Fischer's alleged 1992 crime is not considered an extraditable
offense in Japan, and U.S. authorities were instead counting on
Japanese laws mandating deportation of persons detained for traveling
on false documents to their countries of citizenship. Fischer tried a
number of failed countermoves to block an unwelcome homecoming to the
United States -- including seeking refugee status, renouncing his U.S.
citizenship and unveiling plans to marry his avowed companion Miyoko
Watai, a four-time Japan women's chess champion.
</P>
<P>
But he found his checkmate in Iceland, where, at Fischer's request,
the parliament honored his intellect and ``historic connection'' with
the tiny island nation stemming from his 1972 match there by awarding
him Icelandic citizenship with a 40-0 vote on Monday. It came despite
U.S. protests.
</P>
<P>
``Mr. Fischer is a true Icelander now,'' Iceland's ambassador to
Japan, Thordur Oskarsson, told reporters in Tokyo.

<P>
For the wily Fischer, who long ago brought an unlikely pizzazz to
the bookish game of chess, his narrow escape marks yet another stroke
of strategic genius. An eccentric personality known for his bizarre
behavior at matches and brief adherence to a religious cult, he became
a celebrated American hero after besting Spassky at the 1972
championship in Reykjavik.
</P>
<P>
But in the years following his early retirement from the game,
Fischer grew to resent the United States, regaling it as part the
``global Jewish conspiracy'' despite the fact that his mother was
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
Fischer has insisted from his Japanese jail cell that U.S.
officials are persecuting him for his political beliefs. His
supporters here have noted that U.S. authorities only revoked his
passport after he took to the airwaves in Manila on Sept. 11, 2001,
hailing the terrorist attacks on the United States as ``wonderful
news'' and adding that ``I want to see the U.S. wiped out.''
