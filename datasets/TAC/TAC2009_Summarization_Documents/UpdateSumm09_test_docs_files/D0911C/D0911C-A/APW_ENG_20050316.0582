Chess genius Bobby Fischer, now in a Japanese detention cell awaiting
deportation to the United States, will be allowed to leave Japan for Iceland if
that country grants him citizenship, an opposition party leader said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mizuho Fukushima, head of the Social Democratic Party, said senior immigration
officials told her that Fischer could go to Iceland instead of the United States
if he is given citizenship there. Fischer is wanted by Washington for violating
economic sanctions against the former Yugoslavia when he played a high-profile
chess match at a resort there in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"They said that if he had citizenship, there would be no problem," she said
after the meeting with immigration officials. Fukushima, a member of Parliament,
later met with Iceland's ambassador to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Iceland recently issued Fischer a special passport and residence permit to help
resolve the standoff over his status. Fischer became world chess champion in a
1972 match in Iceland against the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky, and some of his
Icelandic supporters have campaigned to help him out of gratitude for putting
Iceland in the global spotlight.
</P>
<P>
The Iceland passport is one used by foreigners, however. Iceland's parliament
voted two weeks ago against granting Fischer citizenship, and it's unclear
whether lawmakers plan to reconsider this.
</P>
<P>
"The decision on citizenship lies with Parliament," said Illugi Gunnarsson, an
advisor to the Foreign Minister David Oddsson.
</P>
<P>
Since being taken into custody in July for allegedly trying to leave the country
on a revoked U.S. passport, Fischer has lived up to his reputation as
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
He has repeatedly denounced the U.S. deportation order as politically motivated,
demanded refugee status, unilaterally renounced his U.S. citizenship and said he
wants to become a German national instead. He has also applied to marry a
Japanese woman who heads this country's chess association and is his longtime
companion.
</P>
<P>
Officials, meanwhile, have taken a hard line with him.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, 62, is being held in detention just outside Tokyo pending the outcome
of a lawsuit challenging the deportation order. Officials say they do not know
how much longer that could take. Most detainees at the center are deported or
allowed to leave Japan within about one month, but Fischer has been in custody
for eight months.
</P>
<P>
Fukushima said Fischer, an outspoken critic of the U.S. government, was being
treated unfairly.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to keep him in detention," she said. "If this was any other
person, I'm sure it would have turned out differently."
</P>
<P>
Her protest came after a member of Japan's leading opposition party, the
Democrats, grilled government officials in Parliament over the case. Fukushima
said her party also intended to pursue the issue further in parliamentary
debate.
</P>
<P>
During questioning in Parliament on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura
denied allegations Tokyo is trying to please the United States by being
tough.
</P>
<P>
"I do not recall being asked by the United States to do anything about Fischer,"
Machimura told the committee. "So I don't think the Justice Ministry is
interpreting the law out of consideration for the United States."
