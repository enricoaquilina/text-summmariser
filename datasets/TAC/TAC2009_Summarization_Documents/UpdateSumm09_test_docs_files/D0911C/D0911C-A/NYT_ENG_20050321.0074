IN STEP TOWARD FREEDOM, ICELAND GRANTS CITIZENSHIP TO FISCHER

Iceland's parliament voted Monday to grant Icelandic citizenship to
the American chess champion Bobby Fischer, laying the groundwork, his
supporters said, for his release from the Japanese prison where
he has been detained since last summer.
</P>
<P>
"We are most happy," said Einar S. Einarsson, spokesman for a
committee that has been fighting to allow Fischer to leave
Japan, where he is being held in prison while he
fights deportation to the United States. Einarsson, who called Fischer
"part of our modern saga and part of our recent
history," said that the 62-year-old chess champion might be released
"in only a few days" and that an Icelandic delegation
planned to travel to Tokyo to escort him back to
Reykjavik.
</P>
<P>
Monday's vote appears to be a resolution -- of sorts --
to the curious legal limbo that Fischer fell into in
1992, when, the U.S. government says, he violated economic sanctions
against the former Yugoslavia by accepting a $3.3 million fee
to play an exhibition match there that year.
</P>
<P>
After that, the always reclusive, progressively more eccentric Fischer dropped out
of sight, living in Budapest and, possibly, the Philippines and
Switzerland. Now and then he emerged on radio stations in
Iceland, Hungary and the Philippines to rant, in increasingly belligerent
terms, against the United States and against Jews.
</P>
<P>
He surfaced in earnest in July 2004, when he attempted to
board a plane from Japan to Manila and was seized
by the Japanese authorities. He was accused of trying to
leave the country without a valid passport. Since then he
has been held in prison while various governments, as well
as a staunch group of supporters from the chess world,
have tried to find a resolution to what has proved
a vexing and delicate jurisdictional issue.
</P>
<P>
But while the United States -- which is also investigating the
possibility of charging him with tax evasion -- regards Fischer
as a fugitive from justice, in Iceland he is seen
as a national hero. It was in Reykjavik in 1972
that he defeated the Russian world champion, Boris Spassky, in
an electrifying Cold War chess contest that pitted east against
west.
</P>
<P>
Just as the African-American track star Jesse Owens' triumph over Hitler's
Aryan athletes did at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Fischer's victory
in Iceland seemed to symbolize nothing less than the triumph
of one way of life over another -- in this
case, democracy over Communism.
</P>
<P>
It is partly for that reason, said Bjarni Benediktsson, chairman of
the parliamentary committee, who last week recommended that Fischer be
granted Icelandic citizenship, that the full parliament voted in favor
of his request on Monday. Iceland had already agreed to
issue a resident's permit and special passport to Fischer, but
these alone did not prove enough for the Japanese authorities.
</P>
<P>
Fischer's supporters said they had received assurances from Japan that, with
full Icelandic citizenship and passport, he would be free to
leave the country.
</P>
<P>
"It was very clear from the outset that he had a
great influence here," Benediktsson said of Fischer, speaking by telephone
from Reykjavik. "A new generation of international chess players was
born here in Iceland after the world championship match in
Reykjavik, and it was very clear from the outset of
this matter that the authorities in Iceland have very warm
feelings toward this memory."
</P>
<P>
Benediktsson emphasized that the granting of citizenship was considered only as
a last resort, "after the applicant had exhausted all other
possibilities" of gaining freedom. He also said that Fischer's "personal
opinions on social issues" had not entered into his government's
decision.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Einarsson played down the significance of Fischer's
reputation for misanthropy and his habit of making incendiary public
remarks.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows his views, and he doesn't need to repeat them
again," Einarsson said. "He's like Rembrandt or Mozart, one of
these very big people, so his personality is beside the
point."
</P>
<P>
Einarsson said that Fischer was likely to make Iceland his home,
at least for the time being. "I think he will
stay in Iceland a lot, at least for the coming
months, and then he will travel freely around the world
-- although I don't expect he will be going to
America."
