Lawmakers in Iceland are likely to grant citizenship to mercurial chess genius
Bobby Fischer, a member of a parliamentary committee studying the issue said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Gudrun Ogmundsdottir told The Associated Press that a citizenship
motion would probably be approved by the nine-member committee on Thursday. If
it passes, it will go before Iceland's 63-member parliament, the
Althingi.
</P>
<P>
"I think that parliament may approve of the citizenship as early as tomorrow,"
said Ogmundsdottir, a member of the opposition Alliance Party.
</P>
<P>
"Somebody would then go over to Japan with the passport, which would enable him
to travel here or anywhere in the world," she added.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, 62, is in a Japanese detention cell awaiting deportation to the United
States, where he is wanted for violating economic sanctions against the former
Yugoslavia by playing a highly publicized chess match there in
1992.
</P>
<P>
Mizuho Fukushima, leader of Japan's opposition Social Democratic Party, said
senior immigration officials told her that Fischer would be allowed to go to
Iceland if he is given citizenship there.
</P>
<P>
There is widespread support for Fischer in Iceland, where he played the Soviet
Union's Boris Spassky in a world championship match in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Iceland's parliament voted last month against granting Fischer citizenship,
offering him a special foreigners' passport and residence permit instead. But
Japanese officials have so far declined to release Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Several Icelandic politicians indicated Wednesday that parliament was now likely
to grant Fischer citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"I can't speak for the whole party, but think few if any members of Parliament
are opposed to granting Fischer citizenship," said Drifa Hjartardottir, a
lawmaker with the Independence Party, which governs as part of Iceland's
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
"We will not stand in the way of Fischer getting citizenship and want this issue
to be resolved as quickly as possible," said Ogmundur Jonasson, a lawmaker with
the Left-Green opposition party. "The worst thing we can do, both for Iceland
and for Fischer, is to wait any longer."
</P>
<P>
Since being taken into custody in July for allegedly trying to leave Japan on a
revoked U.S. passport, Fischer has lived up to his reputation for
unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
He has repeatedly denounced the U.S. deportation order as politically motivated,
demanded refugee status, unilaterally renounced his U.S. citizenship and said he
wants to become a German national instead. He has also applied to marry a
Japanese woman who heads this country's chess association and is his longtime
companion.
</P>
<P>
Einar S. Einarsson, the former CEO of Visa Iceland who is one of Fischer's most
fervent supporters, said he was optimistic.
</P>
<P>
"We're meeting them at 9:40 tomorrow and we want them to take the final step,"
he said. "It's been like a chess game and there's only one move left before
checkmate."
