ICELAND GRANTING CITIZENSHIP TO FISCHER, HELD IN JAPAN

Iceland's Parliament voted Monday to grant Icelandic citizenship to
the American chess star Bobby Fischer, laying the groundwork, his
supporters said, for his release from the Japanese prison where
he has been held since last summer.
</P>
<P>
"We are most happy," said Einar Einarsson, a spokesman for a
committee that has been trying to free Fischer from Japan,
where he is being detained while he fights deportation to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Einarsson, who called Fischer "part of our modern saga and part
of our recent history," said Fischer, the 62-year-old chess champion,
might be released "in only a few days" and that
an Icelandic delegation planned to travel to Tokyo to escort
him back to Reykjavik.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department had no comment on the case,
although a spokesman noted that renunciation of American citizenship did
not allow citizens to escape prosecution of crimes in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Monday's vote appears to be a resolution of sorts to the
curious legal limbo that Fischer fell into in 1992 when,
the United States says, he violated economic sanctions against Yugoslavia
by accepting a $3.3 million fee to play an exhibition
match there. After that, the always reclusive, progressively more difficult
Fischer dropped out of sight, living in Budapest -- and
possibly the Philippines and Switzerland -- and emerging now and
then on radio stations in Iceland, Hungary and the Philippines
to rant in increasingly belligerent terms against the United States
and against Jews.
</P>
<P>
This latest episode began in July 2004, when he tried to
board a plane from Japan to Manila and was seized
by the Japanese authorities and accused of trying to leave
the country on an invalid passport. He has been held
in prison since then while the various governments, as well
as a staunch group of supporters in the chess world,
have tried to find some resolution to what has been
a vexing and delicate jurisdictional issue.
</P>
<P>
But while the United States -- which is also investigating the
possibility of charging him with tax evasion -- regards Fischer
as a fugitive from justice, in Iceland he is seen
as a national hero. It was in Reykjavik in 1972
that he defeated the Russian world champion, Boris Spassky, in
an electrifying Cold War chess contest that pitted East against
West. As much as the African-American track star Jesse Owens'
defeat of Hitler's Aryan athletes did at the 1936 Berlin
Olympics, Fischer's victory in Iceland seemed to symbolize nothing less
than the triumph of one way of life over another
-- in this case, democracy over communism.
</P>
<P>
It is partly for that reason, said Bjarni Benediktsson, chairman of
the parliamentary committee that recommended last week that Fischer be
granted Icelandic citizenship, that Parliament voted in favor of his
request on Monday. Iceland had already agreed to issue a
resident's permit and special passport to Fischer, but that had
not proved enough for the Japanese authorities.
</P>
<P>
His supporters said they had received assurances from Japan that with
full Icelandic citizenship and passport, Fischer would be free to
leave the country.
</P>
<P>
"It was very clear from the outset that he had a
great influence here," Benediktsson said of Fischer, speaking by telephone
from Reykjavik. "A new generation of international chess players was
born here in Iceland after the world championship match in
Reykjavik, and it was very clear from the outset of
this matter that the authorities in Iceland have very warm
feelings toward this memory."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the granting of citizenship was considered only as
a last resort, "after the applicant had exhausted all other
possibilities" of gaining freedom. He also said Fischer's "personal opinions
on social issues" had not been a factor.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the Committee to Free Bobby Fischer praised the Icelandic
Parliament, saying it had "made history by standing up to
the earth's sole superpower."
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic battle pitting the world's sole superpower-bully against
one lone man who had the courage to fight for
his own freedom to think and speak as he chooses,"
John Bosnitch, chairman of the group, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Einarsson played down the significance of Fischer's
reputation for misanthropy and his habit of making incendiary public
remarks. "Everyone knows his views, and he doesn't need to
repeat them again," he said. "He's like Rembrandt or Mozart
-- one of these very big people -- so his
personality is beside the point."
</P>
<P>
He said Fischer was likely to make Iceland his home, at
least for the time being. "I think he will stay
in Iceland a lot, at least for the coming months,
and then he will travel feely around the world --
although I don't expect he will be going to America."
