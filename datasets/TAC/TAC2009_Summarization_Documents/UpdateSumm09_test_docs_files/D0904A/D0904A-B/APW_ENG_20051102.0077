<P>
Former Ku Kux Klan leader and presidential candidate David Duke said he was
"shocked" that Swedish authorities are investigating whether he violated racism
laws in a speech that he says simply promoted "a lot of passion and love for
European heritage."
</P>
<P>
Duke _ chafing after Sweden's chief prosecutor ordered police to reopen a probe
of whether he made racist remarks during a February speech to a gathering of
what authorities said were neo-Nazis in southern Sweden _ said that the claims
were an attack on his freedom of expression. Duke said that if he was charged,
he would "come back and challenge this."
</P>
<P>
Duke denied that there was anything inflammatory about the speech, telling The
Associated Press in a telephone interview Tuesday night that "there was nothing
hateful about it. ... It condemns violence in any way."
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely a speech with a lot of passion and love for European heritage,
in particular the heritage of the people of Sweden, which is under threat from
massive non-European immigration," Duke said, speaking from Kiev, Ukraine, where
he is teaching history and international relations at the private Interregional
Academy of Personnel Management, known by its Ukrainian acronym,
MAUP.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary complaint against the former Louisiana state representative,
filed by a Swedish man, had been dropped because he lives in the United States.
But chief prosecutor Sven-Erik Alhem said he ordered the case reopened because
"if he has committed a crime, it would be wrong to let him go
free."
</P>
<P>
Alhem said police would look into whether Duke can be tried for "agitation
against an ethnic group," a crime punishable in Sweden by up to four years in
prison. It was unclear if Sweden would seek his extradition.
</P>
<P>
Duke, who visited Sweden several times in 2004 and this year, contested the
allegations, saying that the accusations against him are tantamount to "an
attack on the human and civil rights of the Swedish people. It hits at the
freedom of speech at its core."
</P>
<P>
Duke, whose vocal opposition to immigration and his pointed remarks about Jews
and other ethnic and religious groups have earned him a reputation as a white
supremacist, said that as "an American, I'm shocked that Sweden apparently has
laws against freedom of speech."
</P>
<P>
"They're saying it's somehow an agitation against Jews," said Duke. "What is
does is expose the racist position of extremist Jews, what I call Jewish
supremacists who support the apartheid state of Israel."
</P>
<P>
But he said he believes that once officials take a closer look at the speech, no
charges will be filed. Still, he said, he would not back away from a
fight.
</P>
<P>
"If they chose to charge me, and they want to make an international issue of the
oppression of free speech in Sweden, I will come back and challenge this," said
Duke. "I will not run away from this. ... It's about the right of the Swedish
people to hear a different view."
</P>
<P>
Duke rose to prominence in the United States after winning a state House seat in
suburban New Orleans in 1989, despite his past as a Klan leader and avowed
neo-Nazi.
</P>
<P>
Distancing himself from overtly racist views, he made the runoff for governor in
1991, alarming anti-racist organizations and drawing worldwide media attention
to Louisiana. He was soundly beaten in the runoff by Edwin Edwards, made a poor
showing in 1992 presidential primaries and failed to make the runoff in a later
race for Congress.
</P>
<P>
In 2002, Duke pleaded guilty to bilking his supporters and cheating on his
taxes, and spent a year in federal prison, but later denied any
wrongdoing.
