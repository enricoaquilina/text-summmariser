Cox News Service WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Sept. 11, 2001,
spawned great frustration and hatred against the perpetrators of those
devastating attacks, as well as against ethnic and religious groups
that many were already in the habit of hating. For
instance, there is a widespread rumor that no Jewish people
died in the World Trade Center, because they were the
cause of its destruction after warning other Jews not to
go to work there that day.

rumor as well as looking at the roots and manifestations of
anti-Semitism in an ambling, but often eye-opening documentary, "The Protocols
of Zion." He takes to the streets of New York
and has no difficulty finding people of a variety of
backgrounds who calmly express their prejudices against Jews. Sure there
are proud white supremacists who believe the Holocaust is a
myth, but the virulence that Levin finds goes far beyond
extremists to seemingly average folk.

The film's title refers to a 19th-century Eastern European pamphlet that
spells out the Jewish plan to take over the world,
another source of the systematic hatred. Understandably, perhaps, it was
a favorite tract of Adolf Hitler's, who had his own
strategy for global domination. Those who insist another Holocaust against
the Jewish people could never happen should spend an hour
and a half with "The Protocols of Zion," a chilling,
though not surprising look at the world and one man's
journey trying to get in touch with his much-maligned ethnic
background.

<P>
The verdict: A candid look at current manifestations of anti-Semitism in
America, all too openly expressed and acknowledged.
