<P>
A security guard arrested after police investigating race riots found weapons in
his Sydney home appeared in court Tuesday, where a prosecutor said he had links
to white supremacists.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Sanders, 25, was arrested Monday after police found an unlicensed pistol,
smoke grenades and pepper spray in a raid on his home.
</P>
<P>
He also had been held Sunday night along with four other youths, after police
allegedly found petrol and other materials for making fuel bombs in his
car.
</P>
<P>
During Sanders' appearance at Penrith Local Court in western Sydney, police
prosecutor Jonathan Falzon said the security guard had logged onto a white
supremacist Web site.
</P>
<P>
Falzon also said that when police stopped the car Falzon was riding in Sunday
night, they found a two-way radio tuned to a channel being used by a white
supremacist group called Fightback to update supporters on a protest in the
aftermath of a race riot a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
Sanders has been charged with five counts of possessing a prohibited weapon, an
unauthorized pistol, and possessing a means of disguising his face with intent
to commit an indictable offense. He was not required to enter
pleas.
</P>
<P>
"It's apparent that there are racial motivations behind what transpired there at
Brighton," Falzon told the court.
</P>
<P>
He said a 25 liter (6.6 gallon) drum of petrol, gloves, a first aid kit, a
knife, utility belt, masks, police riot helmets and documentation relating to
the Fightback Web site were found in the car.
</P>
<P>
Magistrate Ian McRae refused to jail Sanders pending trial, instead releasing
him on conditional bail until his next court appearance on Jan.
27.
</P>
<P>
McRae said Sanders could only leave his Sydney home if accompanied by his
mother, ordered him to report daily to police and banned him from communicating
with the four men he was driving with on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Speaking outside court, Sanders' lawyer Phil Gibson commended McRae's
decision.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe (Sanders) is stupid, maybe he participates in some unusual recreational
activities, but does that put him in a position where he's locked up while these
charges are pending?" Gibson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Sanders was arrested a week after rioting by 5,000 white youths erupted in the
beachside suburb of Cronulla following a gathering to protest the beating a week
earlier of two volunteer lifeguards by a gang of men witnesses described as of
Lebanese descent.
</P>
<P>
The riot sparked two nights of retaliatory attacks by carloads of youths of
Middle Eastern appearance, shocking this city of 4 million that had prided
itself on being a successful multiracial melting pot.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of police patrolling the suburbs since the riots have prevented a
repeat of the violence and senior officers have declared it safe for people to
return to the beaches after urging them to stay home last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, New South Wales political leader Morris Iemma said police would
prosecute anybody found to have been involved in race hate messages linked to
the rioting that reportedly are circulating on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The postings include videos of race-based beatings and carry slogans such as
"Not White, not welcome in Cronulla."
</P>
<P>
"Where they (the makers) break the law the law will be enforced and they will be
brought to justice," Iemma said.
