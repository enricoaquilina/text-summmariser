REPORT: 1898 RIOT WAS PLANNED INSURRECTION

RALEIGH, N.C.

<P>
The 1898 riot and coup d'etat in Wilmington,
N.C., that killed an unknown number of black residents actually
was a planned insurrection that white supremacists spent months organizing.
</P>
<P>
The violence was part of a statewide effort -- with a
pivotal role played by The News &amp; Observer and other
newspapers -- to put white supremacist Democrats in office and
stem the political advances of black citizens, according to a
draft report released Thursday by the state-appointed 1898 Wilmington Race
Riot Commission.
</P>
<P>
The incident is the only known violent overthrow of a government
in U.S. history. Afterward, white supremacists in state office passed
the laws that would disfranchise a race of people for
generations -- until the civil rights movement and Voting Rights
Act of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, it crippled a segment of our population that hasn't recovered
in 107 years," said Harper Peterson, former mayor of Wilmington
and a member of the commission. "It's a major event
that went unnoticed."
</P>
<P>
Now, with history fully told, members of the riot commission will
turn toward action, perhaps asserting that there must be some
atonement.
</P>
<P>
"We want to engage people to come up with creative ways
to respond to 106 years of degradation," Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
To make amends, some commission members have suggested financing historical exhibitions
about the riot and its fallout, portraying the Wilmington riot
in school history texts, and developing economic interests in affected
areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, "some apology by the state for its inaction" is
also called for, said Irving Joyner, vice chairman of the
commission and a law professor at N.C. Central University.
</P>
<P>
The commission has been ordered to make recommendations to the legislature
by May 2006. Whatever calls for action the commission advocates
will likely be hotly debated.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to let the cat out of the bag
in terms of proposals," Peterson said. "But they're going to
be very specific."
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly established the commission in 2000 in response to
a push from two Wilmington legislators. The report is now
open for public comment, and Joyner said he wants to
hear suggestions about how the community should respond.
</P>
<P>
In its 450-page report, the Wilmington Race Riot Commission describes the
riot and accompanying coup d'etat as a watershed moment in
North Carolina history.
</P>
<P>
"Because Wilmington rioters were able to murder blacks in daylight and
overthrow Republican government without penalty or federal intervention, everyone in
the state, regardless of race, knew that the white supremacy
campaign was victorious on all fronts," the report says.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
In 1898, African-American men in North Carolina had been able to
vote for some three decades as part of Reconstruction after
the Civil War, said Jeffrey Crow, deputy secretary of the
N.C. Office of Archives and History, which researched the report.
</P>
<P>
Blacks voted in blocs for the Republican party -- the party
of Abraham Lincoln -- and the GOP had formed a
coalition state government in Raleigh with the Populist party.
</P>
<P>
In Wilmington, the state's largest city at the time, blacks outnumbered
whites and were a force in the Republican city leadership.
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders, including Josephus Daniels, editor of The News &amp; Observer,
were outraged. They developed a campaign to install white supremacist
leaders in the General Assembly and U.S. Congress during the
1898 elections.
</P>
<P>
"It's really kind of scary how organized it was," said LeRae
Umfleet, a historian with the state Office of Archives and
History who authored the report. "Every finger of the Democratic
party just reached into every aspect of economic, social and
political life at the time."
</P>
<P>
In The N&amp;O, for example, Daniels published stories about community crime
and graft among elected officials in Wilmington. He hired a
cartoonist to pen racist images of "Negro Rule," showing white
men as victims and white women desperate for help.
</P>
<P>
One cartoon, for example, showed a white woman surrounded by black
men at the post office. It was drawn in response
to the hiring of African-Americans at the postal service and
argued that white women now were afraid to call for
their mail.
</P>
<P>
Other papers, including the Charlotte Observer, the Wilmington Star and the
Wilmington News, also spread racially divisive propaganda.
</P>
<P>
For months in 1898, white men calling themselves the "Red Shirts"
had been riding through the state's southeastern counties, wielding rifles
and terrorizing residents.
</P>
<P>
In Wilmington, Democrats fueled an insurrection. They stuffed ballot boxes and
threatened black men, but there was no widespread violence on
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
Then on Nov. 10, violence broke out when a mob of
nearly a thousand white men marched to a black-owned newspaper
and set it afire. The editor, Alex Manly, had written
an editorial months before suggesting that white women may enjoy
the company of black men.
</P>
<P>
Across the street, children at a black school saw the flames
and went running scared. Mothers, hearing the commotion, scrambled for
their children. Residents ran to the nearby warehouse district to
warn the African-American men working there.
</P>
<P>
African-Americans fled the city as the newspaper building burned, with families
hiding in swamps and cemeteries for days with no more
than the clothing on their backs, Umfleet said.
</P>
<P>
The white mob overthrew the democratically elected city council, whose members
weren't supposed to be up for election for months. All
black city workers were fired. Leading black figures were forced
out of town.
</P>
<P>
Many of the histories in the past century, including an autobiography
by Daniels, offered rationalizations for the riot, saying white leaders
felt pushed into violence by Manly's editorial, Umfleet said. The
new report challenges those accounts.
</P>
<P>
Within a year of the insurrection, the new, Democratic-controlled General Assembly
had passed the first Jim Crow law cutting off voting
rights to blacks.
</P>
<P>
"It took the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act
to get those rights restored," Jeffrey Crow said. And today,
he added, every time the Voting Rights Act comes up
for renewal in Congress, it's argued.
</P>
<P>
"More than a hundred years later, we're still trying to resolve
the issues," Crow said. "It's extremely important that people understand
history."
