A heavy weekend police presence at beaches in southern Sydney prevented a repeat
of racial violence that rocked this city a week ago and headed off "potential
disasters," a senior officer said Monday.

"We feel that the police have been involved to the point where we have stopped
potential disasters from happening in and around our beachside suburbs, so we
are confident we averted potentially major tragedies," New South Wales state
Assistant Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione told television's Nine
Network.

About 2,000 police took part in a major operation to maintain public order,
stopping, checking and sometimes confiscating cars. Police also confiscated
several weapons and arrested a group of five men they said were suspected white
supremacists who had a large drum of gasoline in their car along with helmets
and police radio scanners.
