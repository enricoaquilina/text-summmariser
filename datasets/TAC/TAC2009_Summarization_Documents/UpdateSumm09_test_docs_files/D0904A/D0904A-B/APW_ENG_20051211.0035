Members of a neo-Nazi group staged a rally at City Hall on Saturday, two months
after plans for an earlier march set off a four-hour riot in which a mob
attacked businesses and police.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of officers stood guard to make sure there was no repeat of the October
melee as about 60 white supremacists shouted at counterdemonstrators and held
placards, including one reading: "White race, stand up and take back your
neighborhood."
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 others showed up in the freezing weather to protest against the
members of the National Socialist Movement.
</P>
<P>
The counterdemonstrators, chanting slogans and carrying signs reading "Go home
Nazis" and "Stop the hate now," were kept behind barricades about 75 yards
(meters) from the area where the neo-Nazis were cordoned off.
</P>
<P>
After speaking for an hour, the neo-Nazis left in a caravan of cars, escorted by
several police cruisers. Authorities reported only minor arrests and no
violence.
</P>
<P>
In October, the neo-Nazis gathered for a march they said was intended to protest
gangs and rising crime in a Toledo neighborhood. That plan set off a riot in
which businesses were burned and looted and bricks were thrown at
police.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Police Chief Mike Navarre said about 700 officers from across
northern Ohio were stationed through the downtown area. He said gang leaders and
community activists had offered assurances that counterdemonstrations would be
peaceful as long as the neo-Nazis were kept out of predominantly black
neighborhoods _ a key factor in October's disturbance.
</P>
<P>
Police made 29 arrests, all for misdemeanor offenses that included disorderly
conduct, inciting violence and carrying a concealed weapon. There were no
injuries or property damage, Navarre said.
</P>
<P>
A judge granted the city's request Friday to block the neo-Nazi group and
counterdemonstrators from rallying beyond the grounds of the downtown government
building.
</P>
<P>
That kept the group about two miles (three kilometers) from the neighborhood
where the rioting broke out in October. Twelve officers were injured and 114
people had been arrested after the earlier rally.
