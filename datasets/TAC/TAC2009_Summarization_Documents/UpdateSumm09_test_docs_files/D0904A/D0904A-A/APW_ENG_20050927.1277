White U.S. lawmaker compares black lawmakers in Tennessee to KKK

A white Republican lawmaker who contends he was excluded from a Black
legislative group solely because of his race said Tuesday that the group is even
more racist than the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that the KKK doesn't even ban members by race," Rep. Stacey
Campfield, a lawmaker from Knoxville, told The Associated Press, adding that the
KKK "has less racist bylaws" than the black lawmakers' group.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Campfield was promptly rebuffed when he inquired about
joining the Black Caucus. He had earlier said he wanted to join the group to
find out how it spends its money.
</P>
<P>
There are 18 black state lawmakers in Tennessee and Campfield's request was
deemed to have been made from a "strange guy" who was simply interested in
stirring up trouble.
</P>
<P>
"I definitely think they should allow white people in as members," Campfield
said. "If we work together we might be able to pull things off and get things
done."
</P>
<P>
Tennessee Black Caucus member Rep. Larry Miller, a Democrat, said no white
lawmaker has ever asked to join. He acknowledged the group's bylaws mention only
black lawmakers but said it might consider admitting a white lawmaker _ not
necessarily Campfield who is "using this as a joke."
</P>
<P>
Campfield posted a message on his Web journal, or blog, last week about his
unsuccessful attempt to join the black lawmakers' group.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, under the heading "I too dream," Campfield posted long excerpts
from the Rev. Martin Luther King's famous 1963 "I Have a Dream" speech in which
King dreams of a day when his children "will not be judged by the color of their
skin but by the content of their character."
</P>
<P>
This use of King's speech infuriated some readers, and Campfield announced
Monday that he was banning reader comments on his blog after some of the
postings included death threats.
</P>
<P>
"People just started going crazy about it," Campfield said.
</P>
<P>
Experts on race and hate groups said Campfield hit a nerve when he used King's
words to take on a black institution. It's the same tactic white separatists
often use, said Mark Potok, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern
Poverty Law Center.
</P>
<P>
"Very typically these days we see white supremacists, hate groups, trying to use
the words of King and other civil rights leaders to try to advance their
agendas," Potok said.
</P>
<P>
On his blog, 37-year-old Campfield has also derided gay adoption and
abortion.
</P>
<P>
Although Campfield said he still believes the blog is a good idea, it will now
carry only his posts, along with a little biographical information _ such as his
interests in judo and karate, and a listing of the Bible as his favorite
book.
