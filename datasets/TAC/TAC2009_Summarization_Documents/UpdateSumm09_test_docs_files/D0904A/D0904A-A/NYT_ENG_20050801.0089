ONLINE SITE OFFERS CLOTHING FOR WHITE SUPREMACISTS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a small industrial park west of Keller, Texas, near sprawling
neighborhoods and new schools, a storage facility routinely receives shipments
of merchandise geared toward a certain clientele -- white supremacists
and anti-Semites.
</P>
<P>
An FBI joint task force knows about the place and the
people who operate it.
</P>
<P>
So do the Tarrant County Sheriff's Department and a national watchdog
group that monitors hate groups nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Aryan Wear, an online clothing, music and book outlet that opposes
Jews and promotes white supremacy, keeps much of its merchandise
in the storage stall near Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
Incorporated by Fort Worth man, Aryan Wear is one of 10
hate and racially intolerant operations in Dallas-Fort Worth, according to
the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is based in Montgomery,
Ala., and tracks extremist groups.
</P>
<P>
While most such groups' members are open about their views, the
operators of Aryan Wear remain for the most part anonymous,
letting their online sales pitches spread their message.
</P>
<P>
"You don't really have my permission to use my name in
your article pertaining to this. I think this pretty much
seals the deal," said a phone message left at the
Fort Worth Star-Telegram by Tony Eynon, who is named as
Aryan Wear's president and lone director in corporate records filed
with the Texas secretary of state's office in Austin.
</P>
<P>
A pilot who was until recently licensed to fly Boeing 737s
commercially, Eynon, 30, declined to be interviewed, saying in his
phone message that he had recently sold Aryan Wear and
that "there's just the finalization of paperwork right now."
</P>
<P>
He lives with his wife and young child in a well-established
neighborhood -- down the street from a black family and
a Hispanic family -- in a home no different from
any other on the block until, neighbors say, the garage
door rises, revealing a large Confederate flag on the wall.
</P>
<P>
Joe Roy, chief researcher for the law center's magazine, the Intelligence
Report, called Aryan Wear a "hate-for-profit" business, a kind of
one-stop shopping for the fashion needs of white supremacists."
</P>
<P>
The Web site's merchandise includes a T-shirt that declares, "Deport Pedro,"
another with a picture of Adolf Hitler and the inscription
"I was right," and a third with a design similar
to a Tide detergent logo but altered to say, "Pride
... For a Whiter, Brighter Future!"
</P>
<P>
Aryan Wear's signature product, however, is a high-laced boot with swastikas
carved in the sole, allowing its wearer to leave an
impression of the Nazi symbol on soft ground.
</P>
<P>
"An outstanding product real skinheads can be proud to be associated
with," one wearer said in a review on the Aryan
Wear Web site. The reviewed called the boots "Too White
...!"
</P>
<P>
Roy said the boots were created by Eynon's friend Christopher Evans,
who was connected with the violence-prone Confederate Hammerskins in Dallas
and now lives in the Fort Worth area.
</P>
<P>
Evans could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
Initially, Roy said, the boots were sold to make money for
the National Alliance. But the once-powerful neo-Nazi organization is now
in turmoil, with declining membership, since the death of its
longtime leader, William Pierce, in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Roy said the boots were the alliance's biggest moneymaker until August
2003 when Eynon formed Aryan Wear as a Texas company
and began selling the boots exclusively.
</P>
<P>
A man identifying himself as Jim Reid, who lives near Austin,
said in a recent telephone interview that Eynon is no
longer associated with Aryan Wear and that he is the
new president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
There are three "primary" owners, in Houston, Florida and New Jersey,
and the new owners want to remain "silent partners," Reid
said.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the business promotes hatred or that its products
-- including the "Happy Hitler Baby Doll" T-shirt -- are
overly radical.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't have anything to do with hate," Reid said. "We
want to basically present a positive image to the youth
and the public in general."
</P>
<P>
Local officials are not impressed.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad that authorities are aware of this operation and are
keeping an eye on it," said Roy Brooks, a leader
in the local African-American community and a member of the
Tarrant County Commissioners Court.
</P>
<P>
"We can't legislate good taste or human compassion. I wish we
could," Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
Lori Bailey, a spokeswoman for the FBI in North Texas, said
federal authorities are "keenly aware" of Aryan Wear because of
its apparent association with the sometimes violent skinhead movement. Bailey
said, however, that the FBI can do little because the
business is not breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson agreed that he saw nothing illegal
in Aryan Wear's business tactics. Still, Anderson said, "they are
clearly tied to the white supremacist movement, if you look
at the types of merchandise they're offering. ...
</P>
<P>
"I think anytime anybody deals in that type of activity, it's
a concern for law enforcement," Anderson said. "It certainly bears
watching." Fort Worth Star-Telegram researcher Cathy Belcher contributed to this
report. Jack Douglas Jr. (817) 390-7700 jld@star-telegram.com
