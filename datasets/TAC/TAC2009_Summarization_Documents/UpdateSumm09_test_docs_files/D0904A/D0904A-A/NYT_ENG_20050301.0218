HATE GROUP SUSPECTED IN DEATHS IN JUDGE'S FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Joan Humphrey Lefkow, the nightmare began shortly after
her 2000 appointment as a federal judge, when an Oregon
group's lawsuit to block white supremacists from using a name
it had trademarked, World Church of the Creator, landed in
her lap.
</P>
<P>
Soon, Lefkow found her home address and family photographs posted along
with violent threats on hate-filled Websites, and last April, one
of the Aryan movement's most notorious leaders was convicted of
plotting her murder.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Lefkow sat sequestered under armed federal guard in an
undisclosed location, mourning her husband of 30 years and her
89-year-old mother, whom she found dead of gunshots to the
head in their basement the day before, sending her screaming
into the quiet street.
</P>
<P>
"I think she's very upset with herself, maybe, for being a
judge and putting her family in this danger," said Laura
Lefkow, 20, the third of the judge's five daughters, "but
there's no way she should have known."
</P>
<P>
Local and federal law enforcement officials said on Tuesday that they
were investigating possible connections between the double murder and Matthew
Hale, the white supremacist currently in federal prison for soliciting
Lefkow's assassination, or his many sympathizers. Federal officials in Washington
said agents were scrubbing Lefkow's entire caseload in search of
suspects, with the main thrust on the hate groups that
had targeted her before.
</P>
<P>
Already, some white supremacists were celebrating the killings on the Internet,
while others spun conspiracy theories that the crime was committed
by Hale's enemies to poison the atmosphere before his sentencing
next month. Experts who have spent years tracking Hale's organization
-- now called Creativity -- also pointed to the upcoming
sentencing, noting that one of his acolytes, Benjamin Smith, went
on a shooting spree in 1999 after Hale was rejected
by the Illinois bar.
</P>
<P>
"We saw what happened the last time Matt Hale got slapped
in the face by the system: The price of that
was two dead and nine severely wounded," said Mark Potok,
director of intelligence for the Southern Poverty Law Center. "Now
Matt Hale is about to be sentenced, very probably, to
most of his natural life to federal prison. It's very
possible that a Hale follower or sympathizer has decided to
fight back."
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Billy Roper, a friend of Hale's who is chairman of a
group called White Revolution, disavowed the violence but offered a
different parallel: the FBI's 1992 confrontation in Ruby Ridge, Idaho,
with the white separatist Randall C. Weaver, whose wife and
14-year-old son wound up dead.
</P>
<P>
"We can stand alongside the federal law enforcement community in saying
just as they felt a deep regret and sadness over
the death of Randy Weaver's family so we also feel
a deep sense of regret and sadness over the death
of Judge Lefkow's family," Roper said. "If it was the
case that someone was misguided and thought that they were
helping Matt Hale, then it would be similar in that
other people had suffered for one person's mistake."
</P>
<P>
Hale, who is representing himself, faces up to 40 years in
prison, and has been held for two years in the
Metropolitan Correctional Center here under special administrative measures, reserved for
terrorists, that limited contact with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials refused to discuss the restrictions, but his mother, Evelyn
Hutcheson, said that she and his father are the only
people he is allowed contact with, and that they are
limited to 15-minute phone calls each Thursday morning, and separate
hourlong visits twice a month.
</P>
<P>
"He had nothing to do with what went on last night,"
Hutcheson said in a telephone interview from her home in
East Peoria, Ill. "My son is sitting in a hole
where he's not allowed to even speak loud enough to
be audible.
</P>
<P>
"Common sense would tell you, if he were into having somebody
kill somebody -- which he is not -- would he
have somebody go kill the judge's family just before he's
sentenced?" she added. "Somebody has done this to make him
get an enhanced sentence."
</P>
<P>
The authorities cautioned that it is too soon to focus on
any one theory of the crime, though they did not
offer other possible scenarios or motives. Casings from .22-caliber bullets
were found at the scene, and the medical examiner cited
the cause of death as multiple gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
James Molloy, the Chicago Police Department's chief of detectives, said the
murders happened between 10:30 a.m., when Lefkow's mother answered a
telephone call from one of her granddaughters, and 5:30 p.m.
when the judge returned home. At 4 p.m., the Lefkows'
youngest daughter, Margaret, 16, came home to get her gym
bag and left without seeing anyone in the house, Molloy
said.
</P>
<P>
"There is much speculation about possible links between this crime and
the possible involvement of hate groups," he said at a
news conference. "This is but one facet of our investigation.
We are looking in many, many directions."
</P>
<P>
Hiram Grau, the department's deputy superintendent, said: "The questions you have
are the same ones we have and we are working
around the clock to get them answered."
</P>
<P>
Shannon Metzger, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshal's service, said that
Lefkow had a special protective detail for "a couple of
weeks" last year, but it was disbanded when the threats
against her were deemed "not viable." Molloy said the Chicago
police also had stopped its practice of sending cars to
her home for additional patrols, and Lefkow, her daughter, said
the authorities had long ago removed the security cameras it
had installed in their home.
</P>
<P>
"I guess because the FBI felt it seemed like there was
no danger," said Laura Lefkow, a sophomore at Pomona College
in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
But on Monday night, federal marshals met Laura Lefkow's plane from
Los Angeles, and they stood guard on Tuesday as the
family planned Saturday funerals for Michael F. Lefkow, 64, an
attorney who was a leader in the Episcopal church, and
Donna Humphrey, 89, an ailing grandmother who hand-stitched quilts for
each of her 23 descendants.
</P>
<P>
Michael Lefkow, who ran unsuccessfully for Cook County judge in 2002
and 2004, argued two cases before the U.S. Supreme Court
and worked for the Legal Aid Society and the U.S.
Postal Service before starting a solo firm about 20 years
ago. He spent every Sunday at St. Luke's in Evanston,
flirting with the elderly women in the pews, and since
1992 had been a lay member of the governing committee
of the Chicago Diocese of the Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
A flamenco dancer and tennis player, Lefkow met his future wife
in the library of Wheaton College, where she was an
undergraduate. "She was doing a paper on Indonesia and he
was doing a paper on Indonesia, and she had all
his books," Laura Lefkow recalled of her parents' first encounter.
"Then he asked her out for a beer, and she
said maybe coffee."
</P>
<P>
Lefkow said that her father, a former cab driver, bus driver
and substitute teacher, sought out the local courthouse, post office
and Episcopal church wherever he went, because he saw them
as the "pillars of society."
</P>
<P>
"He used to say he was rich in daughters and not
much else," she laughed. "He was just an optimist about
everything, to the point where it was like, 'Oh my
gosh, dad, come on,' and he would be like, 'It'll
be fine,' and it was. It was always fine."
</P>
<P>
Laura's grandmother, Humphrey, who lived in a tan townhouse in Denver,
had been staying with the judge's family since before Christmas
as she recovered from a kidney infection. Neighbors in Denver
said she played Solitaire and Scrabble on a computer and
frequently cooked big meals for friends.
</P>
<P>
Joan Lefkow, a magistrate judge since 1982, was appointed to the
U.S. District Court by President Clinton, and originally ruled in
favor of Hale, dismissing the trademark case, in 2002. But
after an appeals court reversed her decision, Lefkow had little
choice but to order Hale to remove the World Church
name from his Web sites and printed material or face
fines of $1,000 per day.
</P>
<P>
She was immediately vilified -- Hal Turner, an underground radio personality,
said on his show that she was "worthy of being
killed," adding that "it wouldn't be legal but in my
opinion it wouldn't be wrong." Hale, who called himself Pontifex
Maximus of the church that at one point claimed 30,000
members, was arrested in January 2003, after an FBI informant
infiltrated the church to become his security chief.
</P>
<P>
The informant, Anthony Evola, provided an e-mail message in which Hale
sought Lefkow's home address, and a tape recording of them
discussing her fate. "We gonna exterminate the rat?" Evola asked.
Hale said that he prefers to "fight within the law"
but "if you wish to, ah, do anything yourself, you
can, you know?" When Evola said, "Consider it done," Hale
responded, "Good."
</P>
<P>
Beth Sycamore, a publishing consultant who lives three houses away, said
the Lefkows strolled the neighborhood, holding hands, and took the
el train even amid the death threats. "She wasn't afraid,"
Sycamore said of the judge. "They just didn't want it
to affect their lives."
</P>
<P>
Potok, of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Hale's organization splintered
and foundered upon his arrest, shrinking from a high in
the 1990s of 88 chapters to just five in 2003,
but jumped to at least 16 chapters last year and
remains one of the nation's most violent groups. Sympathizers abound.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone associated with the Matt Hale trial has deserved assassination for
a long time," reads an Internet essay posted on Tuesday
by Bill White, editor of the Libertarian Socialist News. "I
don't feel bad that Judge Lefkow's family was murdered today.
In fact, when I heard the story, I laughed."
