TEMPERS, TEMPERATURES UP IN CRAWFORD

CRAWFORD, Texas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the promise of this weekend's mass demonstrations
have a few jittery, area law enforcement and activists are
planning to defuse confrontations that could turn a verbal showdown
into a physical brawl.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of peace and pro-Bush demonstrators are expected to pack Crawford
and the areas near President Bush's ranch house over the
weekend. However, the potential appearance of white supremacists and the
planned Sunday visit of activist and former presidential candidate Rev.
Al Sharpton should help foster the media circus that has
been growing on the Texas prairie near the Western White
House.
</P>
<P>
"Riots, like grass fire, start from the smallest little spark," said
Bill Johnson, who owns the Yellow Rose, a prominent gift
shop at Crawford's main intersection. "We need to prevent that
spark."
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who is organizing pro-Bush rallies for Saturday, is among the
event organizers who realize the perfect storm-in-the-making. High temperatures, ratcheted
rhetoric and crowds of people are sure to fuel tempers.
</P>
<P>
While there are no official crowd estimates, representatives for both camps
believe hundreds will mass in Crawford in support of the
president or Cindy Sheehan, the peace mom at the center
of demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan has vowed to keep vigil near the president's vacation home
until he agrees to meet with her to discuss bringing
an end to the Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Many sheriff's deputies have been alongside Sheehan since she began her
vigil on Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
The McLennan County Sheriff's Office, which has taken the lead in
providing security and running interference, believes the weekend should be
peaceful, as has been the last three weeks. Chief Deputy
Randy Plemons said they don't plan to change their standard
game plan, which has mostly worked.
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies have depended on some level of self-policing by holding
individual leaders responsible for groups of people. Those leaders, in
turn, keep others in check by keeping the anti-war and
pro-Bush sides separated and discouraging verbal sparring. When that's not
enough, lines of squad cars line up end-to-end to physically
block opposing demonstrators from one another.
</P>
<P>
So far, only two people have been arrested in connection with
disturbances at the peace camp protest site.
</P>
<P>
"I am more worried about the heat than I am about
anyone else out there," Plemons said, referring to triple-digit temperatures
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On the Internet, a forum posting from the Stormfront White Nationalist
Community urged white supremacists to come to Crawford this weekend
to speak out against the war. The posting claims that
the Iraq war bolsters Israel. The group is not only
racist, but is anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
A Sheehan spokesman said the white supremacists were not invited by
anyone connected with Cindy Sheehan. They would be asked to
leave if they set foot at Camp Casey II, which
is on private property, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Like many others in Crawford, Sheehan's supporters are hoping for a
peaceful weekend.
