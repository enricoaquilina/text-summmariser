<P>
A city council candidate dropped out of the race Friday after it was disclosed
that he posted comments to a white supremacist Internet bulletin board more than
4,000 times.
</P>
<P>
Doug Hanks said the postings were fictional and designed to win white
supremacists' trust as he researched a novel he was writing. He said the book
was also meant to appeal to white supremacists.
</P>
<P>
"I needed information for the book and some other writings I was doing," Hanks
told The Associated Press on Friday. "I did what I thought I needed to do to
establish myself as a credible white nationalist."
</P>
<P>
Hanks had filed papers seeking the Republican nomination for one of four
at-large council seats, but formally withdrew Friday, said county elections
director Michael Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
Hanks' postings over the past three years were first reported by The Rhinoceros
Times, a weekly newspaper. In one June 1 posting, he said blacks should be
treated like "rabid beasts."
</P>
<P>
Hanks said his self-published novel, called "Patriot Act," takes themes from
"The Turner Diaries" _ the racist novel believed to have inspired Oklahoma City
bomber Timothy McVeigh.
</P>
<P>
"I saw how successful these 'Turner Diaries' had been and that was the path to
take," he told the AP. White supremacists, he said, "have more of a tendency to
word of mouth, to say, 'Hey, you ought to pick this up.'"
</P>
<P>
Republican Mayor Pat McCrory condemned Hanks.
</P>
<P>
"He's a man of total inner hatred in both his heart and soul, and it doesn't
matter what party he's in," McCrory said.
