White supremacists clashed with an angry crowd outside Faneuil Hall, where
Holocaust survivors and their families were commemorating the liberation of Nazi
concentration camps.

<P>
Two people were arrested during Sunday's confrontation, officer John Boyle said.
Sunday was the 60th anniversary of the end of the Allied victory over Nazi
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Inside the historic meeting house, Holocaust survivors, their children and
grandchildren lit white candles to commemorate the estimated 6 million Jews
killed by the Nazis. Germany's consul-general to New England, Wolfgang Vorwerk,
spoke of his country's role.

Outside, 10 to 15 members of the Arkansas-based group White Revolution were
escorted by officers to a designated protest area across the street. The
officers, many in riot gear, formed a barricade between the protesters and about
100 people who angrily shouted at them to leave Boston.
</P>
<P>
Two people were charged with disturbing the peace after a scuffle outside the
protest area. Police said Shireen Chambers, 36, of Boston, who is white, struck
a black man, Jerome Higins, 25, of Everett, and he retaliated by spitting in her
face and hitting her with a sign. Boyle said at least one officer was injured
while arresting Chambers, who yelled racist epithets as she was dragged
away.

<P>
Gov. Mitt Romney, who attended the Faneuil Hall event, said he was disgusted by
the presence of the supremacists.
</P>
<P>
"Today of all days, to have white supremacists come here from Arkansas, is most
disappointing," he said. "I wish they'd go back home where the came from and
bury themselves under the rocks that they crawled out from."
