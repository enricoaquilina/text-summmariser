Neighbors say neo-Nazis had no right to march in neighborhood

<P>
In the days leading up to a white supremacist march, ministers pleaded with
residents in the predominantly black neighborhood to stay calm and community
leaders organized peace rallies.
</P>
<P>
Authorities even delayed releasing the route so protesters wouldn't know where
the group planned to march.
</P>
<P>
It wasn't enough to stop an angry mob that included gang members from looting
and burning a neighborhood bar, smashing the windows of a gas station and
hurling rocks and bottles at police on Saturday. Twelve officers were injured,
one suffering a concussion when a brick flew through her cruiser
window.
</P>
<P>
In all, 114 people were arrested on charges including assault, vandalism,
failure to disperse and overnight curfew violations.
</P>
<P>
"We knew during the preparation that it was going to be a tremendous challenge,"
Police Chief Mike Navarre said Sunday. "Anyone who would accuse us of being
underprepared I would take exception with that."
</P>
<P>
Much of the anger boiled over because people were upset that city leaders were
willing to allow the supremacists to walk through the neighborhood and shout
insults, residents and authorities said.
</P>
<P>
"You can't allow people to come challenge a whole city and not think they
weren't going to strike back," said Kenneth Allen, 47, who watched the violence
begin near his home.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said there was little they could do to stop the group, because they
did not apply for a parade permit and instead planned to walk along
sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
"They do have a right to walk on the Toledo sidewalks," said Mayor Jack Ford,
who at one point confronted leaders of the mob and tried to settle them
down.
</P>
<P>
A gang member in a mask threatened to shoot him, and others cursed him for
allowing the march, the mayor said. He said he didn't know if the man who
threatened him was actually armed, but he blamed gangs for much of the violence.
The march had been called off because of the crowds, and the white supremacists
had left.
</P>
<P>
If the Nazi group tries to come back, Ford said he would seek a court order to
stop them.
</P>
<P>
Navarre said the riots escalated because members of the National Socialist
Movement took their protest to the neighborhood, which is predominantly black,
instead of a neutral place. "If this march had occurred in downtown Toledo, we
wouldn't have had the unrest," he said.
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood northwest of downtown, full of tree-lined streets and well-kept
brick homes, once was a thriving Polish community. But within the last decade
it's become home to poorer residents.
</P>
<P>
The neo-Nazi group, known as "America's Nazi Party," said they came to the city
because of a dispute between neighbors, one white and the other
black.
</P>
<P>
Police began receiving word midweek from officers on the street that gangs were
going to descend on the neighborhood in protest, the police chief said. The
disturbances were confined to a 1-square-mile (2.6-square-kilometer) area, but
the crowd swelled to about 600 people, overwhelming police.
</P>
<P>
The crowds were eventually dispersed by police in riot gear after about four
hours, and the mayor declared a state of emergency that remained in effect
through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
About 200 officers patrolled the neighborhood overnight after the riot, Navarre
said. Police reported no problems Sunday, but an 8 p.m. curfew was in effect for
a second night.
</P>
<P>
Neighbors were divided about the city allowing the march.
</P>
<P>
"They don't have the right to bring hate to my front yard," said Terrance
Anderson, who lives near a bar that was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Other neighbors said the group had a right to have their say. "Too bad the
people couldn't ignore them," said Dee Huntley.
