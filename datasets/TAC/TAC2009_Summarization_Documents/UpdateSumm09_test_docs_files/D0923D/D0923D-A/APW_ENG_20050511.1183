Immigrants advocates condemn passage of REAL ID Act, say it won't make nation safer

Immigrant rights groups on Wednesday attacked the Senate's passage of new
driver's license rules aimed at preventing terrorism, saying they won't secure
the nation and reflect surging hostility toward the foreign-born in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"This is clearly an anti-immigrant bill that's going to have a very harmful
impact on the Latino community and all immigrant communities," said Michele
Waslin, director of immigration policy research at the National Council of La
Raza.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make us one iota safer. Not a single immigrant is going to be
returned to his or her home country if they're denied a driver's
license."
</P>
<P>
The REAL ID Act would require states to verify that people who apply for a
driver's license are in the country legally. It would also make it harder for
immigrants to gain amnesty, and easier to override environmental laws to build a
barrier along the Mexican border in California.
</P>
<P>
The provision was folded into an emergency military spending bill that earmarks
$82 billion (euro63.65 billion) for the war in Iraq. It was approved by the
House last week and now goes to President George W. Bush, who is expected to
sign it.
</P>
<P>
Immigrants' advocates say the measure is the latest example of America's
increasingly hostile climate toward foreign-born residents, an atmosphere
dramatically worsened by the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and continually
fueled by the ongoing war in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"America is a country of paradoxes: We are a country of immigrants, yet we
attack immigrants," said Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Council on
Civil Rights, a coalition group in Washington, D.C. that in March sent a
petition _ signed by 64 member organizations _ calling on legislators to vote
against the act.
</P>
<P>
"The REAL ID Act is the most blatant attack on immigrant rights since the last
major overhaul of immigration law in 1996," he said.
</P>
<P>
Henderson and other advocates said the more than 10 million undocumented
immigrants already in the country _ with more arriving monthly _ demonstrate the
pressing need for comprehensive immigration reform. Such changes are being
drafted by several senators and are expected to include a proposed guest worker
program that would allow immigrants already in the United States to work
legally.
</P>
<P>
"Rather than spending our time diddling about with issues of who's going to
drive and who's not going to drive in this country, we should address the whole
question of immigration reform," said Cesar Perales, president of the Puerto
Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, based in New York.
</P>
<P>
Opponents also complained that the immigration measures were combined with an
emergency measure for military spending, forcing a rushed vote with no Senate
hearings amid heavy political pressure.
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't vetted, and it was attached to this political must-pass bill," said
Christine Gleichert, legislative director for the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee. "We know senators and members of Congress can't
and won't vote against funding for our troops, but this provision should not
have been attached to it. They sold it as part of national security."
</P>
<P>
All but one of the 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11 attacks had some form of U.S.
identification, some of it fraudulent, the Sept. 11 commission found. The
commission recommended the federal government set standards for birth
certificates and other identification documents, including driver's
licenses.
</P>
<P>
Congress created a panel to negotiate new driver's license standards, but the
new rules supersede the panel.
</P>
<P>
Advocates say the new measure could actually backfire because many undocumented
immigrants' personal information will no longer be kept in state databases,
making it much harder to track them. They also say that, with fewer licensed
drivers, they expect an increase in drivers who lack auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
Some states have voiced opposition to the REAL ID Act, and there are early signs
that some may refuse to implement it for lack of funding, among other issues.
The measure gives them three years to meet the new standards. In addition, state
legislators and courts have already begun to craft their own rules on the issue.
In Utah and Tennessee, new laws mandate that undocumented immigrants turn over
their driver's licenses and get new driving cards, which are not valid as
official identification and cannot be used to board a plane.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a state judge in New York ruled that the Department of Motor
Vehicles may not deny licenses to those who cannot prove they are citizens.
State officials plan to appeal.
</P>
<P>
"In the short term, there will be lots of confusion," Henderson said. "There was
a broad coalition of groups that opposed the REAL ID Act ... and they'll
continue to look at implementation. Our view is that provisions of this law will
prove largely unattainable."
