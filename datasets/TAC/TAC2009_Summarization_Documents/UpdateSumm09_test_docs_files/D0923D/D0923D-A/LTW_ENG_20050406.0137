Let's Put This ID Plan to Work
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Immigration reform is back on the table -- with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
Last month, House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner
succeeded in attaching his Real ID Act to a must-pass Iraq
appropriations bill. Now that spending measure is coming up in the
Senate, and though it's unclear how the upper chamber will handle the
congressman's proposal, members are girding for an all-out fight over
immigration.
</P>
<P>
The Sensenbrenner legislation, tagged as a security measure, is a
hodgepodge of provisions: one aimed at finishing a few miles of fence
on the border near Tijuana, another raising barriers to asylum seekers
who claim they are fleeing abuse in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
But the section likely to create the most controversy would make it
more difficult for states to issue driver's licenses to illegal
immigrants. Already under attack from both the right and the left, it
has also provoked calls for still tougher measures, including a
national ID card.
</P>
<P>
The bill's history in the House, where it passed on a 261-161 vote,
holds crucial lessons for to them. And we will
not put an end to the illegal influx until we find a way to prevent
employers from hiring unauthorized workers.
</P>
<P>
The unavoidable answer -- albeit deeply unpopular in this country --
is a credible ``employer verification'' system: one that replaces
existing fraud-prone employment practices with a better way of
ensuring that businesses hire only legal residents. And even some
policymakers who favor a temporary worker program are beginning to
think this might require some sort of employee ID.
</P>
<P>
Most Americans detest that idea, to put it mildly. We relish our
privacy, we bristle at government interference in business -- and
obviously any effort to prevent hiring one kind of worker will mean
monitoring all hiring. Though the idea of creating national databases
has grown more acceptable since 9/11, the mere mention of worker ID
cards is still enough, in most circles, to end all discussion of an
employment-based strategy.
</P>
<P>
It's hardly surprising that the last time we tried an
employer-based approach -- penalties against businesses that hire
illegal workers are part of the landmark Immigration Reform and
Control Act (IRCA) that Congress passed in 1986 -- it was so watered
down as to be all but irrelevant. Still, unappealing as it may sound,
an employer-verification system is e currently allowed): updated Social Securit
y cards, driver's
licenses, temporary worker's visas and green cards. But any employee
need produce only one. The cards would have to have photos. Ideally,
the Department of Homeland Security would coordinate with the Social
Security Administration so that the only other information required
would be a Social Security number, which in the future could be
embedded in all four types of cards.
</P>
<P>
As with credit card verification, responses would have to come in
real time, and employers would learn only one thing about employees:
whether they are authorized to work or not. Existing databases would
have to be vastly improved: The 10-year-old pilot program that some
businesses already use to verify workers' identities still produces
far too many false hits, though the number is declining. As with
credit histories, employees who were denied work would have access to
their records and an easy-to-use appeals process.
</P>
<P>
Equally important, the new system must be phased in over time. We
might start with temporary workers only, or with one sector -- say,
agriculture. Companies -- especially small companies -- that wished to
continue with the current paper-based method would be permitted to do
so. Any expansion of the program would be tied to proof that it was
working well. And of course it would hardly make sense except in the
context of immigration reform that provided U.S. industries reliant on
foreign laborers with enough legal workers to function and grow.
</P>
<P>
None of this will be easy, and the public is right to be skeptical.
But in the long run, if it's done properly, a program of this kind
would benefit everyone. Employers would get the workers they need with
much less trouble -- the current paper-based system is notoriously
cumbersome -- and more peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
Authorized immigrants would welcome a card they could rely on, and
they would face less discrimination than they are currently exposed
to. As for American workers, we would have no less privacy than we
have now. We already provide this information when we get hired for a
new job. The only difference under the new system is that it would
happen electronically.
</P>
<P>
As it is, most Americans defy the law every day, many of us several
times, benefiting one way or another from the work of illegal
immigrants. We all say this is unacceptable; we say we want change.
But ending the illegality is going to take more than a few miles of
new fence. Do we want a working system, economically realistic but
also airtight? Are we prepared to do what it takes to secure our
borders and restore the rule of law?
</P>
<P>
Think about it -- think about both the costs and the benefits -- the
next time you use your credit card.
