WHITE HOUSE BACKS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD TOUGHEN IMMIGRATION RULES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bill that would enact hotly contested immigration rules,
including one that would bar illegal immigrants from getting driver's
licenses, is marching toward approval with the backing of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
The provisions are attached to an emergency spending bill that would
provide $81 billion for military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A bipartisan House-Senate conference committee is expected to agree on a
compromise version of the bill today; each chamber is slated
to vote on the measure within the next two weeks
and then send it to President Bush for his signature.
</P>
<P>
The immigration provisions, which were introduced as the Real ID Act
in January, include new identification requirements for people seeking driver's
licenses, toughened standards for immigrants seeking asylum in the United
States, and money to complete a three-mile stretch of border
fencing near San Diego.
</P>
<P>
The House version contains the immigration provisions but the Senate's version
does not.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers from both parties, as well as civil liberties groups and
immigration advocates, decry the addition of the provisions to the
must-pass supplemental bill. Supporters of the provisions know that it
would be politically unwise for anyone to vote against a
bill that sends money to American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, high-level lobbying by the Real ID measures' author, Judiciary Committee
Chairman Rep. James Sensenbrenner, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and
the White House helped silence discussion of handling the provisions
as separate legislation.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Congress dated Monday, Joshua Bolten, director of
the Office of Management and Budget, strongly encouraged Congress to
include the immigration provisions and said the legislation would "strengthen
the ability of the United States to protect against terrorist
entry into and activities within the United States."
</P>
<P>
Some experts say the president's support for the tough immigration provisions
sends mixed messages. He also is pushing a temporary guest
worker program to make it easier for illegal immigrants to
work in the United States and is working hard to
improve U.S.-Mexico relations.
</P>
<P>
"We think that the long-term future of North America is more
ties between communities, but when we see fences going up,
it seems to send the wrong message," said Nestor Rodriguez,
co-director of the Center for Immigration Research at the University
of Houston.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers, including Houston Republican Rep. John Culberson, a staunch advocate
of stronger immigration controls, are completely dedicated to making sure
the provisions remain in the bill.
</P>
<P>
"Stopping the flood of illegal immigrants and protecting our borders is
my single highest legislative priority," Culberson said. "We need action
now, and the only sure way to enact immigration change
is to attach it to an emergency spending bill."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Culberson said he and his allies in the House would
vote against the military spending bill if the immigration provisions
are removed.
</P>
<P>
"We would bring it down if we need to," he said.
"I would in two heartbeats. I am fed up with
the complete lack of enforcement of our immigration laws."
</P>
<P>
The bill would set national standards compelling states to issue driver's
licenses only to those lawfully in the country. Nine states
currently allow illegal immigrants to get licenses.
</P>
<P>
Residents of states that don't comply with the law would not
be allowed to use their driver's licenses as federal identification,
needed to board commercial aircraft, for example.
</P>
<P>
The license changes have raised several concerns. Civil liberties groups worry
the move takes the country closer to a national ID
card. Some states feel the changes present a bureaucratic burden
and some experts say illegal immigrants will continue to drive,
but without insurance.
</P>
<P>
The provisions also would raise the standard of proof that asylum
applicants must meet if they claim that they have been
persecuted on ethnic, religious or political grounds in their home
countries.
</P>
<P>
The asylum rules are unnecessary, said Joseph Vail, a former immigration
judge and director of the Immigration Clinic at the University
of Houston Law Center.
</P>
<P>
"The standards are already extremely high," he said. "There is not
one example of a terrorist having been granted asylum. The
end result will be that qualified asylum-seekers will be denied
asylum."
</P>
<P>
The bill would pay for supplies, services, training and facility improvements
for U.S. troops overseas and also fund various programs, such
as those that buy back weapons from foreign insurgents and
counter-drug efforts in Afghanistan.
