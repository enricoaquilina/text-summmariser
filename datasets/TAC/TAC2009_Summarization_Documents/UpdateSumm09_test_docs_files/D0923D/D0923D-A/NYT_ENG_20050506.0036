CONGRESS NEEDS TO TAKE PLUNGE, ADOPT NATIONAL ID
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(BEGIN ITAL)Recommendation: Secure identification should begin in the United States. The
federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth
certificates and sources of identification, such as drivers licenses.(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
The 9/11 Commission Report, quoted above, is clear. Creating a nationwide
secure system of identification is an important national security issue.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time Congress has been told that
a secure national identification system was needed to cure one
problem or another.
</P>
<P>
Congress may pass a bill or two this year that nods
in the direction of a national identification system. Unfortunately, it
likely will take another commission report before lawmakers get behind
a nationwide identity program.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the bipartisan Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by former
Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, concluded that immigration laws and employer sanctions
could never be enforced without some form of secure national
ID cards and with an accompanying database of citizens and
others who are in the country legally.
</P>
<P>
Congress long has ignored notices that the United States needs a
standardized method to be able to identify and track people
who commit crimes in one state and easily take up
residence and new identities in another state.
</P>
<P>
Not only do criminals often avoid justice because of a lack
of standardized identification, citizens also avoid court orders for child
support, custody laws and many other situations simply by skipping
out to another state.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, voter fraud could be reduced with secure national IDs.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, identity theft has become a burgeoning criminal industry
thanks to the lack of a nationwide secure system of
identification. Such a system could help curb identity theft.
</P>
<P>
Another documented national growth industry involves easily obtained fake identification papers.
These inexpensive identity papers can include bogus Social Security cards,
birth certificates, check-cashing cards and driver's licenses -- all available
in most cities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
The 9/11 Commission Report called for a secure, standardized national identification
system as a way to reduce the threat of terrorism
and improve homeland security. That's a valid consideration, of course,
since national security must always be at the top of
the list of national priorities.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism and homeland security issues aside, however, the principle of the
rule of law erodes in the United States when the
government fails to enforce the law that prohibits U.S. employers
from hiring workers who are illegally inside the United States.
</P>
<P>
This was the conclusion of the Jordan commission report on immigration
reform.
</P>
<P>
Without a standardized, secure national system capable of telling citizen from
noncitizen, U.S. employers routinely are let off the hook when
job applicants show them any number of easily obtained fake
identity papers or valid identity cards that offer no proof
of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The Real ID Act (H.R. 418), which Congress likely will pass
this year, requires states to verify the legal residency of
driver's license applicants under threat of having the state's licenses
banned for such federal uses such as boarding airplanes or
cashing checks. The act includes standardization, which is good.
</P>
<P>
Problems with this approach include yet another unfunded federal mandate, not
to mention a shift in immigration responsibility to state agencies
that aren't trained or equipped for the duty.
</P>
<P>
Another proposal that could pass Congress this year calls for the
Social Security Administration to replace all current paper Social Security
cards with plastic cards that include a digitized photo with
an "encrypted machine-readable electronic identification strip."
</P>
<P>
Congress recognizes the problem. That's a start. It should bite the
bullet and pass a federal national ID system.
