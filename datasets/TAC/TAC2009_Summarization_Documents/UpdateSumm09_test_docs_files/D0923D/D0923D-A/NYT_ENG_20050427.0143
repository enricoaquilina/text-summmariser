LAWMAKERS TO DECIDE FATE OF DRIVER'S LICENSE IMMIGRATION BILL

<P>
It's crunch time on a major piece of immigration
legislation and all sides are stepping up the pressure.
</P>
<P>
The Real ID Act, which restricts illegal immigrants from getting driver's
licenses and tightens asylum laws, is expected to be approved
or rejected by House and Senate negotiators Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the measure -- including a group of immigration control
activists in town for a week of lobbying -- said
they were cautiously optimistic, especially after the White House endorsed
it in a letter to House and Senate conferees earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
"We feel pretty good about it," said Carlos Espinosa, spokesman for
Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., a leading critic of illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Lungren, a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee, said that
negotiations on the Real ID Act "are going well" and
involved the leadership in both chambers.
</P>
<P>
But Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said that Democrats have
been "completely shut out of the backroom negotiations" in "yet
another example of the Republican leadership's abuse of power."
</P>
<P>
"This legislation would make sweeping, controversial changes to our laws with
respect to the environment, refugees, judicial review, the states' power
to make decisions about their own laws, and other issues,"
Reid said. "This legislation has never been considered by the
Senate. It has not been subjected to any hearings, debate,
amendments, or any votes at all by this body."
</P>
<P>
Other opponents of the immigration measure -- including immigrant advocates, religious
groups, human rights organizations, the National Conference of State Legislators,
and the American Civil Liberties Union -- were trying hard
to stop it.
</P>
<P>
Several of the groups were planning a telephone conference call on
Thursday to urge lawmakers to drop the legislation from a
larger emergency spending bill.
</P>
<P>
"This country has been known to have safe haven for people,
and we're fearful that, with this measure, that won't happen,"
said Judith Golub, senior director of advocacy and public affairs
of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
</P>
<P>
House and Senate negotiators are working to reconcile two versions of
the emergency spending bill, one of which includes the immigration
provisions. The bill is urgently needed to fund military operations
and rebuilding efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as
tsunami relief efforts in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Real ID Act was added to the spending bill in
the House in an effort spearheaded by Rep. James Sensenbrenner,
R-Wis., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The Senate version
did not include the immigration provisions.
</P>
<P>
The bill would require people applying for or renewing driver's licenses
to confirm their legal status in the United States. The
residents of states that don't comply won't be allowed to
use the driver's licenses as identification to board planes or
apply for Social Security and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
Proponents say the measure would stop foreign terrorists from obtaining driver's
licenses which they could use to travel in the United
States and would also stop terrorists from taking advantage of
U.S. asylum laws.
</P>
<P>
Opponents say that the Real ID Act is an anti-immigrant measure
that would not improve security and hasn't been vetted through
the congressional process.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the measure would result in more dangerous roadways, with
thousands of illegal immigrants driving without licenses or insurance.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the American Civil Liberties Union says that a provision
in the bill to link state driver's license databases would
create a de facto national ID card and a "show
us your papers" society.
</P>
<P>
The driver's licence issue has energized groups upset about illegal immigration.
Some are in Washington this week for a six-day lobbying
effort on various immigration topics. It includes a gathering of
18 radio talk-show hosts from around the country.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Tuesday hosted by the Federation for American
Immigration Reform, a group that advocates reducing immigration, Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said that illegal immigration is "threatening to our
very survival as a nation" because it brings down wages
and "destroys our health care and education system."
</P>
<P>
"They don't deserve a drivers license, they deserve to be driven
to the border," and thrown over, said Rohrabacher, a nine-term
lawmaker who chairs a science subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
The comment drew raucous applause and cheers from the crowd of
about 150 people.
