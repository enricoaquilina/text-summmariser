New driver's license rules tucked in a military spending bill will create
national identification cards for Americans and stick state governments with the
bill, Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, joined Democrats and state officials in
railing against the White House-backed driver's license rules and other
immigration measures before the Senate approved the $82 billion (euro63.79
billion) spending bill 100-0. The House approved it last week.
</P>
<P>
Several states fear the new rules will be costly, provide little protection
against invasions of privacy and identity theft, and make getting a driver's
license a bigger headache for Americans.
</P>
<P>
The rules are aimed at stopping illegal immigrants from getting driver's
licenses to prevent them from boarding planes or entering protected federal
buildings. States will have three years to meet the new standards that include
verifying applicants are American citizens or legal residents.
</P>
<P>
The House had included the rules and other the immigration provisions in its
version of the bill paying for the U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The
Senate did not, but negotiators included them in the final bill.
</P>
<P>
Alexander and other lawmakers said the rules established in the REAL ID Act will
have unintended consequences. Driver's license examiners trained to decide
whether a person can parallel park will have to determine whether an applicant
is an al-Qaida terrorist, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's possible that some governor may look at this and say, 'Wait a minute. Who
are these people in Washington telling us what to do with our driver's licenses
and making us pay for them, too?'" Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
Some states have threatened to challenge the new driver's license orders in
court and even disobey them.
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, vice chairman of the National Governors
Association, has said "if more than half of the governors agree we're not going
down without a fight on this, Congress will have to consider changing" the
rules. Huckabee also is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
"If you think a trip to the division of motor vehicle is a bad experience today,
wait until the REAL ID takes effect," Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat,
said.
</P>
<P>
All but one of the 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks had some form of
U.S. identification, some of it fraudulent, the Sept. 11 commission found. The
commission recommended the federal government set standards for birth
certificates and other identification documents, including driver's
licenses.
</P>
<P>
Congress created a panel to negotiate new driver's license standards, but the
new rules supersede the panel.
</P>
<P>
The new rules were written by Rep. James Sensenbrenner, House Judiciary
Committee chairman, who failed in attempts to include similar provisions in an
intelligence reorganization bill signed by President George W. Bush last year.
He was promised he could add them to the first bill guaranteed to get
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
Sensenbrenner's spokesman Jeff Lungren said the rules do not create a national
ID card but are "merely settings standards for the states" and building on
states' ongoing efforts to boost driver's license security.
</P>
<P>
The bill allows the Homeland Security secretary to provide grants to states to
help defray costs, but it includes no money for them. Lungren said that will be
addressed in appropriations bills.
