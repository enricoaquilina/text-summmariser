US to tighten issuance of driver's licenses
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Applicants for state-issued 
driver's licenses in the United States will be required to produce
four types of identification when the Congress approves a plan to 
discourage illegal immigration, the USA Today newspaper reported 
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Most who apply for new licenses -- and presumably, those 
seeking renewals -- would have to prove that they are in the 
United States legally, possess document of their social security 
number and home address and show a photo ID.
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicle department employees then would have to verify 
the documents with federal databases, a potentially lengthy 
process that could mean an end to same-day license renewals.
</P>
<P>
Each year, about 70 million people in the United States apply 
for new driver's licenses or renewals.
</P>
<P>
In most of the states now, the new drivers are typically 
required to produce proof of age and one or two other forms of ID,
usually including a photo. Less is required for those renewing 
licenses, and a few states, including Maryland, allow renewals by 
mail.
</P>
<P>
The House is likely to pass the Real ID Act as early as 
Thursday and the Senate next week, as an attachment to an 81-
billion-dollar emergency spending bill to the military in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
If states did not comply within three years, their driver's 
licenses could not be used as ID to board a plane or to enter 
certain federal buildings.
</P>
<P>
Along with extra security at airports and workplaces, the act 
could represent the most significant differences in daily lives to
stem from post Sept. 11 security concerns, according to the report.
