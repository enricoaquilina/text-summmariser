EDITORIAL: SYMBOLISM OVER SUBSTANCE: CONGRESS PREEMPTED DRIVER'S LICENSE EFFORTS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Sen. Gil Cedillo, D-Los Angeles, and Democratic lawmakers who supported his
immigrant driver's license bill are in deep and dangerous denial.
Apparently they missed how Congress preempted states on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Five months ago Congress approved the Real ID Act to guide
states in issuing driver's licenses that the federal government would
recognize as valid identification to get on an airplane, apply
for Social Security, even enter a post office. Like it
or not, and we don't, Congress has turned the driver's
license into a national identity card. Our Legislature cannot change
or contravene federal law.
</P>
<P>
Cedillo claims his measure conforms with the Real ID Act. He
cannot know that. The regulations aren't expected to be issued
for another year. So, SB 60 would require California to
redesign its driver's licenses to comply with a federal law
that has no regulations yet for implementing it. The California
Department of Motor Vehicles opposed SB 60 for that reason.
As the DMV wrote to Cedillo, "It would be premature
at this juncture to enact California law that directs this
department to initiate a secondary license procedure until the (federal)
rule-making process is concluded." For those reasons, the governor made
it clear he would not sign SB 60.
</P>
<P>
Serious budgetary issues justify that decision as well. It would cost
California millions to create a new driver's license procedure two
years ahead of what the federal law allows, and in
the end the regulations would almost certainly invalidate those efforts.
</P>
<P>
We sympathize with Cedillo's goal. Driver's licenses ought to validate people's
ability to drive competently, not their immigration status. Without a
valid driver's license, undocumented immigrants cannot register cars or buy
auto insurance. But they still drive, and that means the
ranks of unlicensed and uninsured drivers in California and nationwide
have swelled.
</P>
<P>
But Cedillo and his supporters in the Legislature can't override the
federal law. The fight belongs in Congress.
