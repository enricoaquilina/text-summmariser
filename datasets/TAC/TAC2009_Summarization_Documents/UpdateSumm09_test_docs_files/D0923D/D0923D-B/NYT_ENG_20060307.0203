PROVISION OF ANTI-TERROR LAW DELAYING ENTRY OF REFUGEES

<P>
About 9,500 Burmese refugees scheduled to be resettled from
Thailand to the United States this year are in limbo
because their indirect support for armed rebels opposed to their
repressive government has put them in technical violation of American
anti-terrorism law, government officials say.
</P>
<P>
The Burmese are the largest of several groups, including refugees from
Cuba, Vietnam, Liberia and Somalia, whose admission to the United
States has been jeopardized by a provision in the USA
Patriot Act that denies entry to anyone who has provided
material support to a terrorist or armed rebel group. The
provision applies even if that support was coerced or the
aims of the group in question match those of American
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The law broadens the definition of terrorist groups to include organizations
that do not appear on the State Department's list of
designated terrorist groups, effectively barring refugees loosely linked to armed
groups that have resisted authoritarian governments like those in Burma
and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Some of the refugees paid taxes to rebel groups that controlled
their communities. Others offered food or small sums to relatives
or acquaintances in groups with ties to rebels or were
forced to provide such support, refugee resettlement officials say.
</P>
<P>
Homeland Security and State Department officials have been working for several
months to define guidelines for a waiver to the statute
that would allow the resettlement of the refugees, who are
fleeing religious, ethnic and political persecution, and refugee officials said
they were hoping for a resolution soon.
</P>
<P>
But with thousands of families stranded in refugee camps overseas, officials
from the United Nations and Republicans and Democrats in Congress
have begun warning in recent weeks that the law is
leaving refugees increasingly at risk.
</P>
<P>
The law has already delayed the resettlement of 146 Cubans who
offered support to armed opponents of Fidel Castro in the
1960s; 200 Burmese refugees housed in Malaysia; 30 Hmong refugees
in Thailand; 11 Vietnamese Montagnard refugees in Cambodia; and a
small number of Liberians and Somalis, U.N. statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is still awaiting a formal decision on the
fate of the 9,500 Burmese refugees in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials and members of Congress said the refugees posed no
known security risks to the United States. By tagging them
as having links to terrorists, the United Nations says, the
Bush administration will make it difficult to find other countries
willing to accept them. It may also lead countries providing
the refugees with temporary shelter to reconsider their welcome.
</P>
<P>
The delay in issuing a waiver to the statute has led
the United Nations to suspend the American resettlement of hundreds
of Colombian refugees, many of whom were forced to make
payments to rebel forces, and of 1,300 Burmese refugees housed
in Malaysia, who made donations to ethnic groups linked to
armed opponents of the Burmese government.
</P>
<P>
It has also prevented some 500 asylum seekers in the United
States from being granted permanent refuge here. Many of those
cases are being appealed.
</P>
<P>
"Until this issue is resolved, many deserving refugees and applicants for
asylum fleeing religious, ethnic or other forms of persecution will
be unfairly denied or postponed from achieving safe haven," Reps.
Christopher H. Smith, R-N.J., and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said in
a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff last week.
</P>
<P>
The Patriot Act, which was passed in 2001 and is being
reauthorized by Congress, has been increasingly applied to refugees in
the past two years. So has the Real ID Act,
which further broadened the definition of terrorist groups when it
was passed last year.
</P>
<P>
"That procedure should ensure that terrorists do not abuse refugee status
or the asylum laws of the United States," Smith and
Ros-Lehtinen wrote. "However, the procedure should also properly weigh situations
in which individuals are acting under duress or are legitimately
resisting illegitimate and tyrannical regimes."
</P>
<P>
Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, both Democrats, wrote a similar letter last week.
</P>
<P>
Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, said his
agency was working with the departments of State and Justice
to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
"Part of the consternation over this issue is that this process
is taking some time," he said. "The process is made
difficult because of the need to balance national security with
our deep commitment to assisting refugees and providing a safe
refuge."
</P>
<P>
Those affected by the law include a Colombian woman forced by
rebels to hand over livestock. The rebels killed her husband
and raped her before she escaped the country. Because her
forced support for the rebels would bar her from admission
to the United States, the United Nations resettled her in
another country.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School, who
traveled to Thailand and Malaysia, interviewed scores of additional refugees.
Two of them -- one who gave a hat to
a cousin who belonged to an opposition group and another
who was taxed a basket of rice annually by the
group -- are among the Burmese who still hope to
find refuge here.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers at the Homeland Security Department have also argued that the
laws now bar the United States from admitting Afghan refugees
who supported the Northern Alliance in its battle against the
Taliban or South Africans who supported the African National Congress
when it was deemed a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers made that case in January as they tried to
persuade a panel of judges to deny asylum to a
Burmese woman who had donated money to an opposition group.
The woman, a Christian who has been detained in Texas
since she entered this country in 2004, said she had
been persecuted in Burma for her religious beliefs and her
ethnicity. The woman, who asked for anonymity because her case
is pending, is still in detention, awaiting the judges' decision.
</P>
<P>
"I am still hoping," she said in a telephone interview on
Friday.
