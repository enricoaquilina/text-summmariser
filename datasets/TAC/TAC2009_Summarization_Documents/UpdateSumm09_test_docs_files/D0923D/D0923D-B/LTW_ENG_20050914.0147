Homeland Security Forces Controversial Border Fence Issue

<P>
In a rebuff to California officials and
environmentalists, the Bush administration cleared the way Wednesday
for completion of a 14-mile-long border fence that will run through
coastal wetlands to the Pacific Ocean near San Diego.
</P>
<P>
Exercising the first waiver of environmental laws since Congress in
May gave him the authority to do so, Homeland Security Secretary
Michael Chertoff said that completing the last 3 1/2 miles of the
fence -- at a cost of about $32 million -- would allow the U.S. Border
Patrol to create a security corridor between it and the existing
border fence. The zone would include two new fences and two new roads
for use by border agents, plus stadium-style lighting and surveillance
cameras.
</P>
<P>
In the process, said Border Patrol Chief David Aguilar, the agency
would be able to shrink the area agents need to physically patrol from
2,000 acres to 200 acres.
</P>
<P>
``Bottom line, this is about border security,'' Aguilar told
reporters. ``We're addressing the vulnerabilities here'' in closing a
border to potential terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Compressing the amount of territory the government patrols, he
said, also will deter illegal immigration by creating ``certainty of
arrest in that zone.''
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol chief pledged that his agents would be ``good
stewards of the environment,'' and he blamed much of the area's
degradation on traffic from border-crossers who take cover in the
wetlands and litter the area with trash.
</P>
<P>
With Chertoff's announcement, the department formally waived
enforcement of environmental and other laws that had delayed the
project -- or threatened to.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office, Chertoff promised to ``act in
an environmentally responsible manner consistent with the security
needs of our nation.''
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists who fought the project say the government is
planning to use soil from a nearby mesa to fill in a canyon, nicknamed
Smugglers Gulch, with enough dirt to fill two Hoover Dams. They
believe it will trigger severe ecological hardships.
</P>
<P>
``This will cause a tremendous amount of damage to the Tijuana
estuary, particularly downstream,'' said Jim Peugh, chairman of the
conservation committee for the San Diego Audubon Society. ``The waiver
means they don't have to respect water quality or endangered species
or labor or child safety laws. It's a very chilling precedent.''
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have come to San Diego and ``talked, but they
don't listen,'' Peugh said. He argued that the border could be
protected ``without cutting off the tops of the mesas to fill in the
canyon. The problem is they insist on a straight freeway across the
canyons. They have chosen to do it in an environmentally damaging
way.''
</P>
<P>
Litigation has dogged the project since Congress approved the
border fence in 1996. Last year, the California Coastal Commission --
which regulates coastline development -- refused to grant permits to
complete the fence, saying the harm to sensitive habitats outweighed
security benefits.
</P>
<P>
Peter Douglas, the commission's executive director, said
Wednesday's federal action trumped state law.
</P>
<P>
``This is a clear victory for the politics of fear,'' he said.
``They were intent on circumventing all the environmental protections
we spent decades putting into place. They were able to get through the
back door what they couldn't get through the front. And there's
nothing we can do about it except mourn the day.''
</P>
<P>
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has called for a balanced
approach in completing a border infrastructure system that weighs both
environmental and security considerations.
</P>
<P>
``The federal government appears to have gone to great lengths to
allay and avoid environmental concerns, including public hearings and
numerous studies, and Californians appreciate that,'' Schwarzenegger's
office said in a statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Outraged by what they saw as obstructionism by environmentalists,
congressional Republicans passed the Real ID Act in May, giving the
Homeland Security secretary authority to waive any legal requirements
that he, in his discretion, ``determines necessary to ensure
expeditious construction'' of barriers, like border fences, under his
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Hailing Chertoff's move Wednesday, Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif.,
castigated ``the dilatory efforts which have restricted this national
security element for so many years.'' Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.,
R-Wis., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, likewise decried
those who ``stymied (the project) by litigation and obstructionism.''
