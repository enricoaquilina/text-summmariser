GOVERNORS ASSAIL NEW ID LAW AND SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The nation's governors told Michael Chertoff, the
secretary of homeland security, on Monday that the new law
expanding the role of state motor vehicle departments to include
national security responsibilities was presenting enormous financial and logistical challenges
that could take many years to meet.
</P>
<P>
Some governors suggested that the problems might prove so onerous that
Congress might need another approach. The law, known as the
Real ID Act, gives states three years to begin verifying
whether someone seeking or renewing a driver's license is in
the country legally.
</P>
<P>
"Real ID has raised a lot of concerns," said Gov. Phil
Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat who was part of a
bipartisan chorus of criticism made by the governors to reporters
after the meeting. "People who pass these laws don't necessarily
take into account what it takes to implement them in
the states. Some people expressed the opinion that if you
want to have a national ID card, fine. You need
to issue it, not try to get it done in
50 states."
</P>
<P>
The governors met privately with Chertoff on the final day of
the National Governors Association's summer meetings.
</P>
<P>
Chertoff, speaking to reporters after his 40-minute meeting, described it as
part of "an ongoing discussion" with the governors about how
to put new programs into practice and to improve existing
ones.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's opinion is different," he said. "We'll find a common plan
to work for everybody."
</P>
<P>
While the governors said they appreciated Chertoff's words, many seemed nonetheless
daunted by the need to restructure motor vehicle agencies. Under
the new law, workers would need to be trained for
added responsibilities that involved document verification and use of sensitive
federal databases.
</P>
<P>
Many governors were critical of how the law was forced on
them with no consultation. Congress approved the measure in May
as part of a bill providing $82 billion more for
the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"It was attached at the last minute, and it was poorly
thought through," said Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a Republican
who became the new chairman of the governors association.
</P>
<P>
Part of the governors' objection was based on costs. Congress appropriated
$100 million for the effort, but Gov. Mark Warner of
Virginia, a Democrat and the outgoing chairman, said upgrading the
motor vehicle department in his state alone could cost that
much.
