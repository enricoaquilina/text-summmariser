<P>
An anti-terrorism law creating a national standard for all driver's licenses by
2008 isn't just upsetting civil libertarians and immigration rights
activists.
</P>
<P>
State motor vehicle officials nationwide who will have to carry out the Real ID
Act say its authors grossly underestimated its logistical, technological and
financial demands.
</P>
<P>
In a comprehensive survey obtained by The Associated Press and in follow-up
interviews, officials cast doubt on the states' ability to comply with the law
on time and fretted that it will be a budget buster.
</P>
<P>
"It is just flat out impossible and unrealistic to meet the prescriptive
provisions of this law by 2008," Betty Serian, a deputy secretary of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Nebraska's motor vehicles director, responding to the survey by the American
Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, said that to comply with Real ID
her state "may have to consider extreme measures and possibly a complete
reorganization."
</P>
<P>
And a new record-sharing provision of Real ID was described by an Illinois
official as "a nightmare for all states."
</P>
<P>
States use a hodgepodge of systems and standards in granting driver's licenses
and identification cards. In some places, a high school yearbook may be enough
to prove identity.
</P>
<P>
A major goal of Real ID _ which was motivated by the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks,
whose perpetrators had legitimate driver's licenses _ is to unify the disparate
licensing rules and make it harder to fraudulently obtain a card.
</P>
<P>
The law also demands that states link their record-keeping systems to national
databases so duplicate applications can be detected, illegal immigrants caught
and driving histories shared.
</P>
<P>
State licenses that fail to meet Real ID's standards will not be able to be used
to board an airplane or enter a federal building.
</P>
<P>
The law, which was attached to a funding measure for the Iraq war last May, has
been criticized by civil libertarians who contend it will create a de facto
national ID card and new centralized databases, inhibiting privacy.
</P>
<P>
State organizations such as the National Governors Association have blasted the
law as well. Many states will have to amend laws in order to
comply.
</P>
<P>
The August survey by the motor vehicle administrators' group, which has not been
made public, asked licensing officials nationwide for detailed reports on what
it will take to meet Real ID's demands.
</P>
<P>
"If you begin to look at the full ramifications of this, we are talking about
billions and billions of dollars. Congress simply passed an unfunded mandate,"
said Barry Steinhardt, director of the technology and liberty project at the
American Civil Liberties Union. "Every motorist in America is going to pay the
price of this, of the Congress' failure to do a serious exploration of the cost,
the complexity, of the difficulty."
</P>
<P>
The survey described a multitude of hurdles.
</P>
<P>
Some examples:
</P>
<P>
_ The law demands that states mine multiple databases to check the accuracy of
documents submitted by license applicants. Several states questioned how that
will work, especially with confirming birth certificates.
</P>
<P>
_ Some states' ancient computing systems will have to be overhauled in order to
link to other networks. Minnesota runs a 1980s-era mainframe
system.
</P>
<P>
_ Many states don't make drivers prove they are legally in the country, but the
law will now demand such documentation. It also calls for states to run license
applications through a federal database known as SAVE that was launched by a
1986 law aimed at preventing illegal immigrants from receiving federal benefits.
One problem, though, is that the "SAVE database is notoriously unreliable ...
months behind," said South Carolina's response to the survey.
</P>
<P>
_ Real ID requires that a license show someone's principal residence. But state
officials object that a mailing address makes more sense for many people _ for
"snowbirds" who spend time in two states, for example or for public officials
who want to protect their privacy.
</P>
<P>
_ The law calls for a person's "full legal name," no nickname or abbreviations,
on licenses. Cards have to be redesigned and databases must be reprogrammed to
make room for extremely long names, likely up to 125 characters. That's not an
easy process.
</P>
<P>
_ Real ID demands that all driver's licenses or ID cards have pictures that can
be read by facial-recognition technology. That would end many states' practice
of letting people with certain religious beliefs request not to have a
picture.
</P>
<P>
"If you take any one of these things individually, you see a significant
problem," Steinhardt said. "There are literally hundreds of these problems
embedded in Real ID, and the statute doesn't give you a way out. It's black and
white. No exceptions, no reality check.
</P>
<P>
"In many respects it's a statute that ignores reality."
