Poll Reveals Positive View of `Guest Workers'

<P>
The majority of Californians support a guest-worker
program for illegal immigrants and do not believe that they are taking
jobs from the state's residents, according to a statewide poll
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, those surveyed hold a more positive view of illegal
immigrants than in previous years, the nonpartisan Field Poll
reported. Last month, 47 percent of those surveyed said they believe
that undocumented immigrants are having a ``favorable impact'' on the
state, compared to 19 percent in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Voters and nonvoters, however, hold dramatically different views on
the subject. About 36 percent of voters said they believe illegal
immigrants have a favorable impact on the state, compared to 64
percent of nonvoters.
</P>
<P>
The poll comes a week after the U.S. Senate began debating a series
of immigration reforms. The House passed legislation in December that
emphasized employer sanctions and tighter enforcement along the
border.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party also has endorsed a guest-worker program,
which President Bush has said needs to be a central part of
immigration reform.
</P>
<P>
The Field Poll reported that 65 percent of people surveyed last
month said they supported a temporary worker program, which would
provide legal status for undocumented laborers. And 70 percent said
they believed illegal immigrants are generally doing jobs others don't
want.
</P>
<P>
Poll director Mark DiCamillo said Thursday's poll results reflect
the increasing population of noncitizens in the state.
</P>
<P>
``The demographics of California now are very different than the
demographics of California 20 years ago,'' DiCamillo said.
</P>
<P>
California's improving economy and low unemployment also were
factors in the survey results, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, public attitudes toward undocumented
immigrants obtaining drivers' licenses are also changing. Of those
surveyed, 44 percent said they believe illegal immigrants should be
able to get licenses, compared to 35 percent one year ago.
</P>
<P>
But again, there are stark differences between those who are
registered to vote and those who are not. Only 33 percentof voters
support licenses, compared to 61 percent of nonvoters.
</P>
<P>
The federal Real ID Act signed into law on May 11 last year
required states to replace current drivers' licenses with
forgery-proof identification cards by 2008, but Congress gave states
the option to create distinct licenses for illegal immigrants.
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed such a bill last year.
</P>
<P>
The poll was based on a random telephone survey of 500 California
adults conducted in both English and Spanish over a two-week period in
February, according to the director. The sample included 337
registered voters and 163 who were not registered to vote. The margin
of sampling error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.
