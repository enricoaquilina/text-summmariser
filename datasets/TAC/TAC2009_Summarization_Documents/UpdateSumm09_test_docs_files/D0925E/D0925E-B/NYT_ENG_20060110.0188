APPLE UNVEILS MAC WITH INTEL INSIDE
</HEADLINE>

Apple Computer Inc. Tuesday introduced the first computer in its Macintosh
line to use a chip made by Intel Corp. The
move accelerates a shift by the maker of machines renowned
for their elegant design and ease of use to the
same brand of processor that runs the Windows software of
Apple's archrival, Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
At the annual Macworld trade show in San Francisco, Apple chief
executive Steve Jobs introduced the first Intel-based Mac, a new
model of the company's popular iMac line. "With ... Intel's
latest dual-core processor under the hood, the new iMac delivers
performance that will knock our customers' socks off," said Jobs.
</P>
<P>
The new machine also marks a new era for chip supplier
Intel. The iMac is the first computer to use a
new line of Intel chips called Core Duo. A successor
to the Pentium M chip Intel designed for use in
laptop computers, the Core Duo is actually two processors in
one. Each chip has two processing cores that enable it
to handle many simultaneous tasks faster and more reliably than
standard single-core chips.
</P>
<P>
Apple has long relied on PowerPC chips made by IBM Corp,
but IBM didn't introduce new and improved chip designs as
quickly as Intel which, like its rival Advanced Micro Devices
Inc., has been making dual-core Pentium chips since last year.
And the PowerPC chips for Apple's line of iBook and
PowerBook laptop computers lagged behind Intel's and AMD's laptop chips.
</P>
<P>
Cost was also a problem, according to industry analyst Roger Kay,
the president of Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc. in Wayland. Because
Intel produces a huge volume of processor chips for companies
around the world, it can offer chips at lower prices
than IBM. "The benefit that the user gets is the
lower cost that comes from the volume production that Intel
can bring," Kay said.
</P>
<P>
Apple disclosed last year that it would switch over its entire
product line to Intel processors. The company has modified its
Mac OS X operating system to run on the Intel
chips, which are exactly the same as those used by
Windows-based PCs. However, the Intel-based Macs won't be able to
run Windows software.
</P>
<P>
The transition to Intel wasn't supposed to begin until the spring,
but Jobs said that the Intel-based iMac, priced at $1,299,
is available now at Apple retailers. He also revealed a
new Intel-based laptop Mac, priced at $1,999, set to go
on sale next month.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's event, Jobs also unveiled upgrades to Apple's iLife lifestyle
software and iWork productivity software, and the Radio Remote, a
headphone that transforms the company's iPod music player into an
FM radio.
</P>
<P>
The iPod's explosive success was reflected in Apple's financial results. Jobs
said Apple sold 14 million iPods in its first quarter
of fiscal 2006, which ended in December. This helped to
generate quarterly revenues of $5.7 billion, a billion dollars more
than Apple had predicted last October. Apple's results were also
boosted by stronger sales of Mac computers. Apple sold 1.25
million of the machines in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of the iPod has made Apple a major force
in consumer electronics. The company's iTunes Music Store is the
leading distributor of recorded music on the Internet, and has
begun selling downloadable TV programs for viewing on its video
iPod.
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts had expected the company to unveil new products
for the home entertainment market Tuesday. Rival Microsoft launched a
major push of its own at last week's International Consumer
Electronics show in Las Vegas. Microsoft showed off a new
operating system and an array of products for managing music
and movies.
</P>
<P>
Jim Pelham, an analyst at Strategy Analytics Inc., a Boston communications
and entertainment technology consultany, said he has long expected Apple
to introduce other products to build on the iPod's success.
But he understands why the company isn't venturing too far
off the beaten path.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they're really in the position that Microsoft is,
to spread their bets across several niches," said Pelham. Despite
its success in music, Apple remains a niche computer company
with a loyal but relatively small following, Pelham said.
</P>
<P>
Apple's stock surged $4.81 to close at $80.86, while Intel's stock
declined 35 cents to $26.12, both on the Nasdaq stock
exchange.
