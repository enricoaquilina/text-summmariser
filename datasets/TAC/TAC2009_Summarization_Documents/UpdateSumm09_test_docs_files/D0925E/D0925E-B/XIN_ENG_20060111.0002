Apple Computer Inc. on Tuesday
unveiled its first Mac computers based on Intel processors, 
marking a big shift of the computer maker.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a packed crowd of the Apple faithful in the annual 
Macworld show in San Francisco, chief executive Steve Jobs 
released the long-awaited new products: the desktop and laptop 
machines using Intel's dual core chips.
</P>
<P>
The iMac will come in the same sizes and sell for the same 
prices as the current models, but the Intel chips make it two to 
three times faster, Jobs said.
</P>
<P>
A 1.83-gigahertz version of the iMac with a 17-inch screen 
sells for 1,299 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A new laptop computer, called the MacBook Pro, will be 
available in February. The machine, four to five times faster than
current PowerBook laptops, will also include a built-in camera for
video conference, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The MacBook Pro is the fastest Mac notebook ever, obviously," 
Jobs said.
</P>
<P>
Apple had used the PowerPC processors made by IBM and Motorola 
in its Macintosh computers for more than two decades. But the 
company planned a shift to Intel last year, after the PowerPC 
processor was criticized as being slower.
</P>
<P>
With the first personal computer Apple II, Apple had pioneered 
the information technology during the 1980s. Now Apple computers' 
market share is shrinking under competition from cheap producers 
such as Dell, but the company still has a group of loyal fans.
