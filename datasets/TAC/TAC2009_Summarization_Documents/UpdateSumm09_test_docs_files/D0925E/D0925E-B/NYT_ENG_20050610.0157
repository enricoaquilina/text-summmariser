THINK SIMILAR: WHAT'S BEHIND THE APPLE-INTEL ALLIANCE STEVE LOHR CONTRIBUTED REPORTING FROM NEW YORK.

<P>
Nearly a quarter century ago, Apple Computer ran
a snarky ad after its onetime rival encroached on its
territory: "Welcome, IBM. Seriously." This week, however, Steven P. Jobs
had a different message for Big Blue, which had since
become a chief ally -- "Goodbye. Seriously."
</P>
<P>
Jobs, 50, a co-founder of Apple, is famously brash and mercurial.
Even so, the Apple faithful -- not to mention IBM
itself -- were caught by surprise by Apple's decision to
end its 14-year relationship with IBM and team with Intel
for its computer chip needs.
</P>
<P>
The buzz that began Monday among developers, bloggers, analysts and Apple
followers trying to guess Jobs' true designs has not let
up. After all, Jobs is a legend in no small
part because he defied the monster combination that is Wintel
-- as the digerati call the Windows and Intel alliance
-- and lived to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
Apple's decision in the 1980s to use a different chip than
the one used by most personal computers "fit in with
the idea of Think Different," Stephen G. Wozniak, who founded
Apple with Jobs in 1976, said in an e-mail exchange.
"So it's hard for some people to accept this switch."
</P>
<P>
So what could a Macintel possibly hope to accomplish?
</P>
<P>
Potentially, quite a lot. In striking the deal, Jobs, Apple's chief
executive, has opened a range of tantalizing new options for
his quirky company.
</P>
<P>
Many people in the industry believe that Jobs is racing quietly
toward a direct challenge to Microsoft and Sony in the
market for digital entertainment gear for the living room. Indeed,
Sony's top executives had tried to persuade Jobs to adopt
a chip that IBM has been developing for the next-generation
Sony PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
On paper, an Intel processor inside a Macintosh would put the
vast library of Windows-based games and software programs within the
reach of Mac users -- at least those who are
willing to run a second operating system on their computers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, having Intel Inside might solve an important perception problem that
has long plagued Apple in its effort to convert consumers
who are attracted to the company's industrial design, but who
have stayed away because the computers do not run Windows
programs.
</P>
<P>
There is an immediate risk in the tie-up with Intel, however:
Jobs could soon find himself trapped if his best customers
stop buying IBM-based Macintoshes while they wait for more powerful
Intel-based systems, which are likely to begin arriving in January
2006.
</P>
<P>
"There is going to be a long wait," said Mark D.
Stahlman, a Wall Street analyst at Caris &amp; Co. The
power-conserving 64-bit Intel chips that Apple is counting on to
rejuvenate its laptop products will not be available until early
2007, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Jobs rejected the notion that Apple might suffer
from what is known as the "Osborne Effect," a term
that describes the fate of the computer pioneer Adam Osborne
whose firm went bankrupt when he announced a successor to
his pioneering portable computer before it was available.
</P>
<P>
At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, Jobs talked of a
transition that would appear almost seamless to customers. "As we
look ahead we can envision some amazing products we want
to build for you, and we don't know how to
build them with the future Power PC roadmap," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nothing was seamless about how the deal with Intel came together.
</P>
<P>
Several executives close to the last-minute dealings between Apple and IBM
said that Jobs waited until the last moment -- 3
p.m. on Friday, June 4 -- to inform Big Blue.
Those executives said that IBM had learned about Apple's negotiations
with Intel from media reports and that Apple had not
returned phone calls in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The two camps dispute what led to the breakup. People close
to IBM said pricing was a central issue, while Jobs
insisted on stage Monday that IBM had failed to meet
promised performance measures.
</P>
<P>
On stage, Jobs noted that he had promised both a 3-gigahertz
Macintosh as well as a G5 Power PC, promises that
he had not been able to deliver.
</P>
<P>
In the end, Jobs was given no choice but to move
his business to Intel when IBM executives said that without
additional Apple investment they were unwilling to pursue the faster
and lower-power chips he badly needs for his laptop business.
</P>
<P>
"Technical issues were secondary to the business issues," said an executive
close to the IBM side of the negotiations. Because the
business was not profitable, IBM "decided not to continue to
go ahead with the product road map."
</P>
<P>
But Jobs disputed this assessment, simply stating that IBM had failed
to meet its technology roadmap. The issues in the end,
he said, came down to speed and the absence of
a chip that consumed less electricity than traditional processors designed
for PCs.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I heard Steve say that the factor where
Intel's roadmap was superior was processing power per ((watt)) I
knew right away that it was exactly what I have
been reading and saying and so have many others, that
this is the real key to the future of high
performance computers," Wozniak wrote.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
As it happens, Intel's was not the only alternative chip design
that Apple had explored for the Mac. An executive close
to Sony said that last year Jobs had meetings in
California with both Nobuyuki Idei, then the chairman and chief
executive of the Japanese consumer electronics firm, and with Kenichi
Kutaragi, the creator of the Sony PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
Kutaragi tried to interest Jobs in adopting the Cell microprocessor, which
is being developed by IBM for use in the coming
PlayStation 3, in exchange for access to certain Sony technologies.
Jobs rejected the idea, telling Kutaragi that he was disappointed
with the Cell design, which he believed would be even
less effective than the Power PC.
</P>
<P>
Now that Jobs has broken with IBM, Apple is free to
pursue a potentially intriguing consumer electronics strategy with Intel.Intel has
been looking for ways to get its chips into devices
that can compete with game consoles as living-room entertainment hubs.
Indeed, all three next-generation video game machines made by Microsoft,
Nintendo and Sony are based on IBM chips. And analysts
think that both Microsoft's Xbox 360 and the Sony PlayStation
3, scheduled to arrive next spring, will be positioned as
home digital media hubs in addition to being video game
machines -- and priced far lower than the Intel-powered, Windows-based
Media Center PCs that are also aimed at the living
room.
</P>
<P>
Should the new consoles find wide acceptance as broad-based entertainment engines,
Intel will need to respond -- and one attractive alternative
would be an inexpensive Macintosh Mini based on an Intel
processor, capable of running the vast library of PC games.
</P>
<P>
Before he can set his sights on that new market, Jobs
faces the task of shoring up his base, his customers
and developers. On Monday, he made the case to the
software designers who must be willing to rewrite their software
for the new Macintel world.
</P>
<P>
Early indications are that he made a convincing presentation.
</P>
<P>
"The reason people buy Mac is the software, and I think
the real fun is yet to come," said Scott Love,
the president of AquaMinds, a software concern in Palo Alto,
Calif., that sells a Macintosh program called NoteTaker used by
writers, researchers and students. "We'll be able to develop a
program that will just work on both IBM and Intel-based
computers."
</P>
<P>
On the hardware side, Jobs' secret weapon will be his ability
to run Apple's manufacturing business efficiently while the company waits
for its next hit product, whether it is an Intel-based
Mini, or some new category of consumer product for the
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
"One area where Steve is really good and manically focused is
on supply chain issues," said Dan'l Lewin, who worked for
Jobs at both Apple and Next, and who is now
Microsoft's top executive in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
Even more important will be his ability to persuade the Macintosh
faithful to join him in his journey from IBM to
Intel. That is where Jobs has an advantage over virtually
every other business executive.
</P>
<P>
"He is still committed to the idea of an Apple culture,"
said Peter Schwartz, the co-founder and chairman of the Global
Business Network, a consulting firm in Emeryville, Calif. "It is
the counterculture to the dominant Windows culture."
