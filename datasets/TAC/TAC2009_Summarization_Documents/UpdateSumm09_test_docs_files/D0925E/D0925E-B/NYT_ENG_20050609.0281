<P>
Intel Corp., the largest chip maker, on Thursday
increased its revenue forecast for the second quarter because of
strong sales of notebook computers that use its Centrino chip.
</P>
<P>
The company said revenue would be in the range of $9.1
billion to $9.3 billion, higher than the range of $8.6
billion to $9.2 billion it gave in April. The quarter
ends July 2.
</P>
<P>
The revised estimates beat the estimates of Wall Street analysts, who
were expecting sales of about $8.99 billion, according to Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
Intel does not provide earnings guidance, but analysts have forecast a
profit of 28 cents a share for the second quarter.
The company posted earnings of 27 cents a share in
the second quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
Before Intel released its update, shares in the company rose 60
cents on Thursday, to close at $27.70, then fell slightly
in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
Intel's revised forecast capped a week of good news for the
semiconductor sector. On Wednesday, the Semiconductor Industry Association estimated that
worldwide chip sales would increase 6 percent in 2005, to
$226 billion, revising its earlier forecast that pegged 2005 sales
as flat with 2004, saying that high energy prices have
not dampened electronics sales as the industry had feared.
</P>
<P>
And earlier in the week, Texas Instruments raised its financial targets
to the high end of its projected range, citing strong
demand, while National Semiconductor reported better-than-expected earnings.
</P>
<P>
On Monday Intel announced a deal with Apple Computer to provide
the chips that power Macintosh computers, replacing IBM's PowerPC chips,
a crucial vote of confidence for the chip maker as
it moves to put a period of technical setbacks and
missed deadlines behind it.
</P>
<P>
Tim Luke, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, called Intel's revised forecast
encouraging, particularly given recent changes at the company, including a
new chief executive, the move to dual-core processing and a
new manufacturing process known as 65 nanometer.
</P>
<P>
"They are executing well on a series of transitions," said Luke,
whose company has a buy rating on Intel stock.
</P>
<P>
Intel expects gross margins to be approximately 57 percent, plus or
minus a point, as compared with the earlier forecast of
56 percent, plus or minus a couple of points. Intel
also said it expected to benefit from a tax rate
of 26 percent compared with its earlier estimate of a
31 percent rate. Intel's gains from equity investments and other
items are expected to be approximately $100 million.
