Apple's chip switch could open new window for Macs

In the late 1990s, Apple Computer Inc. ran TV ads mocking the Intel Corp. chips
in rival Windows-based PCs: The Pentium II glued to a snail and the toasted
bunny suit were supposed to suggest that Apple's Macintosh computers were simply
faster.
</P>
<P>
How times have changed. Apple CEO Steve Jobs warmly embraced Intel Chief
Executive Paul Otellini this week as they announced that Macs will switch to
chips built by the same company that has made a fortune selling the hardware
that powers PCs running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
Though the transition is likely to be rocky at first for Apple, programmers and
customers, the move could lead to Macs that are both more competitive and more
compatible with Windows. It could even open the Mac to software titles now
available only to Windows users.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Apple would retain as much control as it wants over its
software and brand.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the future performance and energy efficiency improvements Intel has
promised, Apple could deploy an Intel security scheme that could allow Apple to
keep its operating system locked to Macs. Apple also could tap a separate Intel
technology that lets multiple operating systems run efficiently on a single
chip.
</P>
<P>
Such advances could be critical for Apple, which has gained a reputation for
building innovative and stylish machines that run Apple's own, acclaimed Mac OS
X operating system. By not allowing clones, as are common in the Windows world,
Apple can still charge a premium and differentiate itself.
</P>
<P>
After all, the microprocessor may be the brain of a computer, but the soul is
provided by the software, which Apple has said will continue to be locked to its
systems.
</P>
<P>
Apple's business model of selling its own computers and operating system stems
from 1970s, when Jobs and friend Steve Wozniak were pioneering the personal
computer industry from a Silicon Valley garage. At the time, a fledgling company
then-called Micro-Soft was just getting started.
</P>
<P>
That changed in the early 1980s, when International Business Machines Corp.
rushed to put out a personal computer that could compete against Apple. Big Blue
integrated hardware and software from other companies _ namely, Intel and
Microsoft _ into its systems.
</P>
<P>
IBM famously failed to stop competitors from copying its PC. A healthy IBM clone
industry grew, fueled by the support of software developers, who saw the huge
business opportunity in the volume of clone PCs being purchased.
</P>
<P>
Apple continued to sell systems based on non-Intel processors and its own
software. Even in 1984, when it launched the first Mac, it stuck with Motorola
chips and its own software.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, Motorola and Apple joined forces with IBM, which by then long
realized it had lost control of the PC, to build the more powerful PowerPC
microprocessor to do battle with WinTel.
</P>
<P>
But Apple's market share continued to slide. Corporations and consumers embraced
Windows-based systems because they could run more programs. Software developers
loved WinTel because it guaranteed a huge market.
</P>
<P>
Apple became the niche player it is today, with just 2.3 percent of the
worldwide market, according to the latest figures from the research firm
IDC.
</P>
<P>
Still, Jobs managed to continue marketing the Mac as the Porsche of the PC
industry.
</P>
<P>
But IBM and Motorola, which last year spun off its chip business into Freescale
Semiconductor Inc., haven't been able to give Apple what it needs. Freescale's
G4 has seen only incremental improvements in performance while IBM's G5 runs too
hot for notebook computers.
</P>
<P>
And so Jobs went chip hunting.
</P>
<P>
Intel promises Apple fast, energy-efficient chips, manufacturing reliability and
possibly even lower prices.
</P>
<P>
Apple could lose control of its operating system when it starts using next year
the same hardware that powers the Windows world.
</P>
<P>
That's where the new technologies come into play and why Apple is so willing to
make a move.
</P>
<P>
Intel has been touting a hardware-based security plan called LaGrande Technology
as a way to keep systems secure by locking data with a key that's embedded in a
hardware chip.
</P>
<P>
But LaGrande also could be used to ensure that certain software only runs on
permitted machines, such as Mac OS X only running on systems built by
Apple.
</P>
<P>
"You can tie the serial number of the software with the hardware ID, and say
these things go together and shall never be separate," said Roger Kay, an
analyst at IDC.
</P>
<P>
But there's a much bigger opportunity for Apple beyond faster, more efficient
chips. Though it will prevent Mac OS X from leaking non-Apple PCs, it could
allow Apple systems to run Windows _ and its universe of programs _ at full
speed. Currently, running Windows programs on Macs requires emulators that slow
down performance.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that Jobs is putting himself in the sights of Bill Gates," said
Don Yachtman, a Salt Lake City-based software developer. "Microsoft may act like
they don't care about Apple's move to Intel but you never know until they launch
an attack."
</P>
<P>
But Microsoft isn't likely to complain. After all, Apple or its customers would
still have to buy a copy of Windows.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Apple faces technical and psychological hurdles in the near
term.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure some of Apple's loyal customer base see this as a sellout," said Tim
Deal, senior analyst with Technology Business Research. "These users supported
this niche, boutique player for years and this agreement with Intel removes a
very important difference between a Mac and a PC."
