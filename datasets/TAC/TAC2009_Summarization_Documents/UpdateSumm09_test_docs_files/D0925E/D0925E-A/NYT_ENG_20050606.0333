APPLE TO USE INTEL CHIPS

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>

<P>
Apple Computer Inc. began a historic transition Monday:
The Cupertino, Calif., firm plans to switch to Intel Corp.
microprocessors for its Macintosh lineup starting next year.
</P>
<P>
Ending weeks of speculation, Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs confirmed
plans to dump its current lineup of PowerPC chips, which
Apple has long touted as superior to Intel chips. Jobs
said the two firms that have supplied Apple with microprocessors
for years, IBM and the Motorola spin-off Freescale, can no
longer supply the kinds of chips that Apple needs for
future products.
</P>
<P>
Jobs warmly embraced Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini onstage before
hundreds of attendees at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, in
a gesture that symbolized the new partnership between the two
iconic Silicon Valley companies.
</P>
<P>
"We're so happy the world's most innovative computer company and the
world's most innovative chip company have finally teamed up," Otellini
told the crowd at San Francisco's Moscone Center West. "I
think this brings together the skills and the engineering excellence
of two great companies."
</P>
<P>
Apple plans to make the transition over a 21/2-year period. Some
Macs with Intel inside are scheduled to be released in
June 2006, with most of the lineup to be converted
by June 2007. Jobs said he hopes the full switch
will be completed by the end of 2007.
</P>
<P>
Although there has been much speculation through the years about such
a partnership, few realized how long the two firms have
been working on this.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jobs revealed that a team of Apple engineers
has been secretly working on a transition from IBM's PowerPC
platform to an Intel-based architecture for five years inside a
building on the firm's Cupertino campus.
</P>
<P>
In fact, every edition of Macintosh OS X that has been
released since then has been been designed to also run
on the Intel platform "just in case," Jobs said.
</P>
<P>
"The Mac OS has been leading a secret double life for
the past five years," Jobs said. "So Mac OS X
is cross-platform by design right from the very beginning."
</P>
<P>
A few developers in the audience groaned when Jobs confirmed the
switch, but later cheered when Jobs demonstrated a Macintosh desktop
that was already operating on an Intel Pentium 4 3.6
GHz processor.
</P>
<P>
Jobs said Apple decided to start the transition now because Intel's
microprocessor development road map promises features, like more efficient power
consumption, that Apple did not foresee in similar plans for
the PowerPC chip.
</P>
<P>
Apple had great products planned, but "we don't know how to
build them with the current PowerPC program," Jobs said.
</P>
<P>
Apple's move marks a significant but risky combination between two of
Silicon Valley's largest, most visible players.
</P>
<P>
"Every time they've tried to make this kind of transition, they've
managed to lose market share," said Nathan Brookwood, an analyst
at market research firm Insight 64. "And they don't have
that much market share to lose."
</P>
<P>
Shaw Wu, an analyst with American Technology Research of San Francisco,
said the Apple-Intel alliance also presents a marketing problem, because
Apple has spent more than 10 years touting the superiority
of its PowerPC chips over Intel's Pentium. Apple "could risk
alienating some of its loyal customer base," Wu said in
a report.
</P>
<P>
"It's a gamble," said Kevin Krewell, an analyst at In-Stat/MDR, noting
that a transition to a new chip is never easy.
"But if anyone can make this transition, it's Apple. They've
done more transitions than anyone else."
</P>
<P>
The news Monday didn't make waves on Wall Street. Apple closed
at $37.92, down 32 cents per share in Nasdaq trading.
Intel shares were down 62 cents, closing at $19.79.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has major symbolic value, bridging the gap between two
firms that have been on ideologically opposite sides of the
tech world for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Apple has been using Motorola chips since the early 1980s, when
the firm essentially inaugurated the personal computing era. In 1991,
Motorola and IBM began collaborating on the PowerPC, which then
became the central brain for Apple's Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
Although Apple had an early lead in the field, it was
soon overtaken by a powerful partnership that relegated Apple to
a niche technology player. Ironically, that partnership was keyed by
Intel, which paired with Microsoft Corp. to create the "Wintel"
platform, which dominates desktop computing today.
</P>
<P>
Apple's switch comes as IBM, which made G5 processors used in
Macintosh desktops, has also begun to focus on new partners.
A statement IBM released after Jobs' keynote speech did not
react directly to Apple's impending chip switch. Instead, IBM highlighted
its own recent inroads in the video game industry.
</P>
<P>
"IBM is aggressively moving the Power Architecture beyond the PC, as
shown by our recent successes with the next-generation gaming systems
announced by Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo," the statement said. "IBM
is focused on the highest-value opportunities in each marketplace, and
our direction with the Power Architecture is consistent with that
strategy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Freescale Semiconductor Inc., the Austin, Texas, company that spun off
from Motorola in 2004 and makes the G4 chips used
in Apple laptops, also tried to downplay the loss of
Apple.
</P>
<P>
"Apple represents only 3 percent of total Freescale revenues," said a
memo from Freescale Chairman and CEO Michel Mayer to employees,
which the company released publicly. "It was becoming more and
more difficult to justify that level of investment to provide
the customized products Apple required to satisfy a small part
of the market."
</P>
<P>
In the past year or so, some frustration in Cupertino with
IBM was apparent. About a year ago, Apple publicly blamed
IBM for its short supply of PowerPC chips for the
Power Mac G5 desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
Apple later said it had to delay the release of its
new iMac computers because IBM couldn't meet Apple's demand for
similar chips.
</P>
<P>
Another challenge Apple has been facing with IBM is delivering processors
that consume less power and create less heat. One of
the biggest questions for Apple has been whether the computer-maker
will be able to upgrade its lineup of laptop computers
from PowerPC G4 chips to PowerPC G5 chips, which Apple
Executive Vice President Tim Cook has called "the mother of
all thermal challenges."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Jobs said a key factor in the switch was
Intel's plans for chips with a performance-to- power-ratio more than
four times greater than any PowerPC chip in the works.
</P>
<P>
The move to an Intel platform could provide quite a few
headaches for software developers, who now have to retool their
products, although Jobs said Apple engineers already have codes to
ease the transition.
</P>
<P>
Apple announced the availability of a $999 Developer Transition Kit, consisting
of an Intel-based Mac development system along with preview versions
of Apple's own software for the Intel chips.
