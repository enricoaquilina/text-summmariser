In a risky move that could further shrink its minuscule slice of the PC market,
Apple Computer Inc. announced plans Monday to switch its Macintosh computers to
the same Intel Corp. chips used in systems that run Microsoft
Windows.

Apple, which for years suggested its users "Think Different," will join all
other PC makers in using microprocessors built on the x86 architecture. The
technology took root when IBM launched its first PC in 1981 and eventually
turned Apple into a niche player.

"Our goal is to provide our customers with the best personal computers in the
world, and looking ahead Intel has the strongest processor roadmap by far," said
Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. "It's been ten years since our transition to the
PowerPC, and we think Intel's technology will help us create the best personal
computers for the next ten years."

Jobs said Apple will begin offering Macs with Intel processors by June 2006 and
will switch its entire product line by the end of 2007.
