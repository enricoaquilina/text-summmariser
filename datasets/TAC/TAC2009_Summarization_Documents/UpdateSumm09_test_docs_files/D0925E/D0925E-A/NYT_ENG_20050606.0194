INTEL PROCESSORS TO POWER APPLE'S COMPUTERS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apple Computer Inc. Monday dumped IBM Corp. as the supplier of
processor chips for its Macintosh computers. Starting next year, future
Macs will use Intel Corp. processors, the same kinds of
chips found in millions of PCs running software from Apple's
archrival Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
Apple plans to have its first Intel-based computers available a year
from now, and its entire line of desktop and notebook
computers are to feature Intel chips by 2007.
</P>
<P>
The company did not say which Intel chips would be used
in its products, but Intel spokesman Charles Mulloy said they
would be standard Intel processors, just like the Pentium 4
processors found in PCs running Microsoft's Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
The deal, revealed at Apple's annual San Francisco conference for software
developers, had been widely rumored in recent weeks. The original
Mac, released in 1984, used a processor made by Motorola
Inc. A decade ago, Apple switched to PowerPC, a chip
designed by Motorola and IBM.
</P>
<P>
By PC industry standards, the deal is small potatoes. Apple sold
3.8 million Mac computers over the past four quarters, giving
it less than 3 percent of the worldwide desktop computer
market.
</P>
<P>
But Roger Kay, vice president for client computing at IDC Corp.
in Framingham, said Intel will derive big benefits thanks to
Apple's reputation. "It's not just 2 percent of the market
share, it's also a very prestigious company," Kay said.
</P>
<P>
Apple's iPod music players and iTunes Internet music retail store have
made the company one of America's most respected electronics firms,
and Kay said that some of that cachet could rub
off on Intel.
</P>
<P>
IBM has endured major technical difficulties in producing sufficient quantities of
the PowerPC G5, the chip used in today's Macs, and
Apple has publicly criticized IBM for problems which forced Apple
to delay the release of faster Macs. IBM also failed
to deliver a low-power version of the G5 suitable for
use in laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Baker, director of industry analysis at the NPD Group in
Port Washington, N.Y., said Apple's inability to put its most
powerful chip in a laptop was a major problem, at
a time when laptop sales are on the upswing.
</P>
<P>
"I think Apple looked out and said, what are we going
to do here? We're really losing ground," Baker said. Intel
makes the Pentium M, a cool-running chip designed especially for
laptops. Baker predicted the first Apple machines with Intel processors
would probably be laptops, and perhaps the low-end Mac Mini
home machine.
</P>
<P>
Apple has not said how long it will continue to provide
technical support for owners of Macs based on IBM chips,
but the company may have to give strong pledges of
support, or sharp discounts, to sell its remaining stock of
IBM-based machines.
</P>
<P>
The NPD Group's Baker warned that as the release date of
the new Intel Macs draws near, many people will delay
their purchases until the new machines go on sale. "It's
when you get into that last three months or so
and everybody knows it's coming," Baker said. "That's when it's
going to be very difficult for them to get people
into the stores."
