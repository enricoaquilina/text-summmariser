Apple to Put Intel at Its Core

Monday's announcement that Apple Computer Inc.
will use Intel Corp. chips in its PCs made the Mac faithful think:
different.
</P>
<P>
After weeks of rumors and speculation, Apple Chief Executive Steve
Jobs told software engineers at the company's annual developer
conference that Intel microprocessors would power Macintosh computers
beginning next year, with Intel inside all Apple computers by 2007.
</P>
<P>
The move ends a long and sometimes-stormy relationship between
Apple and IBM Corp., which builds the Mac's current PowerPC chips, and
Motorola Inc., which makes chips for Apple laptops. Intel supplies
most of the chips that power PCs running the Windows operating system
of Apple archrival Microsoft Corp. So closely aligned are Microsoft
and Intel that they often are referred to as Wintel.
</P>
<P>
So to some of Apple's Macolytes, the new alliance portended
something sinister for the Cupertino-based company that has leveraged
the success of its iPod portable music players to boost sales of its
stylish but pricey PCs.
</P>
<P>
``Where does this lead us?'' Jobs asked from the stage. Before Jobs
could answer himself, someone in the audience cracked: ``Down the road
to hell.''
</P>
<P>
Despite sentiments like that, computer industry analysts and many
Mac users discounted the long-term effects of the change, saying Apple
has built its reputation on software and design rather than the raw
computing power of its machines. By switching to Intel, they said,
Apple may be able to cut prices on its computers and compete more
directly against low-cost sellers such as Dell Inc.
</P>
<P>
In wooing Apple, Santa Clara-based Intel can claim the prestige of
supplying one of Silicon Valley's most finicky customers, but the
financial benefits will be relatively small. Intel is the world's
largest chip maker and Apple is one of the smallest major PC makers,
with just under 4 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM has already focused its
energies on building chips for the fast-growing video game industry.
Its chip technology will power next-generation game consoles from all
three of the major game companies -- Microsoft, Sony Corp. and
Nintendo Co.
</P>
<P>
On a generally flat day on the financial markets, Apple shares fell
32 cents to $37.92, Intel dropped 16 cents to $27.17 and IBM lost 79
cents to $75.
</P>
<P>
Jobs described the switch to Intel as the third major transition
for Mac computers since the company was formed in 1976. The other two
were the initial switch to PowerPC chips between 1994 and 1996 and the
move to a new operating system, OS X, between 2001 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
The change was fueled by a desire ``to make the best computers
going forward,'' Jobs said, noting that he promised high-performance
desktop and laptop models two years ago that never materialized. ``We
envision amazing products we want to build for you. But we don't know
how to do it on the future of PowerPC.''
</P>
<P>
He did not cite IBM by name, but Apple reportedly had been
frustrated by IBM's inability to develop a chip that could process
immense amounts of data without overheating. Intel, by contrast, touts
its cool-running chips that consume less power.
</P>
<P>
But just because the chips are the same, differences will still
exist between Macs and other PCs. Most noticeably, Apple will continue
to promote the virtues of its operating system, which is widely viewed
as more stable and secure than Windows even if it runs a fraction of
the programs.
</P>
<P>
``This is not a clone play,'' said Jupiter Research consultant
Michael Gartenberg. ``OS X won't run on a Dell or HP machine. Will
someone come up with a hack to do so? Absolutely. But the OS X
installer will not allow it to work on a non-Apple machine that's not
from Cupertino. But I can imagine Microsoft creating an app where you
push a button and get OS X, and push a button and get Windows.''
