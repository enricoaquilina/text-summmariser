Apple's deal with Intel won't rattle IBM's chip plans

While Apple Computer Inc.'s new embrace of Intel Corp. microprocessors leaves
IBM in the cold, the news really isn't bad for Big Blue, which may have found
the Apple account more trouble than it was worth.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, IBM Corp. derived relatively little revenue from making its
"Power" brand of chips for Apple's Macintosh computers, which own about 2
percent of the global market.
</P>
<P>
IBM's future chip plans are focused elsewhere _ notably the next generation of
video game consoles made by Microsoft Corp., Sony Corp. and Nintendo Co. IBM's
chips also power several kinds of IBM server computers, which account for a huge
chunk of the company's hardware revenue.
</P>
<P>
Both kinds of machines require such high levels of performance that it becomes
an expensive and challenging proposition to adapt their chips for personal
computers, especially mobile devices that present stricter energy and cooling
requirements.
</P>
<P>
So while winning Apple's business gives Intel some bragging rights, ceasing to
make chips for Macs will let IBM focus on markets it believes can be much
bigger.
</P>
<P>
"It's never a happy time when you lose a customer, no matter how large they are,
but Apple's impact on the PC market is marginal at best these days," said
Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT Research. "It will have more of a PR
impact than a financial impact."
</P>
<P>
Added SG Cowen Co. analyst Steve Weber: "This move will likely have
indiscernible impact."
</P>
<P>
IBM shares were down 67 cents, 0.9 percent, at $75.12 in afternoon trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
IBM declined to comment on Apple's announcement Monday other than to release a
statement reiterating its chip strategy. "IBM is aggressively moving the Power
architecture beyond the PC," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
While most computer companies long ago abandoned chip manufacturing to
industry-standard suppliers such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., IBM
has stayed with it as part of a broader strategy to distinguish the company as
an innovative, high-end tech provider. That desire to focus on top-tier markets
motivated the recent spinoff of IBM's PC business to China's Lenovo Group
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
With IBM's internal chip needs falling short of the company's manufacturing
capacity _ and demand from outside companies such as Apple only tepid _ IBM's
microelectronics division lost $252 million (now euro205 million) in 2003, the
last year in which IBM released detailed figures. The segment grew at a paltry
0.6 percent in 2004, while IBM's overall sales jumped 8.3 percent to $96 billion
(euro78.2 billion).
</P>
<P>
But IBM's long-term microprocessing bet lies in a new breed of chips, code-named
Cell, being developed with Sony and Toshiba Corp. Promising blazing speeds and
the ability to carry out 10 sets of computing instructions at once, Cell is due
to come out next year.
</P>
<P>
Hopes for Cell are so high that Sony, which plans to use Cell chips in the next
generation of PlayStation game consoles, has invested $325 million (euro264.8
million) in improvements to IBM's semiconductor plant in East Fishkill, New
York.
</P>
<P>
IBM's production of chips for Apple accounted for only about 2 percent of
Fishkill's capacity.
