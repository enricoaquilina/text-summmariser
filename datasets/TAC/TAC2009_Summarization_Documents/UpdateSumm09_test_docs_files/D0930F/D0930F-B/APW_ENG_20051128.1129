BP PLC said Monday it will increase its investment in alternative energy
projects through a new business unit, BP Alternative Energy.
</P>
<P>
BP, which is based in Britain, said it expects to invest up to $8 billion
(euro6.8 billion) in solar, wind, hydrogen and carbon-abatement technology over
ten years.
</P>
<P>
The investment represents only fraction of BP's annual $14 billion (euro12
billion) to $16 billion (euro13.6 billion) in capital expenditures but is an
eightfold increase from the $1 billion (euro850 million) spent over the past
decade, Chief Executive John Browne told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to double its solar capacity from the roughly 100 megawatts of
capacity it currently has in the United States, Spain, India and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Browne said BP was also planning a carbon-sequestration project for 2006 and
2007, in which carbon emissions from power plants would be re-injected in fallow
offshore gas and oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Browne said BP looked to hire "several hundred" staff, including engineers, to
support its new alternative and renewable energy investment plan, which is among
the biggest by an oil major.
</P>
<P>
Browne said he expects the unit to achieve a 15 percent return on
capital.
</P>
<P>
Friends of the Earth, an environmental organization, welcomed BP's "modest"
shift of emphasis to focus more on alternative energy sources.
</P>
<P>
American Depositary Receipts of BP fell $1.72, or 2.5 percent, to close at
$66.11 on the New York Stock Exchange.
