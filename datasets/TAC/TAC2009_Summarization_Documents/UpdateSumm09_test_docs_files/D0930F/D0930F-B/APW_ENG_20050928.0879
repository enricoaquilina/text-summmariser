EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs on Wednesday called on oil companies to
do more to boost refining capacity.
</P>
<P>
Piebalgs said he would meet with executives from major oil companies and ask
them to do more to remove production bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
"I consider it very important that oil companies behave in the most responsible
manner given this situation," he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg,
adding that the European Commission will strengthen dialogue with oil-producing
countries, including OPEC.
</P>
<P>
Europe pays higher prices for oil because it has less refining capacity than the
United States. Several U.S. refineries in the U.S. Gulf have yet to restart work
after suffering storm damage from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
</P>
<P>
Piebalgs reiterated Europe should switch to using alternative energy sources and
boost research of wind, wave and solar, and hydrogen energy and of clean coal
and carbon sequestration.
</P>
<P>
"The energy potential of biomass in the EU needs to be developed. A Biomass
Action Plan will be tabled before the end of the year," he said.
</P>
<P>
MEPs warned against the EU's over-dependence on oil and said Europeans should
diversify their energy sources.
</P>
<P>
"We face structural problems which go far beyond any short-term crisis, said
Fiona Jane Hall, a Liberal Democrat.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution scheduled to be voted on Thursday, lawmakers were to call on EU
governments to initiate a world summit of large consumer and producer
countries.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also calls on the European Commission to ensure the EU becomes
the world's least fossil-fuel-dependent and most energy-efficient economy by
2020.
</P>
<P>
Current EU president Britain aims to win an agreement on a new Europe-wide law
designed to reduce energy consumption before the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the assembly, Britain's Europe Minister Douglas Alexander said
reaching an agreement on the law had grown in importance as oil prices are at
record levels.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation would require EU governments to save at least one percent
more energy a year by promoting savings in the supply and distribution of
electricity, gas, heating and fuels to households, transport and other
industrial consumers.
</P>
<P>
"Promoting energy efficiency is quite rightly at the top of the agenda,"
Alexander told the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The legislation must be approved by the European Parliaments and EU governments
before it can become law.
</P>
<P>
EU energy ministers are due to hold their next meeting in Luxembourg on Oct. 6.
The European Parliament will hold its next plenary session in mid
October.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the institutions will secure what is an important directive,"
Alexander said.
