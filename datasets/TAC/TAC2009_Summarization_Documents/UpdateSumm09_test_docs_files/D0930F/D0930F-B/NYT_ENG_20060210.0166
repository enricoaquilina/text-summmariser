CALIFORNIA POWER PLANT WOULD REUSE CARBON DIOXIDE
</HEADLINE>

Subsidiaries of BP and Edison International said Friday that they were
planning to build a power plant that would run on
oil residues, and that 90 percent of the carbon dioxide
would be captured and pumped into an oilfield, where it
would help push more oil to the surface.
</P>
<P>
The $1 billion plant would be adjacent to a BP refinery
in Carson, Calif., about 20 miles south of Los Angeles,
and would be the first of its kind in the
country, the companies said. BP is already drawing up engineering
plans for a plant in Scotland that would sequester its
carbon dioxide in an underground oil-bearing formation; that plant is
to run on natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The companies said they hoped to make a final decision on
the plant in 2008 and have it running in 2011.
It would qualify for a tax credit as a carbon-free
energy source under the 2005 energy bill, company executives said.
</P>
<P>
The plant would run by mixing an oil residue, petroleum coke,
in a chamber with steam and a controlled amount of
oxygen. In this technique, called gasification, both the fuel and
the water give up hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen gas.
This process also produces carbon monoxide, which is converted to
carbon dioxide, giving off heat to sustain the reaction.
</P>
<P>
The hydrogen is then burned in a turbine engine, the kind
that electric companies normally run on natural gas, and the
dominant combustion product is water. The carbon dioxide is compressed
into a liquid and injected into an oilfield.
</P>
<P>
Although the fuel is an oil residue, and not coal, the
technology is the same as one mentioned by President Bush
in his State of the Union speech on Jan. 31,
in which he said, "we will invest more in zero-emission
coal-fired plants."
</P>
<P>
When coal or other fuels are gasified, conventional pollutants like sulfur
and carbon dioxide, which is believed to be responsible for
climate change, can be removed before combustion, while the volume
of gas is still relatively small.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum coke from the Carson refinery is usually trucked to the
harbor and shipped to China, where it is burned for
fuel.
</P>

As a nearly carbon-free source of electricity, the plant would compete
with wind power. Its construction cost is about double the
cost of a wind turbine, according to Theodore F. Craver
Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Edison Mission Energy,
an unregulated subsidiary of Edison International. But the production of
wind turbines cannot be scheduled, and they generally produce only
about 30 percent as much electricity as they would by
running around the clock; this plant will run 90 to
95 percent of the hours in a year, he said.
And the Los Angeles Basin, where it is located, is
often short of power, he said.
</P>
<P>
Steve Westwell, chief executive of BP Alternative Energy, said that all
of the technologies had already been demonstrated individually, including separating
carbon dioxide from hydrogen, and pumping the carbon dioxide under
pressure into the ground. One area in which the project
would stretch existing technologies is in the turbine; hydrogen burns
hotter than natural gas, and tends to make turbine blades
brittle.
</P>
<P>
BP is seeking to put the carbon dioxide in oilfields owned
by Occidental Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who attended the project announcement, said, "This will
be the first plant of its kind in the whole
country, and I think it is a perfect fit for
our state."
