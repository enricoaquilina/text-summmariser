Experts from around the world 
gathered in Paris Tuesday for a UNESCO conference on oceans, coasts 
and islands where the focus will be on stemming the erosion of 
biodiversity and the depletion of fish stocks, the UN's science and 
education body said.
</P>
<P>
"The experts will examine progress made in achieving the 
objectives set by the international community ... to improve 
conservation and management of the marine environment that makes up 
72 percent of the surface of our planet," according to a press 
release.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-eight countries are represented in the week-long 
conference, including 21 small island developing states (SIDS), 
which are heavily dependent on the sea for economic development.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO said the conference would also tackle questions of 
governance and climate change.
</P>
<P>
"High seas governance is particularly important as 64 percent of 
the worlds oceans lie beyond the limits of national jurisdictions 
and are subject to considerable stress, notably due to fishing," 
UNESCO said.
</P>
<P>
"The debate on oceans and climate will focus on the problems of 
acidification, carbon dioxide sequestration and Arctic change.
</P>
<P>
"Climate change is expected to emerge as a major cause for the 
loss of biodiversity by the end of the century and to increase the 
vulnerability of coastal communities through erosion and flooding," 
it said.
