The European Commission called on EU nations Tuesday to back a Danish pilot
project meant to boost the use of cleaner energy sources.
</P>
<P>
It said the start of a new pilot energy plant at the Elsam power station near
Esjberg, Denmark, expected on Wednesday, offered a way ahead in the search for
near-zero carbon dioxide emissions, in efforts to stem global
warming.
</P>
<P>
EU spokeswoman Antonia Mochan said the project received euro8.5 million (US$10
million) in EU research funding to get it off the ground. The project foresees
the first use of new technology to capture carbon emitted from the conventional
power plant and store it underground.
</P>
<P>
The technology can be used on coal and oil power plants and can also be used in
oil refineries.
</P>
<P>
The plant at Elsam will be the first to test the new technology, the EU said.
"By developing technologies for carbon capture and storage, we can reduce
emissions in the medium term as we move to large scale use of renewable,
carbon-free energy sources," said EU Research Commissioner Janez Potocnik in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The EU said it hoped to use the project to ensure the 25-nation bloc meets its
international commitments to reduce carbon emissions.
</P>
<P>
The EU and China signed an agreement last month to encourage the development of
cleaner coal-fired power plants, also with the new technology to capture carbon
dioxide emitted from coal burning plants.
</P>
<P>
China is heavily dependent on coal, which accounts for 70 percent of its energy
consumption. In the EU, fossil fuels account for around 85 percent.
