<P>
President Bush, in one of the least-noticed gestures
of his European visit, has pledged to help developing nations
such as China and India cut back on their fast-growing
output of the greenhouse gases linked to global warming.
</P>
<P>
Bush signed a pact with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Wednesday
to help poorer countries adopt more energy-efficient technologies in power
generation, transportation and industry.
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement lacked specific commitments for new spending, diplomats and
analysts say it could help take political pressure off the
United States, the world's largest polluter, and remove a major
obstacle to achieving the goals set out in the Kyoto
Protocol, the agreement on climate change that went into effect
Feb. 16 despite a U.S. boycott.
</P>
<P>
The Bush-Schroeder agreement "can be very meaningful as a start. It
can get the United States and developing countries on board,"
said ZhongXiang Zhang, an energy and climate policy analyst at
the East-West Center, a think tank in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto Protocol's weak point is that even as wealthy nations
cut back on pollution, greenhouse gas emissions from China, India
and other developing nations keep rising at a sizzling rate.
</P>
<P>
China's emissions of carbon dioxide, the most common greenhouse gas, are
rising at more than twice the rate of the United
States, while Germany's overall output is dropping. In fact, China
is widely projected to overtake the United States as the
world's top source of greenhouse gases by 2025.
</P>
<P>
"China is building a new 1,000-megawatt power plant every week with
old, Eisenhower-era technology," said Douglas Ogden, director of the China
program at the Energy Foundation in San Francisco. "They're going
to keep building the oldest, dirtiest plants unless we do
something. The world can ill afford even one greenhouse gas
producer on the U.S. scale, let alone two."
</P>
<P>
China and other developing nations are exempted from the Kyoto Protocol's
rules for emission cutbacks because their governments are afraid the
limits would hobble their rise from poverty.
</P>
<P>
"The European side wants hard targets from the United States and
developing countries, which is ... very difficult," Zhang said. "But
if they can work together to subsidize advanced technologies ...
it would be very positive."
</P>
<P>
The key to the U.S.-German initiative is the most polluting of
major energy sources -- coal.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder and British Prime Minister Tony Blair are pressing Bush to
join them in creating an ambitious aid program to help
developing nations adopt new technologies that reduce emissions from coal
power plants and save energy. Blair holds the annual rotating
presidency of the G-8, the group of industrialized nations, and
he says he will make the proposal a top priority
for the group's summit meeting in July.
</P>
<P>
Although environmentalists advocate the expansion of wind and solar energy production,
China and India are expected to continue to rely on
their huge reserves of coal for most of their energy
needs in the near future. The two countries derive 80
percent and 65 percent, respectively, of their electricity from coal,
compared to the U.S. share of 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Coal is really the workhorse for the economies of India and
China in the decades to come, so that's why coal
is so important for global warming," said Bernd Kramer, minister
counselor for science, technology and environment at the German Embassy
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
In the next eight years, China expects to put into operation
562 coal-fired plants -- nearly half the world's total --
and India is projected to add 213 such plants, according
to government figures. The United States is expected to build
only 72.
</P>
<P>
For years, the U.S. government has invested heavily in clean-energy research.
For 2005, it budgeted nearly $3 billion for research and
development of climate-change technology, mostly through subsidies and tax breaks
for work on hydrogen fuel-cell developments and so-called clean coal
technology, which releases less carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
Hydrogen fuel cells are widely believed to be 15 to 20
years away from commercial viability, while clean-coal technology is already
on the market. The most prominent clean-coal method goes by
the cumbersome name of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle, or IGCC.
Under the process, coal is turned into a gas, which
is then burned in a process that allows carbon dioxide
to be siphoned off rather than released into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Plants built with this technology release 15 percent less carbon dioxide
and can be combined with a futuristic option called "carbon
sequestration," in which the carbon dioxide byproduct is injected into
oil and gas aquifers underground, eliminating emissions altogether.
</P>
<P>
What is needed now is not further research but aid to
get these two methods to market, say Schroeder, Blair and
many experts.
</P>
<P>
One prominent environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington,
has estimated that the extra cost of using IGCC and
carbon sequestration in all plants being built in developing nations
would be just $6 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
"This amount would be a huge investment in global security, and
it is very low compared to the $50 billion that
the G-8 gave in development assistance last year," said David
Hawkins, the council's climate policy director.
</P>
<P>
If China, India and other nations start snapping up this new
technology, a big winner could be San Francisco's Bechtel Corp.,
which has already built two coal-fired power plants and two
nuclear plants in China, with several more under construction or
projected. Bechtel recently formed an alliance with General Electric Co.
to develop IGCC power plants.
</P>
<P>
Amos Avidan, a principal vice president of Bechtel, said China is
eager to make its power plants cleaner and reduce the
nation's severe air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The IGCC technology "hasn't yet taken off," Avidan said, "but we
believe it can become a mainstream technology in a couple
of years or so and eliminate the cost gap. We
think it has great potential for China."
</P>
<P>
Other industry analysts are more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
"The problem with these leapfrog technologies is they have a well-proven
track record of mostly failing," said Dale Simbeck, vice president
of technology for SFA Pacific Inc., a Mountain View energy
industry consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are only two IGCC power plants operating
in the United States, despite two decades of federal subsidies.
One failed attempt was the Pinon Pine power plant, an
IGCC plant near Reno completed in 2000 at a price
tag of $335 million, split equally between a local power
company and the U.S. Energy Department. The plant has been
plagued by technical snafus and has never been fully operational.
</P>
<P>
Simbeck, who has worked as a consultant on China power issues
for the World Bank and the Chinese government, said China
has enough technological know-how. Its main barrier, he said, is
rigid government policies that shield state-owned power companies from competition.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese are just telling the West what it wants --
'Help us build with IGCC, please help fund these with
our companies' -- but it's not necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee Schipper, director of transportation research for World Resources Institute in
Washington, said China's reputation as a big polluter is unfair.
The Beijing government is spending billions of dollars annually on
pollution prevention, he noted.
</P>
<P>
China's efficiency programs are getting a boost from European and Bay
Area experts. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is working with the
Energy Foundation on a host of programs, ranging from consumer
appliance standards to building codes. And the California Air Resources
Board has helped Chinese federal and state governments set up
air-quality monitoring programs.
</P>
<P>
"China is improving at many times the rate of improvement in
the United States," Schipper said. "The Bush administration should be
getting its own carbon house in order instead."
