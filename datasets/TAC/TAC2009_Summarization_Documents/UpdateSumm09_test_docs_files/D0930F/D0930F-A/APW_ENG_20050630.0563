Oil group BP PLC said Thursday it has formed a joint venture with
ConocoPhillips, Shell Transport &amp; Trading Co. and Scottish and Southern
Energy to begin work on a project to generate "carbon-free" electricity from
hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
BP said the project, which would make use of a power station in northern
Scotland and export the carbon dioxide to a North Sea oil reservoir, would
require total capital investment of some US$600 million (euro497
million).
</P>
<P>
Initial engineering feasibility studies have been completed, BP said, and the
partners are now working to confirm the economic viability of the
project.
</P>
<P>
BP said it expects that review to be completed in the second half of 2006,
allowing a final investment decision to be made next year. If approved, the
group plans to start operation of the project in 2009.

<P>
"This is an important and unique project configured at a scale that can offer
significant progress in the provision of cleaner energy and the reduction of
carbon dioxide emissions," said BP Chief Executive Lord Browne.
</P>
<P>
"For example, if applied to just 5 percent of the new electricity-generating
capacity that the world is projected to require by 2050, such schemes would have
the potential to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by around 1 billion tons
a year _ a material step in the challenge the world faces," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In its March 2005 budget, the British government announced that it is examining
the potential for new economic incentives to support the development of carbon
capture and storage technologies and applications.
</P>
<P>
The BP-led project would convert natural gas to hydrogen and carbon dioxide
gases, then use the hydrogen gas as fuel for a 350 megawatt power station near
Peterhead, northern Scotland, and export the carbon dioxide to a North Sea oil
reservoir for increased oil recovery and ultimate storage.
</P>
<P>
When fully operational, the project would be expected to capture and store
around 1.3 million tons of carbon dioxide each year and provide 'carbon-free'
electricity to the equivalent of a quarter of a million U.K. homes. BP said the
project would reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere by
the power generation by over 90 percent.
