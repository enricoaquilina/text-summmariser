"Carbon storage" gets a push in hopes for defeating global 
warming

<P>
Less than a decade ago, the idea 
of capturing and storing the carbon gases blamed for driving the 
Earth towards climate-change peril was usually dismissed with a 
laugh.
</P>
<P>
But a top scientific forum here shows how far the argument for 
carbon sequestration has come, with a series of experts insisting it 
can be transformed from fiction to fact.
</P>
<P>
Driving their case is the fear that time is running out for 
dealing cheaply with the carbon pollution spewed out by fossil 
fuels.
</P>
<P>
These emissions trap the Sun's heat and disrupt Earth's fragile 
climate system, with potentially catastrophic effects a few decades 
from now.
</P>
<P>
Their focus is on power stations which burn oil, gas and coal, 
and whose pollution is set to soar in coming years as China and 
India, the two world's most populous countries, meet surging needs 
for energy.
</P>
<P>
Sequestrators say carbon dioxide (CO2) would be captured using 
solvents, either before or after the fossil fuel is burned in the 
plant.
</P>
<P>
The CO2 would then be pumped out, sometimes over hundreds of 
kilometers (miles), to disused oil and gas fields up to one 
kilometer (3,250 feet) underground, and stored.
</P>
<P>
It would not be the miracle cure to global warming or switch off 
the dependence on fossil fuels that are the source of the problem, 
they admit.
</P>
<P>
Even so, "it can play a global role, making very large and very 
rapid reductions of CO2 emissions," Jon Gibbins of Imperial College 
London said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to a pilot scheme in the North Sea as proof of its 
feasibility.
</P>
<P>
An experiment in Norway's offshore field, Sleipner, has been 
storing a million tonnes of waste CO2 per year since 1996, pumping 
it 1,000 metres (3,250 feet) below a cap of shale and mudstone.
</P>
<P>
Another project is in North America, where CO2 is being 
extracted from a coalgas plant in Wyoming and pumped 300 kms (185 
miles) to Weyburn, in Canada's Saskatchewan province, where it is 
stored in an empty underground chamber in a working oilfield.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say the answer to global warming is to slash 
emissions themselves and swiftly wean the world off dirty fossils 
and onto renewable sources and hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
They also warn that the stored carbon is simply a bequeathed 
hazard for future generations. If the geological storage tank leaks 
or is breached by an earthquake the outpouring of CO2 would 
instantly damage the world's climate system.
</P>
<P>
Gibbins says former oil and gas fields in sedimentary basins, 
but also many types of water aquifers, are excellent options for 
safe storage: "We are looking at 90 percent retention [of the gas] 
for 1,000 years."
</P>
<P>
Taking out the CO2 from fuel is called "carbon neutral," in 
other words not adding further to emissions from that source.
</P>
<P>
But a more ambitious possibility is "carbon negative," or 
removing CO2 from the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
That could be done by biofuels, suggests Peter Read, a professor 
at Massey University in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Plants suck CO2 out of the air as part of photosynthesis. By 
growing plants, burning them in fossil-fuel power stations and then 
sequestrating and storing the carbon, a dent could be made on ors would increase by 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, world electricity demand is projected to 
double, with fossil fuels supplying most of the need.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, ending in this southwestern city on 
Thursday, focussed on scientists' latest assessment of the global 
warming problem.
