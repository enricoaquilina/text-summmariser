Water Safety Worries EPA Chief
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<P>
EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson predicted
Wednesday that safeguarding the country's water supply -- both from
terrorists and pollutants -- will be the environmental issue of the
coming decades.
</P>
<P>
``I believe water, over the next decade and further, will be the
environmental issue that we as a nation and, frankly, as a world will
be facing,'' he said. Keeping the nation's water safe and secure, he
added, is ``an area of vulnerability for the United States and also an
opportunity for us.''
</P>
<P>
The first scientist to head the agency, Johnson said that in
addition to helping the Department of Homeland Security secure the
water supply, he wanted to find economically viable solutions for the
10 percent of Americans whose drinking water is not healthy -- and for
cities and municipalities facing huge bills to improve aging water
treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
In his first interview with reporters since being confirmed by the
Senate last month, Johnson, a 54-year-old biologist and career
official at the Environmental Protection Agency, also talked about
controversies that recently have plagued the agency.
</P>
<P>
Asked about charges this week by an unnamed EPA scientist that the
Bush administration had watered down reports about global climate
change, Johnson talked about the need for good communications -- and
sound science.
</P>
<P>
``We have a number of people inside the agency and across
administrations that look at the documents to try to make sure that we
are staying true to the science and at the same time communicating
effectively,'' he said. ``And on any particular issue if the way it is
said isn't your particular leaning or viewpoint, then you say `You've
compromised the science,' or `You haven't done a good job of
communicating.' ''
</P>
<P>
Conceding the existence of climate change but not ready to predicts
its severity or its causes, Johnson said, ``My focus is on advancing
technologies and achieving real results.'' He touted a program he
called Methane to Market, which captures methane gases for energy use.
</P>
<P>
. ``The answer is going to be the technologies,'' he said. ``Why
aren't we focusing on making that a reality rather than the rhetoric
of global climate change?''
</P>
<P>
A native of Washington, D.C., Johnson said that after almost 25
years at the agency, he is well familiar with political rhetoric from
the business and environmental communities as well as from Congress,
the public and the press. ``I've heard it all,'' he said. ``I don't
want to waste time focusing on the rhetoric. I want to get past
that.''
</P>
<P>
Johnson took Congress to task for failing to ratify international
environmental treaties that the United States has signed on to --
including the Persistent Organic Pollutant Treaty, which reduces or
eliminates the production, use or release of 12 toxic chemicals. The
United States, a leader in pressing for the agreement, signed the
treaty on May 23, 2001. Congress has yet to ratify the pact.
</P>
<P>
He made no mention of the U.S. refusal to sign on to the Kyoto
international agreement to restrict greenhouse gases, which took
effect in 140 nations earlier this year. Both Congress and President
Bush have opposed it, advocating voluntary steps instead.
</P>
<P>
Noting that treaties can take years to negotiate and then ratify,
Johnson said of the organic pollutant pact, ``Frankly, I don't want to
wait.''
</P>
<P>
While he said he would prefer a legislative solution to a
regulatory one, Johnson said he would forge ahead if Congress does not
act -- as the EPA did in March in issuing a rule limiting mercury
emissions from new and existing coal-fired power plants.
</P>
<P>
``We've got a Mercury problem internationally,'' Johnson said. He
said he hopes to share ``the very technologies that we're going to use
in the United States for dealing with mercury control'' -- such as
techniques called activated carbon injection or carbon sequestration
-- with other countries that are contributing to the mercury problem,
like China.
</P>
<P>
He also advocated bridging shortfalls in the U.S. energy supply
with alternatives from nuclear to solar, and he foresaw the day when
environmental requirements could be ``the driver'' of economic
progress. ``We as a nation are facing significant shortfalls,'' he
said. ``Either we at EPA can be a stumbling block or we can provide
incentives.''
