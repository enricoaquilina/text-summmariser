DIRTY SECRET: COAL PLANTS COULD BE MUCH CLEANER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost a decade ago, Tampa Electric opened an innovative power plant
that turned coal, the most abundant but the dirtiest fossil
fuel, into a relatively clean gas, which it burns to
generate electricity. Not only did the plant emit significantly less
pollution than a conventional coal-fired power plant, but it was
also 10 percent more efficient.
</P>
<P>
Hazel R. O'Leary, the secretary of energy at the time, went
to the plant, situated between Tampa and Orlando, and praised
it for ushering in a "new era for clean energy
from coal." Federal officials still refer to the plant's "integrated
gasification combined cycle" process as a "core technology" for the
future, especially because of its ability -- eventually -- to
all but eliminate the greenhouse gases linked to global warming.
</P>
<P>
Since that plant opened, however, not a single similar plant has
been built in the United States. Abundant supplies of natural
gas -- a bit cleaner and, until recently, a lot
cheaper -- stood in the way.
</P>
<P>
But even now, with gas prices following oil prices into the
stratosphere and power companies turning back to coal, most new
plants -- about nine out of 10 on the drawing
board -- will not use integrated gasification combined-cycle technology.
</P>
<P>
The reason is fairly simple. A plant with the low-pollution, high-efficiency
technology demonstrated at the Tampa Electric plant is about 20
percent more expensive to build than a conventional plant that
burns pulverized coal. This complicates financing, especially in deregulated markets,
while elsewhere utilities must persuade regulators to set aside their
customary standard of requiring utilities to use their lowest-cost alternatives.
(A federal grant of $143 million covered about a fourth
of the construction cost of the Tampa Electric plant, which
was originally a demonstration project.)
</P>
<P>
The technology's main long-term advantage -- the ability to control greenhouse
gas emissions -- is not winning over many utilities because
the country does not yet regulate those gases.
</P>
<P>
That could be a problem for future national policy, critics say,
because the plants being planned today will have a lifetime
of a half-century or more. "It's a very frightening specter
that we are going to essentially lock down our carbon
emissions for the next 50 years before we have another
chance to think about it again," said Jason S. Grumet,
the executive director of the National Commission on Energy Policy.
</P>
<P>
The commission, an independent, bipartisan advisory body, has recommended that the
federal government spend an additional $4 billion over 10 years
to speed the power industry's acceptance of the technology. In
a recent report, the commission concluded that "the future of
coal and the success of greenhouse gas mitigation policies may
well hinge to a large extent on whether this technology
can be successfully commercialized and deployed over the next 20
years."
</P>
<P>
Grumet was more succinct. Integrated gasification combined cycle technology, combined with
the sequestration of carbon stripped out in the process, "is
as close to a silver bullet as you're ever going
to see," he said.
</P>
<P>
Until Congress regulates carbon emissions -- a move that many in
the industry consider inevitable, but unlikely soon -- gasification technology
will catch on only as its costs gradually come down.
Edward Lowe, general manager of gasification for GE Energy, a
division of General Electric that works with Bechtel to build
integrated gasification combined-cycle plants, said that would happen as more
plants were built. The premium should disappear entirely after the
first dozen or so are completed, he added.
</P>
<P>
Even now, Lowe said, the technology offers operational cost savings that
offset some of the higher construction costs. And if Congress
eventually does limit carbon emissions, as many utility executives say
they expect it to do, the technology's operational advantages could
make it a bargain.
</P>
<P>
James E. Rogers, the chief executive of Cinergy, a heavily coal-dependent
Midwestern utility, is one of the technology's biggest industry supporters.
"I'm making a bet on gasification," he said, because he
assumes a carbon-constrained world is inevitable. "I don't see any
other way forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
The operating savings of such plants start with more efficient combustion:
They make use of at least 15 percent more of
the energy released by burning coal than conventional plants do,
so less fuel is needed. The plants also need about
40 percent less water than conventional coal plants, a significant
consideration in arid Western states.
</P>
<P>
But for some people, including Rogers and other utility leaders who
anticipate stricter pollution limits, the primary virtue of integrated gasification
combined-cycle plants is their ability to chemically strip pollutants from
gasified coal more efficiently and cost-effectively, before it is burned,
rather than trying to filter it out of exhaust.
</P>
<P>
Proponents say that half of coal's pollutants -- including sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to acid rain and smog
-- can be chemically stripped out before combustion. So can
about 95 percent of the mercury in coal, at about
a tenth the cost of trying to scrub it from
exhaust gases racing up a smokestack.
</P>
<P>
The biggest long-term draw for gasification technology is its ability to
capture carbon before combustion. If greenhouse-gas limits are enacted, that
job will be much harder and more expensive to do
with conventional coal-fired plants. Lowe, the GE executive, estimated that
capturing carbon would add about 25 percent to the cost
of electricity from a combined-cycle plant burning gasified coal, but
that it would add 70 percent to the price of
power from conventional plants.
</P>
<P>
Gasification technology, although new to the power sector, has been widely
used in the chemical industry for decades, and the general
manager of the gasification plant run by Tampa Electric, Mark
Hornick, said it was not difficult to train his employees
to run the plant. Tampa Electric is the principal subsidiary
of TECO Energy of Tampa.
</P>
<P>
Disposing of the carbon dioxide gas stripped out in the process,
however, is another matter. Government laboratories have experimented with dissolving
the gas in saline aquifers or pumping it into geologic
formations under the sea. The petroleum industry has long injected
carbon dioxide into oil fields to help push more crude
to the surface.
</P>
<P>
Refining and commercializing these techniques is a significant part of a
$35 billion package of clean energy incentives that the National
Commission on Energy Policy is recommending. The Senate considered some
of those ideas in a big energy policy bill last
week, but it is doubtful whether Congress will approve the
funds to enact them because they are tied to regulating
carbon emissions for the first time, something that many industry
leaders and sympathetic lawmakers oppose.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Still, the energy bill may have some incentives for industry to
adopt gasification technology, and the Department of Energy will continue
related efforts. These include FutureGen, a $950 million project to
demonstrate gasification's full potential -- not just for power plants
but as a source of low-carbon liquid fuels for cars
and trucks as well, and, further out, as a source
of hydrogen fuel.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the politics of carbon caps, the Energy Department has
made it clear that it intends to push the development
of integrated gasification combined-cycle technology. Last month, for example, Mark
Maddox, a deputy assistant secretary, said at an industry gathering
that the technology "is needed in the mix -- needed
now."
</P>
<P>
Some industry leaders are skeptical, to say the least. "We would
not want to put all of our eggs in one
basket as far as a single technology is concerned," said
William Fang, deputy counsel for the Edison Electric Institute, a
trade association whose members, shareholder-owned utilities, account for three-quarters of
the country's generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added, many of his members think that mandatory carbon
controls, in place in much of the world since the
Kyoto Protocol came into force in February, can be kept
at bay in the United States -- possibly indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
It's a risky strategy -- for industry and for the climate.
"Coal-fired plants are big targets," said Judi Greenwald of the
Pew Center on Global Climate Change, "and if we do
get serious about climate change, they are going to be
on the list of things to do quite early."
