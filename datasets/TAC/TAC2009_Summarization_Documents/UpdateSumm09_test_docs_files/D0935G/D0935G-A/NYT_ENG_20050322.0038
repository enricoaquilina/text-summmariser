Cox News Service WASHINGTON On the day when Washington's new baseball
team won its first exhibition game, President Bush honored Jackie
Robinson in a congressional ceremony on Wednesday and welcomed the
champion Boston Red Sox to the White House. The ceremony
marking the Red Sox first World Series win since 1918
was an upbeat event despite political overtones. Pitcher Curt Schilling,
who presented Bush with a team jersey, campaigned for the
president last year. But team executives backed Massachusetts Sen. John
Kerry. John Henry, a Kerry backer and the team's principal
owner, was ill and skipped the event. Red Sox General
Manager Theo Epstein also endorsed Kerry, saying last year, "It's
been four days and I'm finally starting to believe the
Red Sox won the World Series and I still can't
believe George Bush is president of the United States." Epstein
attended the White House south lawn event, but sat with
the audience instead of joining the team and Bush on
stage. Massachusetts Sens. Kerry and Ted Kennedy, two of Bush's
harshest critics, attended the event, though Kerry was late in
arriving from the Robinson ceremony at the Capitol. Bush spotted
Kerry as he arrived. "Good to see you," Bush told
his former foe. "I like to see Senator Kerry, except
when we're fixing to debate. If you know what I
mean." Bush, former managing partner of the Texas Rangers, greeted
the Red Sox with a jab aimed at the fact
that they had not won the championship since 1918. "So,
like, what took you so long?" he joked, noting that
Woodrow Wilson was president the last time the Red Sox
won the World Series. Bush praised the Red Sox for
their hustling style of play and touted their organization for
its long-standing charitable programs, including The Jimmy Fund. Just before
welcoming the team to the White House, Bush participated in
a Congressional Gold Medal ceremony for the late Robinson, the
first black to play in Major League Baseball. "This is
a guy who inspired little 7-year-olds to dream of wearing
42 and dashing for home in Brooklyn," Bush said, "and
a 7-year-old like me hoping to get his Topps baseball
card, even though I was a Giants fan." "He was
an amazing guy. And his story was powerful then and
it is powerful today," Bush said. The baseball events came
as the Washington Nationals, who moved to the city from
Montreal during the off-season, defeated the New York Mets 5-3
in their first exhibition game in Florida. Bush is expected
to throw the ceremonial first pitch when the Nationals play
their first regular season home game on April 14. The
name of a prominent Democrat will also be associated with
that game. The Nationals will play in Robert F. Kennedy
Memorial Stadium, named for the late Democratic senator and attorney
general. Ken Herman's e-mail address is khermancoxnews.com
