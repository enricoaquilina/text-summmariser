</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Washington Nationals will make 
their debut in the nation's capital when they host the New York Mets 
in a major league baseball exhibition game on April 3.
</P>
<P>
The game will be played at RFK Stadium, which will serve as the 
Nationals' temporary home before their new stadium is constructed.
</P>
<P>
Formerly the Montreal Expos, the Nationals were officially 
relocated to Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
After the move was approved the team's future in the District of 
Columbia briefly seemed in jeopardy when stadium funding hit a snag, 
but local officials have since approved a plan for public funding of 
a 400 million-dollar stadium.
