GAME FULL OF FIRSTS HAS A FAMILIAR FEEL

VIERA, Fla.
</DATELINE>

<P>
The Montreal Expos can move to Washington, change
their name and never play the Canadian national anthem again,
but they cannot seem to go anywhere without the New
York Mets following along for a photo-op.
</P>
<P>
Despite everything that has changed with this vagabond franchise, its trusty
sidekick remains the same. More than 35 years after the
Mets welcomed the Expos to the major leagues and more
than five months after they ushered them out, the Mets
once again rode shotgun into history on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spring training schedule-makers have quite a sense of symmetry. The
Expos played their first regular-season game against the Mets in
1969 and their last game against the Mets on Oct.
3, so it was only fitting that the Washington Nationals
would play their first game against the Mets on opening
day in the Grapefruit League.
</P>
<P>
If anyone missed the nostalgic significance of the event, the Mets
will travel to Washington for the Nationals' first game at
RFK Stadium, an exhibition on April 3. By the end
of the regular season, these two National League East companions
will have met 26 times. "It's getting really weird," Washington
outfielder Brad Wilkerson said. "It's always us and them."
</P>
<P>
In the first regular-season game between thesefranchises, Tom Seaver started for
the Mets at Shea Stadium and Coco Laboy powered the
Expos to an 11-10 victory. In their last meeting, Tom
Glavine started for the Mets at Shea and Todd Zeile
homered to deal the Expos an 8-1 defeat. On Wednesday
at Space Coast Stadium, Glavine started again for the Mets
and the Nationals came back for a 5-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
"To start the last game and start the first game," Glavine
said, "that's pretty cool."
</P>
<P>
The Mets can take solace in lessons of the past. When
they dropped the opener to this franchise in 1969, they
went on to win the World Series. "Maybe that's an
omen for our team," said Mets outfielder Ron Calloway, who
came over from the Expos this winter. "Or maybe it's
just a reach."
</P>
<P>
To celebrate their first game, the Nationals wore their regular-season home
uniforms instead of their batting-practice jerseys. They got their first
hit from shortstop Christian Guzman and their first home run
from outfielder Jose Guillen, both off-season acquisitions. The Nationals have
sold 20,000 season-ticket packages in Washington, but they drew a
more modest sellout of 7,558 in Viera on Wednesday. After
the third inning, there was still a traffic jam outside
the stadium, with ticket-holders trying to get into the grass
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of enthusiasm and anticipation," Washington manager Frank
Robinson said. "There is interest in this ball club that
hasn't been there before."
</P>
<P>
The Nationals were not the only players on a new team.
Doug Mientkiewicz started his first game for the Mets at
first base and made a nifty scoop on a double
play. Kazuo Matsui started his first spring-training game at second
base and successfully charged two grounders, bare-handing one and short-hopping
the other. Carlos Beltran was in the Mets' lineup for
the first time and went 1 for 3 with a
searing single. "I was a little nervous," Beltran said. "But
that's just me."
</P>
<P>
With Mike Piazza and Cliff Floyd back in Port St. Lucie,
and Mike Cameron rehabilitating from wrist surgery, Beltran was the
second-most popular reason to watch Wednesday's game. "Whenever I throw
my last warm-up pitch, I always turn around to make
sure everybody is ready," Glavine said after working two shutout
innings. "To see the new guys we had out there,
and to see Carlos in center field, it was a
good feeling."
</P>
<P>
Even the Mets' rookie manager, Willie Randolph, was bouncing out of
the dugout to greet players coming off the field. After
the Mets hired Randolph in November, one of the first
congratulatory calls he received was from Robinson. And after Randolph
put on a Mets' uniform for the first time last
month, one of his first calls was to Robinson.
</P>
<P>
This game will undoubtedly be remembered as the Nationals' introduction to
baseball, but it also included two African-American managers who have
relied on each other for support.
</P>
<P>
"I think Willie is going to do really well," Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
Randolph seemed much more comfortable than Omar Minaya, the Mets' general
manager, who could be forgiven for forgetting for a day
which organization signs his paycheck. Minaya, the Expos' general manager
the past three years, helped make the Nationals a competitor
and the Mets a contender. In the first of many
reunions with his former team, Minaya wore a blue hat
with a white M on the front. The hat was
not a new style released by the Mets. It was
worn by the Montreal Royals, Jackie Robinson's first professional baseball
team.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy today, and I'm also a little bit sad," Minaya
said. "I'm happy for Washington, but I'm sad for Montreal.
It can be sort of emotional. There is a lot
of newness here today."
</P>
<P>
As a sign that not everything had changed, the former first-round
draft choice Aaron Heilman allowed three runs in two innings
for the Mets, wasting a pair of run-scoring hits from
Jason Phillips. Felix Heredia, who frustrated Yankees' fans last season,
gave up the winning run in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Heredia did not get any help from his former Yankees' teammate,
infielder Miguel Cairo, who booted a ground ball at third
base to score the run.
</P>
<P>
The Mets and the Yankees have had many players go back
and forth across town over the years, but the Mets
and the Nationals share a more common history. The two
franchises always seem to be starting over at the same
time, and often on the same field.
