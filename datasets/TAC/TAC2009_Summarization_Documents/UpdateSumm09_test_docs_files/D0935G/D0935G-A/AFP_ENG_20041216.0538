<P>
The White House said Thursday it hoped that the city of Washington
and Major League Baseball could still reach an agreement that would
bring a professional team to the US capital city.
</P>
<P>
US President George W. Bush, an avid fan and former team owner,
"thought it was great that baseball would be coming to Washington,"
spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters. "Hopefully, they'll be able
to work things out."
</P>
<P>
The District of Columbia Council has voted to require private
financing for at least half the construction costs of a new ballpark
for the Nationals -- the former Montreal Expos, who are due to kick
off next season in their new city against Arizona on April 14.
</P>
<P>
"The legislation is inconsistent with our carefully negotiated
agreement and is wholly unacceptable to Major League Baseball," MLB
president and CEO Bob DuPuy said in a statement a day after Tuesday's
vote.
</P>
<P>
In the initial agreement between the team and Washington Mayor
Anthony A. Williams, the city was to be responsible for 531 million
dollars in bonds to finance the stadium plan.
</P>
<P>
But under the legislation approved by the council, 50 percent of the
costs must come from private financing, or the approval for the plan
expires.
</P>
<P>
With the new provision in place, the Nationals may have to reopen
bidding for a permanent home if private financial obligations are not
met.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Bush supported public financing for sports stadiums,
McClellan replied: "Those are local decisions."
