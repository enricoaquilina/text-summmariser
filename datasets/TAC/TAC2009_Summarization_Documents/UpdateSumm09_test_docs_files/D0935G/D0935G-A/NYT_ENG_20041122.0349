RED, WHITE, BLUE BUT NO GREEN FOR NATIONALS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Still without approval from baseball club owners or the city they
plan to call home, the Washington Nationals were born Monday in a sea
of red, white and blue. These are not your grandfather's Washington
Nationals, because those Nationals played in the American League and
were alternately called the Senators.
</P>
<P>
The new National League Nationals were named not only before they
have approval to play in the nation's capital, but also before they
have a new owner.
</P>
<P>
Major League Baseball, the owner of record, has moved so slowly on
the transfer and the sale of the team that a new owner isn't
guaranteed to be in place in time to make marketing plans for next
season or to have a say in off-season player decisions.
</P>
<P>
For what some people expect to be $400 million to $500 million, the
new guy doesn't get to name his team.
</P>
<P>
"We need a name for marketing," Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief operating
officer, said Monday. "We're not going to have an owner for some
time. What if we don't have an owner by the start of spring
training?"
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30 individuals or groups have submitted expressions of
interest in buying the team. Baseball expects about half of that
number to bid seriously when the time comes to put up their money.
</P>
<P>
One owner said Monday that he believed the leading contender for the
team was Mark Broxmeyer, a Long Island builder, but another hopeful
said there was no way anyone could be a leading contender because the
first dollar hasn't been bid.
</P>
<P>
If there is a leader in the bidding, having nothing to do with
finances, it could be the group headed by Stan Kasten, who for many
years was the president of the Atlanta Braves. Kasten has been
exploring multiple opportunities in multiple sports, but if he
decides to reach for the Nationals, he would have an advantage over
other prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
Why? Study recent baseball history. The winning bidder for the Boston
Red Sox three years ago was John Henry's group, which was loaded with
baseball people who had a close relationship with Commissioner Bud
Selig. He might not have known it at the time, but Cablevision's
Charles F. Dolan never really had a chance. Kasten has had a good,
long relationship with Selig.
</P>
<P>
The Washington bidding will be a show worth watching. Not long after
Major League Baseball took control of the Expos, baseball people
talked about an eventual sale bringing in $400 million, giving the
other 29 teams a rewarding payday for their $120 million purchase.
</P>
<P>
Then the economy turned south, and some people felt baseball would be
fortunate to get $200 million. Maybe that's why baseball officials
dragged their feet in deciding where to put the Expos. They were
trying to wait out the economy.
</P>
<P>
Time hasn't done much for the economy, but it did give baseball time
to find a knight on a big white horse. The Washington mayor, Anthony
Williams, came riding in and pledged that the District of Columbia
would build a new ballpark for the new team, whatever the cost, which
some estimates say could exceed $600 million.
</P>
<P>
The new owner, whose team will play at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium for
the first three seasons, will have what might be the best stadium
deal ever. The Nationals will pay nothing for the construction of the
park, pay $3.5 million a year for rent and receive all
stadium-related revenue from tickets, concessions, parking, signs and
naming-rights fees.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of getting that combined revenue and money from a
regional sports network to be shared with the Baltimore Orioles will
drive up the sale price.
</P>
<P>
A financial investment adviser said Monday that he would never advise
a client to pay $400 million for the Nats, although maybe $300
million, but he acknowledged the possibility that some bidder might
make a $400 million bid if he really wanted the team and wanted to
break away from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
Just like the old Nationals, who became the Senators in 1957, these
Nationals will have the right to change their name. "When they move
into the new stadium, the owner will have the right to petition to
change the name," DuPuy said.
</P>
<P>
Club owners are expected to approve the team's move within the next
two weeks, whether or not baseball officials have concluded an
agreement with Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner, on compensation for
intruding on what he considers his turf. The Washington city council
will vote on stadium financing next month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, even though no owner is in place to decide which players
he might want or how much he would spend on them, Jim Bowden
continues to do his job as interim general manager.
</P>
<P>
Bowden has already demonstrated his acumen in running a low-budget
operation, having served as general manager of the economically
deprived Cincinnati Reds for 10 1/2 years. And in the space of a few
days last week, Bowden signed half an infield's worth of free agents
-- third baseman Vinny Castilla and shortstop Cristian Guzman -- and
traded for a productive, if volatile, outfielder in Jose Guillen.
</P>
<P>
Bowden hasn't been told if he can exceed the $41 million payroll with
which the Expos opened last season, but baseball officials have
estimated that the Nationals will take in at least $100 million more
in revenue than the Expos did. That should give Bowden a little more
to play with.
</P>
<P>
Even if he doesn't know who the new owner will be.
