Sharing RFK causing problems for MLS champs, MLB Nationals

The sharing of Robert F. Kennedy Stadium by Major League Soccer champion D.C.
United and the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball has resulted in a
soccer pitch that isn't rectangular.
</P>
<P>
"It's clearly not acceptable, but we understand that it's been a challenge for
everybody, and we just have to be patient," United president Kevin Payne said
Tuesday. "Nobody wants the field to be off."
</P>
<P>
Officials at United's 4-3 home loss to New England on Saturday filed a report
with MLS saying the field was lopsided. Two officials measured the field by
walking it, and they determined that one corner-to-corner diagonal was about 6
meters longer than the other.
</P>
<P>
"It's unscientific, but the referees are pretty good at measuring by walking it
off," MLS spokesman Dan Courtemanche said.
</P>
<P>
Even once that's fixed, there's another issue: the way the grass is
mowed.
</P>
<P>
Right now, the pitch is set up in such a way that the lines cut in the outfield
grass for the baseball team are at an odd angle for United games. Normally for
soccer, grass is mowed perpendicular to the sidelines, which helps officials by
giving them a straight line against which to judge offside calls.
</P>
<P>
"It is sort of an optical illusion, confusing to everybody," Payne said. "It's
very hard on the linesmen."
</P>
<P>
One possible solution would be to change where the soccer field is set up,
putting it parallel to the Nationals' first-base line. But that would mean the
soccer field would have to be smaller, something Payne doesn't
want.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly believe that everything will be worked out," Courtemanche
said.
</P>
<P>
D.C. United and the Nationals are sharing RFK, a venue used for the 1994 World
Cup and frequently a site of U.S. World Cup qualifiers, until 2008 while a new
baseball stadium is being built. When the soccer team plays, the baseball mound
is lowered, and the infield dirt is covered with temporary turf.
</P>
<P>
Pitchers have had problems with the mound, which will be stripped down and
rebuilt with new clay next week.
</P>
<P>
The problem with the possible misalignment of the field's shape was first
reported by The Washington Post.
