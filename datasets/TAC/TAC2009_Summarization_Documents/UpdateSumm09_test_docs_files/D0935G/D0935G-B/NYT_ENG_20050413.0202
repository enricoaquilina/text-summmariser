BASEBALL, NOT POLITICS, HAS THE CAPITAL IN A TIZZY

WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

Jerry Bush remembers the day baseball died as if
it were yesterday, not 34 years ago, not a lifetime
ago.
</P>
<P>
It was Sept. 30, 1971, at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium,
the final game for the Washington Senators before their hated
owner, Robert Short, moved the team to Arlington, Texas, to
become the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
With two outs in the top of the ninth and the
Senators ahead, hundreds of angry, frustrated, memento-hunting fans piled onto
the field, raced around the bases and tore numbers off
the scoreboard. Bush, a 17-year-old high school senior at the
time, pulled up a chunk of emerald sod and kept
it in a shoe box in his bedroom for years.
</P>
<P>
Over the next three decades, he flirted with other teams: the
Orioles, the Yankees. But like a scorned lover who just
can't get over it, none of them stuck in his
heart. None until this year.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Bush will join 45,500 other fans at RFK Stadium
for the sold-out home opener of the newly minted Washington
Nationals, formerly the Montreal Expos, who have brought baseball back
to this baseball-starved city.
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting goose bumps when I hear the name Nats on
the radio," said Bush, a middle-school technology teacher in Montgomery
County, Md., who unashamedly wears his Nationals baseball cap and
jersey to school some days.
</P>
<P>
In this buttoned-down city of transients, power brokers and the politically
obsessed, giddy displays of nostalgia are not the norm. But
baseball has a way of doing that to grown men
and, occasionally, women.
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere I go, people stop me to talk baseball," said City
Councilman Jack Evans. "They yell from cars. They grab me
at meetings. I see people wearing the hats all over
the city. At a Ward 7 event on Friday, two
dozen people, mostly men 40 and over, said how proud
they were to have a team back."
</P>
<P>
Never mind that few here can name more than a player
or two on their new team. Never mind that the
club drew just 748,550 fans in Montreal last year, when
it finished last in the National League East with a
67-95 record. Never mind that the Nationals' hat features a
lone "W" above the bill, an uncomfortable reminder to some
people in this overwhelmingly Democratic city of their Republican president.
</P>
<P>
A new day has dawned in a new city. The Nationals
are 5-4 and tied for first in their division. The
honeymoon has begun. While the common folk buy team T-shirts
and hats, the rich and powerful have been buying up
behind-the-dugout seats. Already, the Nationals have sold more than 22,000
season tickets, prompting confident team officials to project total attendance
of 2.5 million for the year.
</P>
<P>
"The good news is we haven't had to aggressively market the
team yet," said Chartese Berry, the Nationals' vice president for
communications. "We were just absolutely bombarded by folks who were
interested."
</P>
<P>
The home opener will have all the trappings of a Washington
event. President George W. Bush -- once a part-owner of
the Texas Rangers -- will throw out the ceremonial first
pitch, using the final ball from the final Washington Senators
game, which they forfeited to the Yankees because the fans
stormed the field. There will be a flyover of military
jets. And Chris Matthews plans to tape his Thursday edition
of "Hardball" on MSNBC from the RFK field.
</P>
<P>
This being Washington, protests are also expected. Parents who want the
city to spend money on schools instead of a new
baseball stadium. Advocates seeking congressional voting rights for the city.
(Washington has only one non-voting seat in the House.) Critics
of President Bush. Opponents of the war in Iraq. (The
Nationals are trying to negotiate a deal to let the
National Guard advertise and recruit at the stadium.)
</P>
<P>
"I think Robert Kennedy would appreciate that," Mayor Anthony Williams, whose
entire public schedule on Thursday will involve baseball events, said
of the protests.
</P>
<P>
The big question for marketing gurus and baseball fanatics alike is
how long the love affair will last. Could one abysmal
Expos-like season kill it?
</P>
<P>
It may come down to people like Jim Mauro. A Pittsburgh
native who has lived in Washington for 25 years, he
has continued to cheer for his beloved Pirates. This year
might be different.
</P>
<P>
At an Orioles game in Baltimore this month, Mauro, a lawyer,
glanced up at the scoreboard and noticed that the Phillies
were leading the Nationals. And he noticed something else: a
pang of dismay with his new home team.
</P>
<P>
"It was an epiphany," said Mauro, 60, the president of a
youth baseball league in northwest Washington. "I felt like I
was becoming a Nationals fan. And I felt guilty about
the Pirates."
