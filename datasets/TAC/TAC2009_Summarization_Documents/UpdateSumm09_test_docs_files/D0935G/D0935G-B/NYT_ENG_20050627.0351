IN BELTWAY CABLE DISPUTE: FANS PAY THE PRICE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took 33 years for baseball to return to Washington; Nationals
fans hope it will not take that long for most
of them to see the team's cable TV games.
</P>
<P>
Nearly halfway through the season, the Nationals' games on the Mid-Atlantic
Sports Network, or MASN, are not being carried by Comcast
and are seen only by consumers served by RCN Cable
and DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
The dispute is almost identical to the one that kept the
YES Network off Cablevision's systems in the New York metropolitan
area from 2002 to early 2003. Games are being blacked
out in a large portion of the market. One side
(Comcast) is suing the other. And one party (the Baltimore
Orioles) has embarked on an advertising campaign to trump its
rival.
</P>
<P>
But there are twists that make the Nationals' case more complex.
</P>
<P>
The Nationals are pawns in events they had no say in,
that as the wards of Major League Baseball they could
not influence. The Nationals' television predicament is a result of
the compensation package that kept Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner,
from suing to block the Montreal Expos' move to Washington.
</P>
<P>
One part of the agreement gave him 90 percent ownership of
(a stake that will be reduced to 67 percent, 1
percent a year for the next 23 years), with baseball
owning the rest (or selling it to whoever buys the
Nationals). will not carry Orioles games until 2007, but it
began showing the Nationals in April.
</P>
<P>
So here is a network mostly owned by one team, carrying
the games of a second team it did not want
in its market, but doing so as part of a
sweetheart deal under which baseball will also guarantee the value
of the Orioles if Angelos sells.
</P>
<P>
Now that is Moneyball. A total of 81 Nationals games will
be on local broadcast stations this season and 76 on
MASN. For their troubles, the Nationals are guaranteed about $20
million in annual rights fees from MASN, not bad for
an innocent bystander in a legal war.
</P>
<P>
As happy as the deal might have made Angelos, it displeased
Comcast, which, in addition to being the largest cable operator
in the United States and the dominant one in the
Orioles and the Nationals' market, owns all or part of
various entertainment and sports networks, including four Comcast SportsNets. One
of those sports networks has the rights to carry Orioles
games through the 2006 season.
</P>
<P>
Comcast has refused to carry and alleged in a lawsuit filed
in county circuit court in Maryland that the Orioles' deal
with baseball violated its rights to match third-party offers for
the team's cable rights beyond 2006.
</P>
<P>
"Comcast is trying to protect its monopoly," said Bob Whitelaw, the
executive vice president and general manager of MASN. "It's that
simple. They're the only regional network in the area, and
they've stated publicly that a market with 6.6 million cable
households doesn't need another regional sports network."
</P>
<P>
It is odd, he said, that Comcast started the second regional
sports network in Chicago, and is an investor and the
operating partner in the Mets' new network, which will start
next year and be the fourth one in the New
York market. The Orioles went on the offensive earlier this
month. In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, they
accused Comcast of violating cable law by showing preference to
Comcast SportsNet by not carrying a competitor.
</P>
<P>
The Orioles also charged that Comcast illegally sought equity in to
carry it and intimidated rival cable companies into not making
deals with it.
</P>
<P>
The Orioles insist that Comcast's right to match competing offers has
not been violated, because no outside bids were made, or
solicited, for the cable games.
</P>
<P>
The team's reasoning stems from the mid-1990s, when Angelos created TCR,
a television company that sold Orioles cable rights to Home
Team Sports, which Comcast eventually acquired knowing that after the
2006 season, those rights would revert to the Orioles, which
could do as they pleased with them.
</P>
<P>
The Orioles argue that is the fruit of forward legal thinking:
that it is not a new network, but a successor
to TCR, with a new brand name. And, if is
not new, but a reinforced TV company into which baseball
is investing $75 million, then Comcast's right to match an
outside bid was not set off.
</P>
<P>
It is elegant thinking, and maybe, in Comcast's view, a fancy
subterfuge around the definition of a new network. A Comcast
spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
Comcast's problem with the Orioles is a lengthy legal detour from
the mostly happy tale of the Nationals, who lead their
division with a 44-31 record, and whose cable games have
been held hostage to the battle between Angelos and Comcast.
</P>
<P>
Fans are frequently irrelevant in these disputes, which come down to
money. Comcast wants leverage and may view the Nationals as
fruit from a poisoned tree, so why carry them? And
if Comcast is as ornery as Cablevision, disenfranchised Nationals fans
may have to wait until next year's opening day to
see their team on local cable.
