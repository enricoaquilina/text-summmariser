BC-BBO-LEVESQUE-COLUMN-SPI SOULLESS RFK SLOWING D.C. FANS' EMBRACE OF NATIONALS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No doubt RFK Stadium will exude considerably more baseball
charm on a night when the humidity isn't a thousand
percent.
</P>
<P>
That's not a typo.
</P>
<P>
If 100 percent humidity is the point at which we start
growing gills, then there has to be an exponentially higher
scale of measurement when a dorsal fin appears and one
starts developing a taste for bait.
</P>
<P>
But hot teams make for hot times.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Nationals, having won seven in a row and 10
of 11 before last night, and the Mariners, as hot
as they've been all season, clashed for the first time
ever last night, and the most remarkable aspect may be
that no one swooned until the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was the humidity and a threat of thunderstorms that
kept the D.C. crowd under 30,000 -- less than two-thirds
of RFK's stated capacity of 45,250 for baseball.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Mariners-Nationals isn't quite the same as Red Sox-Cubs on the
marquee of interleague matchups.
</P>
<P>
Or perhaps this place just doesn't get it yet.
</P>
<P>
Yeah, it's still early. And school isn't out yet.
</P>
<P>
And the Nationals are the first team to play regularly in
the nation's capital since Watergate was just an apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
So maybe we should cut the fans some slack for not
being up to speed on recent developments.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Nationals have virtually no season-ticket base, given that the
former Montreal Expos had probably less notice of their new
situation than 20 percent of the General Motors work force
will soon be getting.
</P>
<P>
Still, if a team is brand new in a town that
supposedly has been thirsting, nay, lusting for major league baseball
these past 34 years, and it's in first place and
playing extremely well, shouldn't the crowds be bigger?
</P>
<P>
Certainly if the Mariners were in the Nationals' position -- first
place in a division where every team is playing above
.500 -- Safeco Field would be hosting thousands more than
the 33,718 fans Seattle has averaged at home through 29
dates this year.
</P>
<P>
That figure, by the way, puts the Mariners third in average
attendance in the American League behind the Yankees and Angels,
and fourth (behind the Red Sox, Yankees and Angels) in
percentage of stadium capacity.
</P>
<P>
Through 31 dates, the Nationals are averaging about 2,000 fewer at
RFK, admittedly not one of the prime drawing cards as
stadiums go. Opened in 1961 as District of Columbia Stadium,
one of the first multipurpose venues in the much-copied soup-tureen
style that was all the rage for a generation, the
Nationals' ballpark is indeed the team's best argument for the
new half-billion-dollar home it wants.
</P>
<P>
Washington's football fans may have a soft spot for the place,
but as a baseball park RFK is soulless, charmless and
utterly unremarkable in its bland symmetry.
</P>
<P>
To which all real baseball fans should respond with a unanimous
"so what?"
</P>
<P>
It shouldn't, absolutely shouldn't, be the stadium that matters. Yet we've
all been conditioned, not just by Major League Baseball but
by every "brand" making a pitch for our attention, that
packaging comes before content.
</P>
<P>
As a result, we lose perspective.
</P>
<P>
Consider, for example, that the 26-33 Mariners are the statistical equal,
sometimes the better, of the 35-26 Nationals.
</P>
<P>
In batting average the Mariners are 12th of 14 American League
teams, the Nationals 16th of 16 National League teams; in
total hits, the Mariners are 13th, the Nationals 10th; in
home runs, the Mariners are 13th, the Nationals 16th; in
on-base percentage, the Mariners 11th, Nationals 12th; in ERA, the
Mariners eighth, Nationals seventh; in strikeouts by pitching staff, Mariners
14th, Nationals 15th, and in opponents' batting average, Mariners fourth,
Nationals sixth.
</P>
<P>
Even after walking seven Nationals in the final two innings of
last night's 9-3 loss, the Mariners, seventh in the AL
in walks, have walked fewer batters than the Nationals, who
are 11th in the NL.
</P>
<P>
What to make of all this?
</P>
<P>
"I honestly have no clue what anyone should take from that,"
said Mariners manager Mike Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
Hargrove is right not to read too much into numbers that
are made malleable by many variables between leagues and even
divisions within the leagues, not to mention the vicissitudes of
the schedule.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Seattle fans can appreciate there's not much difference -- statistically
-- between the Mariners and a team that, for the
moment, is a contending ballclub. A bounce here, a break
there, and the Mariners are maybe three games out of
first place.
</P>
<P>
That their fans have responded so well despite a losing record
this season is worth noting, though it's likely many of
those fans are showing up because Safeco Field is a
nice ballpark.
</P>
<P>
We'll never know how many fans the Mariners would draw if
they played in a place like RFK Stadium, but I'd
be willing to bet a decline of 5,000 per game.
Which makes it imperative that they realize, at 26 wins
and 33 losses, just how incredibly lucky they are.
