FIXER-UPPER FRANCHISE HAS A HOME MAKEOVER

<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Washington Nationals left the field with their
12th consecutive home victory on Saturday night, the sound system
at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium played the theme music
from "The Natural," a movie about mystical and magical occurrences
in baseball.
</P>
<P>
Livan Hernandez, the starting pitcher who raised his record to 11-2,
had taken the same walk to the dugout in the
previous inning and waved his red cap to the 39,881
customers applauding him.
</P>
<P>
Now, Marlon Byrd, the left fielder who was also cheered, was
congratulated by his teammates for his two hits, his two
runs batted in, his stolen base, his throw to cut
down a runner at second base and his diving catch.
</P>
<P>
But Byrd got more than pats on the back when his
teammate Jose Guillen sneaked up and smacked his face with
a pie made of shaving cream. "It means you played
a good game," Byrd said with a smile over the
blast of salsa music coming from the clubhouse stereo. "I
hope to get a whole bunch of those."
</P>
<P>
The Nationals have played many good games in this surprising season,
their first here. Despite a 9-5 loss to the Toronto
Blue Jays on Sunday, Washington is in first place in
the National League East, three games ahead of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Despite modest hitting -- the Nationals are second to last in
the majors in runs -- they use pitching, defense and
the managing of Frank Robinson to win, often coming from
behind. "A lot of people don't believe in this team,"
Hernandez said, referring to those outside Washington. "I like it
like that, because you can show people."
</P>
<P>
He recalled playing in Canada last season, when the team was
the Montreal Expos and fans were few at Olympic Stadium.
"It's good when you've got 40,000 people screaming for you,"
Hernandez said. "It's different than 5,000 people. Everybody is happy
about the fans and wants to say, 'Thank you."'
</P>
<P>
Hernandez and the Expos spent last season in last place while
playing most of their home games in the province of
Quebec and some of them in the territory of Puerto
Rico. Now they are thriving in the District of Columbia,
but their franchise transfer still has many loose ends.
</P>
<P>
The team is still owned by Major League Baseball, which bought
it for $120 million in 2002 and is brokering a
sale among nine bidders. The Nationals play in a 43-year-old
stadium that has many problems, including vandalism and theft from
some players' cars in the parking lot when the team
was on the road last week.
</P>
<P>
"Somebody's got to do a little better job," said Byrd, whose
Cadillac Escalade was stolen.
</P>
<P>
Referring to other problems -- including long concession-stand lines and turf
disfigured by the Major League Soccer team that is a
co-tenant -- Tony Tavares, the team president, called RFK "an
old dog."
</P>
<P>
"We've put a lot of lipstick on this pig, but people
have fun," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Bush and Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state, were among
the 110,127 who attended the three-game weekend series and pushed
the season attendance total to 1,166,717, the ninth-highest in the
NL.
</P>
<P>
According to Major League Baseball, sales of merchandise bearing the Nationals'
brand are among the top five of the league's 30
teams, even though the merchandise was introduced after the Christmas
season, the peak period for such sales. With a new
stadium expected to open in 2008 and a location in
the prestigious market of the nation's capital, the franchise could
be sold for as much as $400 million.
</P>
<P>
Despite legal problems that limit their television exposure, a scattered and
inconsistent radio network, a low payroll and few star players,
the Nationals are outdrawing the Baltimore Orioles, their American League
neighbors, who are about 40 miles away.
</P>
<P>
The Nationals are averaging 32,409 fans a game, the ninth-most in
the NL. The Orioles, despite spending most of the season
in first place in the AL East, are averaging 30,756,
down from 33,165 at the same point last season, when
their team was not as successful.
</P>
<P>
Monica Pence, the communications manager of the Orioles, said it was
too early to judge the impact of competition in overlapping
markets. "We feel we've already said all we wanted to
say," she said. "We expressed concern the Nationals would have
a negative impact on our revenue and attendance."
</P>
<P>
The Nationals have already surpassed the single-season attendance record of the
old Washington Senators, who drew 1,027,216 fans in 1946. They
could threaten the Expos' best attendance of 2,320,651 in 1983.
Last season, the Expos drew 748,587.
</P>
<P>
The Nationals' interleague games against Toronto this season were vestiges of
the teams' geographic rivalry, developed when both were based in
Canada. The Expos' transfer was approved late last fall, and
the schedule was already made. Next season, the Nationals and
the Orioles will play each other in their respective parks.
</P>
<P>
But, even with the Nationals in first place, skeptics wonder whether
MLB will be able to sell the team quickly, have
a new stadium built with public money and maintain two
viable teams in the region. How will the commissioner's office
handle the finances this summer if the Nationals want to
make trades to compete for a postseason spot?
</P>
<P>
Bob DuPuy, the president and chief operating officer of MLB and
the overseer of the Nationals, said the commissioner, Bud Selig,
hoped to have a "firmer feel" about the sale of
the team before the All-Star Game break, in about two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
"You're never convinced a stadium is a sure thing until they
throw the first pitch of the first game," DuPuy said.
"We've said all along there's room for two teams in
that marketplace."
</P>
<P>
The Nationals' payroll of less than $50 million is among the
lowest 25 percent in the majors, according to Tavares. DuPuy
said, "I would expect they will have" more money to
spend because a profit of $20 million is projected this
season.
</P>
<P>
Jim Bowden, the general manager of the Nationals, was more emphatic.
"There's no question that if the right deal is out
there, we'll be able to increase payroll to get the
piece to win," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added: "This is a great defensive team, one of the
best defensive teams in the league, and one of the
best bullpens. And when you have pitching and defense, you
usually win pennants. We have that combination, and we are
getting the breaks."
</P>
<P>
Bowden said Nick Johnson, the first baseman and cleanup hitter, "is
having his breakout year," with 8 home runs, 42 RBI
and a .320 batting average. He said Ryan Church, who
injured his shoulder Wednesday when he crashed into a wall
while making a game-ending catch in Pittsburgh, was a contender
for rookie of the year; he is batting .325.
</P>
<P>
Chad Cordero, who leads the majors in saves with 25, said:
"We like to be under the radar, but I think
a lot of people are noticing now. They're taking us
seriously."
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Robinson, a Hall of Fame player who was baseball's first black
manager 30 years ago in Cleveland, is a serious man.
He will turn 70 on Aug. 31, and his patience
is short with many people, including pitchers who disagree with
his maneuvers. Tomo Ohka was one who objected, and he
was traded for doing it.
</P>
<P>
"I can rub the players the wrong way," Robinson said. But
he has helped the team win by arguing successfully with
umpires for a reversal of an opponent's home run and
by challenging the pine tar on the glove of an
opposing pitcher, as he did with Brendan Donnelly of the
Los Angeles Angels two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
When Angels manager Mike Scioscia confronted Robinson over Donnelly's ejection, Robinson
challenged Scioscia, who is 23 years younger. "I wasn't going
to let him intimidate me," Robinson told reporters a day
after the incident. "I am the intimidator."
</P>
<P>
The managers' confrontation prompted Guillen to rush to Robinson's support in
what almost escalated into a fight. Since then, Guillen has
broken out of a slump. He twice hit two homers
in a game last week, and he gave the Nationals
a 2-1 lead in the third inning Sunday by diving
home headfirst on an infield grounder.
</P>
<P>
"Jose is a very emotional kid," Robinson said. "That may have
got his adrenaline flowing a little more." Guillen leads the
team in home runs with 15 and is batting .301.
In nine major league seasons, he has played for seven
teams, often leaving behind hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
"He's been given a bad rap," said Bowden, who traded for
him. "The guy's a winner. He's emotional."
</P>
<P>
Now, like his new franchise, Guillen seems to have ceased his
wandering and landed in a comfort zone. The Nationals have
the best home-field winning percentage in the majors, .722.
</P>
<P>
Guillen, referring to the pie-in-the-face celebration, said: "Winning is always fun.
You always try to do something to make the players
happy. Trust me, this happens only when you win and
you have the year we're having. So far, so good."
