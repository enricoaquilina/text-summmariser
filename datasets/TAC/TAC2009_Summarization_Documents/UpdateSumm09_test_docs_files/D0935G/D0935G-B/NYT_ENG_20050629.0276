THE HOTTEST TICKET IN TOWN

WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, Washington hungered for a baseball team. Now
it has one, and a winning team at that.
</P>
<P>
But in a city where politics courses through the veins of
the inhabitants -- where Republicans run the show and the
man in the White House is himself a former baseball
team owner -- it was probably too much to expect
the Washington Nationals to usher in a bipartisan era of
peace, love and understanding.
</P>
<P>
Sure, James Carville, the Democratic political consultant, can be spotted at
games sitting in the same row as Andrew H. Card
Jr., President Bush's chief of staff. But now that George
Soros, the billionaire liberal philanthropist who spent millions trying to
defeat Bush last year, is competing for ownership of the
team against bidders who include the likes of Colin L.
Powell, the former secretary of state, and Peter Fitzgerald, a
Republican former senator, the mood on Capitol Hill isn't exactly
Mom and apple pie.
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans went so far as to suggest that baseball could
lose its antitrust exemption if it permits Soros, who would
be a part-owner with a group of investors headed by
a local entrepreneur, to sign on -- a threat that
immediately drew ridicule in the sports pages and outrage from
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, one Republican, Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, had backed
away from that suggestion, saying he never intended any threat.
But Davis and other Republicans did not back down from
their criticism of Soros who, they took pains to note,
has been convicted of insider trading in France (a ruling
he is appealing) and has supported ballot initiatives to legalize
medical marijuana.
</P>
<P>
"We finally got a winning team," Davis said. "Now they're going
to hand it over to a convicted felon who wants
to legalize drugs and who lives in New York and
spent 5 million dollars trying to defeat the president? How's
he going to get him out to the opening game?
C'mon."
</P>
<P>
As if the feud over team ownership is not enough, the
Nationals appear to be creating a sartorial quandary for some.
Certain Democrats, it seems, are feeling queasy about wearing the
team's signature "W" caps, which evoke reminders of a certain
former owner of the Texas Rangers whose middle initial just
happens to be W.
