NATIONALS' ROBINSON IS EPITOME OF THE CONSCIENCE OF BASEBALL

The Washington Nationals take some getting used to, from the tip
of their caps (stolen from the second incarnation of the
Senators) to the bottoms of their pseudo old-school uniforms with
the blocky block lettering and numerals (stolen, as near as
we can tell, from the late 1950s Packers).
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when you think of how, as the Montreal Expos, they
were systematically starved to death to make the Nationals possible
... well, you have a built-in rooting interest for the
new team to fail miserably.
</P>
<P>
But then you look at manager Frank Robinson, face of the
franchise, and the kind of guy who does the Hall
of Fame honor by letting himself be included, and with
all that, you come to the realization that rooting for
the Nationals might not be such a bad idea after
all.
</P>
<P>
Or that when they finally do blow up, that he's well
on his way to his next job.
</P>
<P>
Robinson is the living embodiment of baseball's conscience, of the class
of African Americans who saved the game from its own
smothering sterility and did so despite the most revolting racial
inequities. He took plenty, but gave back every bit of
it and then some. It is his intention to hand
out a bit more to the Giants in this weekend's
three-game set that begins this evening.
</P>
<P>
Robinson was fun to watch as a player, fun to watch
as a manager and even fun to watch when he
was disciplining players for on-field brawls. In short, he just
looks as baseball ought to want to look -- 69
going on 53, and looking ahead rather than behind because
ahead still has the chance to be really interesting.
</P>
<P>
The Nats (a lame enough nickname, but exactly what you should
get when you think "Nationals" evokes any kind of civic
emotion) are still the Expos in every way but one
-- they are playing in a new town. The old
one was a perfectly good baseball town treated badly by
a series of bad owners, the last ones being the
other 29 owners.
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, the Expos dealt away nearly the entire contents
of what had been a superbly productive farm system, and
replaced those contents with, well, nothing. Even now, they are
a fairly faceless lot, with the most recognizable name for
local consumption being the mighty ex-Giant-and-a-half Livan Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
Robinson coaxed a couple of winning seasons out of the strip-mined
Expos before it all caved in last year, and a
new challenge, however manufactured, has always worked for him.
</P>
<P>
In Cleveland, where he was not only the first African American
manager but the man who came closest to carrying off
the Indians' ridiculous all-red uniforms, he took a bad team
and drove it toward the middle of the standings. In
San Francisco, he took a hideous team and got it
to win. In Baltimore, he took a horrendous team and
improved it by 32 wins in a season.
</P>
<P>
This is Robinson's fourth year with the Nats, and when he
completes it, he will have finally managed the same team
for four consecutive years. If it continues at its current
pace, this team will bring him 85 wins, give or
take.
</P>
<P>
The Nats are an odd team in that they don't seem
to have a readily definable shape. Hernandez is the team's
best pitcher by a margin as wide as his ...
well, let's give that analogy a break for once. The
batting order has been more productive than its name-recognition factor,
which is good news both for veterans seeking a home
such as Jose Guillen and Vinny Castilla, and Expo lifers
such as Brad Wilkerson and Brian Schneider.
</P>
<P>
You, of course, don't care that much. Your favorite team has
a bullpen by convention, a left fielder who sends cryptic
notes over the Internet while he recoups from what seems
to be an endless series of knee surgeries, and a
predilection for beating up on the harmless and losing 2-of-3
to everyone else. The Washington Nationals mean next to nothing
to you.
</P>
<P>
But credit must be awarded to teams, and men, who deserve
it, and Frank Robinson remains on scholarship with anyone who
has ever paid attention to the game. Even his time
in San Francisco helped set up the team for its
run of glory in the late '80s.
</P>
<P>
So forgive him his uniform, and the tale of shame that
helped make the Nationals possible. Ignore the future, which as
likely as not will have the Nats as a sick
franchise struggling for attention in a football town.
</P>
<P>
Just look at the manager. He may seem like a dinosaur,
but the meteor hasn't yet hit the Earth that could
make him extinct. He is too smart, too headstrong, too
wise to limp in. Trust us on this -- Frank
Robinson has plenty of miles left on the warranty.
