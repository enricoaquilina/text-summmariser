The Washington Nationals finished their opening homestand tied for first place.
It can't get much better than that.
</P>
<P>
"We have a whole new outlook," catcher Brian Schneider said. "Now
anything seems possible."
</P>

Nationals players are obviously happy to finally have a true home
after going virtually unwatched as the vagabond Montreal Expos the
past two seasons. But many questions remain about this team
and baseball's future in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
With a payroll still under $50 million, the Nationals aren't likely
to be able to stay in contention all season in
the difficult National League East, and the newness of the
sport's return after 33 empty summers will soon wear off.
</P>
<P>
Despite a face-lift, RFK Stadium remains a relic that is far
from fan-friendly, and a new stadium on the banks of
the Anacostia River not far from the Capitol won't be
ready until 2008 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Nationals remain wards of Major League Baseball. Commissioner Bud
Selig says that he expects a sale to go through
by midseason. Earlier, the speculation was that it would be
completed by May.
</P>
<P>
MLB bought the team for $120 million three years ago and
hopes to sell it for triple that amount. So far,
eight groups have said that they are interested in buying
the Nationals.
</P>
<P>
One is headed by Stan Kasten, the former president of the
Braves, Hawks and Thrashers. "I'd like to see him get
it," Braves manager Bobby Cox said during his team's two-game
series at RFK. "I think it would be good for
baseball. I was hoping he might be around while we
were here."
</P>
<P>
Most of the prospective ownership groups are keeping a low profile.
That certainly isn't the case with the return of baseball
to Washington, however.
</P>
<P>
President Bush threw out the ceremonial first pitch and more than
600 media members were on hand as the Nationals won
their home opener 5-3 over Arizona before a sellout of
45,596 at RFK Stadium. "It was like a World Series,"
rookie outfielder Ryan Church said.
</P>
<P>
The Nationals swept the three-game series with the Diamondbacks before losing
twice to Florida and then splitting with the Braves. All
the crowds were larger than the best for the Expos
last season, but the dip from the opener was dramatic
considering that the Nationals have a season-ticket base of about
22,000.
</P>
<P>
"We just need to keep winning," said coach Tom McCraw, a
player on the last Washington Senators team in 1971. "That's
the only way to keep people excited."
