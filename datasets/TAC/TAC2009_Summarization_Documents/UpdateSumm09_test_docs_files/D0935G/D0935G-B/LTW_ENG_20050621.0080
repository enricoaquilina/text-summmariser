Washington's Nationals Team to Turn $20M Profit

The Washington Nationals are on pace to earn a pre-tax
profit of $20 million this season, reversing the fortunes of one of
baseball's biggest economic underperformers during the past decade and
increasing the potential value of the franchise as Major League
Baseball attempts to sell it, according to Nationals officials and
people involved in the sale.

The projected profits are fueled by robust attendance, strong
sponsorship and television deals, and one of the lowest player
payrolls in baseball. The Nationals have swung from a $10 million loss
last year as the Montreal Expos into the top half of teams, ranked on
the basis of revenue and profits, according to people who closely
follow baseball economics.

``I think $20 million might be conservative,'' said Andrew
Zimbalist, who teaches economics at Smith College and writes
frequently about baseball. ``If they go to the postseason, you can add
another $5 million or $10 million. And when they get the new stadium,
it will go up even more.''

The team's financial success could play a major role in determining
the Nationals' sale price. MLB, which bought the franchise for $120
million in 2002, has received eight bids, most of them believed to be
between $300 million and $400 million. MLB officials say they hope to
reach a decision on a new owner this summer and are currently
interviewing prospective buyers. Most MLB teams sell for between two
and three times their revenue, according to investment bankers, so the
Nationals' projected revenue of approximately $129 million this year
could push the sales price to $400 million or more.

``It could end up toward the high end of the range,'' said Scott
Levine, a sports team valuation expert and director at Stout Risius
Ross Inc., a Detroit-based financial advisory firm. Levine said he
thinks the price also could go higher given what he called ``the ego
factor'' among the bidding groups. ``You are dealing with people worth
billions of dollars,'' he said. ``To some extent, this is an expensive
toy.''
</P>
<P>
The Nationals play in 44-year-old Robert F. Kennedy Memorial
Stadium, which seats 45,250 and has none of the cash-generating
amenities such as club seats and luxury suites modern sports stadiums
and arenas feature. Washington has pledged to build a $535 million
stadium along the Anacostia River in return for baseball's decision to
move the team here.
</P>
<P>
Some sports experts cautioned that the Nationals' financial success
could be fleeting. ``You went from a greatly depressed market in
Montreal to one where pent-up demand was dramatic,'' said David
Carter, who teaches sports business at the University of Southern
California Marshall School of Business. ``Where you will really be
able to tell how financially successful this team will be is in the
next several years, where we find if the revenue numbers are
sustainable.''

<P>
``They are enjoying every bit of their honeymoon, but everything
looks great when you are in first place or within striking distance of
first place,'' said Raul Fernandez, one of the partners in the MCI
Center sports complex, which includes the arena and the Washington
Wizards, Capitals and Mystics. ``But building great franchises takes
dedication, effort and smart moves over a longer period of time than
half of a season.''
</P>
<P>
Nationals President Tony Tavares, who declined to comment publicly
on specific revenue numbers, said he had counted on the excitement
over baseball's return to Washington after a 34-year absence when he
calculated his projections on how the franchise would fare financially
in its first season in the city. He might not have counted on the team
being in first place in the National League East Division this late in
the season, which could also spur attendance.
</P>
<P>
The Nationals, who this month surpassed the 1 million mark in
attendance, are averaging 31,912 tickets sold per game, 13th highest
in the league and one spot ahead of the Baltimore Orioles, who are
selling 30,756 tickets per game, according to league statistics. That
puts the Nationals on track to sell about 2.5 million tickets this
year. With about 22,000 season tickets sold per game, at an average
price of $24 per seat, plus an average walk-up crowd of more than
8,000 per game, Washington will generate nearly $60 million at the
gate this year after local taxes.
