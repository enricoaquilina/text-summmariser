Top Palestinian officials abruptly postponed a trip to Paris on
Monday to ascertain the real condition of ailing leader Yasser Arafat
after critical comments by his wife, a spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's deputy in the Palestine Liberation Organization, Mahmoud
Abbas, and Palestinian prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, were asked by the
Fatah central committee on Sunday to speak directly to Arafat's
doctors, Nabil Shaath, a Palestinian minister, said Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat's wife, Suha, who has fiercely protected her husband's
privacy, lashed out in an emotional television interview with
Al-Jazeera television early Monday, calling the planned visit by
Palestinian officials a "conspiracy" against her husband. "They are
trying to bury Abu Ammar alive," she said, using Arafat's nom de
guerre.
</P>
<P>
Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a senior Arafat aide, announcing the postponement
of the Paris visit, also said that the critical comments by Suha
Arafat "don't represent our people." On Sunday, Shaath, who was to go
with the two men, said: "We've heard many conflicting reports, and it
makes us worried. We want to hear from the doctors directly."
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary turn of events is an indication of the confusing
court politics surrounding Arafat, who is variously described as on
his death bed or recovering. His wife is controlling the meager
release of information about his health, even to Arafat intimates in
Paris. That the leading Palestinian politicians felt the need to find
out the real facts for themselves is itself extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, the French foreign minister, Michel Barnier, told LCI
television that Arafat was alive but that his circumstances were
complicated. "I would say he is in a state that is very complicated,
very serious and stable at the time we are speaking," Barnier said.
Asked if Arafat were dead, Barnier answered, "I wouldn't say that."
</P>
<P>
Israel is preparing for a possible escalation of violence in the West
Bank and Gaza after the death of Arafat, the Israeli defense
minister, Shaul Mofaz, told the Cabinet on Sunday, Israeli officials
said.
</P>
<P>
While Abbas and Qureia seem to be controlling the situation among
Palestinians and are trying to reach internal agreement on a
post-Arafat leadership, Mofaz said, "there is no guarantee they will
be successful" in their efforts to get Palestinian militants to stop
attacks against Israelis during the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's condition was described as unchanged by a spokesman of the
French military hospital in Paris where Arafat is variously said to
be in an irreversible coma, a reversible one or no coma at all.
