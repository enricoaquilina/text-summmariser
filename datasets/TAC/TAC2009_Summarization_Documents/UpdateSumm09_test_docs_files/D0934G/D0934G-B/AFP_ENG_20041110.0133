RAMALLAH, West Bank, Nov 10 (AFP)

<TEXT>
<P>
The death of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who has been lying in a
coma in a French hospital for a week, was set to be announced at his
West Bank headquarters Wednesday, a Palestinian official told AFP.
</P>
<P>
As a top Islamic cleric prepared for a bedside visit to Arafat, other
sources meanwhile said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had offered
to host an official funeral in Cairo in the event of Arafat's death.
</P>
<P>
"The death of President Arafat should be announced Wednesday after
meetings of the central committee of Fatah and the executive
committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to be held
at the Muqataa," said the official who asked to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the ailing 75-year-old leader's death was
expected after the return here early Wednesday of four top
Palestinians from a visit to the military hospital at Clamart near
Paris where Arafat was admitted 12 days ago.
</P>
<P>
However negotiations minister Saeb Erakat told AFP early Wednesday
that Arafat was still fighting for his life as he confirmed that the
veteran leader would be buried at the battered Muqataa compound in
the event of his death.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that if President Arafat dies he will be buried at
the Muqataa," Erakat said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the head of the Palestinian Authority, who
was dramatically flown from Ramallah for treatment in France on
October 29, was still alive "at 2:00 am (midnight GMT)".
</P>
<P>
Erakat also pledged that Arafat's body would eventually be moved and
reburied in east Jerusalem when peace with Israel is achieved.
</P>
<P>
"I think it (a burial in Ramallah) will be temporary and one day,
when we have peace and we are alright as neighbours, President
Arafat's body will be moved to east Jerusalem, to the al-Aqsa
mosque," he told Israeli radio.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian representative in France, Leila Shahid,
said that Arafat was still alive but in a critical condition in
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Foreign minister Nabil Shaath, a member of the four-strong leadership
delegation that went to Paris, said before leaving that Arafat was
gravely ill but still alive.
</P>
<P>
After an anonymous claim by a fellow cabinet minister that Arafat had
lost his fight for life, Shaath told journalists Arafat's condition
had worsened and he was in a deep coma, but that his heart, brain and
lungs were functioning.
</P>
<P>
Shaath gave a lengthy account of Arafat's condition to journalists,
denying that life support machines would be unplugged.
</P>
<P>
"I want to rule out any question of euthanasia. People talk as if his
life can be plugged in or plugged out. This is ridiculous. We Muslims
do not allow euthanasia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shaath was accompanied on a 24-hour visit to Paris by three other top
Palestinians -- prime minister Ahmed Qorei, the PLO's ac of religious
courts in the Palestinian territories, flew in to Charles de Gaulle
airport and was expected at the Percy military hospital in Clamart,
Palestinian officials said.
</P>
<P>
An announcement of Arafat's death could have a galvanising impact on
the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
US President George W. Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
have refused to meet with Arafat for the last four years.
</P>
<P>
However Abbas, who is now emerging as the key figure in the
Palestinian leadership, was a guest of both men during his brief
tenure as prime minister last year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Mexico City, US Secretary of State Colin Powell said his
country was willing to work with whatever leaders the Palestinians
choose in the event of Arafat's death.
</P>
<P>
"The US remains ready to engage with the Palestinian leadership as
the Palestinians define that leadership," Powell said.
