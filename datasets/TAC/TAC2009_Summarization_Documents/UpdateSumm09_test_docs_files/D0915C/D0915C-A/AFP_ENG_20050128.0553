Five US soldiers and at least eight 
Iraqis were killed Friday in a string of attacks, two days before 
Iraq's landmark elections which insurgents have vowed to drench in 
blood.
</P>
<P>
A US helicopter also crashed in the Baghdad area, two days after 
the crash of a transport helicopter left 31 US troops dead, 
inflicting on the US military its heaviest loss in a single incident 
since the March 2003 invasion.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant Colonel James Hutton said that three soldiers were 
killed and another wounded in the explosion of a makeshift bomb in a 
western district of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Another two soldiers were killed and three wounded Friday in two 
separate incidents in the capital, bringing to 1,412 the total 
number of US servicemen who died in Iraqi since the invasion almost 
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
An OH-58 Kiowa Warrior, a reconaissance chopper from the same 
Baghdad-based division, crashed in a southwestern district of the 
capital, but there was no word on the fate of the two-man crew.
</P>
<P>
"At this time, we have no evidence of hostile fire playing a 
role in the helicopter going down," Colonel Keith Walker said in a 
statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, four people were killed in a suicide car bomb 
attack at a power station in the southern Baghdad neighbourhood of 
Dura, police and medical sources said.
</P>
<P>
"At around 9:00 am (0600 GMT), a black GMC approached the 
checkpoint at the entrance of the power plant. There was only a 
driver inside the car, his face was masked," a policeman who 
witnessed the attack told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"He was stopped at the checkpoint and a few seconds later, the 
explosion went off. We lost three comrades and one civilian was also 
killed in the blast," said the policeman.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking from Baghdad's Yarmuk hospital, where medical 
sources at the emergency department confirmed the death toll and 
added that three other policemen and a civilian were also wounded in 
the attack.
</P>
<P>
The bullet-riddled bodies of six Iraqi soldiers were found 
Friday in the western city of Ramadi, where two more people were 
killed and eight wounded in fighting between Iraqi forces and 
insurgents.
</P>
<P>
"The bodies of six soldiers, with their dog-tags, were found in 
central Ramadi," a police officer told AFP on condition of 
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a series of finds of bodies of apparently 
executed security personnel in the city.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops traded fire with the Sunni Muslim insurgents 
Friday, in a gunfight in which a soldier and a civilian were killed, 
Lieutenant Colonel Mahmud Mohammed said.
</P>
<P>
Four women and four children were also wounded by mortar fire 
Thursday night, said Doctor Alaa al-Rawi of the city's hospital.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi policeman was killed and two civilians wounded in a 
host of attacks on buildings to be used as voting stations around 
Kirkuk, 250 kilometers (150 miles) north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The policeman was shot dead by attackers as he stood guard at a 
voting station in the east of Kirkuk, which has a divided population 
of Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen, police told AFP.
</P>
<P>
A car bomb attack went off near a school to be used as a polling 
station in the same Baghad neighbourhood where the power station was 
targeted. A police officer said the blast caused material damage but 
no casualties.
</P>
<P>
But an Iraqi soldier was killed and another wounded when their 
patrol vehicle ran over a mine near Samarra, in the "Sunni Triangle" 
north of Baghdad, police said.
</P>
<P>
Other attacks were reported in the triangle. One man was wounded 
in an attack on another polling station at Al-Dur and another 
civilian was injured in a mortar attack on a voting centre in 
Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of voting stations have been attacked by insurgents who 
have put up posters and handed out leaflets warning Iraqis not to 
vote.
