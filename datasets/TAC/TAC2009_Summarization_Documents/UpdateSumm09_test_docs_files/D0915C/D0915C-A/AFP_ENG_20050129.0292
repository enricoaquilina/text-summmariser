The group of Al-Qaeda's frontman in Iraq 
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility Saturday for a suicide 
attack at an Iraqi polling station and vowed to spill more blood on 
election day, according to a statement posted on an Islamist 
website.

<P>
"A lion from the martyrdom-seeking brigade of the Al-Qaeda Group 
of Jihad in the Land of Two Rivers carried out an attack against the 
Americans and their agents in the Khanaqin region," said the 
statement, whose authenticity could not be verified.
</P>
<P>
"This is only (a small) part of what our virtuous sheikh Abu 
Musab al-Zarqawi promised," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We warn for the last time that tomorrow will be a bloody day 
for the Jews, the Christians, their agents, and anyone who agrees to 
play the American-Allawi game," added the statement in a reference 
to Iraqi interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi.

Iraqi police and the US military said that a suicide bomber 
wearing an explosives belt walked up to an Iraqi polling station in 
Khanaqin, a town near the border with Iran, and set off a blast that 
killed eight people, including a child and three soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The attack was one of a series by insurgents in which at least 
18 people were killed on the eve of Iraq's US-backed election 
despite massive security measures across the country.

<P>
An official from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) in the 
Kurdish town of Suleimaniyah said the attacker had been identified 
as a Sudanese member of Zarqawi's network.
</P>
<P>
"It was a Sudanese member of Al-Qaeda," Molla Bakhtiar, a member 
of the party's political bureau, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Zarqawi, a Jordanian-born fugitive with a 25-million-dollar US 
price on his head, has threatened to attack anyone involved in 
Sunday's polls.
