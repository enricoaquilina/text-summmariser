Rocket Slams U.S. Embassy Ahead of Iraqi Voting

BAGHDAD, Iraq
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hours before Iraqis headed to the polls for a
momentous vote, a rocket struck the U.S. Embassy compound Saturday
inside the heavily fortified Green Zone, killing two people and
shattering the relative calm of election eve in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The rocket attack marked a rare direct hit for insurgents, who
frequently target the sprawling embassy complex but have never before
killed anyone inside. The stunning strike came despite a massive
nationwide security clampdown, complete with Iraqi army tanks rumbling
through the capital for the first time since the fall of Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the country, several bombings and attacks on polling
places marred the day before elections. But the kind of large-scale
insurgent offensive that some had feared did not materialize.
Authorities expect the violence to worsen Sunday, when voters will be
particularly vulnerable as they venture to some of the more than 5,200
polling places.
</P>
<P>
``I think we'll see millions of people across Iraq vote tomorrow,''
said Lt. Gen. Thomas F. Metz, operational chief for the more than
150,000 coalition troops here.
</P>
<P>
During his weekly radio address Saturday, President Bush hailed
Iraqi voters, who he said were ``standing firm'' despite threats. His
remarks were aired shortly before the embassy was struck.
</P>
<P>
``Tomorrow's elections will happen because of their courage and
determination,'' Bush said. ``In the face of assassination, brutal
violence and calculated intimidation, Iraqis continue to prepare for
the elections and to campaign for their candidates.''
</P>
<P>
Iraqis are scheduled to choose a 275-member transitional national
assembly, 18 provincial councils and, in three northern provinces, a
Kurdish Parliament.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Iraqi security forces spent Saturday setting up cordons
around polling stations in an effort to protect voters.
</P>
<P>
``We are on the lookout,'' said Brig. Gen. Adil Molan Ghaidan,
police chief in Diyala province northeast of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
More than 14 million Iraqis are eligible to vote, but turnout is
unpredictable amid the violence that has swept across large swaths of
Iraq and amid the deep fissures among the nation's three major groups
-- Shiite Muslims, Sunni Muslims and ethnic Kurds.
</P>
<P>
This tense capital, its streets devoid of most civilian traffic but
bristling with edgy U.S. soldiers and Iraqi forces wearing black ski
masks, was oddly quiet through most of Saturday. Anxious troops wary
of suicide car bombers trained weapons on the few vehicles that were
on Baghdad's usually gridlocked streets, ordering many drivers to halt
and submit to searches. At one major intersection, an Iraqi armed
personnel carrier incongruously offered free rides to children.
</P>
<P>
Security measures included restrictions on driving, a shutdown of
Baghdad's international airport and the closure of the country's
borders.
</P>
<P>
Repeated reports circulated that insurgents had stolen police
trucks or ambulances and were planning to launch suicide attacks from
those vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A roadside bomb killed a U.S. soldier in western Baghdad,
authorities reported.
</P>
<P>
After nightfall, military trucks rolled through Baghdad's streets
shining high-power spotlights and warning residents on loudspeakers to
stay indoors during the new curfew hours and heed the government's ban
on driving.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic bursts of gunfire resounded through the darkened streets.
</P>
<P>
The rocket attack that struck the embassy compound occurred shortly
before 8 p.m., triggering a wail of sirens from the Green Zone, a
sealed-off swath of central Baghdad that is home to Western diplomats,
contract workers, U.S. troops and others. The Iraqi Independent
Electoral Commission, which runs the elections, is also housed there.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.S. statement, the rocket struck a building
connected to the embassy's annex in Saddam's former Republican Palace.
The huge palace houses much of the embassy's office space.
</P>
<P>
The Baghdad embassy, one of the largest U.S. missions in the world,
is said to be home to some 3,000 employees, including a huge security
contingent along with diplomats, representatives of assorted U.S.
agencies and Iraqi staff.
</P>
<P>
The facility sits behind two cordons of concrete blast walls and a
series of security barriers, checkpoints and body searches -- all
testament to its presence in one of the world's most hostile
environments for U.S. personnel.
</P>
<P>
The embassy, which opened last June after sovereignty was returned
to an Iraqi interim government, is the first U.S. mission here in more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
Many embassy workers are housed in nearby prefabricated trailers
protected by blast walls and sandbags; the trailers remain vulnerable
to mortar and rocket attacks. It was not clear precisely where the
rocket hit.
</P>
<P>
Outside the capital, a suicide attack earlier in the day in the
small Kurdish town of Khanaqin, near the Iranian border, heightened
fears that insurgents may try to infiltrate polling stations with
bombs or suicide belts. The bomber killed eight people near a police
station after detonating an explosives-laden vest. Six others were
injured, according to a source at the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, a
leading Kurdish political party.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increased security presence, insurgents hit five
polling centers around Baqubah, an ethnically divided regional capital
northeast of Baghdad. Mortars struck two schools in the city, homemade
bombs damaged two others, and gunmen sprayed a fifth with bullets and
rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
Scores of attacks have targeted polling places across Iraq in
recent days, officials said, but mostly the buildings have been empty
and casualties have been low.
</P>
<P>
In and around the city of Kirkuk in the north, seven election
centers were attacked with small-arms fire or mortars, according to
Lt. Col. Yadgar Mohammed, operations room director for the Iraqi
national guard in Kirkuk.
</P>
<P>
In southern Basra, U.S. and Iraqi troops sealed off borders with
neighboring countries, padlocking gates leading to Iran, blocking
roads to Kuwait and closing the Um Qasir sea port leading to the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, hundreds of young men showed up near the Convention
Center for $200-a-day jobs guarding polling stations.
</P>
<P>
``I've been without a job ever since the war, so I signed up for
this job because it seems to be honorable and I'd like to a part of
it,'' said Abass Mihseen, 42, a former Iraqi Army officer. ``Maybe
it's a new start for my career.''
</P>
<P>
At a schoolhouse being used as a polling center in Baghdad's Sadr
City neighborhood, election workers pushed aside metal desks and set
up cardboard voting booths.
</P>
<P>
``Everything is ready for tomorrow,'' said Dhia Fakhir, 38, manager
of the voting center. ``Nobody resigned.''
</P>
<P>
By late afternoon, Carlos Valenzuela, the top U.N. adviser to the
electoral commission, declared that matters were proceeding apace.
</P>
<P>
``So far, things are going ahead of schedule,'' said a cautious
Valenzuela, flanked by bodyguards in Baghdad's cavernous convention
center.
</P>
<P>
But election preparations were not as smooth in other parts of the
country, particularly in Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland to the north and
west of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Sunnis have dominated Iraq for decades but have lost power to rival
Shiite and Kurdish groups in the new order following the U.S.-led
toppling of Saddam, himself a Sunni. Many Sunni clerics and
politicians are vowing to boycott the vote, viewing it as another step
in their minority community's marginalization.
</P>
<P>
Insurgents, believed to be mostly Sunni Arabs, have vowed to kill
anyone who votes.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Jobouri, head of the electoral commission in largely Sunni
Salahuddin province, predicted that only 10 percent of voters would
turn out in Tikrit, Saddam's birthplace. It is possible that no one
will vote in the restive city of Samarra, he added.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
``It's all because of the bad security, violence and terrorist
attacks recently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Some Shiite clerics have preached that anyone who does not vote
today will face the wrath of God. The Shiite religious and political
leadership views the elections as a means of gaining their long-denied
place of power in Iraq, where they are in the majority. Kurds are also
encouraging people to vote despite the threats.
</P>
<P>
Throughout Iraq, people vowed not to be intimidated.
</P>
<P>
``This is going to be a free and honest experiment,'' said Amir
Moosa, 42, of Basra. ``We do not fear threats. Even bombs won't stop
us. It is our destiny.''
</P>

Times staff writers Alissa J. Rubin in Baghdad and Tom Hamburger in
Washington and special correspondents in Samarra, Basra, Kirkuk and
Baghdad contributed to this report.
