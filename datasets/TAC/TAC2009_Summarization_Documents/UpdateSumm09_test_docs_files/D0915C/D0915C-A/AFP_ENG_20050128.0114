<P>
Insurgents set off a car bomb and 
attacked polling stations and security forces in several Iraqi 
cities Friday, killing at least six people as Iraqi exiles across 
the globe began voting in their country's landmark election.
</P>
<P>
Four people were killed in a suicide car bomb attack at a power 
station in the southern Baghdad neighbourhood of Dura, while an 
Iraqi soldier and a policeman were killed in separate attacks in 
Samarra and Kirkuk
</P>
<P>
Campaigning by candidates for Sunday's election officially ended 
on Friday, as Iraqi expatraites in 14 countries -- from the Middle 
East to Australia to the United States -- began voting in a 
three-day process.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we did it!" shouted Ali al-Kabeer, clapping his hands 
after casting his ballot in Dubai and breaking into tears as he 
hugged his wife who also voted.
</P>
<P>
Kabeer, a commercial director, said he had "been waiting for 
this moment for 54 years," 24 of which he has spent in England and 
the UAE. "I'm doing this for my children ... it's the first step in 
a thousand-mile journey."
</P>
<P>
However, insurgents, including Al-Qaeda frontman Abu Musab 
al-Zarqawi, have vowed to wreck the country's first democratic vote 
in decades and there are fears the violence will pursue right 
through the election weekend and beyond.
</P>
<P>
At least 60 people have been killed in a spate of attacks across 
the country over the past two days alone, in additon to the killing 
of 31 US military personnel in a helicopter crash in western Iraq on 
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi authorities have ordered tough security measures, 
including a curfew, sealing off the borders and the closure of 
Baghdad international airport from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
US President George W. Bush has urged Iraqis to brave death 
threats and seize what he termed an "historic opportunity" to vote, 
while a British newspaper reported the United States and Britain 
have privately agreed on a way of withdrawing their troops from 
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Zarqawi, Iraq's most wanted man, on Thursday 
posted a video on the Internet of their murder of a candidate in 
Iraq's elections from the party of US-backed interim Prime Minister 
Iyad Allawi.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Qaeda Group in the Land of Two Rivers announced Sunday on 
a website that it had executed Salem Jaafar al-Kanani, "secretary of 
the traitor Iyad Allawi", and a video would be released at a later 
time.
</P>
<P>
Allawi's party has had at least 22 of its members killed in the 
space of two months, party official Imad Shbib said earlier this 
month, adding that as many as 44 had been murdered since the fall of 
Saddam Hussein's regime in April 2003.
</P>
<P>
An Islamist group linked to Al-Qaeda warned it would attack 
Iraqis involved in the general election even after voting was over.
</P>
<P>
"We have warned you not to go to the centres of this sordid 
comedy, called voting bureaus ... we renew our warning. They will be 
the targets of the mujahedeen (Islamist fighters)," Ansar al-Sunna 
said in a website statement.
</P>
<P>
In London, The Guardian newspaper reported US Defence Secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld and his British counterpart Geoff Hoon have agreed 
on a so-called exit-strategy based on doubling the number of Iraqi 
police trainees and setting up Iraqi paramilitary units.
</P>
<P>
The pair were acting on recommendations from retired US General 
Gary Luck, who was sent to Iraq by the Pentagon last month to look 
at the failings of Iraq's security force.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, with some 40 polling stations already destroyed by 
insurgent attack, even the distribution of ballot boxes for Iraq's 
estimated 14.1 million eligible voters underscored the tension 
hanging over the poll.
</P>
<P>
Ballot boxes were distributed to 5,300-odd polling centres 
across the country, along with millions of ballot papers and tens of 
thousands of bottles of indelible ink which voters will be tagged 
with to avoid fraud.
</P>
<P>
The total number of electoral staff is expected to swell to 
200,000 on polling day.
</P>
<P>
Bush said the vote offered an "historic opportunity" for Iraqis 
to start building a truly democratic society after decades of brutal 
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic opportunity for the people of Iraq to vote 
for a government," Bush said in an interview with Arabic televison 
station Al-Arabiya.
</P>
<P>
The US military's top commander in Iraq, General George Casey, 
told AFP that the more Iraqi security forces come on line, the less 
visible America's 150,000 troops will be.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's election has been marred not only by growing violence 
but also by a boycott by many Sunni politicians concerned that the 
election will cede power to the long-oppressed Shiite majority. 
</P>
<P>
However, a high turnout is expected among Shiites and Kurds 
ready to exercise their right to vote.
