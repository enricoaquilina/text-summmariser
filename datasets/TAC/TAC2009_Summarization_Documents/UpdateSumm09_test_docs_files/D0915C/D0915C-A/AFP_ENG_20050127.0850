BAGHDAD, Jan 28
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least 30 people were killed in Iraq 
as insurgents intensified attacks on Iraqi and US targets, and 
election workers backed by troops started distributing ballot boxes 
for the vote in just two days' time.
</P>
<P>
The latest attacks Thursday came as Iraqi exiles voting in 
Australia and New Zealand became the first to vote in their 
country's historic national elections early Friday.
</P>
<P>
The exiles began casting votes as a British newspaper reported 
the United States and Britain have privately agreed on a way of 
withdrawing their troops from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Militants have promised an all-out onslaught against the 
election, but US President George W. Bush has urged Iraqis to brave 
death threats and seize what he termed an "historic opportunity" to 
vote in Iraq on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Iraq's most wanted man, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, on 
Thursday posted a video on the Internet of their murder of a 
candidate in Iraq's elections from the party of US-backed interim 
Prime Minister Iyad Allawi.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Qaeda Group in the Land of Two Rivers announced Sunday on 
a website that it had executed Salem Jaafar al-Kanani, "secretary of 
the traitor Iyad Allawi", and a video would be released at a later 
time.
</P>
<P>
Allawi's party has had 22 of its members killed in the space of 
two months, party official Imad Shbib told AFP on January 11, adding 
that as many as 44 had been murdered since the fall of Saddam 
Hussein's regime in April 2003.
</P>
<P>
An Islamist group linked to Al-Qaeda warned it would attack 
Iraqis involved in the general election even after voting was over.
</P>
<P>
"We have warned you not to go to the centres of this sordid 
comedy, called voting bureaus ... we renew our warning. They will be 
the targets of the mujahedeen (Islamist fighters)," Ansar al-Sunna 
said in a website statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraqi exiles registered at three centres, in Sydney, 
Melbourne and the remote community of Shepparton in Victoria state 
on Friday and started casting their ballots.
</P>
<P>
In London, The Guardian newspaper reported US Defense Secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld and his British counterpart Geoff Hoon have agreed 
on a so-called exit-strategy based on doubling the number of Iraqi 
police trainees and setting up Iraqi paramilitary units.
</P>
<P>
The pair were acting on recommendations from retired US General 
Gary Luck, who was sent to Iraq by the Pentagon last month to look 
at the failings of Iraq's security force.
</P>
<P>
New attacks across Iraq followed the deaths of 31 US military 
personnel in a helicopter crash in western Iraq on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In one deadly attack Thursday, a car driven by a suicide bomber 
rammed an Iraqi army patrol in Samarra, a mainly Sunni Arab city 
north of Baghdad where US and Iraqi forces launched a massive 
operation last October to wrest control from insurgents before the 
vote.
</P>
<P>
As security forces sealed off the sector to evacuate victims, a 
second car burst onto the scene from the direction of a nearby 
hospital. Eight soldiers and three civilians were killed, police 
said.
</P>
<P>
In Baquba, north of the capital, a car bomb attack on a 
provincial government headquarters killed five people while the 
bodies of four executed Iraqi soldiers were found in the city of 
Ramadi.
</P>
<P>
South of Baghdad, in the so-called triangle of death, a homemade 
bomb killed five Iraqis and wounded 15 on the road between 
Mahmudiyah and Latifiyah. A US marine was killed in the same area.
</P>
<P>
With some 40 polling stations already destroyed by insurgent 
attack, even the distribution of ballot boxes for Iraq's estimated 
14.1 million eligible voters underscored the tension hanging over 
the poll.
</P>
<P>
In the Shiite holy city of Najaf south of the capital, police, 
US and Iraqi forces sealed off a one kilometre (0.6 mile) perimeter 
around a school being used as a polling station as ballot papers 
were taken in.
</P>
<P>
Amid the relentless violence, the electoral commission pressed 
on with its mission in the closing hours of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Ballot boxes were distributed to 5,300-odd polling centres 
across the country, along with millions of ballot papers and tens of 
thousands of bottles of indelible ink which voters will be tagged 
with to avoid fraud.
</P>
<P>
The total number of electoral staff is expected to swell to 
200,000 on polling day.
</P>
<P>
The US president said the vote offered an "historic opportunity" 
for Iraqis to start building a truly democratic society after 
decades of brutal dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic opportunity for the people of Iraq to vote 
for a government," Bush said in an interview with Arabic televison 
station Al-Arabiya.
</P>
<P>
The US military's top commander in Iraq, General George Casey, 
told AFP that the more Iraqi security forces come on line, the less 
visible America's 150,000 troops will be.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, top Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy called for 
a withdrawl of at least 12,000 US troops after Sunday's poll with a 
goal of a complete pull out next year.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's election has been marred not only by growing violence 
but also by a boycott by many Sunni politicians concerned that the 
election will cede power to the long-oppressed Shiite majority. 
</P>
<P>
However, a high turnout is expected among Shiites and Kurds 
ready to exercise their right to vote.
</P>
<P>
Former US president Bill Clinton called Thursday on Iraq's 
Shiite majority to reach out to the nation's Sunni minority if they 
win this weekend's election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he 
also said he was "totally against" the notion of setting a timetable 
for the withdrawal of US troops.
