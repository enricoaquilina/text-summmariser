BAGHDAD, Jan 30
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iraqis nervously came out to vote Sunday 
in their first multi-party elections in half a century, defying the 
threat of attacks by insurgents bent on sabotaging the vote.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after polls opened, a suicide bomber struck in Baghdad, 
killing one person and injuring another four, despite massive 
security precautions across the country.
</P>
<P>
A steady stream of people in Shiite Muslim and Kurdish areas 
took part in the first elections since the overthrow of former 
dictator Saddam Hussein almost two years ago. But there were 
immediate signs of Sunni Muslim strongholds rejecting the vote.
</P>
<P>
Interim President Ghazi Al-Yawar was among the first to vote, 
casting his ballot in Baghdad just a few hours after a rocket attack 
on the US embassy in the capital that killed two Americans.
</P>
<P>
"Thank God, Thank God. Blessed are the Iraqi elections. We greet 
all Iraqi people and urge them not to give up their rights, to vote 
for Iraq, elect Iraq and not to give up on Iraq," said Yawar.
</P>
<P>
Sunni Muslim insurgents have vowed to wreak havoc on the vote to 
choose a 275-member national assembly which will wire a new 
post-Saddam constitution.
</P>
<P>
A suicide bomber blew himself up near a polling centre in the 
Mansur district of western Baghdad, killing one person was killed 
and four wounded.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic explosions and machine gun fire were heard across the 
centre of the capital in the early morning. A mortar was also fired 
near the US military base in the northern city of Kirkuk just before 
polling stations opened.
</P>
<P>
In Shiite-dominated southern Iraq voters appeared to be turning 
out enthusiastically 
</P>
<P>
Taha Lufta waited outside a station at the Al Amaali school in 
the southern city of Basra when it opened at 7:00 am (0400 GMT).
</P>
<P>
"I came here to be first and encourage the people to vote," he 
said. "I'm an old man. I want to be a model for others." Lufta said 
he had voted for the Shiite list the United Iraqi Alliance "because 
it includes Islamists, and we want an Islamic constitution in 
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The alliance has the key backing of Grand Ayatollah Ali 
al-Sistani, the spiritual leader of Iraqi Shiites and is expected to 
be the biggest single bloc in the new assembly.
</P>
<P>
Long lines of people were also reported outside voting stations 
in Kurdish strongholds such as Arbil in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
But the head of the local council in the Sunni Muslim stronghold 
of Samarra said nobody would vote there because of safety fears.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody will vote in Samarra because of the security situation," 
said Taha Hussein. An AFP correspondent said there were no election 
staff at polling stations and police could not be seen on the 
streets of the city where US forces battled insurgents in October.
</P>
<P>
An American serviceman and civilian staff member were killed and 
five wounded in the embassy attack late Saturday thatst of the country and the authorities 
banned travel between provinces.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the authorities extended for one month the state of 
emergency under which it can order curfews and other special 
measures.
</P>
<P>
US President George W. Bush joined Iraqi leaders in appealing 
for the population to brave the insurgent threats to make the 
election a success.
</P>
<P>
US President George W. Bush and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan 
both appealed for Iraqis to brave the violence and vote.
</P>
<P>
Bush warned Saturday that "terrorists" were bent on wrecking the 
Iraqi election.
</P>
<P>
"The terrorists and those who benefitted from the tyranny of 
Saddam Hussein know that free elections will expose the emptiness of 
their vision for Iraq," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Annan made a special plea to Iraqis saying: "Please 
exercise your democratic rights on Sunday. Whatever your feelings 
about how the country reached this point, this election offers an 
opportunity to move away from violence and uncertainty toward peace 
and representative government."
</P>
<P>
But with world attention fixed on the turnout, the impact of the 
attacks added new uncertainty to the outcome.
</P>
<P>
US military leaders have warned that despite the huge security 
clampdown more attacks, particularly by suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi police guarded polling stations with the army forming a 
second ring and rapid reaction force units from the 150,000 US 
troops in Iraq playing a support role.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi election commission on Friday predicted a 57 percent 
national turnout. A poll by the Washington-based International 
Republican Institute said it would be 63.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sunday was also the final day for Iraqi exiles, many of whom 
fled Saddam's rule, to take part in voting in 14 countries across 
the world.
