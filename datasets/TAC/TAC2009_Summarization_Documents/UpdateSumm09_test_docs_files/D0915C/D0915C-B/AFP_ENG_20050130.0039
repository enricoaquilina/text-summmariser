BAGHDAD, Jan 30
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suicide bomber struck in an upmarket 
neighbourhood of Baghdad on Sunday and mortar attacks and gunfire 
erupted around the country as Iraqis went to the polls for their 
first free election in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
One person was killed and four others wounded when a bomber blew 
himself up near a polling centre in Baghdad's upmarket Mansur 
district in the western part of the capital, the interior ministry 
said.
</P>
<P>
Police and soldiers had stopped the bomber as he tried to enter 
the sealed-off cordon around the polling station when the attacker 
detonated his explosives belt, a US military officer said. 
</P>
<P>
US commanders have warned of suicide attacks, car bombs and 
mortar and rocket fire on Iraq's first election since the overthrow 
of Saddam Hussein almost two years ago as insurgents try to wreck 
the milestone event.
</P>
<P>
Six explosions jolted the northern Iraqi city of Mosul although 
the general hospital had no immediate word on casualties. Heavy 
security was in place around polling stations in the city, riven by 
insurgent violence since November.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi soldiers surrounded polling stations, and it was difficult 
for people to move around the city. At one polling centre in 
northern Mosul visited by AFP the station was deserted except for 
the workers inside.
</P>
<P>
Arms fire also reverberated in the northern flashpoint city of 
Baquba, an AFP correspondent said, as the streets remained empty 
shortly after the opening of polls.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear what was the cause of shooting in the city that 
has been the site of fierce clashes in the past between US forces 
and insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
One voting centre at the Al-Hussan bin-Ali school in central 
Baquba was empty as US armoured vehicles cruised the city.
</P>
<P>
In the southern city of Basra, a mortar shell landed near a 
polling station but there were no reports of casualties.
