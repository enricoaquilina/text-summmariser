CROWDS GATHER AT SUPREME COURT AS TERM COMES TO CLOSE

</DATELINE>

<P>
For the third week in a row, the Rev.
Rob Schenck set up a podium and a large wood
and marble display of the 10 commandments outside the U.S.
Supreme Court on Monday, in anticipation that the high court
would rule on two cases that challenge displays of the
Decalogue on public property.
</P>
<P>
But after the justices announced their decisions in six other cases
-- none of which tackled the contentious issue of religious
displays -- Schenck packed up and headed off.
</P>
<P>
Schenck, the head of the conservative National Clergy Council, said he
plans to return Thursday, the next day the Supreme Court
is expected to hand down decisions. He wants to be
there so that he can give reporters his group's interpretation
on the court's decisions in the 10 commandments cases, among
the most anticipated rulings this year.
</P>
<P>
"We've been through this drill so many times," said Schenck, who
has waited outside the court building in the waning weeks
of previous terms for decisions involving gay rights and abortion.
"The court is a very disciplined branch of government. They
keep everybody -- including some internal people -- on pins
and needles."
</P>
<P>
Schenck will be dueling with activists on the other side of
the debate. For example, Barry W. Lynn, executive director of
Americans United for Separation of Church and State, also has
camped out at the court building on recent Mondays, ready
to respond to a ruling.
</P>
<P>
No one outside the court knows for sure when the decision
will be handed down -- so the partisans show up
at the Supreme Court just in case.
</P>
<P>
Although the Supreme Court gives as much as a week's notice
before the so-called "decision days," it does not say in
advance which rulings it will issue. With 11 cases still
undecided by the court -- and the panel's October 2004
term set to end next week -- throngs of advocates,
lawyers and reporters are on edge.
</P>
<P>
In addition to issuing a verdict on the constitutionality of government-sponsored
displays of the 10 commandments, the court is expected to
decide whether companies can be held liable for making computer
software used to illegally download copyrighted music and movies. The
court also is set to rule whether the city of
New London, Conn., violated the Constitution when it seized private
property for redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court typically issues its most anticipated rulings each year
in the final days of June, before taking its annual
three-month break.
</P>
<P>
Tom Goldstein, a lawyer with the Washington, D.C., firm Goldstein &amp;
Howe who has argued before the Supreme Court, said the
end-of-term rulings are typically "the most hard-fought cases, where [the
justices] are going back and forth, back and forth with
their opinions" until the very last minute.
</P>
<P>
This year, the anticipation is especially intense because many believe Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist will decide to step down from
the court after 33 years on the bench. Rehnquist, 80,
began treatment late last year for thyroid cancer. If he
decides to retire, Rehnquist could announce the move before the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to catch the attention of the cameras and
reporters at the building, Schenck's props include a two-foot by
three-foot replica of the 10 commandments tablets. He also has
plenty of paper -- including at least three versions of
news releases that cover possible outcomes.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most critical issues of our time;
it has so much to say about what role religion
will play in the future of our country," Schenck said.
"So much of the public's impression of these opinions comes
in the way they're presented in the press, so we
try to be out there immediately to give our perspective
on it."
