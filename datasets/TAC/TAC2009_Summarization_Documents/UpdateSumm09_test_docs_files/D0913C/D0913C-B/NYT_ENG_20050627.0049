HIGH COURT RULES THAT TEN COMMANDMENTS CAN BE DISPLAYED ON GOVERNMENT PROPERTY

<P>
The Supreme Court ruled Monday that displaying the Ten
Commandments on government property does not necessarily violate the constitutional
principle that there must be a separation between church and
state.
</P>
<P>
In a pair of 5-4 rulings, the court said the display
of the Ten Commandments in a 22-acre park at the
Texas State Capitol was proper, but that the displays of
the Commandments in two county courthouses in Kentucky were so
overtly religious as to be impermissible.
</P>
<P>
The rulings, the first by the court in a quarter-century on
the emotional issue of the proper place of the Commandments
in American life, conveyed the message that disputes over such
religious displays must be decided case by case, and that
the specific facts are all important.
</P>
<P>
Writing for the court, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist noted that
at the Texas Capitol in Austin, a six-foot monolith displaying
the Commandments was just one of 17 sculptures. "The inclusion
of the Commandments monument in this group has a dual
significance, partaking of both religion and government, that cannot be
said to violate the Establishment Clause," the chief justice wrote.
</P>
<P>
Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Stephen G.
Breyer sided with the chief justice, with Justice Breyer calling
the Texas dispute a difficult borderline case. The dissenters were
justices Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter
and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment decrees that "Congress shall
make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof," and the Supreme Court has long
held that the same rule must be applied to the
states.
</P>
<P>
"While the Commandments are religious, they have an undeniable historical meaning,"
Rehnquist wrote. "Simply having religious content or promoting a message
consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afoul of
the Establishment Clause."
</P>
<P>
But he added pointedly, "There are, of course, limits to the
government's display of religious messages or symbols."
</P>
<P>
And those limits were exceeded in the Kentucky displays, the court
held in an opinion by Justice Souter and joined by
justices Stevens, O'Connor, Ginsburg and Breyer. "The reasonable observer could
only think that the counties meant to emphasize and celebrate
the religious message," the majority held. "The display's unstinting focus
was on religious passages, showing that the counties posted the
Commandments precisely because of their sectarian content."
</P>
<P>
Dissenting were Chief Justice Rehnquist and justices Scalia, Thomas and Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
The backgrounds of the Texas and Kentucky disputes were different in
a way that the court found vitally important. The Texas
Ten Commandments monument was donated in 1961 by the Fraternal
Order of Eagles and was just one of thousands donated
by the fraternity across the country with the support of
Cecil B. DeMille, the director, who was promoting his movie
"The Ten Commandments." Thomas Van Orden, a suspended lawyer, challenged
the display in a lawsuit filed in 2002, after he
became homeless.
</P>
<P>
The four decades between the erection of the monument and the
challenge strongly suggest that there was little perception among the
public that the Austin display was a government attempt to
establish religion, the justices in the majority reasoned.
</P>
<P>
The crucial difference in the Kentucky case was that the Commandments
were first displayed by themselves on the courthouse walls, and
government officials did not display accompanying historical documents until after
the American Civil Liberties Union complained about the Commandments exhibits.
</P>
<P>
"An observer would probably suspect the counties of reaching for any
way to keep a religious document on the walls," the
majority observed.
</P>
<P>
The majority noted that neither a federal district court nor the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had found
any "valid secular purpose" in the courthouse Commandments displays. In
the Texas case, on the other hand, both a district
court and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had
agreed that there was a valid secular purpose to the
displays.
</P>
<P>
The Texas case is Van Orden v. Perry, No. 03-1500. Gov.
Rick Perry is named in his capacity as chairman of
the State Preservation Board. The Kentucky case is McCreary County
v. the ACLU of Kentucky, No. 03-1693.
</P>
<P>
The last time the Supreme Court ruled on a Ten Commandments
case was in 1980, when it invalidated a Kentucky law
that required the posting of the Ten Commandments in every
public school classroom.
