SUPREME COURT SPLITS RULINGS ON TEN COMMANDMENTS IN PUBLIC SITES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A 6-foot-tall granite monument of the Ten Commandments outside
the Texas capitol building is constitutional, but smaller displays of
the Decalogue inside two Kentucky county courthouses must go, the
Supreme Court ruled in separate decisions Monday.
</P>
<P>
The court said the purpose of the displays was the dividing
line in the two cases as the justices weighed whether
the exhibits violated the Constitution's First Amendment bar against government
promotion of religion.
</P>
<P>
In the Texas case, the court ruled 5-4 that the tablet-shaped
monument was constitutional because it was part of a comprehensive,
historical presentation on the state capitol grounds, one of 38
monuments and historical markers on the site.
</P>
<P>
Although the monument "has religious significance," the Ten Commandments also "have
an undeniable historical meaning," Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote
in an opinion joined by Associate Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony
M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Justice Stephen Breyer concurred in
a separate opinion.
</P>
<P>
"Simply having religious content or promoting a message consistent with a
religious doctrine does not run afoul of the establishment clause,"
Rehnquist wrote.
</P>
<P>
In the Kentucky cases, the court ruled 5-4 that county officials
stepped over the line because they had religious motives when
they approved the construction of two displays of the Ten
Commandments.
</P>
<P>
Breyer was the crucial swing vote, siding with conservative justices in
support of the Texas monument, but joining the court's more
liberal members to outlaw the Kentucky displays.
</P>
<P>
Legal scholars and public officials had hoped the Supreme Court would
use the two cases to clear up years of confusion
about what kind of religious displays are allowed on government
property, but the issue was further muddled by the Texas
and Kentucky decisions.
</P>
<P>
The court appeared to acknowledge that point, with Rehnquist noting in
his opinion in the Texas case that there was no
definitive formula for assessing the constitutionality of government-sponsored religious displays.
In effect, the court said, it would have to sort
out the principles one case at a time.
</P>
<P>
Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of
Church and State, which opposed both displays of the commandments,
said the split decisions "just guarantee there will be far
more lawsuits and far more confusion about religious displays on
public property."
</P>
<P>
For years, the Supreme Court has struggled with whether to lower
or raise the wall separating government and religion but a
clear guide for the future has remained elusive. Although the
court has ruled that legislatures can open their sessions with
prayers and has upheld state and local laws barring the
sale of alcohol on Sundays, it also has struck down
a law mandating that the Ten Commandments be displayed in
schoolrooms.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion in the Texas case, Rehnquist acknowledged the difficulty
in defining the line.
</P>
<P>
"Our institutions presuppose a supreme being, yet these institutions must not
press religious observances upon their citizens," Rehnquist wrote. The court
must "neither abdicate our responsibility to maintain a division between
church and state, nor evince a hostility to religion by
disabling the government from in some ways recognizing our religious
heritage."
</P>
<P>
As evidence of the difficulty in reaching consensus, the nine justices
together issued seven separate opinions in the Texas case and
three in the Kentucky case.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know we had that many people on our court,"
Rehnquist quipped Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the Kentucky case, the court based its ruling on the
history of the displays in two county courthouses; the exhibits
were modified twice in response to a lawsuit and a
lower court ruling against the displays, steps that Justice David
Souter -- writing for the majority -- said were designed
to conceal the basic religious motivation behind the display. In
addition to Breyer, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul Stevens
and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Souter in the majority.
</P>
<P>
The first exhibits, created in 1999, consisted of framed copies of
the Ten Commandments in the McCreary County courthouse in Whitley
City, Ky., and the Pulaski County courthouse in Somerset, Ky.
</P>
<P>
Later, county officials added excerpts of other historical documents containing religious
references, including passages from the Declaration of Independence, the preamble
to the state constitution and a proclamation by former President
Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
In its final version, the Ten Commandments were surrounded by historic
American and British political and patriotic documents and a statement
asserting that the commandments "have profoundly influenced the formation of
Western legal thought."
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Souter said there was "ample support" for a lower court's
finding "of a predominantly religious purpose" behind the displays.
</P>
<P>
Although Kentucky officials described the display as including documents "foundational" to
American government, the collection was not comprehensive, Souter wrote. The
only real connection is that materials included religious references, Souter
said.
</P>
<P>
An observer "would probably suspect that the counties were simply reaching
for any way to keep a religious document on the
walls of courthouses constitutionally required to embody religious neutrality," Souter
wrote.
</P>
<P>
In a dissenting opinion, Scalia blasted the court's majority, arguing that
"the commandments have a proper place in our civil history."
On the bench Monday, Scalia took the unusual step of
reading his dissent in the courtroom, prefacing his comments by
saying the court's ruling against the Kentucky displays "ratchets up
this court's hostility to religion."
</P>
<P>
"Invocation of the almighty by our public figures, at all levels
of government, remains commonplace," Scalia wrote, noting that even inside
the Supreme Court building, Moses is depicted holding the Ten
Commandments and that court sessions open with a clerk proclaiming
"God save the United States and this honorable court."
</P>
<P>
In other decisions on the final day of the Supreme Court's
2004 term, the justices:
</P>
<P>
-- Unanimously decided that makers of software that can be used
to illegally download copyrighted music and movies can be held
liable when they "foster infringement." The ruling is a victory
for the entertainment industry, which has complained that widespread downloading
of movies and music is hurting their bottom line. The
court said the makers of file-sharing programs Grokster and Morpheus
had acted in bad faith by promoting their products as
tools for illegally obtaining copyrighted content. Companies who make and
market products legitimately -- only later learning they are being
used for illegal purposes -- would not be liable, the
court said.
</P>
<P>
-- Declined to review an appeal by New York Times reporter
Judith Miller and Time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper, who face
jail time for refusing to testify about confidential news sources.
The court's decision, which was made without comment, sends Miller
and Cooper's case back to U.S. District Court, which could
order the reporters' imprisonment this week. To put the case
on the court's docket for the 2005 term, which begins
in October, at least four justices would have to vote
in favor of considering the case.
</P>
<P>
-- Ruled 6-3 that cable companies offering high-speed Internet access do
not have to open up their infrastructure to other Internet
service providers.
