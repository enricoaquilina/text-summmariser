SUPREME COURT HEADS FOR FINISH OF 2004-05 TERM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON, June 20
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixty-two decisions down, 12 to go.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court's 2004-2005 term, dominated by months of speculation over
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's health and retirement plans, will
end as soon as next Monday. As usual, several of
the most contentious cases will be among the final rulings.
</P>
<P>
After announcing six decisions on Monday, the court has scheduled Thursday
and next Monday as decision days. If necessary, the justices
will add another day next week. These are the remaining
cases:
</P>
<P>
Ten Commandments: Perhaps the most closely watched cases are two that
require the court to define the constitutional boundaries for governmental
display of religious symbols. The appeal in Van Orden v.
Perry, No. 03-1500, challenges the display of a Ten Commandments
monument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. In
McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union, No. 03-1693, the
question is the constitutionality of displays on the walls of
two Kentucky county courthouses that include the text of the
Ten Commandments along with historical documents, such as the Mayflower
Compact.
</P>
<P>
File sharing: In a case of enormous interest to the entertainment
and recording industries, the question in Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios
v. Grokster Ltd., No. 04-480, is whether the companies that
provide the software that enables computer users to share illegally
downloaded files of copyrighted material are themselves liable for copyright
infringement.
</P>
<P>
Internet access: In National Cable and Telecommunications Association v. Brand X
Internet Services, No. 04-277, the court will review the Federal
Communications Commission's determination that companies offering broadband access through cable
modem service do not have to permit competing Internet service
providers to share their lines. Industry groups say the shape
of future Internet access could depend on this decision.
</P>
<P>
Private property: A closely watched case from New London, Conn., questions
the government's use of the power of eminent domain to
take, and pay for, private property for the purpose of
fostering private economic development. The question in the case, Kelo
v. City of New London, No. 04-108, is whether such
development fits the definition of "public use" for which the
Fifth Amendment permits a "taking" of private property.
</P>
<P>
Domestic violence: The court will decide in Town of Castle Rock
v. Gonzales, No. 04-278, whether a police department can be
held liable for violating a victim's rights when harm ensues
from a failure to enforce a court's order of protection.
In this case, a woman's estranged husband violated a protective
order and kidnapped and killed their three daughters.
</P>
<P>
Jurisdiction: The court will decide whether the federal courts have jurisdiction
over certain kinds of class-action cases. Two related appeals are
likely to be decided by a single decision. They are
Ortega v. Star-Kist Foods Inc., No. 04-79, and Exxon Corp.
v. Allapattah Services Inc., No. 04-70.
</P>
<P>
Water rights: In Orff v. United States, No. 03-1566, the court
will decide whether the federal government can be sued by
farmers claiming a breach of contract in the delivery of
water from the Central Valley reclamation project in California.
</P>
<P>
Right to counsel: The question in Halbert v. Michigan, No. 03-10198,
is whether indigent defendants have a right to a government-appointed
lawyer to challenge aspects of a guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
Habeas corpus: In another criminal appeal, Gonzalez v. Crosby, No. 04-5432,
the question is whether a defendant can use a petition
for a writ of habeas corpus as a means for
reopening certain earlier judgments.
</P>
<P>
Time limits: In Mayle v. Felix, No. 04-563, the question is
how the one-year time limit in the federal law governing
habeas corpus petitions applies to a defendant's effort to add
new claims to an existing petition.
</P>
<P>
Death penalty appeal: In Bell v. Thompson, No. 04-514, a death
penalty case from Tennessee, the court will address the authority
of a federal appeals court, on the basis of newly
discovered evidence that is favorable to the defense, to change
its mind and order a case reopened as the state
is preparing to carry out a death sentence.
