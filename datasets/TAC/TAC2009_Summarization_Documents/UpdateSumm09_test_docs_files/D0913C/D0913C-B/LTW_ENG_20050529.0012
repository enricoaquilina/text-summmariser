Supreme Court Nears Decisions on Critical Cases
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<P>
The Supreme Court justices usually leave some of the
hardest cases for the final month of the term, and this year is no
different. The court is due to decide 29 cases by the end of June,
including nettlesome issues surrounding medical marijuana, the Ten
Commandments and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
But this year, the term's end could be overshadowed by the
retirement of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Since October, he
has been battling thyroid cancer. And though his voice has sounded
stronger in recent weeks, he is widely expected to announce soon that
he will step down at the end of the current term.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the court will meet to hand down rulings, and it is
likely to issue decisions on one or two days each week for the rest of
June.
</P>
<P>
Here are key issues awaiting a decision:
</P>
<P>
-- Ten Commandments. Can government officials prominently display
the Biblical Commandments at public buildings or in courthouses to
demonstrate the nation's religious heritage? Or does this official
display amount to the government's promotion of religion in violation
of the First Amendment? The court will rule on two cases: a Ten
Commandments monument outside the Texas state Capitol and plaques
featuring the Commandments posted in Kentucky courthouses.
</P>
<P>
-- Medical marijuana. Can federal agents raid the homes of
California patients who grow marijuana for their own use? Although the
medical use of marijuana is legal in California and nine other states,
federal authorities say they can override those state laws. The 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the federal officials had exceeded
their constitutional power.
</P>
<P>
-- File sharing. Can film studios and record labels go to court to
shutdown Internet-based companies that help computer users download
free copies of music and movies? This is a multibillion-dollar
question of copyright law. The movie and record industries say
unchecked Internet piracy threatens to make copyrights meaningless.
</P>
<P>
-- Internet access. Must cable and phone companies allow outside
companies, such as Earthlink, to offer broadband Internet service to
customers, or may they instead reserve their lines for their own
broadband service? A divided Federal Communications Commission said
cable companies can keep exclusive control of their lines. If the FCC
prevails, it plans to adopt the same rule for phone companies. The
outcome may determine how much choice consumers will have in Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
-- Property rights. May cities seize private property to make way
for business development? This Connecticut case could limit the
government's power of ``eminent domain.'' The Constitution says
officials may take possession of private property ``for public use,''
and the homeowners who are fighting the city of New London say that
private development is not a public use.
</P>
<P>
-- Restraining orders. Can the police be sued for failing enforce a
restraining order? The case before the court is tragic -- a mother
whose three daughters were murdered by her estranged husband -- but
during the oral argument the justices were skeptical of the claim that
the police can be held liable for not acting in time.
</P>
<P>
-- Religion in prison. Can Congress require state prisons to make
special accommodations for the religious needs of their inmates? Five
years ago, a bipartisan group of lawmakers won passage of a new law to
further religious liberty, but prison officials have opposed it.
</P>
<P>
-- Juries and race. What should judges do if prosecutors remove
several blacks from the jury pool? The court has said the Constitution
forbids racial bias in selecting jurors, but it has struggled on how
to enforce that rule. Two cases raise this issue.
</P>
<P>
-- Drug research. Can scientists make use of patented drugs and
devices while researching new drugs? A 1984 law exempted such research
from charges of patent infringement, but that law has been read
narrowly to cover only research data to be presented to the Food and
Drug Administration. Researchers at the Scripps Institute in La Jolla,
Calif., were hit with a $15 million judgment for patent infringement.
(
</P>
<P>
-- Cruise ships. Does the federal law that protects disabled
Americans from discrimination apply to passengers who travel on
foreign-flagged cruise ships? This case tests the reach of U.S. law.
