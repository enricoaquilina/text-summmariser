THERE'S NO MIDDLE GROUND FOR COMMANDMENTS

After more than two decades of dodging the
question, the U.S. Supreme Court this week heard oral arguments
on whether Ten Commandments displays in courthouses and other public
space are compatible with the First Amendment to the Constitution.
The cases before the court involve a Ten Commandments monument
on the grounds of the Texas Capitol and a display
of the commandments in a Kentucky courtroom.
</P>
<P>
The positions of the respective advocates are well known. Maybe a
solution, some of the justices seemed to suggest with their
comments and questions from the bench, lies somewhere in the
middle.
</P>
<P>
"It's so hard to draw that line," said Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
Justices seemed eager to stake that middle ground, wherever it might
lie. But by not decisively ruling for one side or
the other, the Supreme Court would be doing a disservice
to the nation. This important question of religious freedom demands
a clear answer from the high court.
</P>
<P>
Those who favor Ten Commandments displays take one of two tacks
or a combination of the two. They argue either that
such displays only celebrate the religious and legal heritage of
the United States; or as, put forth by former Alabama
Chief Justice Roy Moore and some evangelicals, nothing in the
Constitution prohibits government acknowledgment of God, with the Ten Commandments
or other religious displays.
</P>
<P>
Opponents' reading of the First Amendment's "establishment clause," however, leaves no
such room.
</P>
<P>
"An assertion that the Ten Commandments is the source, the foundation
of our legal system ... that is simply wrapping the
Ten Commandments in the flag, and that's endorsement," argued David
Friedman, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, before
the high court on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The search for a middle ground is attractive, if only because
both extremes can be troubling.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to imagine how displays of the Ten Commandments
in courthouses or other government buildings can be taken as
anything other than a government endorsement of a particular religious
viewpoint. That officials added non-religious documents to the offending display
in Kentucky after a lawsuit was filed reveals that intent.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, though, advocates of Ten Commandments displays are willing to downplay
their religious significance of the precepts and instead argue their
secular value as, what Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott called,
a "recognized symbol of law."
</P>
<P>
So which is it, and why are supporters so willing to
denigrate the Commandments' religious power to make their case?
</P>
<P>
Justice Antonin Scalia wants to know. In response to Abbott, Scalia
said, "You're watering it down to say the only message
is a secular message. ... I can't agree with you.
'Our laws come from God.' If you don't believe it
sends that message, you're kidding yourself."
</P>
<P>
Scalia said that if Abbot's view were to prevail, it would
be a "Pyrrhic victory."
</P>
<P>
Some on the other side are guilty of a similar cheapening,
this time of the First Amendment. I agree with those
who see Ten Commandments displays in courthouses or on the
grounds of the Texas Capitol as an affront to the
First Amendment, but that does not mean all religious expression
on public property -- or even the mentioning of "God"
in the Pledge of Allegiance or on our money --
threatens the republic.
</P>
<P>
By using a one-size-fits-all argument, whether against the Ten Commandments or
"In God We Trust," civil libertarians and others sometimes look
silly. Yes, "under God" was added to the Pledge of
Allegiance in 1954 to counter the "God-less" communists, but that
did not make a pledge a prayer inappropriate for a
public school or anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
As an insult to the Constitution, it is nothing compared to
a clearly religious monument in a public courthouse or on
the grounds of the Texas Capitol.
</P>
<P>
"These are not simple messages, like 'In God We Trust,"' on
U.S. currency, said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. "The Ten Commandments
are a powerful statement of the covenant God made with
his people."
</P>
<P>
The First Amendment was written to guarantee Americans the right to
worship, or not worship, as they want, and to ban
government from establishing or endorsing a particular faith. Government breaches
the First Amendment's "wall" between church and state when it
reserves for the public space a monument with a clear
religious message.
</P>
<P>
There is no middle ground on that.
