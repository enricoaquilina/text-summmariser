AN UNLIKELY JOURNEY UP THE LEGAL LADDER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
AUSTIN, Texas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Win or lose, Thomas Van Orden savored the
moment on Wednesday as the lawsuit he brought here three
years ago was preoccupying the highest judges of the land
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"What are the chances of this case making it to the
Supreme Court?" he asked from behind a borrowed computer at
the University of Texas law library. "My God! My little
case."
</P>
<P>
It is hardly little -- a constitutional challenge to displaying the
Ten Commandments on the grounds of the Texas Capitol, and
so, a case that could rewrite aspects of church-state relations
when the high court rules, perhaps this summer. But at
any point in its journey up the legal ladder, Van
Orden said, it might have failed for the unlikeliest of
reasons: a lack of paper, or postage.
</P>
<P>
Van Orden, a suspended lawyer who put his age at 60,
compiled the case while homeless, living in a tent on
a wooded tract in Austin, surviving on food stamps, while
writing his briefs at the law library and scrounging for
writing materials.
</P>
<P>
"You can find paper and pens on the college campus," he
said. "Just look down."
</P>
<P>
At times, he said, he lacked the 10 cents to print
out even one page of his briefs and did not
have the money to mail his appeal to the federal
appeals court in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
But he disdained what he portrayed as the caricaturing of his
story by journalists.
</P>
<P>
"OK, so I did crawl in out of the woods," he
said, "but I brought some knowledge with me."
</P>
<P>
It is not about him, Van Orden said again and again
in an interview on Wednesday, deflecting personal questions while talking
animatedly about the legal issues and yet volunteering intriguing snippets
of biography that included a stint as a pilot.
</P>
<P>
"It's not my lawsuit," he said. "It's every American's."
</P>
<P>
Van Orden said he had turned down an offer by a
lawyer who argued his case, Erwin Chemerinsky, to pay for
a trip to Washington to witness the argument.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I should accept anyone's money to go," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he had overcome an unspecified psychological problem,
that he was eager for a steady job -- "You
don't actually think I like living in a tent, do
you?"-- and that he had gotten, and laughed off, offers
from Hollywood for his story.
</P>
<P>
"How do you do a movie of a guy at his
desk researching legal briefs?" he asked. "There's no car chases,
no exploding bombs."
</P>
<P>
But he said that if anyone persisted, "I would say, 'Bring
cash and tell me what time to meet your plane."'
</P>
<P>
Tall, with lanky, center-parted hair and a thick brush mustache --
Van Orden, who declined to be photographed as well --
said he had not gone looking for a cause. "This
one found me," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he had come across the Ten Commandments monument on
the Capitol grounds several years ago and, based on his
readings of separation of powers cases thought: "Something ought to
be done, and why not me? So I did it."
</P>
<P>
He said he was drawn to the case not by any
antipathy toward religion -- he was brought up Southern Baptist,
he said -- but raised questions with a state preservation
office and was told the display would not come down.
</P>
<P>
"I never said, 'I demand you take it down,"' Van Orden
said. "I'm not rude."
</P>
<P>
But he did begin researching a federal lawsuit that he filed
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
"I was demonstrating what you could do with a pencil and
paper and a law book," Van Orden said.
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Southern Methodist University's law school in Dallas, Van
Orden said he had practiced criminal law in Houston, principally
defending drug dealers, until "something happened to me" that he
said "destroyed me."
</P>
<P>
Previously published articles said he fell prey to acute anxiety and
did not complete some cases he had been engaged to
handle, accounts he declined to discuss beyond saying, "I never
stole a dime from anybody."
</P>
<P>
Texas State Bar records list him as suspended for "disciplinary sanctions"
and "default in payment of Occupation Tax."
</P>
<P>
He said he had been divorced for 15 years and had
a son and a daughter.
</P>
<P>
Little by little, other details of Van Orden's life emerged. He
said he had served in the Vietnam-era Army and had
narrowly avoided duty as a helicopter gunner by signing up
as a lawyer in the judge advocate general's corps. But
he said his brother, a Navy pilot who served on
the same aircraft carrier as Sen. John McCain, was shot
down and killed. Van Orden said he himself later became
a pilot flying light planes and training flight students and
walked away from at least one serious crash.
</P>
<P>
He was always drawn to constitutional law, he said, and was
so enamored of Benjamin Nathan Cardozo, the former Supreme Court
justice, that he named his son after him.
</P>
<P>
In the Ten Commandments case, Van Orden said, the central questions
were: What was the government's purpose in putting up the
display in 1961, and what message did it send to
people? If religious, it was unacceptable, he said. Moreover, he
said, the version of the commandments at the Capitol omits
part of the Hebrew text referring to God's covenant with
the Jews, raising another religious issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Van Orden lost in the district court and, after managing to
pay for enough copies and postage, appealed to the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, where he
also lost. Then, he said, seizing on conflicting opinions by
different federal appeals courts, he asked the Supreme Court to
resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
"That's what the Supreme Court does for a living," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chemerinsky, a law professor at Duke University, said that after the
high court agreed to hear the case in late 2003,
Van Orden called him -- one of the rare times
Van Orden used a telephone -- and the two agreed
to collaborate. Chemerinsky flew to Austin last November and with
Van Orden walked the Capitol grounds, seeing the monument and
discussing the case.
</P>
<P>
"He was extremely knowledgeable in the law in this case," Chemerinsky
said.
</P>
<P>
They did not discuss Van Orden's homelessness, he said, adding, "It
was none of my business."
</P>
<P>
They exchanged drafts by e-mail, Van Orden working at the University
of Texas law library and the state law library, using
his own e-mail accounts honoring his favorite Roman philosopher, Seneca.
</P>
<P>
Van Orden derided the cliches of homelessness that he said reporters
had unfairly stuck to him over the years. He did
not travel with bundles, he said, and he took pride
in his clean clothes and grooming, which he attended to
in ways he did not detail.
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised they don't have me trailing a yellow dog," he
said, exaggerating.
</P>
<P>
He ate on food stamps at the upscale Central Market, pitched
his tent nightly and took it down each morning in
a wooded location he did not specify, traveled on a
free bus pass granted for a veteran's disability and read
newspapers and magazines free at newsstands.
</P>
<P>
He said his happiest moment was not when he heard the
Supreme Court was taking his case but when his teenage
daughter read the story and tracked him down by e-mail,
breaking a long estrangement.
