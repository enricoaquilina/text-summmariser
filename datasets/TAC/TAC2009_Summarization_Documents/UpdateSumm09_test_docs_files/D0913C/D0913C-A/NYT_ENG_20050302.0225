TEXAS SEEKS TO KEEP TEN COMMANDMENTS DISPLAY ON CAPITOL GROUNDS

<P>
The Ten Commandments monument on the Texas Capitol grounds
should remain because it is a cultural and historical symbol
that does not violate the separation of church and state,
Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott told the U.S. Supreme Court
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But an attorney representing Thomas Van Orden, an Austin, Texas, homeless
lawyer challenging the law, countered that the 40-year-old pink granite
slab sends a "powerful religious message" and defies years of
legal doctrine prohibiting a government endorsement of religion.
</P>
<P>
Justices peppered both sides with pointed questions as the court confronted
church-state cases that could affect the display of religious symbols
at public sites across the country. The justices also heard
a challenge to Ten Commandments exhibits in Kentucky courthouses.
</P>
<P>
"I think 90 percent of Americans believe in the Ten Commandments,"
said Justice Antonin Scalia, "but 85 percent probably couldn't tell
you what they are."
</P>
<P>
The cases constituted the first Ten Commandments dispute to come before
the court in a quarter-century and attracted dozens of third-party
participants, from atheists to religious groups. Hundreds of protesters from
at least a half-dozen states mustered on the Supreme Court
steps, often kneeling in impromptu prayer services.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen onlookers, including out-of-town law students, spent the
night in windy, freezing temperatures to get seats to the
landmark arguments. Protesters, bundled against the biting chill, displayed their
sentiments with signs declaring, "Keep Church and State Separate" or
"No Religious Test for Patriotism."
</P>
<P>
The challenge to the Texas monument drew an extra burst of
attention because of the man who waged it -- Van
Orden, a Southern Methodist University graduate who is no longer
eligible to practice law. He slept in an Austin park
while spending his days in the Texas State Library preparing
the case.
</P>
<P>
Van Orden, who filed his suit in 2002, was not present
for the Supreme Court arguments, but his chief attorney, Duke
University law school professor Erwin Chemerinsky, said he and Van
Orden have stayed in touch through almost daily e-mail exchanges.
Chemerinsky agreed to handle the case for free after Van
Orden called and asked his help.
</P>
<P>
The Ten Commandments monument was donated to the Texas Legislature in
1961 by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a century-old civic
organization, to commemorate youth and denounce juvenile delinquency. The monument
is one of 17 memorials on the State Capitol grounds
and sits halfway between the Capitol and the State Supreme
Court building.
</P>
<P>
Abbott, making his first argument before the high court, contended that
the Ten Commandments monument, while containing a sacred religious text,
constitutes a cultural, historical and legal symbol by being clustered
with a diverse array of other monuments. He described the
setting as an outdoor museum.
</P>
<P>
But Chemerinsky argued that the monument serves no secular purpose and
"impermissibly" endorses religion. The 51-year-old law professor, acknowledging the emotional
intensity of the issue, also told the justices that he
has received hate mail because of his legal opposition to
the Texas monument.
</P>
<P>
At issue is the Establishment Clause in the Constitution's First Amendment,
prohibiting Congress from enacting any law establishing a government-sanctioned religion.
The 10-word clause is the cornerstone of more than two
centuries of legal doctrine on the separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
Justices interrupted frequently as the hourlong argument veered into hypothetical discussions
on whether other religious-oriented expressions, such as an opening prayer
before Congress or a Thanksgiving proclamation, would be banned under
a strict interpretation of what constitutes religion. They also noted
that Moses and the Ten Commandments are part of a
decorative historical carving along the ceiling of the Supreme Court
chambers.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why the one is good and the other
is bad," said Scalia, contrasting the Ten Commandments monument with
a congressional prayer. During the subsequent arguments on the Kentucky
case, Scalia said sardonically: "I don't know who we're addressing
when we say, 'God Save this honorable court.' "
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony Kennedy complained about "an obsessive concern to any mention
of religion" on public sites. "This is a classic 'avert
your eyes,' " he said. "If an atheist walks by,
he can avert his eyes."
</P>
<P>
Justice John Paul Stevens raised the possibility of posting a disclaimer
that the Ten Commandments and similar displays might have a
religious connotation. Abbott said a disclaimer might help fend off
legal challenges but he later told reporters that he felt
it would be unnecessary under Texas' argument that the Austin
monument is non-religious.
</P>
<P>
Abbott, who was partially paralyzed when he was struck by a
falling tree while jogging two decades ago, made his arguments
from his wheelchair. Stevens told Abbott that his presentation demonstrated
"that it's not necessary to stand at the lectern in
order to do a fine job."
</P>
<P>
Ailing Chief Justice William Rehnquist was absent but Stevens, second in
seniority, said Rehnquist "reserves the right" to participate in the
decision.
</P>
<P>
Abbott, 47, a former state Supreme Court justice, declined to predict
the outcome of the case but several attorneys on both
sides of the issue said the justices' comments suggested that
the court might support the state's arguments.
</P>
<P>
"In the Texas case, they seemed more inclined to find the
display OK," said Steven Freeman of New York, an attorney
with the Anti-Defamation League, which supported Van Orden's challenge.
