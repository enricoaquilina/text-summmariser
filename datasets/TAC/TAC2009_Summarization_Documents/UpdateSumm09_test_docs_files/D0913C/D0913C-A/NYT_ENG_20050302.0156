HIGH COURT HEARS ARGUMENTS IN 10 COMMANDMENTS CASE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court Wednesday wrestled with whether the Constitution
allows displays of the Ten Commandments on government property, bringing
to a climax the latest battle in the culture war
over the role of Christianity in the nation's public life
and the exact line between church and state.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union and a Texas plaintiff
argued that the Ten Commandments presuppose the existence of a
God. Although the tablets can be displayed on government property
in a secular context, they said, displays in Texas and
Kentucky went too far, violating the First Amendment's prohibition on
establishing an official state religion.
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the displays argued that the Ten Commandments serve
a secular historic function as well as a religious one.
They said the displays should be allowed to stay on
the Texas state capitol grounds and in a Kentucky county
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
The arguments signaled little chance that the perennially contentious issue will
be definitively resolved. The justices showed no appetite for creating
a clear rule that state exhibits of the Ten Commandments
will henceforth either always be allowed or always be forbidden.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the arguments revolved around which legal doctrine should be used
to decide on a case-by-case basis, how the details of
the two cases before the court fit those tests, and
whether those tests should be kept or modified.
</P>
<P>
"Because of our religious traditions, there's no way to do it
other than to look at divisive qualities on a case-by-case
basis," said Justice Stephen G. Breyer said. "When I do
that, I don't find divisiveness here."
</P>
<P>
Not so, responded Erwin Chemerinsky, a lawyer arguing against the Texas
display. He noted that the chief justice of the Alabama
Supreme Court lost his job in 2003 for defying a
federal order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from his
state courthouse.
</P>
<P>
"The Ten Commandments is enormously divisive today," he said. He also
noted the hundreds of evangelical Christian protesters praying outside the
Supreme Court walls and said he had received hate messages
in the past week.
</P>
<P>
The Texas case involves a Ten Commandments monument on the capitol
grounds that was donated to the state four decades ago.
The only one of 17 monuments on the grounds that
has a religious theme, it was formally endorsed by the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky case involves a recent effort to exhibit the Ten
Commandments in a county courthouse as part of a "Foundations
Display" along with political and patriotic texts that are not
religious in nature. The first version contained only the commandments,
and a second added excerpts from speeches and public documents
that made specific reference to Christianity. The display in dispute,
the third version, dropped the Christian references and added such
documents as the Magna Carta.
</P>
<P>
The courthouse changed the display in response to a lawsuit by
the American Civil Liberties Union. A judge ruled that the
new display was unconstitutional, because the history showed that officials'
clear intent was to post a religious document. The counties
asked the Supreme Court for a new test that looks
at the effects of the display, not the intent of
its sponsors.
</P>
<P>
The dispute also had personal overtones for the Supreme Court. Its
courtroom is replete with Ten Commandments imagery, from a frieze
that includes Moses holding the tablets to several images of
twin tablets with Roman numbers from 1 to 10.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers challenging the constitutionality of the Texas and Kentucky displays showed
no desire to confront the high court about its own
use of the iconography. They said the Supreme Court's use
of the image was obviously of a secular nature, to
acknowledge one source of law among many, while insisting that
the Texas and Kentucky displays went too far.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Supreme Court's use of commandments imagery was a regular
theme.
</P>
<P>
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg pointed to the frieze on the south
wall of the courtroom, which depicts Moses with eight other
ancient lawgivers. The tablets of Moses are tilted so only
the second five commandments, all secular rules, such as "Thou
shalt not kill," are visible. Religious rules, such as "Thou
shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God
in vain," are hidden.
</P>
<P>
Ginsberg asked whether an inscription of the secular rules without the
tablets would be acceptable on government property. Chemerinsky said they
would be since those rules are also found in Texas
statutes. That led Justice Antonin Scalia to interrupt with a
scoff: "Who are you kidding? Everyone knows these come from
the Ten Commandments."
</P>
<P>
Scalia, a devout Catholic, also took issue with the argument by
Attorney General Greg Abbott of Texas that the display from
that state serves a secular function. Scalia denounced the idea
of "watering down" the religious message of the Ten Commandments,
which he said was "government derives its authority from God,"
and suggested that it would be a "Pyrrhic victory" if
Texas won on those grounds.
</P>
<P>
Atheists should "turn your eyes away if it's such a big
deal to you," he added.
</P>
<P>
The court's two swing voters, Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra
Day O'Connor, both appeared uneasy about the prospect of ordering
governments to take down all of the thousands of Ten
Commandments displays around the country.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy talked about "an obsessive concern with any mention of religion"
that would amount to impermissible "hostility to religion." O'Connor suggested
that for older monuments and displays, the state's "interest in
preserving old objects" in a "museumlike setting" could be an
alternative justification for not tearing down Ten Commandments monuments.
</P>
<P>
The court last addressed the issue in a Kentucky case in
1980, striking down a state mandate that schools post copies
of the commandments.
