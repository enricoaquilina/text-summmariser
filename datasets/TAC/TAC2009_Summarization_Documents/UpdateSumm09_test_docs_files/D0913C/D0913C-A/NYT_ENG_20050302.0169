HIGH COURT ARGUES TEN COMMANDMENTS CASES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The marshal yelled "God Save the United States and
this honorable court" and the U.S. Supreme Court justices took
their seats in a room bearing a sculpted depiction of
Moses holding a Ten Commandments tablet.
</P>
<P>
That backdrop became part of the questioning Wednesday as the justices
considered the ways in which government and religion intertwine during
oral arguments in two closely-watched cases from Texas and Kentucky.
Their ruling, due by the end of June, is expected
to clarify when government may acknowledge religion and more specifically,
under what circumstances it can display the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
One of the cases originated when Thomas Van Orden, a homeless
former lawyer, sued Texas officials in 2001, claiming that a
Ten Commandments monument near the rear entrance to the state
Capitol violated the constitutional separation between church and state. He
lost at trial and then on appeal and the monument
remains.
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Duke University Law Professor Erwin Chemerinsky, was the first
to field questions from the justices.
</P>
<P>
"What happens if (the Ten Commandments) are packaged in a museum-like
setting?" asked Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, echoing an argument by
Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott that the monument is one
of many on the grounds that shows different influences on
Texas culture.
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a museum-like setting," Chemerinsky said, dismissing Abbott's argument with
one one of his own -- that the monument is
in a uniquely prominent place on the Capitol grounds, away
from any other display.
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't the venue count?" asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, noting that
there is a difference between prayer in schools -- which
the court has struck down -- and a prayer to
open a legislative session, which the court has allowed.
</P>
<P>
Chemerinsky agreed, saying that "monument standing alone does convey the government's
endorsement for religion."
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony Kennedy said he would be worried that any ruling
by the court that showed "obsessive concern with any message
of religion" would suggest a "hostility towards religion."
</P>
<P>
"This is a classic avert your eyes," Kennedy said. "If an
atheist walks by he can avert his eyes."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so, your honor," Chemerinsky said, arguing that the
message conveyed by the monument is that the Texas government
favors Judeo-Christian religions above others.
</P>
<P>
That, Chemerinsky said, would be a violation of the Establishment Clause,
the part of the First Amendment that says "Congress shall
make no law respecting an establishment of religion."
</P>
<P>
After Chemerinsky sat down, Abbott argued that the Ten Commandments are
a historically recognized "symbol of law" that are part of
an integrated display erected to honor a service organization's work
with juveniles. The monument, he added, has stood for 40
years unchallenged before Van Orden brought his case.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court decided to hear the Texas and Kentucky cases
amid a national debate on religion's role in government. Ten
Commandments displays that have stood for decades in and near
courthouses and other public buildings across the country have come
under frequent attack by people and groups saying they violate
the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the Ten Commandments displays, including the Bush Administration, say
the religious text has been important in developing the country's
legal and civic traditions.
</P>
<P>
In the Kentucky case, two counties posted framed copies of the
Ten Commandments on the walls of two different courthouses. They
later added other documents, including copies of the Magna Carta
and the Declaration of Independence. An appeals court ordered those
Ten Commandments displays removed.
</P>
<P>
Lower courts have issued conflicting rulings in dozens of cases involving
Ten Commandments displays in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Those include a 2003 Alabama case that led Chief Justice Roy
Moore to be removed from office for refusing to comply
with a court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument
from the state judicial building.
</P>
<P>
Moore supporters were among several hundred people who assembled Wednesday morning
outside the nation's highest court as temperatures hovered around freezing
with a stiff wind that made it feel ten degrees
cooler.
</P>
<P>
"The Ten Commandments is part of our history; it's a Christian
history," said Rod McDougal of San Diego, a Moore supporter
who has been traveling with the monument removed from the
Alabama court building.
</P>
<P>
Chris Clipper, a former Austinite who moved to a Washington suburb
last year, paced the sidewalk as crowds lined up for
the few public seats in the white-columned Supreme Court building,
carrying a sign proclaiming himself an atheist.
</P>
<P>
"I think there should be a public forum where all views
should be heard, respected," said Clipper, 41.
</P>
<P>
Inside the courtroom, Justice Antonin Scalia joined Kennedy in signaling clear
support of the government's right to acknowledge religion.
</P>
<P>
Scalia suggested during Chemerinsky's argument that there is no difference between
referencing God at the opening of Supreme Court hearings and
erecting a Ten Commandments monument.
</P>
<P>
"I think 90 percent (of Americans) believe in the Ten Commandments
and I think 85 percent can't tell you what they
are," Scalia said, drawing laughs from people in the packed
chamber. "It's a symbol that government derives its authority from
God."
</P>
<P>
Chemerinsky countered that while the inclusion of "God" in a prayer
may be a symbol, displaying a religious text like the
Ten Commandments conveys a "profound religious message."
</P>
<P>
As for the depiction of Moses -- who Christians believe received
the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai -- on
a frieze on a wall to the left of the
justices inside the Supreme Court chambers. Chemerinsky said it is
constitutional because it is included in a display of 15
"great lawgivers." The Texas monument would be constitutional if it
were displayed similarly.
</P>
<P>
When it was Abbott's turn, Justice John Paul Stevens asked him
whether he would consider a crucifix of the same size
and shape on the Capitol grounds constitutionally acceptable.
</P>
<P>
Probably not, Abbott said, because it is "not a historically recognized
symbol of law . . . and does not send
a message to all people."
</P>
<P>
Abbott fielded several questions about his legal argument that the Ten
Commandments are secular.
</P>
<P>
"You are asking us to ignore the religious purpose?" Kennedy asked.
</P>
<P>
There is both a secular and a religious interpretation of the
commandments, Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, widely believed to be the swing vote in the case,
asked how the state could erect a monument on state
grounds and purport to not endorse its message.
</P>
<P>
"Every monument on the Capitol grounds enjoys a state endorsement, doesn't
it?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
Abbott replied that only nine of 17 monuments bear the state
seal. The Ten Commandments monument does not, he said.
</P>
<P>
Later, Acting U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement -- who spoke on
behalf of the Bush Administration -- echoed Abbott's claims.
</P>
<P>
"The Ten Commandments have undeniable religious significance," he said. "But they
also have secular significance as a code of law."
