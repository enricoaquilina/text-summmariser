US Supreme Court examines issue of displaying Ten Commandments
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON, March 2
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The US Supreme Court on Wednesday 
was to review the displaying in public spaces of the Ten 
Commandments, the fundamental moral precepts of Judeo-Christian 
religions, in a case that could define the extent of separation of 
church and state in American society.
</P>
<P>
Following challenges to the use of public property for 
displaying the commandments in Texas and Kentucky, the court will 
decide under what conditions, if at all, such explicitly religious 
displays are permitted.
</P>
<P>
The first amendment to the US Constitution establishes the 
principle of separation of church and state, but the details of this 
principle remain unclear in the face of numerous contradictory 
decisions by courts over many decades.
</P>
<P>
Jews and Christians believe the Ten Commandments are the basic 
moral guidelines given to Moses directly by God on Mount Sinai.
</P>
<P>
The court will review, in the Kentucky case, the legality of 
displaying framed copies of the Ten Commandments in two courthouses 
among copies of other documents that form the basis of US laws.
</P>
<P>
The Texas case involves the legality of a stone monument 
inscribed with the commandments installed on the grounds of the 
state legislature.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the Supreme Court declined to review a third case, 
concerning the installation of a stone replica of the commandments 
in front of the state Supreme Court of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
The case has drawn extremely high interest from both religious 
groups and secular society advocates across the United States.
