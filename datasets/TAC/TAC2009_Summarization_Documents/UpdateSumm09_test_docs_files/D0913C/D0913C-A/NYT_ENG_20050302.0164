SUPREME COURT WRESTLES WITH TEN COMMANDMENTS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The justices of the Supreme Court appeared to wrestle
with contradictory impulses as they heard arguments on Wednesday in
two cases challenging government displays of the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, they were searching for a broad principle
that could decide not only these particular disputes, but future
ones as well. On the other hand, they appeared powerfully
drawn to deciding the two cases on their specific facts,
even at the risk of inviting an endless parade of
future cases.
</P>
<P>
Was the 22-acre park surrounding the Texas Capitol, where a Ten
Commandments monument sits among 16 other displays, all of them
nonreligious, the equivalent of an outdoor museum or sculpture garden?
Fine: maybe just such a mixed display might pass constitutional
muster, even if a stand-alone Ten Commandments in a future
case might prove more troublesome.
</P>
<P>
Did it matter that the two Kentucky courthouses now seeking to
display a framed Ten Commandments surrounded by nine nonreligious historical
documents had at first hung unadorned copies of the Commandments
and did not add the other documents until after a
lawsuit was filed? If so, if that history provided the
constitutional taint that led a federal appeals court to order
removal of the entire displays, then the answer to whether
a display without such a history would be acceptable could
wait for another day.
</P>
<P>
By the end of two hours of argument, it was not
clear how the justices would resolve the problem they created
for themselves when, after 25 years of silence on the
Ten Commandments, they agreed to decide these two cases. Justice
Antonin Scalia, unsurprisingly, expressed a definitive view, consistent with his
long-held position in religion cases. He called the Ten Commandments
"a symbol of the fact that government derives its authority
from God," adding, "That seems to me an appropriate symbol
to put on government grounds."
</P>
<P>
But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who may well be in a
position to cast the deciding vote, appeared uncertain as she
tried out various approaches to resolving the cases on narrow
grounds. Referring to the Texas monument, erected in 1961 by
the Fraternal Order of Eagles, she wondered aloud whether "at
some point" the preservation of an "old object" might itself
provide an independent, nonreligious justification for keeping the Ten Commandments
on the Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
The justices' visible struggle reflected the fact that the Supreme Court's
own precedents provide relatively little guidance on how to tell
the difference between religious displays that amount to an unconstitutional
"establishment" of religion and those that acknowledge religion in such
a minimal or contextual way that the Constitution is not
offended, even if some individuals are.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the court invalidated a Kentucky law that required the
posting of the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom,
but no one seemed to suggest that the old case,
Stone v. Graham, provided an answer to the new ones.
In the new cases, one federal appeals court upheld the
Texas display even as another struck down the two in
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
Would it be permissible for the Texas Legislature to post the
Ten Commandments, not in an outdoor park, but in the
halls of the Capitol, O'Connor asked Erwin Chemerinsky, who was
representing the Austin man who challenged the Texas display.
</P>
<P>
No, replied Chemerinsky, a professor at Duke University Law School, because
that would be a sign of government endorsement of religion.
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Court itself has upheld the practice of beginning
a legislative session with a prayer, O'Connor pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"It can't be that just because a prayer is permissible, everything
becomes permissible," Chemerinsky replied, adding that a Legislature could not
mount a large Latin cross on the top of a
state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
"It's so hard to draw the line!" O'Connor exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
Justice Stephen G. Breyer said he had reluctantly and tentatively come
to the conclusion that there was no way for the
court to decide religious display cases other than by evaluating
the divisive nature of the display on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
The Ten Commandments are "enormously divisive," Chemerinsky responded, urging that the
court "not ignore social reality." He mentioned the crowds that
the arguments themselves drew to the court, as well as
the dispute in Alabama two years ago over Chief Justice
Roy Moore's display of a large Ten Commandments monument in
the courthouse rotunda.
</P>
<P>
Scalia asked whether the marshal's invocation that begins each Supreme Court
session, "God save the United States and this honorable court,"
was not also "divisive, because there are people who don't
believe in God."
</P>
<P>
Chemerinsky replied that it was important to draw a distinction between
"minimal and maximum religious content." The message of the Ten
Commandments was deeply religious he said: "All of these are
God's commands to his people."
</P>
<P>
Justice David H. Souter asked whether a tablet containing only the
last five commandments, the injunctions against killing, stealing, and so
on, might be constitutional because, unlike the first five, they
did not necessarily imply religious belief.
</P>
<P>
That would be a harder case, Chemerinsky replied, but such a
tablet would still be unconstitutional because it would still convey
the Ten Commandments' message.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
What about a "piece of stone" simply carved with the various
"thou shalt nots," Souter asked.
</P>
<P>
That would be acceptable as a "reflection of law" rather than
religion, Chemerinsky replied.
</P>
<P>
"Who are you kidding?" Scalia broke in, adding that "everyone knows"
that the reference would be to the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
"Context matters enormously," Chemerinsky said.
</P>
<P>
Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, described the Ten Commandments as
a "recognized symbol of law" and defended the state's display
as having the secular purpose of "recognizing historic influences" on
the legal system.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's argument distressed Scalia. "You're watering it down to
say the only message is a secular message," the justice
said. "I can't agree with you. 'Our laws come from
God.' If you don't believe it sends that message, you're
kidding yourself." Later, Scalia told Abbott: "I would consider it
a Pyrrhic victory for you to win on the grounds
you're arguing."
</P>
<P>
In both the Texas case, Van Orden v. Perry, No. 03-1500,
and the Kentucky case, McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties
Union, No. 03-1693, the Bush administration argued on behalf of
the displays. "The Ten Commandments have an undeniable religious significance,
but also a secular significance as a code of law
and a well recognized symbol of law," Paul D. Clement,
the acting solicitor general, told the justices. He added: "The
Establishment Clause should not be interpreted to force the state
to send a message of hostility toward religion."
</P>
<P>
The question was one of degree, Clement suggested. In answer to
a question from Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, he said that
Moore in Alabama "probably" crossed the constitutional line when he
turned the courthouse rotunda into the equivalent of a "religious
sanctuary." Clement added: "The state can have a permissible acknowledgment
of religion, and I don't think in this case the
state of Texas has gone too far."
</P>
<P>
In defending the Kentucky courthouse displays, Mathew D. Staver, a lawyer
with Liberty Counsel, a Florida-based group associated with the Rev.
Jerry Falwell, said the appeals court had "ignored the overall
context" when it ordered the removal of courthouse displays that
contained the Ten Commandments surrounded by the text of nine
historic documents, including the Mayflower Compact.
</P>
<P>
But it was the context that the justices probed, several dwelling
on the original 1999 displays that contained the Ten Commandments
alone. The two counties, McCreary and Pulaski, had decided to
"switch rather than fight," Staver said, and should be "rewarded,
not punished, for trying to get things right."
</P>
<P>
But "the courts cannot turn a blind eye to a sham
secular purpose," David A. Friedman, general counsel of the American
Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, told the justices. He said
a "reasonable observer" would know the history and understand the
counties' real purpose.
