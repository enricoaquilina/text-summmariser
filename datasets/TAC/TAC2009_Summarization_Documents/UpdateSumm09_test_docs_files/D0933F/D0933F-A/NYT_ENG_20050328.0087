MEDICINAL MARIJUANA ON TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Medical marijuana is now legal in 11 states, and bills to
legalize it are pending in at least seven more. The
drug is also at the heart of a case being
considered by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Yet there remains much confusion over whether marijuana in fact has
any significant medical effect.
</P>
<P>
"People subjectively report benefits," said Dr. Joseph I. Sirven, an epilepsy
specialist and associate professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic
College of Medicine in Scottsdale, Ariz. "There's a whole Internet
literature suggesting what a wonderful thing it is. But the
reality is, we don't know."
</P>
<P>
In an editorial last year in the journal Neurology, Sirven said
the best studies of marijuana's effects on humans so far
have shown little objective evidence of benefit in patients with
epilepsy or multiple sclerosis. And a growing body of research
indicates that, at least in teenagers, heavy marijuana use over
a period of years significantly increases the risk of developing
psychosis and schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
In the Supreme Court case, two California residents, Angel McClary Raich
and Diane Monson, brought a suit against federal officials in
October 2002 to defend their use of marijuana after six
of Monson's marijuana plants were seized and destroyed by the
Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
The federal government, which considers marijuana illegal under the Controlled Substances
Act, asked the Supreme Court to overturn a Court of
Appeals ruling that supported the two women. Oral arguments were
heard just after Thanksgiving and a ruling could come any
day.
</P>
<P>
Raich's physician, Dr. Frank Henry Lucido of Berkeley, Calif., asserted in
an affidavit that Raich risked death if she was denied
the marijuana to treat nausea, anorexia, severe chronic pain and
other disorders brought on by a variety of illnesses, including
post-traumatic stress disorder, asthma and an inoperable brain tumor. On
a Web site created on her behalf, www.angeljustice.org, Raich says
she joined the lawsuit "in order to save my life."
</P>
<P>
While little scientific evidence supports such a lifesaving role for marijuana,
many studies have found modest benefits in patients' subjective measures
of pain, sleep, nausea, appetite, tremors and muscle spasms.
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing better for nerve pain than marijuana," said Phillip Alden,
41, a writer in Redwood City, Calif. Twice a month,
he spends about $200 to buy a half ounce of
high-potency marijuana from one of San Francisco's medical marijuana buyers'
clubs.
</P>
<P>
He smokes it three or more times a day to treat
pain from a back injury and to improve his appetite
and reduce nausea associated with AIDS and the antiviral drugs
he takes for it. It has even checked the progression
of his peripheral neuropathy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Two recent surveys published in Neurology have documented widespread use of
marijuana among Canadian patients and a widespread belief in its
benefits. The first survey, of 220 patients with multiple sclerosis,
found that 36 percent had used marijuana to treat their
symptoms and that 14 percent were using it at the
time of the survey.
</P>
<P>
The second, of 136 patients attending the University of Alberta Epilepsy
Clinic, found that 21 percent had used marijuana in the
previous year. Just over two-thirds of the active users said
it decreased the severity of their seizures and slightly more
than half reported a decreased frequency of seizures.
</P>
<P>
But the lead author of the epilepsy study said it proved
only that some patients believed in marijuana, not that it
or its active ingredients, called cannabinoids, actually worked. "There's not
been a randomized, controlled trial demonstrating that marijuana or any
cannabinoid is any more effective in controlled seizures than a
placebo," said Dr. Donald W. Gross, director of the University
of Alberta's adult epilepsy program.
</P>
<P>
Although doctors may now prescribe marijuana in Canada for certain disorders,
including epilepsy, Gross said he had never done so. "It's
terribly complicated from a physician's standpoint, and somewhat frustrating," he
said. "We have a product that has been legitimized without
any evidence of efficacy."
</P>
<P>
A large body of research in test tubes and animals supports
the view that cannabinoids have anticonvulsive properties. But while a
2003 study of 657 patients with MS published in the
journal Lancet found significant improvements in subjective reports of muscle
spasms and pain, it found no improvement by objective measures
after 15 weeks.
</P>
<P>
A follow-up report on the same group of patients did show
modest benefit after 12 months, but the researchers said the
results should be interpreted cautiously because the study had been
intended to test only short-term benefits.
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Baker, a professor at the Institute of Neurology in
London, has found beneficial effects of cannabinoids in mice who
have an artificially induced type of multiple sclerosis. But, he
said, "Showing clinical benefit in humans has been an elusive
beast."
</P>
<P>
"At best there is a narrow therapeutic effect before the side
effects become unacceptable for many people," he said. " What
is clear is that there have been no dramatic improvements
overall."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kenneth P. Mackie, a professor of anesthesiology at the University
of Washington, has devoted 15 years to studying the brain's
response to cannabinoids through specialized brain receptors called CB1 and
CB2.
</P>
<P>
"There's a whole bunch of theoretical reasons suggesting there would be
a benefit for marijuana on a variety of conditions relating
to pain and neuroinflammation," Mackie said. "But the clinical studies
just aren't there."
</P>
<P>
Far stronger evidence exists for a harmful effect of marijuana in
teenagers who use it early and often. "We know that
cannabis is a contributory cause of schizophrenia," said Dr. Robin
M. Murray, a professor at the Institute of Psychiatry in
London and the co-editor of a new book, "Marijuana and
Madness: Psychiatry and Neurobiology."
</P>
<P>
In a 2002 study published in the British medical journal BMJ,
Murray reported that New Zealand teenagers who started smoking marijuana
before age 15 and continued doing so on a daily
basis raised their risk of developing psychosis and schizophrenia from
about 2 percent to as much as 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The study, he said, ruled out the possibility that the teenagers
who used marijuana were also those who were more likely
to develop schizophrenia, whether or not they used the drug.
</P>
<P>
"You have to take a lot to go psychotic," Murray said.
"But with five joints a day for five years, an
amount that is increasingly common in Europe, you're seriously increasing
your risk of schizophrenia."
</P>
<P>
But he added, the risk dropped sharply as people aged, so
that most chronically ill people who used marijuana for medical
purposes were unlikely to experience psychosis as a result.
</P>
<P>
Research in the United States has been greatly hampered by legal
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Dr. Donald Abrams, an oncologist and assistant director of
the Positive Health Program at the University of California at
San Francisco, became the first doctor authorized by the National
Institute of Drug Abuse to receive marijuana to conduct research
to determine if it provided medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
Now more than a dozen California researchers are studying it under
the auspices of the University of California's Center for Medicinal
Cannabis Research.
</P>
<P>
"Cannabis has a 5,000-year history of medical use," Abrams said. He
said he had completed three studies in patients with HIV
that showed no negative effects on their immune systems or
on the functioning of the protease inhibitor drugs they were
taking. He is now trying to show that marijuana has
a beneficial effect on immune functioning, he said.
