PAIN FUELS DOCTOR'S SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH

<P>
At 76, Dr. James Watson has
been recognized repeatedly for his brilliance and his life-altering discovery
50 years ago, along with a colleague, of the structure
of DNA.
</P>
<P>
Remember that winding double-staircase known as the double helix that's recognized
worldwide as DNA's model?
</P>
<P>
That was his discovery.
</P>
<P>
And that finding at age 25 led him to become a
Nobel Prize winner.
</P>
<P>
This day, when we meet, he is being honored by the
National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression at a
Palm Beach dinner. He sits with members of NARSAD --
the president has a daughter with schizophrenia -- and we
begin talking about his research into devastating mental illness and
his quest to find the genes that produce these disorders.
</P>
<P>
He has already found genes implicated in attention deficit disorder and
Tourette's syndrome in children with autism.
</P>
<P>
And we begin to talk about diagnostic testing -- when these
genes are isolated. He thinks it's possible we could soon
have a test, like that done for Down syndrome, for
schizophrenia. Parents could find out when the child is still
in utero if it was afflicted.
</P>
<P>
(The same test, known as a DNA biopsy, might also be
used in adults and children with schizophrenia to find genes
that are damaged and then select the best therapy for
them, similar to the way Herceptin is used in breast
cancer and Gleevec is used for leukemia.)
</P>
<P>
"We just have to spend the money ... if you were
at war, you'd work 24 hours a day, seven days
a week, but that's not the way science is done,"
he says. "We don't have the money. We have no
grants in support of this."
</P>
<P>
He rambles on about famous families who have genetic defects --
bipolar, dyslexia, for example. And how fortunate it would be
if they donated money to his research.
</P>
<P>
"If you found the gene that caused it, you could finally
rid this curse from the family," he says.
</P>
<P>
I ask him why he has chosen to concentrate now on
schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
"We have a son who's been hospitalized with it," he answers.
There is a shocked silence. No one knew.
</P>
<P>
His son, now 35, hasn't responded to medication, he says.
</P>
<P>
I ask him about what seems the cosmic injustice: A man
whose genius makes it possible for him to search out
genetic causes for disorders to be a father to such
a son.
</P>
<P>
"I just look at it as DNA can't be copied perfectly,
and this has always been true, and it leads to
a lot of inequality."
</P>
<P>
A speech given a few years ago enhances his views.
</P>
<P>
"Random throws of the genetic dice during the formation of sperm
and egg take away from too many infants the opportunity
to participate in a meaningful life. Those unfortunate individuals genetically
programmed ... represent unambiguous tragedies lacking in any compensatory side
advantages. Common sense tells me that no one is seriously
harmed by steps taken to prevent the birth of such
children," he has said.
</P>
<P>
So he, a Nobel Prize winner, hasn't been spared the pain
of dealing with what his own research may someday spare
others from suffering. And that drives him, hard, every day.
