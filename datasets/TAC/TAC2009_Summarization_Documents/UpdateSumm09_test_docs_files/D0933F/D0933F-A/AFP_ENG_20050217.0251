Australian researchers announced a 
breakthrough Thursday in the search for the cause of schizophrenia, 
linking the impaired thought processes involved with the disorder to 
thinning grey matter in the brain.
</P>
<P>
Vaughan Carr of the Neuroscience Institute of Schizophrenia and 
Allied Disorders said the discovery could provide a better 
understanding of the genetic causes of the illness and eventually 
lead to improved treatments.
</P>
<P>
"The importance of this research is that it links together for 
the first time abnormal brain structure and function in the one 
image and ties that with abnormal thinking in schizophrenia," Carr 
said.
</P>
<P>
"Now this is a remarkable achievement."
</P>
<P>
The researchers used advanced computing technology to give them 
a "new window" into the brains of schizophrenia sufferers, Carr 
said.
</P>
<P>
They examined the thickness and function of the brain in 10 
Australian patients with early onset schizophrenia while they 
performed a planning task involving attention and memory in a 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. 
</P>
<P>
They compared the results with a healthy control group and found 
those with schizophrenia had difficulty completing the task.
</P>
<P>
The computer analysis showed impaired thought processes and 
inability to problem solve among those with the debilitating mental 
illness were directly related to the thinning outer layer of grey 
matter and reduced activity of the affected part of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
Carr said the find, to be published in the international journal 
Neuroimage, would open new areas of research examining post-mortem 
tissue samples of the affected grey matter in schizophrenia 
sufferers. 
</P>
<P>
"It means we can now focus on the genetics of a very specific 
area of the brain and delve deeper and deeper into why the tissue 
located there deteriorates in schizophrenia sufferers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Researchers hope to pinpoint genes that may be turned on or off 
in schizophrenia sufferers, leading to possible new treatments.
</P>
<P>
The mental disorder, which usually strikes people aged between 
15 to 25, alters the way the brain functions and causes symptoms 
including hallucinations, hearing voices, delusions and impaired 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
The research was done in collaboration with scientists in the 
United States and Germany.
