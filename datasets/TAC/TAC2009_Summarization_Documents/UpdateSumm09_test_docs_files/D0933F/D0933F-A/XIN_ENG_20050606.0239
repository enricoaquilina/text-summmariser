IBM said on Monday that it is 
teaming with a European institute in a research initiative to 
uncover the secrets of human cognitive intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from IBM and the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de 
Lausanne (EPFL) of Switzerland will work together over the next 
two years to create a detailed model of the circuitry in the 
neocortex -- the largest and most complex part of the human brain,
IBM said.
</P>
<P>
The scientists hope that by expanding the project, nicknamed 
the Blue Brain Project, to model other areas of the brain, they 
will eventually build an accurate, computer-based model of the 
entire brain.
</P>
<P>
Using the digital model created with IBM's Blue Gene 
supercomputer, scientists will run computer-based simulations of 
the brain at the molecular level, shedding light on internal 
processes such as thought, perception and memory, IBM said.
</P>
<P>
The scientists also hope to understand more about how and why 
certain microcircuits in the brain malfunction -- thought to be 
the cause of psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia 
and depression.
</P>
<P>
"Modeling the brain at the cellular level is a massive 
undertaking because of the hundreds of thousands of parameters 
that need to be taken into account," said Henry Markram, the EPFL 
professor heading up the project.
</P>
<P>
Under the initiative, IBM will install a Blue Gene 
supercomputer at EPFL, with a peak processing speed of at least 22.
8 trillion floating-point operations per second (22.8 teraflops), 
making it one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.
</P>
<P>
Markram is the founder of EPFL's Brain and Mind Institute, 
where more than 10 years of research and wet-lab experiments have 
produced the world's most comprehensive set of empirical data on 
the micro-architecture of the neocortex.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from IBM will use their experience in simulating 
complex biological systems to help turn this data into a working 3-
dimensional model re-creating the high-speed electro-chemical 
interactions of the brain's interior.
