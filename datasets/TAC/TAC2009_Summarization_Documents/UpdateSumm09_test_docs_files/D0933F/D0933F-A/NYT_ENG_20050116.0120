SCIENTISTS FIND DNA REGION THAT AFFECTS EUROPEANS' FERTILITY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Researchers in Iceland have discovered a region in the human genome
that, among Europeans, appears to promote fertility, and maybe longevity
as well.
</P>
<P>
Though the region, a stretch of DNA on the 17th chromosome,
occurs in people of all countries, it is much more
common in Europeans, as if its effect is set off
by something in the European environment. A further unusual property
is that the genetic region has a much more ancient
lineage than most human genes, and the researchers suggest, as
one possible explanation, that it could have entered the human
genome through interbreeding with one of the archaic human lineages
that developed in parallel with that of modern humans.
</P>
<P>
The genetic region was discovered by scientists at DeCode Genetics, a
biotechnology company in Reykjavik, Iceland, which has made the Icelandic
population, with its comprehensive genealogy and medical records, a prime
hunting ground for the genetic roots of common diseases. Their
finding is published in Monday's issue of Nature Genetics in
a report by Kari Stefansson, Augustine Kong, Hreinn Stefansson and
other DeCode scientists.
</P>
<P>
The report seems likely to receive considerable attention, even though it
raises as many questions as it answers. "I thought it
was one of the most interesting papers in population genetics
I have ever read," said Nick Patterson, a mathematician at
the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass., who advised DeCode on
the article but has no other connection with the company.
</P>
<P>
The DNA region came to light during the search for a
schizophrenia-causing gene, which turned out not to be there. But
the DeCode researchers noticed that the DNA sequences they had
examined did not seem to agree with those in the
standard human genome sequence, said Kari Stefansson, DeCode's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
The lack of agreement turned out to be caused by the
fact that the region exists in two forms in the
Icelandic population. The region is not a single gene but
a vast section of DNA, some 900,000 units in length,
situated in the 17th of the 23 pairs of human
chromosomes. In some Icelanders, the DeCode team found, the section
runs in the standard direction, but in others it is
flipped. Looking for any physical consequence, the DeCode researchers found
that women carrying the inverted section tended to have slightly
more children.
</P>
<P>
The section carries several known genes, not one of which has
any obvious connection with fertility. It is not clear why
inverting the section should have any effect on the number
of children, Stefansson said. But the inversion does increase the
rate of recombination, the shuffling of genes between generations that
is a major source of genetic novelty. That could account
for some of the increase in fertility.
</P>
<P>
The DeCode scientists found that the chromosome-17 inversion is rare in
Africans and almost absent in Asians, but is present in
20 percent of Europeans, the same frequency as in Iceland.
The inversion seems to have been favored by natural selection
among Europeans in fairly recent times, perhaps the past 10,000
years. "Maybe something switched it on in the European environment,
such as an interaction with diet," said David Reich, a
population geneticist at the Broad Institute.

<P>
Fertility is without doubt affected by different genes in different populations,
and DeCode found a genetic element special to Europeans because
that is where it was looking. The increased frequency of
the inversion in Europeans is one of a growing number
of examples of recent human evolution.
</P>
<P>
The inversion itself, however, is surprisingly ancient. Its age is revealed
by its counterpart, the standard or noninverted section of chromosome
17. The standard and inverted regions cannot exchange genetic elements
during recombination because their DNA sequences do not match. Hence,
unlike most of the rest of the genome, which gets
shuffled in each generation, the two forms have existed separately
since their creation. This event presumably happened when the region
came adrift from its parent chromosome and got knitted back
in the opposite way.
</P>
<P>
When all the known versions of a human gene are compared,
in most cases they turn out to have had a
single common ancestor about a million years ago. But the
standard and flipped versions of the chromosome 17 region last
shared a common ancestor 3 million years ago. It is
highly unusual for two versions of a gene to endure
for so long, because one will usually get lost by
a natural process of elimination.
</P>
<P>
The DeCode researchers propose two explanations. One is that the standard
and flipped versions confer different advantages, so that it is
beneficial for a person to have inherited a copy of
each from different parents. This balancing selection can keep two
versions of a gene around in a population indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
DeCode's alternative proposal is that the flipped version was carried for
many years in a different human lineage, one of the
archaic populations that preceded the emergence of anatomically modern humans
in Africa 150,000 years ago. Then, in some episode of
interbreeding, a single copy of the flipped version entered the
modern human lineage some time before humans left Africa 60,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
In support of this view, the flipped version carries far fewer
mutations than does the standard version, as if it had
been accumulating them from a much more recent date. There
have been other recent hints of modern human interaction with
archaic hominids, notably the finding in October that a lineage
of body lice seems to have been inherited from a
different human species.

Stefansson said that another property of the inversion, though one not
described in Monday's article, was that it is associated with
longevity. DeCode scientists have located two sites on Icelanders' genomes
where there is some genetic variant that promotes longer lifespan.
The chromosome 17 inversion, it turns out, lies at one
of these sites. It occurs at much higher frequency in
women over 95 and in men over 90 than in
the normal population. "It seems to confer on people the
ability to live to extreme old age," Stefansson said.
</P>
<P>
It is particularly surprising that the same genetic element should promote
fertility and longevity, because most organisms are obliged to follow
a strategy either of breeding fast during short lives or
of living longer and having fewer children. "Usually people think
of there being a tradeoff between fertility and longevity. So
we are getting a free lunch here," said Dr. Alan
Rogers, a population geneticist at the University of Utah.
</P>
<P>
Stefansson said his findings were empirical observations for which functional explanations
have yet to emerge. Despite the loose ends, other researchers
seem impressed with the solidity of DeCode's findings. "It's a
startling and amazing claim, and it's actually pretty convincing and
compelling evidence at the same time," Reich said.
