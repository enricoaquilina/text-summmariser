RESEARCHERS TOIL WITH GENES ON THE FRINGE OF A CURE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Dr. Huda Y. Zoghbi's laboratory at the Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston, her research team has found the genetic
roots of at least two crippling neurological diseases -- Rett
syndrome and spinocerebellar ataxias.
</P>
<P>
Recently, she and her colleagues identified a gene that regulates the
growth of tiny inner ear hair cells, essential elements of
hearing and balance in mammals.
</P>
<P>
For her findings, Zoghbi, a 50-year-old pediatrician who was born in
Lebanon, has won major honors in the world of science,
including her election to the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"To me, women don't have to give up relationships to dedicate
themselves to science," Zoghbi said over coffee at the Regency
Hotel in Manhattan on a recent Saturday. She is married
with two children. "My life is two things: the people
I love and my work. With a little bit of
organization, it can be done."
</P>
<P>
Q. You started out as a neurological pediatrician. Why quit the
clinic for the research bench?
</P>
<P>
A. I got into research for emotional reasons. In 1985 when
I was about to finish my neurology training, I was
pregnant with my first child, Roula, who is now 20.
It was very hard on me to be an expectant
mother and meet parents whose children had neurodegenerative diseases. It
devastated me to say, "Well, your child has a genetic
disorder, and we can't do anything about it."
</P>
<P>
I was fortunate that around that time I ran into Professor
Arthur Beaudet, a genetics researcher, who said, "I'll be happy
to train you in molecular genetics." So I started over
because I wanted to find a way to solve some
of these terrible diseases. At the beginning, I knew less
than the technicians in his laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Q. How did you come to study the neurodegenerative disease known
as Rett syndrome, which, I believe, strikes about 1 girl
in 10,000?
</P>
<P>
A. While I was still a resident, I met Ashley, a
5-year-old. She couldn't communicate, was having seizures and balance problems
and was constantly wringing her hands. These are signs of
Rett syndrome.
</P>
<P>
Her parents said she had started life as a perfectly normal
girl and then at the age of 18 months, all
of this became manifest. Knowing that Ashley started out as
a healthy child, it was hard to get her off
my mind. A week later, another little girl was brought
to me with similar symptoms. This can't be that rare,
I thought.
</P>
<P>
So I went to medical records and found the charts of
five more girls with symptoms that fit the diagnosis of
Rett syndrome. If I could identify about seven patients, I
knew this was much more common than believed. Moreover, I
was intrigued by Rett syndrome, intellectually. I wondered what goes
on with the brain of a child who starts out
normally and then loses her communication and motor skills.
</P>
<P>
Q. Have you unraveled the puzzle of Rett syndrome yet?
</P>
<P>
A. Well, we've found the gene that, when mutated, causes Rett
syndrome. That's the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene. Six years ago,
we were able to clone it.
</P>
<P>
It turns out that this gene's mutations cause a lot more
than Rett syndrome. There are patients with it who get
seizures and others who get autism. In rare cases, you
even have bipolar disease and mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
A couple of patients with juvenile-onset schizophrenia also have this mutation.
So we think that the gene that's mutated in Rett
syndrome is probably affecting many processes and neuronal activities.
</P>
<P>
It's the same for another neurological disease we study in my
lab, spinocerebellar ataxia Type 1, which is also inherited. That's
even rarer because only 1 in 100,000 people get it.
Yet, by studying it, we've learned that what happens to
mutant proteins in the cell is the same as what
happens to the proteins mutated in Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases.
In all cases, the mutant proteins accumulate within neurons and
are not cleared properly.
</P>
<P>
So, if we can figure out how to deal with the
proteins mutated in ataxia, similar approaches could be taken in
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. By researching diseases that affect only a
few people, we might solve others that affect many.
</P>
<P>
Q. Why is it such a big breakthrough when you discover
a gene that's associated with a specific disease?
</P>
<P>
A. With Rett syndrome, it's helpful to the parents of these
kids. Some thought they'd done something wrong and that's why
their child was sick. Once we had the gene, they
could see it was not their fault.
</P>
<P>
In terms of research, finding the gene permitted us to make
animal models of the disease. We can now engineer mice
to carry this mutation. It is possible to finally study
the disease in the mouse, and to spare humans.
</P>
<P>
Also, once you have the gene, drugs are a possibility.
</P>
<P>
Q. The president of Harvard, Lawrence Summers, suggested that biological differences
might explain why women had not advanced so much in
the world of science. What was your reaction?
</P>
<P>
A. I was disappointed by how he phrased his comments. When
I read them, I worried about how a female graduate
student would feel. My biggest concern was that these words
might be taken by young female scientists to go, "Oww,
I might not make it." And that really upset me.
</P>
<P>
In my own case, I've succeeded, in part, because I had
a very supportive husband -- William Zoghbi, who is a
professor of cardiology at Baylor. We've been together since we
were medical students in Beirut. He's always respected my need
to go late at night to do my experiments. I
also had fantastic mentors, male and female.
</P>
<P>
Dawna Armstrong, a Baylor pathologist, when my baby was 2 months
old, she could see my guilt about being away from
the baby and say, "Huda, babies, they sleep all the
time when they are this age."
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think there's such a thing as a female
style of doing science?
</P>
<P>
A. I think females communicate quite a bit, and that's important
in a lab. Also, there are times when I follow
my intuition. You think, "I'm going to follow this, even
though the data doesn't say I should." I do wonder
if that intuitive approach is more prevalent among women scientists.
Lawrence Summers didn't talk about any of that.
</P>
<P>
Q. What drew you to medicine in the first place?
</P>
<P>
A. I grew up in an educated, cultured Beirut family. My
mother urged me to become a pediatrician. I started medical
school at the American University of Beirut in 1975. That
was the year the civil war in Lebanon began.
</P>
<P>
Bombs fell on the neighborhood of the university. My class was
so determined to study that we attended lectures in the
basement and we slept there at night because you couldn't
go home. I found a corner of the ladies' room
where I lived for most of the semester.
</P>
<P>
At the end of that year, my parents sent me and
my brothers to visit our sister, who was living in
Texas. They were afraid for us. While we were in
the United States, the borders to Lebanon closed. There was
no returning. So Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tenn., a
traditionally African-American institution, accepted me two months after their term
began.
</P>
<P>
But as kind as they were, there I was, 21, alone
in a new country, always worried about people back home:
150,000 people would die in the Lebanese civil war. Somehow
I managed. That year shaped me.
