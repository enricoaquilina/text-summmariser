EXPLORING MENTAL ILLNESS AND BATTLING HER OWN (Science Times) Barron H.
Lerner teaches medicine and public health at Columbia University. Lucy
Freeman, who died at the end of 2004, thought that
there was nothing wrong with being crazy.
</P>
<P>
As a reporter for The New York Times in the 1940s
and '50s, she worked to remove the stigma of mental
illness, even writing a revealing book that chronicled her own
psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
Freeman's efforts recall a heady time in the history of psychiatry,
when two competing groups, the followers of Sigmund Freud and
those who favored physical manipulation of the brain, each believed
it had found a "cure" for mental illness. We know
more today, but all the answers are not in.
</P>
<P>
Freeman was born in 1916, the daughter of Lawrence Greenbaum, a
prominent New York lawyer, and his wife, Sylvia. In 1940,
after graduating from Bennington College, she became one of the
few women on the reporting staff of The Times. Seven
years later, she married William Freeman, an editor.
</P>
<P>
But Freeman had a troubled personal life. As she said in
her 1951 book "Fight Against Fears," she was angry, unhappy
and unable to sleep. She also had a series of
ailments, including sinus headaches.
</P>
<P>
That Freeman turned to a psychoanalyst was not surprising. The teachings
of Freud, who believed that emotional problems in adulthood resulted
from unresolved childhood conflicts, were at the height of popularity
then, and his solution was psychoanalysis -- spending years revisiting
one's life history with a trained therapist.
</P>
<P>
Still, Freeman's family and friends were displeased with her decision to
go into analysis, responding, she said, with "skepticism, jeers and
outright disapproval."
</P>
<P>
One acquaintance told her, "You're crazy if you go to a
psychiatrist."
</P>
<P>
This type of response stemmed from the prevailing beliefs of the
era, which viewed mental illness scornfully and its victims as
deviants. Compounding this stereotype was the reliance on imposing state
hospitals, like the one depicted in the 1948 Hollywood film
"The Snake Pit," to house people with severe schizophrenia or
depression.
</P>
<P>
In truth, many psychiatrists were trying to convert such institutions from
overcrowded, custodial facilities to modern medical centers. Believing that mental
illness stemmed from organic problems within the brain, psychiatrists had
devised a series of treatments, including electroshock therapy and lobotomy.
</P>
<P>
It was these advances that Freeman relentlessly publicized as The Times'
reporter on mental health. Writing scores of articles like "Action
Now Urged on Mental Cases" and "State Mental Care Entering
New Era," she willingly blurred the roles of reporter and
advocate.
</P>
<P>
But Freeman's heart lay in promoting psychoanalysis, which she believed had
greatly improved her own condition, most likely a severe form
of neurosis. By helping her confront her childhood conflicts, which
included hating her mother, having sexual feelings for her father
and envying her siblings, her analyst, she said, had cured
her headaches and eased her psychological pain. Psychoanalysis, she wrote,
"is part of today's struggle for survival."
</P>
<P>
Freeman and her analyst saw unexplored childhood and adult fears as
the cause of mental illness -- even of psychotic conditions
like schizophrenia. As she wrote, fear had "incited the anger,
the hatred, the guilt" and thus "split me into pieces."
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, perhaps, this emphasis on fear had great currency during
the Cold War, leading former mental patients to start "Fight
Against Fear" clubs across the nation.
</P>
<P>
From our modern perspective, viewing fear as the cause of most
mental illnesses seems quite outdated. Even Freud had intended that
only neurotics, as opposed to people with more severe diseases,
explore their childhood conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that disorders like schizophrenia have a
genetic basis and result from chemical abnormalities in the brain.
</P>
<P>
While lobotomy has been abandoned, electroshock therapy is still used to
treat depression. And over the last 50 years, scientists have
developed numerous effective medications to treat psychosis and other symptoms
of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the grand claims made by Freeman and others for psychoanalysis
have been challenged. Researchers argue that the effectiveness of psychoanalysis,
like other medical interventions, needs further validation through studies.
</P>
<P>
Lucy Freeman wanted to hear none of this. According to her
niece, Dale Schroedel, her aunt remained "absolutely devoted and committed
to Freud even when he became archaic."
</P>
<P>
Many therapists still agree with Freeman. Analysis, and its less intensive
cousin, psychotherapy, remain a cornerstone of psychiatric practice.
</P>
<P>
Freeman eventually wrote 78 books, many of them addressing the connection
of emotions and health.
</P>
<P>
In so doing, she further fought the stigma that plagued her
and others suffering from mental illness. "By saving them," she
wrote, "in some way I also saved myself."
