SCHIZOPHRENIA INSIGHT FROM RATS A photo is being sent to NYTNS

get schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
That is lucky for the animals but bad for the millions
of humans who suffer from it, often struggling with its
delusions and mental damage from young adulthood until they die.
With no animals to experiment on, researchers have been hampered
in their efforts to crack the question of what schizophrenia
does in the brain to produce such devastating symptoms.
</P>
<P>
But they may be getting closer. Dr. Francine Benes of McLean
Hospital has just published work showing that on the level
of cells and chemicals, some of the changes of schizophrenia
can be replicated in a rat's brain.
</P>
<P>
"This has never been done before, and conceptually, it's an important
step forward," she said.
</P>
<P>
The rats did not behave as if they were seeing hallucinations
or hearing voices - though who can tell? Rather, Benes
used a drug to mimic some of the biological changes
of schizophrenia, and recorded electrical activity in the brain showing
that, indeed, schizophrenia-like effects in certain circuits in the rat's
brain had resulted.
</P>
<P>
Her findings could lead to new targets for schizophrenia drugs, and
also could allow researchers to better pinpoint genes that are
involved in the disease.
</P>
<P>
"This is a pioneering study that reproduces the neuropathology of schizophrenia
in rodents," said Dr. Alessandro Guidotti, a schizophrenia researcher and
scientific director of the Psychiatric Insitute of the University of
Illinois at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
It is only a partial model, he cautioned, so "this has
to be taken with a grain of salt." But it
could provide a way to test schizophrenia drugs on animals
for potential use in humans, he said, and the lack
of such animal models up until now has been a
major obstacle to the development of better drugs. Research on
the basic biology of disease often can only be done
in animals, because test animals are killed, dissected, or subjected
to other procedures that would be unethical in humans.
</P>
<P>
Published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, Benes's findings in rats build on two decades of
research, by her and others, beginning with an analysis of
brain tissue from dead schizophrenics and now including high-tech brain
imaging and genetic analysis.
</P>
<P>
It was back in the 1980s, Benes recalled, that researchers began
to suspect that levels of a chemical messenger in the
brain called GABA were abnormal in people with schizophrenia. GABA
is the main such messenger that inhibits, or dampens, the
firing of neurons in the brain.
</P>
<P>
Benes gradually realized that there were two particular areas of the
brain where the GABA abnormalities showed up repeatedly: one area,
in the cortex or rind of the brain, played a
role in attention and emotion at the conscious level. The
other was in the hippocampus, which is central to memory.
</P>
<P>
It could be, she reasoned, that both of these areas were
part of a network that is mis-wired in schizophrenia, and
the source of these abnormalities was elsewhere. And yes, it
turned out that major highways of nerve connections linked both
these spots with the amygdala, a small almond-shaped structure deep
in the brain that is important for emotion and learning.
</P>
<P>
"So then we thought we had the makings of a rat
model," she said. "We ought to be able to experimentally
manipulate the amygdala and produce changes in one of these
downstream sites that are similar to what we see in
schizophrenia."
</P>
<P>
With a drug called picrotoxin, Benes dampened the GABA system in
the amygdala. Two hours later, when her team examined GABA-releasing
cells in the rat's hippocampus, they could see changes similar
to those in schizophrenia. They also used electrodes to measure
the activity in neurons in the affected areas, and found
GABA levels dramatically reduced.
</P>
<P>
Such work, she said, is allowing her team now to dissect
out the individual neurons that are likely most important in
schizophrenia and figure out which among thousands of genes may
be most important in the disease.
</P>
<P>
"We're inside the brain, we're inside the circuit, now we're inside
the cells, and I really believe this is the trail
that we have to follow," she said.
