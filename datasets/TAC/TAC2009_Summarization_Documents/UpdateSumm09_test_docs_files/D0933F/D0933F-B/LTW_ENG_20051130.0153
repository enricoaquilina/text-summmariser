Brains of Schizophrenics, Pot Users Look Similar to Scientists
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A teenage brain on pot looks frighteningly similar to the brains of
adolescents with schizophrenia, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
While it's too early to prove a connection, researchers at North
Shore University Hospital-Long Island Jewish Healthcare System caution
that marijuana could be a match that ignites an underlying genetic
vulnerability to schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have long debated whether drug abuse triggers
schizophrenia, which in males usually appears in late adolescence, or
whether the illness itself can lead to drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
``It is the story of nature vs. nurture,'' said Manzar Ashtari, an
associate professor in radiology and psychiatry at Albert Einstein
College of Medicine and a scientist at LIJ's Zucker Hillside Hospital.
``If there are people who are vulnerable and smoke marijuana, they may
be putting themselves at greater risk for developing severe mental
illness.''
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Balster, an endowed professor of pharmacology and
toxicology at Virginia Commonwealth University, said that while more
research is needed, ``studies such as this are very important in
providing new leads for possible brain mechanisms that could be
involved in drug abuse and its frequent association with mental
illness.''
</P>
<P>
The studies at Zucker Hillside were done only in males because
females tend to develop schizophrenia later, in their mid-20s and
beyond. Ashtari suspects the developing brain in late adolescence is
at greater risk of environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
``Whatever insult is happening, it is taking place in brain regions
still under construction,'' said Ashtari, who presented her findings
Wednesday at the Radiological Society of North America's annual
meeting in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The scientists conducted several brain scan studies in teenage
marijuana smokers who used the drug daily for at least one year; in
adolescent schizophrenia patients who didn't smoke marijuana; in
schizophrenia patients who also use marijuana regularly, and in
healthy, nonsmoking controls.
</P>
<P>
Ashtari and her co-investigator, child psychiatrist Dr. Sanjiv
Kumra, found that a brain region called the arcuate nucleus, a bundle
of fibers that connects the front of the brain to deeper regions, is
underdeveloped in both schizophrenia patients and in marijuana users.
While the lack of growth seems to be only on the left side in these
teenagers, schizophrenia patients who also abuse marijuana showed
problems on both sides of the brain.
</P>
<P>
Ashtari said the arcuate nucleus is critical to higher cognitive
functions.
