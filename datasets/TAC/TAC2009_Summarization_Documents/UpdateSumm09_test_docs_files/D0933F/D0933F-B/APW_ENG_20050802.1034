Chinese famine study bolsters starvation-schizophrenia link

<P>
A study of a famine in China more than 40 years ago found that children born to
severely malnourished women are more likely to develop schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
The research bolsters the evidence that environmental factors can trigger the
devastating mental illness.
</P>
<P>
Compared with children born before or after the 1959-61 famine, those born
during the disaster faced double the risk of becoming schizophrenic later
on.
</P>
<P>
The results are nearly identical to a previous study of a famine in Holland
resulting from a Nazi food blockade toward the end of World War
II.
</P>
<P>
"Since the two populations are ethnically and culturally distinct, the processes
involved may apply in all populations undergoing famine," the authors
said.
</P>
<P>
Lead author Dr. David St. Clair of the University of Aberdeen, Scotland,
conducted the study with researchers from China. Their findings appear in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
The study supports the theory that schizophrenia is caused by a genetic
predisposition influenced by environmental triggers that disturb the developing
fetal brain _ in this case, nutritional deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
And that raises the possibility that preventing starvation and malnutrition
could head off some cases, said Richard Neugebauer, a schizophrenia researcher
at the New York State Psychiatric Institute who was not involved in the
study.
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer said in an accompanying editorial that the study's similarity to the
earlier Dutch findings is remarkable given the differences in the two
populations.
</P>
<P>
Still, Neugebauer said, the new research leaves unanswered exactly how
nutritional deficiencies disturb fetal brain development to the point of
increasing the risk of schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
It also does not resolve whether deficiencies in all foods or in a single
nutrient increase the risk. That is "the most pressing question from a public
health and interventionist perspective," Neugebauer wrote.
</P>
<P>
The answer would determine whether the findings apply globally or just to
developing countries where overall malnutrition is common, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Schizophrenia is characterized by delusional thinking and difficulty in dealing
with others. It affects about 1 percent of the world population. Symptoms
usually appear during the teens or early adulthood.
</P>
<P>
Schizophrenia runs in families, and various infections _ including measles, flu
and herpes _ are among environmental factors that some scientists believe may
increase the risk when they affect pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
The famine study focused on the Wuhu region of Anhui province in eastern China,
one of the hardest-hit areas. The researchers examined data on births and deaths
before, during and after the famine and on psychiatric records from 1971 to
2001.
</P>
<P>
In 1960, in the midst of the famine, there were 13,748 children born in the
region; 192 of them developed schizophrenia. That compared with 483
schizophrenics out of 59,088 births in 1956 and 695 out of 83,536 births in
1965.
