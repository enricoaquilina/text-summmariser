Tactical Shift in Treating Schizophrenia
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Copy machines that talk. Co-workers conspiring to kill. These are
the kinds of bizarre hallucinations and delusions that have driven
people with schizophrenia from schools and workplaces and deposited
them on the lonely margins of society.
</P>
<P>
Now, however, doctors are discovering that other well-known, but
much less flamboyant, symptoms of the brain disorder may be just as
significant in preventing schizophrenics from engaging in the real
world. Mental confusion, apathy and the inability to experience
pleasure are now thought to be major barriers to a return to
mainstream life.
</P>
<P>
Such symptoms are hard to treat. Although a number of antipsychotic
medications can help blot out the so-called ``positive'' symptoms of
schizophrenia -- the disorienting and disturbing hallucinations and
delusions -- there are no medications to treat the cognitive
impairment and emotional symptoms.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, researchers have started seeking therapies for
these so-called ``negative'' symptoms of schizophrenia, says Dr.
Stephen Marder, a professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for
Neuroscience and Human Behavior at the University of California, Los
Angeles and director of the mental health research, education and
clinical center for the VA Greater Los Angeles Health Care System.
</P>
<P>
The impetus has been the recovery movement, an effort by patients,
their families and other mental health advocates that aims not to
``cure'' the disease but to restore schizophrenics as functioning
members of society.
</P>
<P>
``The recovery movement is saying, `You can go just so far in
improving positive symptoms, but we also want to be able to socialize,
to work and make progress in our lives,' '' says Marder, who has
helped spearhead a national research effort addressing the problem.
``If that is going to happen, it's likely we're going to have to
develop drugs that address those areas.''
</P>
<P>
The cognitive and emotional problems can be deeply crippling.
People with schizophrenia ``seem like they have a lack of ability to
express themselves,'' Marder says. ``They are also oftentimes
apathetic. Some will say, `I would really like to do things, but I
can't get myself interested in doing it.' ''
</P>
<P>
College students experiencing their first psychotic episode often
find they can no longer continue school even if promptly treated with
antipsychotics and the hallucinations are resolved, he says. ``They'll
find their grades deteriorate. Reading and studying and focusing their
attention becomes so difficult.''
</P>
<P>
The search for treatments for these problems represents a dramatic
shift in drug development goals for schizophrenia. As recently as a
decade ago, doctors and patients rejoiced in a new family of
antipsychotic medications aimed at reducing hallucinations and
delusions without many of the severe side effects linked to the older
antipsychotic drugs. Older drugs, such as Haldol, typically cause
tremors and muscle rigidity.
</P>
<P>
But the new so-called atypical antipsychotics, though helpful to
many, haven't led to sweeping improvements in quality of life, experts
acknowledge. In an 18-month study released in September, researchers
found that three-quarters of the patients stopped taking their
assigned drugs before the trial's conclusion because the medications
didn't improve their condition enough or because of side effects such
as tremors or significant weight gain.
</P>
<P>
Even with treatment, about 85 percent of schizophrenics are
unemployed, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
``Ten years ago, there was a hope that the newer medications would
give us a greater chance at recovery, the vanishing of the disorder,''
says Dr. Thomas R. Insel, director of NIMH. ``I think (the study)
makes clear that the medications we currently have are necessary but
not sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
Several drug companies are continuing to seek better antipsychotic
drugs. But the main focus of research within the government and
academia is on better understanding the negative symptoms of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
For decades, scientists have blamed schizophrenic symptoms on
abnormalities in the brain chemical dopamine -- and these are, indeed,
linked to the delusions and hallucinations.
</P>
<P>
But new research suggests other brain chemicals are involved in the
disorder, contributing to such symptoms as confusion and emotional
unresponsiveness.
</P>
<P>
NIMH is collaborating with universities and industry to identify
possible new medications for cognitive deficits and develop better
instruments for assessing improvements. Ideally, these new medications
would give people with schizophrenia the ability to concentrate, carry
out tasks and interact socially.
</P>
<P>
One promising substance is a drug, D-cycloserine, that is used to
control tuberculosis. D-cycloserine works on a structure in the brain
known in shorthand as the NMDA receptor, which plays a key role in
learning and memory. It's believed that some of the symptoms of
schizophrenia are caused by a blockage or abnormality of this
receptor; D-cycloserine appears to unblock it.
</P>
<P>
Studies on D-cycloserine drugs for schizophrenia are still in early
stages. But one study, reported in March in the journal Biological
Psychiatry, showed that 39 people with schizophrenia taking
D-cycloserine in addition to a traditional antipsychotic experienced
improvements in a range of symptoms, including hallucinations,
delusions, apathy, withdrawal and cognitive deficits.
</P>
<P>
Another avenue of study involves targeting a serotonin receptor
that is critical to cognitive function. Saegis Pharmaceuticals, a
company in Half Moon Bay, Calif., is teaming with Eli Lilly &amp; Co. in
phase 2 testing of a drug, SGS518, which blocks this receptor, with
the hope of improving cognitive functioning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, San Diego's Acadia Pharmaceuticals is studying a
chemical that may help subdue psychotic symptoms as well as improve
cognition. The company is on track to present results from phase 2
studies within a year, said chief executive officer Uli Hacksell.
</P>
<P>
``There is a lot of excitement about the ability to improve the
negative symptoms in schizophrenia,'' Hacksell says. ``It's time to do
something about this part of the symptomology of the disease that
hasn't been dealt with so far.''
</P>
<P>
Drugs, however, will take recovery only so far. Non-drug treatments
are also important. For example, Insel says, a program called
supportive employment -- in which employees receive job coaching,
support, even transportation -- can boost employment rates from 10
percent to 50 percent. Educating family members, and engaging them as
part of the treatment team, can also sharply reduce the relapse rate.
</P>
<P>
``This whole push for recovery is very important, but I don't think
medications are going to be the largest part of that story,'' Insel
says. ``I think we have some very good (nonmedical) treatments that
are not used nearly enough. We need multiple forms of care, not just
medication.''
