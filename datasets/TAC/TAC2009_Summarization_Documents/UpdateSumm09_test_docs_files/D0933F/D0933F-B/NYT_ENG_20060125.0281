STUDIES LINK PSYCHOSIS, TEENAGE MARIJUANA USE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Researchers are offering new ammunition to worried parents trying to dissuade
their teens from smoking marijuana: Evidence is mounting that for
some adolescents whose genes put them at added risk, heavy
pot use could increase the chances of developing severe mental
illness - psychosis or schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
This week, the pot-psychosis link gained ground when two major medical
journals reviewed the research to date and concluded that it
was persuasive. In PLOS Medicine, an Australian public health policy
expert wrote that genetically vulnerable teens who smoke marijuana more
than once a week "appear at greater risk of psychosis,"
while the British medical journal BMJ cited estimates that marijuana
use could contribute to about 10 percent of cases of
psychosis.
</P>
<P>
The new research has little hint of "Reefer Madness" alarmism. Rather,
a half-dozen long, careful studies published in the last several
years have tried to determine whether pot-smoking is a cause
rather than an effect of mental illness. And groundbreaking research
has begun to try to pinpoint which genes and brain
chemicals could do the damage.
</P>
<P>
The conclusions remain controversial, in part because it would be unethical
to randomly assign teens to smoke or not smoke pot
- which would be necessary to perform a gold-standard study
to definitively show that adolescent marijuana use causes mental illness.
It could be the other way around, or some other
factor could put teens at risk of both.
</P>
<P>
But the recent research has attempted to get around these hurdles
by controlling for factors such as the presence of psychosis
before the use of marijuana, family income, education, other drug
use, and childhood traumas.
</P>
<P>
"No single study is perfect," Wayne Hall, author of the PLOS
Medicine essay and a professor at the University of Queensland,
said in an e-mail interview. "But the fact that so
many individually imperfect studies so consistently find this relationship adds
confidence to the conclusion that the relationship is causal."
</P>
<P>
The recent research points to adolescence as a particularly risky time
to smoke marijuana heavily for those genetically predisposed to mental
illness. Brain scientists theorize that marijuana may induce temporary changes
in brain chemistry that, when reinforced over time, become permanent.
</P>
<P>
Among the research cited by both papers appearing this week was
an intriguing study published last year that followed a group
of more than 800 New Zealanders from birth until age
26. The study looked at people with a gene variant
that apparently predisposes them to developing psychosis, and people without
it. The variant was carried by 25 percent of the
study's participants.
</P>
<P>
The study found that among those with this variant, smoking marijuana
as teens increased their risk of psychosis in young adulthood
nearly tenfold compared with those who did not smoke as
teens. Those who smoked pot but did not have the
gene variant incurred little or no added risk.
</P>
<P>
No test of such gene variants is widely available. Dr. Robin
Murray, a psychiatry professor at Kings College London and an
author of the New Zealand paper, said he and other
researchers like to joke that they should set up a
DNA-test tent at rock concerts and tell customers whether it
is safe to get stoned. In reality, however, the gene
research is at too early and tentative a stage to
justify offering a test, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other studies cited in the BMJ article found that teens and
young adults who smoked marijuana had roughly double the risk
of later developing psychotic symptoms, but these studies did not
distinguish between carriers and noncarriers of the gene variant.
</P>
<P>
Still, even among pot smokers, the absolute risk of developing schizophrenia
was low, Murray said - about 2 percent. And the
added risk from smoking pot was small compared to, say,
cigarette smoking, which multiplies a person's chances of lung cancer
by 15, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Overall, schizophrenia affects about one in every 100 people, and two
more in every 100 experience a lesser form of psychosis.
</P>
<P>
This week's PLOS Medicine essay suggests that teens should be considered
vulnerable if they have psychosis in the family, an indication
their genes may predispose them to it, or have had
"unusual psychological experiences after using cannabis."
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the White House has emphasized a causal link
between marijuana and schizophrenia as part of an antipot campaign,
but the National Institute on Drug Abuse does not list
psychosis as a marijuana risk on its informational website.
</P>
<P>
The evidence for a link is becoming more convincing, said Dr.
Wilson Compton, who directs the institute's public health research program.
But he said the agency wants "to make sure we
don't overblow" the risk, because that would make teenagers likelier
to discount the warnings.
</P>
<P>
The controversy stems in part from the challenges of the research.
Consider a boy who has shown early signs of schizophrenia
since childhood, lacking friends and seeking isolation. In his early
teens, he starts hanging out with pot-smokers, gets increasingly withdrawn
and is finally diagnosed with schizophrenia at 19.
</P>
<P>
In a case like that, it is likely that the early
symptoms of the disease led to the pot-smoking rather than
vice versa, said Dr. Harrison Pope, director of the Biological
Psychiatry Laboratory at Harvard's McLean Hospital.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying the studies are wrong," he said. "I'm saying
this is a caveat you have to bear in mind
even when you see six studies all in agreement -
it's very, very difficult in retrospect to tease apart the
chain of causality."
</P>
<P>
But even marijuana advocates allow that there could be a link,
at least for a small minority of pot smokers.
</P>
<P>
Marijuana has an excellent safety record when used in moderation by
adults, emphasized Paul Armentano, senior policy analyst for the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. But "I would
not rule out that heavy use of marijuana at a
young age, particularly combined with other drugs, could precede onset
of some symptoms of mental illness."
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand study, published last year in the journal Biological
Psychiatry, looked at a gene called COMT, which is involved
in the breakdown of dopamine, a brain chemical known to
play a role in psychosis.
</P>
<P>
Though the researchers found a dramatically higher risk when teenagers with
the wrong variant of the gene regularly smoked marijuana, they
cautioned that even so, that combination accounted for only one-fifth
of the people in the study who became psychotic.
</P>
<P>
Still, the COMT study has brought excitement among psychiatric researchers, because
it highlights so elegantly how a single gene could interact
with an environmental factor to contribute to mental illness. Now
the challenge is translating the research into a credible warning
for teenagers.
</P>
<P>
"People who smoke pot don't [automatically] go on to become schizophrenic
- boom boom boom," said Alan Budney, a professor and
federally funded addiction researcher at the University of Arkansas for
Medical Sciences. "There's an intricate level of risk factors that
don't apply to Tom, Dick, and Harry - it just
applies to, say, Jim."
</P>
<P>
At least, said Murray of London, he now has better answers
for schizophrenic patients who ask, "Why is it you're telling
me that cannabis contributed to my going psychotic when all
my mates smoked more than me and nothing ever happened
to them?"
