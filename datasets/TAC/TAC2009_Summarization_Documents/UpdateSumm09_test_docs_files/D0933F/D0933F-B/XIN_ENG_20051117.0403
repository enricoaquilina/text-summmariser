Scientists discover new gene linked with schizophrenia

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 17 (Xinhua)-- A new gene has been identified 
to link with higher risk of schizophrenia and depression, 
scientists reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Schizophrenia and related mood disorders are thought to arise 
from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but 
researchers have had difficulty identifying the specific genes 
involved.
</P>
<P>
Earlier studies have found a gene called DISC1, operating in a 
way that may contribute to the disorder, may make people 
susceptible to schizophrenia. However, the function of its encoded
protein has been unclear.
</P>
<P>
The new research, appearing in the Nov. 18 issue of the journal
Science, presented genetic and biochemical evidence suggesting 
that the DISC1 protein interacts with an enzyme called 
phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), which in turn influences the 
activity of the signaling molecule cAMP.
</P>
<P>
This signaling system has previously been implicated in 
learning, memory and mood in other experimental systems, which is 
consistent with the idea that alterations in the system may 
contribute to schizophrenia, according to the researchers.
</P>
<P>
Damage to the gene PDE4B is also seen to increase the risk of 
developing mental illness. In addition, the researchers have 
discovered that DISC1 acts as a regulator for PDE4B, creating a 
'pathway' between the two genes.
</P>
<P>
"The new genetic link we have made to PDE4B and how that links 
back to DISC1 sheds much needed light on these debilitating 
disorders. It also suggests a new way of thinking about developing
better and effective medicines," said David Porteous, a professor 
at the University of Edinburgh, Britain, who led the study.
</P>
<P>
The new discovery may in the future lead to the eventual 
development of new drugs to treat mental health problems, the 
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
"Our insights into the important role that the proteins PDE4B 
and DISC1 may play in the mis-function of the brain that leads to 
schizophrenia will lead our thinking in the development of new 
treatments for this disorder," said Peter Hutson, co-author of the
study from the drug maker Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme.
