INSULIN A SUSPECT IN ALZHEIMER'S, SCHIZOPHRENIA A graphic is being sent
to NYTNS Photo Service subscribers. Non-subscribers can make individual purchases
by calling 800-535-4425. A small but growing chorus of scientists
is becoming convinced that insulin is just as important to
the brain as it is to the body.
</P>
<P>
The body needs insulin to convert sugar in the bloodstream to
energy. People whose bodies either don't make enough insulin or
don't process it correctly develop Type 1 or Type 2
diabetes, which can lead to poor circulation, kidney failure, blindness,
and death.
</P>
<P>
The role of insulin in the brain is less clear, but
this much is certain: When brain cells are deprived of
insulin, they die. Now researchers are discovering that a breakdown
in insulin-processing in the brain plays a role in mental
illnesses. Perhaps even a driving role.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Suzanne de la Monte, a neuropathologist at Rhode Island Hospital
in Providence, believes that Alzheimer's disease could be called "Type
3 diabetes." And C. Anthony Altar, president of Maryland-based Psychiatric
Genomics, refers to schizophrenia as "diabetes of the brain."
</P>
<P>
Though researchers are still answering basic questions about insulin's role in
mental illness, the potential impact of their work is dramatic.
Until now, research on the ravages of Alzheimer's has centered
mainly on the amyloid plaques that build up in the
brain as the disease progresses, while scientists have focused on
a breakdown in brain cell communication to explain schizophrenia, in
which victims often become delusional and erratic as brain tissue
dies.
</P>
<P>
If the insulin researchers are right, those problems could be secondary
to a more fundamental breakdown in the way brain cells
process insulin to generate energy and protect themselves against death.
</P>
<P>
Whether an insulin shortage "causes the disease, contributes to the disease,
or it's the brain's response to injury we don't know
yet," said Dr. Jesse Roth, geriatrician-in-chief of the North Shore
Long Island Jewish Health System, who has studied insulin's role
in the brain since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Doctors who treat Type 2 diabetes are already concerned about whether
their patients are at greater risk of developing diseases of
the brain later in life. Studies have shown that diabetic
patients are at greater risk of Alzheimer's, but researchers have
assumed that diabetes is just one of several risk factors.
Likewise, people with schizophrenia are at least twice as likely
to develop Type 2 diabetes, but until now, scientists have
attributed that to the unhealthy lifestyle of schizophrenics as well
as the medications they take.
</P>
<P>
"We need to do the basic science, because we need to
be sure," said Dr. C. Ronald Kahn, president of the
Joslin Diabetes Center, who is concerned that the current Type
2 diabetes epidemic could foreshadow an explosion of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
Kahn's research also suggests that insulin problems in the brain, in
turn, may make people more vulnerable to Type 2 diabetes.
Lab mice genetically modified to block insulin processing in the
brain became obese and showed signs of diabetic insulin resistance.
"If this is correct, the public health implications are huge,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, some doctors had latched onto insulin as a possible treatment
for mental illness in the mid-20th century, when "insulin shock
therapy" became popular as a last-ditch treatment for schizophrenia. The
treatment pumped patients so full of the hormone that they
would go into a diabetic coma.
</P>
<P>
While some schizophrenics, such as John F. Nash Jr., the mathemetician
portrayed in the movie "A Beautiful Mind," showed improvement from
the shock treatment, up to 10 percent of the patients
died, and by the early 1960s, insulin therapy had gone
onto the scrapheap of medical history.
</P>
<P>
When Roth began his research for the National Institute of Health
25 years ago, most neurologists agreed that insulin played a
negligible role in brain chemistry. Insulin levels in the brain
were low compared with levels in the rest of the
body, and the brain seemed to have limited need for
the hormone.
</P>
<P>
But Roth's team at NIH demonstrated that brain cells possess insulin
receptors to grab the hormone as it floated by and
took pictures of insulin binding to receptors in rats' brains.
They argued that insulin plays a complex role in brain
cells, from cell repair to self-defense. Far from being a
bit player in the brain, Roth suggested that insulin "has
a very rich job description."
</P>
<P>
When de la Monte started her insulin research in the early
1990s, the neuropathologist was amazed that few scientists had built
on Roth's work. She used a chemical treatment to drastically
reduce insulin levels in the brains of rats and found
that they developed Alzheimer's symptoms, including large-scale cell death. Immediately,
she said, "I knew we had to stop everything we're
doing and focus on Alzheimer's."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, De la Monte's lab has shown that the
brain actually produces insulin itself rather than relying on insulin
from the pancreas that circulates in the rest of the
body. Last year, in a study of brain samples from
45 Alzheimer's patients, de la Monte found that the number
of insulin receptors in the frontal cortex, the center of
intellect, drops by 80 percent in advanced cases of the
disease, meaning that the cells don't get the insulin they
need to survive.
</P>
<P>
"Insulin disappears early and dramatically in Alzheimer's disease," said de la
Monte, who also teaches pathology at Brown University Medical School.
"Many of the unexplained features of Alzheimer's, such as cell
death and tangles in the brain, appear to be linked
to abnormalities in insulin signaling."
</P>
<P>
Of course, other Alzheimer's researchers say it's too soon to say
that insulin defects are the most important cause of the
disease. Large-scale studies have also shown that high blood pressure,
obesity, and cardiovascular disease put people at higher risk of
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
"It is a real stretch to call Alzheimer's disease Type 3
diabetes," said Dr. Hugh C. Hendrie, co-director of the Center
for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Neuropsychiatric Disorders at Indiana University.
He believes the disease probably has more than one cause.
</P>
<P>
The connection between insulin defects and schizophrenia is even less well
established. About three years ago, researchers at Psychiatric Genomics detected
a strange pattern in the brains of deceased schizophrenia patients.
In the hippocampus, the brain region responsible for memory and
learning, they found low levels of activity in genes that
govern the breakdown of sugars and energy production, suggesting an
insulin-processing problem
</P>
<P>
Last year the researchers discovered that the same 14 genes that
are missing in the brains of schizophrenics are also missing
in muscle tissue of diabetics. What's more, they were able
to boost production of the deficient genes in the lab
by adding insulin or insulin-like growth factor, a protein that
is similar to insulin.
</P>
<P>
"We were quite stunned," said Altar of Psychiatric Genomics, which is
now focusing on potential treatments for schizophrenia that would increase
the activity levels of the genes. "There's a whole series
of steps that may prevent the schizophrenic brain from responding
to insulin."
</P>
<P>
Of course, Altar's insulin theory remains new and largely untested, so
even those who hope he is right, such as the
Stanley Medical Research Institute, which is funding him, are cautious.
But Roth of the Jewish Medical Center said, "Whether he's
right in detail I don't know, but he's right in
principle."
</P>
<P>
So far, very few insulin-based treatments for diseases of the brain
have reached human trials. However, physicians from the Veterans Affairs
Puget Sound Health Care System and the University of Washington
are about to study whether insulin delivered in a nasal
spray can improve the memory of people with early-stage Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
But de la Monte is nvinced that one day, insulin therapies
could help the nation's 4 million Alzheimer's patients, and maybe
even Parkinson's disease patients, too. "It opens the door to
many other approaches to a disease that we don't really
have any therapies for," she said.
