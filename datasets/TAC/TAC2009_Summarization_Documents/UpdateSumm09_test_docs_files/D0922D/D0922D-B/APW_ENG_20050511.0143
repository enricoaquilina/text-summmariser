Critics of the USA Patriot Act called for the Senate to temper the
anti-terrorism law's provisions that let police conduct secret searches of
people's homes or businesses, but defenders say since no abuses have been
documented the law should be renewed.
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration wants Congress to make permanent all 15 provisions of
the law that expire at the end of the year, some of which have aroused civil
liberties concerns among liberals and conservatives. The law's national
standards for what are sometimes known as "sneak and peek" searches are
permanent.
</P>
<P>
Sens. Larry Craig, an Idaho Republican, and Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat,
told the Senate Judiciary Committee that while they cannot show any specific
abuses, the anti-terrorism law is written in a way that could allow
abuses.
</P>
<P>
"Our law cannot be written for the best and the brightest. They must also
anticipate enforcement from the worst and the weakest," said Craig, who is
pushing a bill with Durbin that would scale back some of the Patriot Act's
powers.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the law want Congress to pass the SAFE Act to limit the Patriot Act
in several ways, including requiring government officials to inform suspects
about the "sneak and peek" searches within seven days if a judge does not
intervene. The current law does not specify when the government has to inform
suspects about the secret search.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to end the Patriot Act. We want to mend the Patriot Act," Durbin
said.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican, defended the anti-terrorism law, saying
that since no one can come up with specific abuses, the expiring provisions
should be renewed.
</P>
<P>
"In this particular area because there has been no problems, it seems to be me
that the assumption underlying the sunset provisions ought to move forward,
which is, there being no problems, the act ought to be reauthorized," Kyl
said.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has said that the courts authorized 155 delayed search
warrants under the Patriot Act through January.
