US NEARLY DOUBLES USE OF PATRIOT ACT SEARCH POWER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - Justice Department investigators nearly doubled the rate at which
they used a controversial new search-and-seizure power, allowed under the
USA PATRIOT Act, during the past 22 months, according to
data released by the Bush administration Monday on the eve
of congressional testimony by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
Formally called delayed-notification searches, the warrants are known as "sneak and
peek" because they allow investigators to search a person's home
or business and to seize property without disclosing for weeks
or months that they were there. Although investigators must convince
a judge that there is a "reasonable suspicion" that the
investigation would be harmed if the subject were notified, no
judge has ever denied a request for those searches.
</P>
<P>
Although the warrants are codified in a law enacted to fight
terrorism, they are not limited to terrorism investigations. And, according
to the Justice Department, investigators have increasingly resorted to the
power since the Patriot Act became law shortly after the
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said Monday that the power was a valuable
law enforcement tool for a "wide spectrum of criminal investigations,
including those involving terrorism and drugs." But the American Civil
Liberties Union said the release "confirms our worst fears" that
the use of the law is expanding beyond terrorism investigations,
and called for greater oversight.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday intends to question Gonzales and FBI
Director Robert S. Mueller III about how the Justice Department
has been using its Patriot Act powers, setting the stage
for a year of political debate over whether to make
the Patriot Act permanent or to scale it back.
</P>
<P>
In May 2003, the Justice Department released its initial data on
how often it had used the search power, covering Oct.
26, 2001, to April 1, 2003. During those roughly 17
months, it asked for and got sneak-and-peek warrants 47 times,
or about 2.7 times a month. According to data released
MOnday, investigators sought the warrants 108 times in 22 months
- from April 1, 2003, to Jan. 21, 2005, a
rate of 4.9 times a month.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said in its statement that sneak-and-peek searches are
a very small fraction of the total number of search
warrants it uses in its investigations. The searches allow agents
to gather evidence against subjects without tipping them off that
they are under scrutiny - something that could prompt them
to flee, destroy evidence, or menace a witness.
</P>
<P>
"The department estimates that court-approved delayed-notification warrants represent less than 0.2
percent of the search warrants utilized by law enforcement," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The law also allows the clandestine seizure of property when a
judge finds that it is "reasonably necessary." The Justice Department
said it has sought such authorization 45 times since the
Patriot Act became law.
</P>
<P>
But the ACLU said the "highly intrusive" searches "are being used
primarily outside of the terrorism arena. Congress must insist on
receiving more detailed information on each of these searches and
why each was necessary."
</P>
<P>
Delayed-notification search warrants are among the enhanced police powers included in
the Patriot Act. Although judges have had the authority to
approve no-notification warrants in certain criminal cases for decades, the
power did not become codified until the Patriot Act.
</P>
<P>
The ACLU and other critics have called for greater checks on
the power, including stricter standards for when and how a
judge may authorize sneak-and-peek searches. According to the Justice Department
data, no judge has ever denied a law enforcement request
for such search-and-seizure warrants.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales's and Mueller's testimony Tuesday before the committee will mark the
start of the Bush administration's campaign to persuade Congress to
make the entire Patriot Act permanent this year. Several of
its provisions are due to expire at the end of
the year, although the sneak-and-peek" search is not one of
them.
</P>
<P>
A coalition of liberal and conservative libertarians plan to call Tuesday
for the passage of the "Safety and Freedom Enhanced Act,"
which would amend several of the Patriot Act's provisions to
provide for greater safeguards and oversight on when and how
the powers are used.
</P>
<P>
Arlen Specter, chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee and a Republican
of Pennsylvania, said Monday that reauthorizing "certain key provisions" of
the Patriot Act is necessary, but he left the door
open to scaling it back, contending that he is "mindful
of the strong criticism which is coming from both the
right and left of the political spectrum."
</P>
<P>
Democratic Senate aides said Gonzales will also face questioning regarding FBI
agents who allegedly witnessed "torture techniques" during interrogations of "enemy
combatants" at the Guantanamo Bay Navy Base in 2002.
