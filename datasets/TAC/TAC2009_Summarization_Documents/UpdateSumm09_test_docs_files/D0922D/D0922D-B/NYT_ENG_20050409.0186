EDITORIAL: REVISING THE PATRIOT ACT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, April
10:
</P>
<P>
When Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who is not exactly a renowned
civil libertarian, says the Patriot Act may need some adjustments,
it clearly has serious problems. The act, which was rushed
through Congress after the Sept. 11 attacks, gives government too
much power to invade the privacy of ordinary Americans and
otherwise trample on their rights. Congress, which is now reviewing
the act, should rewrite the parts that violate civil liberties.
But it is important to realize that most of the
worst post-Sept. 11 abuses did not stem from the Patriot
Act. If Congress wants to restore the civil liberties Americans
have lost in the last three and a half years,
it must also look more broadly at the problems that
have emerged from the war on terror.
</P>
<P>
After Sept. 11, Congress was in such a rush to pass
the Patriot Act that, disturbingly, many members did not even
read it before they voted for it. Fortunately, Congress made
some of the most controversial provisions expire by the end
of 2005. Last week, it began a series of hearings
on the act, focusing on the parts that need to
be reauthorized.
</P>
<P>
The debate over the Patriot Act is too often conducted in
bumper stickers, in part because the details are so arcane.
Parts of the law are reasonable law enforcement measures that
have generated little controversy. But other parts unquestionably go too
far, and invite the FBI, the CIA and the White
House to spy on Americans, and suppress political dissent, in
unacceptable ways.
</P>
<P>
Libraries and Medical Records Section 215, often called the "library provision,"
is one of the most criticized parts of the act,
with good reason. It allows the government to demand library,
medical, and other records, and makes it a crime for
the record holders to reveal that the request was made.
Section 215 is written far too broadly. It lets the
government seize an entire database -- all the medical records
of a hospital, all of the files of an immigration
group -- when it is investigating a single person. It
also is far too invasive; it is hard to believe
the FBI needs to monitor library book circulation. If the
searches are allowed, Section 215 should be tightened to give
the government access only to records of a specific person
it has legitimate reason to believe is involved in terrorism,
not an entire database.
</P>
<P>
The "gag rule" that makes it illegal for the record holder
to talk publicly about the search also is disturbing, because
it prevents the public from knowing if the government is
abusing these sweeping powers. If the gag rule remains, it
should be limited, so record holders can speak about the
search after a suitable period of time, or talk about
it right away without revealing who the target was.
</P>
<P>
Secret Searches Section 213, the "sneak and peek" provision, lets the
government search a person's home and delay telling him about
it. These delayed-notification searches fly in the face of the
strong American tradition that the government must announce when it
is entering a home. Delayed-notification searches were of questionable legality
before the Patriot Act, and Section 213 -- which does
not expire this year, but is still generating considerable debate
-- clearly goes too far. At the very least, it
should apply only to terrorism cases, and not, as it
now does, to all investigations. It should also have clear
guidelines for how long notice can be delayed.
</P>
<P>
Secret searches are an area where focusing only on the Patriot
Act misses the larger picture of civil liberties violations. There
is another law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, that allows
a worse kind of secret search -- one in which,
unlike the delayed notification of Section 213, the subject may
never be told about the search at all.
</P>
<P>
One way for Congress to deal with searches under the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act -- as well as those under sections
213 and 215 of the Patriot Act -- is to
monitor them closely, which is not being done now. Congressional
staff members with appropriate security clearance should review all requests
for warrants or subpoenas, and should follow up on the
results of the searches. If the FBI, CIA or other
units of government are using these tools to spy on
Americans without sufficient justification, Congress needs this information to rein
them in.
</P>
<P>
INFORMATION SHARING: Giving different units of government more power to share
information about suspected terrorists is a laudable goal, but the
Patriot Act's approach is flawed. It authorizes the FBI, the
CIA, and even the White House sweeping access to confidential
information gathered about Americans, including telephone and e-mail intercepts. The
access is not limited to officials working on terrorism. And
it sweeps in information, like confidential material acquired by grand
juries, that has always been closely guarded. There is a
real danger that the new regime established by the act
could produce a massive database on Americans, freely available to
all units of government.
</P>
<P>
The Patriot Act makes the same mistake the FBI and CIA
have long made: favoring information quantity over quality. The universe
of data that is shared should be narrowed, to focus
on information closely related to suspected terrorism, and rather than
being indiscriminately dumped, it should be given only to officials,
at whatever agency, engaged in investigating terrorism. In the case
of data collected subject to the special powers of a
court, such as wiretaps and secret grand jury material, a
judge's approval should be required before it is simply dumped
into a general database.
</P>
<P>
BEYOND THE PATRIOT ACT: At last week's hearings, Gonzales conceded that
the Patriot Act may need some adjustment, while the Justice
Department is largely standing by the law, and the FBI
is even seeking to expand it. But a coalition of
Republicans and Democrats in Congress, backed by such unlikely allies
as the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Conservative
Union, is pushing for changes. In the coming weeks, there
will be more hearings on how the act can be
improved.
</P>
<P>
These hearings should look beyond the Patriot Act, to the larger
picture of civil liberties and the war on terror. After
Sept. 11, the government rounded up illegal immigrants, and put
hundreds with no ties to terrorism behind bars for months,
often in deplorable conditions. The Justice Department's own inspector general
found that the government made "little attempt" to distinguish people
with ties to terrorism from those without. In conducting this
roundup, the Bush administration gave itself far more power than
the Patriot Act does. Under the act, aliens are to
be held no more than seven days before immigration or
criminal charges are brought.
</P>
<P>
Nor did the Bush administration rely on the Patriot Act for
its lawless "enemy combatant" doctrine, the basis for holding American
citizens suspected of terrorism indefinitely, without access to family members
or lawyers. And the administration now claims that the CIA
has the right to secretly transfer suspected terrorists to foreign
countries for interrogation. Critics of the process, known as rendition,
say it is being used to subject these suspects to
torture. The authority for rendition comes not from the Patriot
Act, but from a classified directive that President Bush signed
shortly after 9/11.
</P>
<P>
If Congress becomes too bogged down in the minutiae of the
Patriot Act in coming weeks, it will be in danger
of missing the larger picture. Revising the law should be
the start, not the end, of its work.
