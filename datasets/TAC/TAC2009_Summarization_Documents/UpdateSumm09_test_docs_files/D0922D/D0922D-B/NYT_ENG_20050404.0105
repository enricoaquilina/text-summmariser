CONGRESS BEGINS RECONSIDERATION OF PATRIOT ACT

<P>
With five state legislatures in revolt against the Patriot
Act, Congress begins reconsideration of the sweeping anti-terrorism legislation Tuesday
amid clamor for changes from the political right and left.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Montana joined four other states that have passed resolutions
urging Congress to curb the new powers hastily granted to
federal law enforcement agencies six weeks after the Sept. 11,
2001, terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
This latest resolution to restrict the Patriot Act "protects our states
rights and is what true Republicans in every 'red state'
should be doing," said Rick Maedje, a GOP member of
the Montana House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
However, similar measures urging restrictions on the Patriot Act have also
passed in the 'blue states' of Vermont, Maine and Hawaii
-- which tend to vote Democratic in national elections --
as well as in the 'red states' of Alaska and
Montana. A coalition to rein in the Patriot Act is
headed by former Rep. Bob Barr, a conservative Georgia Republican,
and has members ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union
on the ideological left to Americans For Tax Reform on
the right.
</P>
<P>
"It's our number one legislative priority," Anthony D. Romero, executive director
of the ACLU, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Portions of the act will expire at the end of this
year if Congress does not vote to renew them, as
President Bush has requested. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales will begin
making the administration's case to Congress this week, testifying before
the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday and the House Judiciary
Committee on Wednesday. Hearings are likely to continue into the
summer before any measures come up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
"I expect these national hearings to be very thorough and I'm
certain there will be probing questions from senators on both
sides of the aisle," said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman
of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
"There are few issues that are more important to this committee
and the American people than protecting our citizen's precious civil
rights and civil liberties while continuing the battle against terror,"
said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the ranking minority member on
the House committee.
</P>
<P>
The Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers of surveillance,
investigation and prosecution to use against suspected terrorists and their
enablers. However, opponents said it has also been used to
bypass the constitutional requirements for "probable cause" in issuing warrants
in ordinary criminal investigations and in other manners unrelated to
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the secrecy that permeates the Patriot Act, it's clear that
it has been abused and misused," said Romero in a
letter sent Monday to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a member
of the Judiciary Committee. "The government has committed these transgressions
without apology or regret and has simultaneously sought to expand
the powers granted under the Patriot Act."
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the ACLU said the act had been used
to carry out a secret search of the home of
Brandon Mayfield, a Muslim attorney in Portland, Ore., who was
wrongly suspected of complicity in the 2004 terrorist bombing of
a train in Madrid, Spain. The ACLU also charged abuse
or misuse of the act in keeping Tariq Ramadan, a
"widely respected Muslim scholar," from entering the United States and
for prosecuting Sami al-Hussayen, a Muslim student in Idaho, for
posting Internet links to materials the Justice Department deemed "objectionable."
</P>
<P>
Sens. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, and Richard Durbin, D-Ill., plan to introduce
the "Safety and Freedom Enforcement" or SAFE Act on Tuesday,
aimed at eliminating some of the Patriot Act provisions that
opponents view as most extreme. It would deal with the
so-called "sneak and peek" provision, which allows federal agents to
secretly search people's homes and businesses without any deadline on
giving notice that the intrusion had taken place.
</P>
<P>
The SAFE Act would also curb a part of the Patriot
Act that allows federal agents to collect personal data on
ordinary Americans -- such as their medical history, books they
check-out at the library and goods they purchase -- without
evidence that the citizen is connected to terrorism. And it
modifies a section that opponents say defines "terrorism" too broadly,
making law-abiding critics of federal policy subject to investigation.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
In addition to the five state legislatures, the ACLU said 375
county and city governments in 43 states have passed resolutions
warning against threats that the Patriot Act could pose to
civil liberties. In a March 7 speech to county officials,
Gonzales contended that some of these votes were based on
"misinformation or a lack of information."
</P>
<P>
"The act has helped us considerably in the war on terrorism,"
Gonzales said.
</P>
<P>
Romero said the ACLU has never opposed the Patriot Act in
its entirety. Some provisions were needed to fight terrorism, he
said, "but some provisions went too far."
