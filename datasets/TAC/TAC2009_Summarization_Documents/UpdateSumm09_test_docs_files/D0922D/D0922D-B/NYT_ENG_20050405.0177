GONZALES SIGNALS COMPROMISE ON PATRIOT ACT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales signaled Tuesday that the Bush
administration is open to compromise with civil liberties advocates on
key provisions of the USA Patriot Act as it comes
up for renewal this year, shifting away from the hard-line
stance of his predecessor, John Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday, also revealed that
the FBI had used Patriot Act surveillance powers to monitor
an Oregon lawyer who last year was wrongly jailed for
14 days as a "material witness" in the March 2004
Madrid train bombings.
</P>
<P>
And Gonzales disclosed that FBI agents have used Patriot Act search
warrants 35 times to obtain business records deemed relevant to
a terrorism investigation. In May 2004, Ashcroft publicly said such
warrants had never been used.
</P>
<P>
None of those 35 warrants were used on libraries, but FBI
Director Robert Mueller said some libraries have voluntarily provided information,
such as data from computers used by a suspect for
Internet access. Librarian groups have been sharp critics of the
Patriot Act, arguing that people's reading habits should be protected
from government surveillance.
</P>
<P>
"As Congress considers whether to renew these provisions, I am open
to suggestions for clarifying and strengthening the act," Gonzales said.
"I look forward to meeting with those both inside and
outside of Congress who have expressed concerns about the act.
But let me be clear that I will not support
any proposal that would undermine our ability to combat terrorism
effectively."
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, Ashcroft threatened that President Bush would use his
first veto if Congress modified the Patriot Act, and members
from both parties criticized the former attorney general for failing
to answer questions about how the Justice Department was using
the law.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales' disclosures about how the Patriot Act has been used and
his willingness to entertain revisions of the law were cheered
by members of both parties.
</P>
<P>
"I am heartened by your opening statement, Attorney General, about being
open to suggestions and ideas," said Senator Richard J. Durbin
of Illinois, the Democratic whip. "It is a grand departure
from your predecessor, and I think it is the right
spirit for us to address the Patriot Act."
</P>
<P>
Congress passed the Patriot Act shortly after Sept. 11, 2001. Most
of it is dedicated to sharing information between law-enforcement and
spy agencies. But its provisions granting FBI agents greater power
to search people's computers, telephones, and homes have become powerful
symbols to civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen provisions of the Patriot Act are due to expire at
the end of 2005, and Bush has said it is
a priority for Congress to make them permanent. Testimony by
Gonzales and Mueller Tuesday opened a new season of political
debate over the measure.
</P>
<P>
"In the United States, with our deep tradition for civil rights
and constitutional law, that concern for security has to be
balanced by due regard for civil rights," said Senator Arlen
Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
He added later, "This is a very knotty problem. I
think there has to be some give on some of
these authorities."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senator Larry Craig, an Idaho Republican, and Durbin filed a
bipartisan bill Tuesday that would provide more public notification and
scrutiny of Justice Department actions under the Patriot Act.
</P>
<P>
Among other changes, their measure would require that most people be
notified of secret search warrants against them within seven days
of the search. It also would make certain that nonviolent
political protests are not covered by the act.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the civil liberties of this country are its strength," Craig
said. "Out of fear, we should not run from those
principles, nor should we deny ourselves those rights and those
protections."
</P>
<P>
Libertarians have also suggested carving out exceptions for libraries and bookstores
from the "business records" that may be sought under the
Patriot Act. But Gonzales argued that the power should be
preserved, even as he stressed that the warrants have so
far been used only for driver's license, credit card, and
telephone records, not reading lists.
</P>
<P>
"It should not be held against us that we've exercised, in
my judgment, restraint," Gonzales said.
</P>
<P>
Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, expressed impatience with the arguments
by librarians, cutting off Mueller when the FBI director was
discussing how to balance security and the "sanctity" of libraries.
</P>
<P>
"A library doesn't have any sanctity," Sessions said, adding that librarians
"think it's sanctified, I'll admit. I just disagree that it
deserves special protection."
</P>
<P>
Gonzales also argued against a proposal to raise the standard of
proof before a judge may authorize a search of business
records.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the attorney general said he would be happy to discuss
compromises. He offered two proposals for clarifying business record search
warrants, saying the law should make clear that they are
for national security investigations only, and business owners are allowed
to challenge the warrants in court.
</P>
<P>
Greg Nojeim, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said
the Justice Department has already conceded those restrictions in court
cases. But he called Gonzales' willingness to consider other modifications
"a welcome and constructive change."
</P>
<P>
"We believe the changes that the attorney general mentioned today were
conceded long ago and much more needs to be done
to bring the Patriot Act in line with the Constitution,"
he said.
