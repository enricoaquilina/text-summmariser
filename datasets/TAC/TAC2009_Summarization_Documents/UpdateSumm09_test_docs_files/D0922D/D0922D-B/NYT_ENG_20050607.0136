PRUNING THE PATRIOT ACT (FOR USE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRUNING THE PATRIOT ACTCONGRESS APPROVED the USA Patriot Act in a
flush of fear following the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001,
but it had the good sense to put a time
limit on many of the most controversial sections so they
expire next Dec. 31. It ought to assess their effectiveness
and potential for abuse rather than toughening the act, as
one influential senator proposes.
</P>
<P>
Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee,
wants to expand the ability of the FBI to use
search warrants issued by a secret intelligence court. Under Roberts's
plan, the agents could use this authority to look for
evidence of crimes unrelated to the purpose of the warrants.
</P>
<P>
Roberts would also allow FBI agents to write their own subpoenas
without having to get permission from a judge. And the
FBI would be able to order the US Postal Service
to provide copies of envelopes addressed to or sent from
people linked to national security investigations.
</P>
<P>
Neither Roberts nor the FBI has yet made the case that
these powers are essential to thwart terrorism. The senator's attempt
to attach them to renewal of the Patriot Act has
diverted attention from more pressing matters, such as whether this
sprawling piece of legislation has been effective and whether it
infringes on Americans' liberties.
</P>
<P>
In "Rethinking the Patriot Act," a study to be released this
week by the Century Foundation in New York, legal scholar
Stephen J. Schulhofer concludes that while some sections of the
law are useful, its implications for civil liberties are troubling
and its impact on terrorism is unclear.
</P>
<P>
Schulhofer joins many librarians who worry that enhanced search powers for
documents allows government agents to rummage through Americans' private records,
including the books they borrow. No doubt most federal agents
will use common sense when seeking this information, but the
risk of abuse is still too high for this section
to remain in effect.
</P>
<P>
Roberts's committee, which was drafting its version of a Patriot Act
extension yesterday, will not have the last word on revising
the law; the House has yet to prepare its own
proposal. Congress ought to be pruning unnecessary, intrusive sections instead
of adding more threats to personal liberty.
</P>
<P>
Congress passed the Patriot Act in a climate of understandable urgency.
Schulhofer concludes that "legal limitations bear little if any of
the blame for Sept. 11." With the advantage of hindsight
and with adequate time to deliberate, Congress has an important
chance to get it right this year.
