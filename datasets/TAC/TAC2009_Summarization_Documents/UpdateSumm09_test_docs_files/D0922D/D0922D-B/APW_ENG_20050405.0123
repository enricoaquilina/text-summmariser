Attorney general to defend renewal of Patriot Act to Congress
</HEADLINE>

As Attorney General Alberto Gonzales prepares his defense of expiring provisions
of the Patriot Act, the anti-terrorism law's opponents hope to persuade Congress
not to extend what they say are intrusions into Americans' lives.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales is to testify Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee and go
before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. FBI Director Robert Mueller,
who also wants full reauthorization of the Patriot Act, will join Gonzales for
his Senate appearance.
</P>
<P>
On the same day Gonzales will speak to the Senate committee, Sens. Larry Craig,
an Idaho Republican, and Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, plan to reintroduce
legislation designed to curb major parts of the Patriot Act that they say went
too far.
</P>
<P>
"Cooler heads can now see that the Patriot Act went too far, too fast and that
it must be brought back in line with the Constitution," said Gregory Nojeim,
associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Washington
legislative office.
</P>
<P>
The Patriot Act is the post-Sept. 11 law that expanded the government's
surveillance and prosecutorial powers against suspected terrorists, their
associates and financiers. Most of the law is permanent, but 15 provisions will
expire in December unless renewed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
Among them is a particularly controversial section permitting secret warrants
for "books, records, papers, documents and other items" from businesses,
hospitals and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
That section is known as the "library provision" by its critics. While it does
not specifically mention bookstores or libraries, critics say the government
could use it to subpoena library and bookstore records and snoop into the
reading habits of innocent Americans.
</P>
<P>
That criticism has led five states and 375 communities in 43 states to pass
anti-Patriot Act resolutions, the ACLU says.
</P>
<P>
Even some Republicans are concerned. Senate Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter, a
Pennsylvania Republican, has suggested it should be tougher for federal
officials to use that provision.
</P>
<P>
Does "this really incorporate the kind of constitutional guarantees that
Americans have come to expect?" said David Keene, chairman of the American
Conservative Union.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales already has agreed to two minor changes to the provision, and is
expected to address those Tuesday, a Justice Department official said on
condition of anonymity so as not to pre-empt Gonzales' testimony.
</P>
<P>
He will support giving someone who receives a secret warrant under the provision
the right to consult a lawyer and challenge the warrant in court, and will back
slightly tightening the standard for issuing subpoenas, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Neither of the changes addresses the central concern of critics, which is that
it allows the government to seize records of people who are not suspected
terrorists or spies.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales and his predecessor, John Ashcroft, say the Patriot Act is a critical
law enforcement tool that has helped protect the country from another terrorist
attack. However, Gonzales has shown a willingness to discuss possible
modifications, saying in January he would consider Specter's suggestion to make
it harder for officials to obtain warrants for books, records and other reading
material.
</P>
<P>
"The attorney general has said before that if there are suggestions that can add
to the government's ability to root out terrorists and aid us in the war on
terror, he will certainly work with Congress to do that," Gonzales spokesman
Kevin Madden said. "He looks forward to a healthy discussion about those
provisions."
</P>
<P>
But Gonzales wants the entire Patriot Act renewed and has spent significant time
talking up the law in preparation for his possibly contentious appearances
before Congress.
</P>
<P>
"I am willing to support improvements to our laws that make America safer. What
I will not support are changes in the law that would make America more
vulnerable to terrorist attacks," he told a conference in February.
</P>
<P>
Critics say the law allows the government to target certain groups, but the
Justice Department counters that no Patriot Act-related civil rights abuses have
been proven.
</P>
<P>
Just in case, Craig and Durbin plan to ask Congress Tuesday to curb both
expiring and nonexpiring parts of the Patriot Act, including the expiring
"library" provision and "sneak and peek" or delayed notification warrants. Those
warrants _ which will not expire in December _ allow federal officials to search
suspects' homes without telling them until later.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said federal prosecutors have asked for 155 such warrants
since 2001.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales also notes that the law has been used in non-terrorism cases. But
non-terrorism uses are part of what concerns Grover Norquist, president of
Americans for Tax Reform.
</P>
<P>
"Many of us remember what happened with RICO," the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, Norquist said. "It was originally passed and they
were going to go after organized crime figures in dark shirts and they ended up
using it against pro-life demonstrators years later."
