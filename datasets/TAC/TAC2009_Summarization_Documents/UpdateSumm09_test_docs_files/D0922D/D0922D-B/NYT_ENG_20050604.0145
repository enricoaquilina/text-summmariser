PANEL TO WEIGH BEEFED-UP PATRIOT ACT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - The Senate Intelligence Committee will meet behind closed doors
this week to consider legislation that could dramatically expand the
government's police powers under the USA Patriot Act, including a
little-discussed provision to enlarge the FBI's ability to wiretap people
who it suspects are national security threats.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, in a draft bill sponsored by committee chairman Pat
Roberts, Republican of Kansas, would lift one of the last
restrictions on special warrants the FBI can obtain through a
secret court originally set up to monitor foreign spies: that
the information the bureau wants must be related to international
terrorism or foreign intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the FBI could use the warrants, which bypass normal constitutional
safeguards, to look for evidence of unrelated crimes that it
could use to get suspects off the street. The wiretap
provision is one of three major additions in the draft
bill, which would reauthorize the Patriot Act, the package of
enhanced law enforcement powers enacted after the attacks of Sept.
11, 2001.
</P>
<P>
If the bill became law, it also would give FBI agents
the power to write their own subpoenas without permission from
a judge, allowing them to seize records from hotels, banks,
and Internet service providers. This provision would require the FBI
to make periodic reports to Congress about how often it
uses that power to obtain library records, bookstore and firearms
sales receipts, and medical or tax records.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also would have the authority to order the US
Postal Service to make and turn over photocopies of envelopes
addressed to or sent from people who have some connection
to ongoing national security investigations. And the bill would extend
the deadline before the FBI is required to ask a
judge to extend or renew a wiretap.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill Roberts has sponsored would escalate the government agents'
police powers at a time when civil libertarians have been
trying to roll back the Patriot Act by urging greater
oversight of investigations by courts and Congress. The Intelligence Committee
bill doesn't include the new safeguards that critics, including both
Democrats and Republicans, have proposed.
</P>
<P>
Lisa Graves, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, called
the proposed bill a strategic maneuver by Republicans to shift
arguments from curbing the Patriot Act to expanding it.
</P>
<P>
"It's an attempt to force the debate onto their terms, versus
where the momentum has been headed, which is to roll
back the Patriot Act to bring it in line with
the Constitution and make sure its tools are focused on
terrorists, as opposed to Americans," Graves said.
</P>
<P>
The draft of Roberts's proposal is still largely under wraps, and
no one at the Justice Department nor the Intelligence Committee
was available to comment on it late last week. It
was given to a small group of specialists who testified
at the only public hearing in the Intelligence Committee in
late May. At that little-noticed hearing, the FBI's general counsel,
Valerie Caproni, testified that the Justice Department strongly supported Roberts'
bill.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the most important provisions of the USA Patriot Act
... are scheduled to sunset at the end of this
year, and the [Justice] Department therefore applauds this committee for
taking up legislation that would make permanent those provisions," she
said, according to her prepared opening statement at the hearing.
"We are also heartened that this committee has come forward
with novel and worthwhile ideas for strengthening the department's counterterrorism
capabilities."
</P>
<P>
Two of the new powers the Intelligence Committee would give to
the FBI bear a strong resemblance to tools the bureau
has long coveted, but which federal judges in the past
have rejected.
</P>
<P>
In 2002, the Bush administration argued that, under the original language
of the Patriot Act, it should be able to use
the national security warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Court to look for evidence of ordinary crimes as a
way to keep suspected terrorists off the streets - the
same idea contained in the Roberts bill. It was rejected
by a special review panel for the secret court.
</P>
<P>
"We see not the slightest indication that Congress meant to give
that power to the Executive Branch," wrote the panel, made
up of federal appeals court judges. The national security warrant
process, they declared, "cannot be used as a device to
investigate wholly unrelated crimes."
</P>
<P>
The possibility that the FBI could get such powers under a
renewed Patriot Act has alarmed civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
"From a constitutional standpoint, that would be devastating because it would
essentially render the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and
seizure completely meaningless," said former US Representative Bob Barr, the
Georgia Republican who became a civil liberties specialist for the
American Conservative Union, the nation's oldest conservative lobbying organization, after
leaving Congress in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Although the powers sought by the FBI in the Roberts bill
are significant, neither Roberts nor the Bush administration has made
a strong effort to build a public case for why
the bureau needs them before the bill is finalized.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to get a comment from Roberts's spokesman on the Intelligence
Committee or from the Justice Department, which supervises the FBI,
were unsuccessful. Members of the committee staff and representatives of
the Justice Department said that the two people who are
authorized to talk about the Patriot Act were both away,
and that no one else could comment.
</P>
<P>
The FBI was rejected in a prior attempt to write its
own subpoenas for records from businesses if agents determined that
the records were "relevant" to a national security investigation -
considered a very low standard to meet. Last fall, judges
stripped the bureau of that power, declaring it unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Laws dating back to 1986 had granted the bureau the power
to write its own subpoenas to get telephone and Internet
records for national security investigations of foreign agents. Business owners
served with those FBI demand letters were permanently gagged from
telling anyone about the incident, including their clients and their
own lawyers.
</P>
<P>
In 2001, the Patriot Act removed a key requirement. Now, the
subject only has to be "relevant" to investigations of suspected
terrorists or foreign spies, a significantly broader standard.
</P>
<P>
After FBI agents used the power to demand unspecified customer service
records from an Internet service provider, the company challenged the
bureau in court instead of complying.
</P>
<P>
In September 2004, a judge ruled that power unconstitutional, saying that
it violated both free speech and unreasonable search protections. That
case is still under appeal, but the draft bill would
restore the power and expand it to any kind of
records, papers, or other "tangible things" about a target which
are held by a third party, with new procedures intended
to address the constitutional issues.
</P>
<P>
Civil libertarians argue that the FBI has not clearly shown how
its investigations have been hampered for lack of this power.
And they warn that - unlike the Internet service provider
who took the bureau to court - few business owners
will assume the expense of fighting such a subpoena, even
if it is unreasonable, since their own privacy is not
at stake.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Roberts provisions would surpass what is already one of
the most controversial parts of the original Patriot Act: a
section that allows the FBI to get warrants for customer
records from the secret court, which was created in 1978
by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
</P>
<P>
This provision has been attacked by a range of critics, including
librarians, who fear it will be used to obtain reading
lists of their patrons. The Bush administration has said it
has never used this power against libraries.
</P>
<P>
At a time when critics of the Patriot Act want to
curtail this power, the Intelligence Committee proposal would eliminate its
final check - lifting the requirement that the FBI get
permission from the secret court before seizing the records.
</P>
<P>
"The administrative subpoena proposal is alarming because [the Patriot Act version]
was already way broader than anything they needed," argued Stephen
Schulhofer, a New York University law professor and author of
a new book about the Patriot Act.
