In the shaky, uncertain weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, Congress
passed an anti-terrorism bill that gave the government broad powers
to peer into the lives of Americans. It's time -- past time -- to
rein in the excesses of the USA Patriot Act.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a federal judge in Manhattan struck down a provision in
the 342-page act that enables federal authorities -- without court
review -- to force Internet service providers to turn over personal
information about subscribers and their online activities.
</P>
<P>
The provision also bars the companies from disclosing that they've
been subpoenaed via a pre-Patriot Act instrument known as a "national
security letter."
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero ruled that the provision violates
the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and
the First Amendment protections against prior restraint on speech.
The challenge was raised by the American Civil Liberties Union on
behalf of an unnamed Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General John Ashcroft said the Justice Department would
appeal the ruling. "We believe the act to be completely consistent
with the United States Constitution," he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Judge Marrero drew a far different conclusion, saying the provision
and the latitude it gives the government to conduct unchecked
searches have "no place in an open society."
</P>
<P>
For the long-term health of our nation, it's essential to strike a
more sensitive balance between the pursuit of security and the
preservation of our basic freedoms.
</P>
<P>
As the judge points out, "Sometimes a right, once extinguished, may
be gone for good."
