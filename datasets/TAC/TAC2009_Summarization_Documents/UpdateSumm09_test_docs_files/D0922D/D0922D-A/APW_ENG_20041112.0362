Summary Box: Renewal of Patriot Act, FBI reform key issues in second term
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT: Top issues for the U.S. Justice Department in President George
W. Bush's second term include persuading Congress to renew key parts
of the anti-terrorism Patriot Act and continuing reform of FBI intelligence
gathering.

THE OTHER SIDE: Opponents call the Patriot Act's expanded surveillance powers too
intrusive and say it was rushed into law after the Sept.
11, 2001, attacks without thorough review in Congress.

OTHER ISSUES: A legal question to be resolved: Can suspected terrorists be
tried in civilian federal courts without jeopardizing national security or military
missions?
