Investigators conclude no violations in Ashcroft's Patriot Act tour
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Attorney General John Ashcroft did not violate anti-lobbying laws
when he gave a series of speeches last year promoting the anti-terror
Patriot Act, Justice Department internal investigators have
concluded.
</P>
<P>
The agency's inspector general, Glenn A. Fine, said the trips to 16
cities in August and September of 2003 did not run afoul of laws
barring executive branch officials from engaging in grass-roots
lobbying or prohibiting the spending of government money on
unauthorized "publicity or propaganda."
</P>
<P>
"Neither the Anti-Lobbying Act nor the appropriations provision
prohibited the attorney general and the U.S. attorneys from making
public speeches conveying DOJ's view regarding the merits of the
Patriot Act and discussing the DOJ's use of the law's provisions,"
Fine said.
</P>
<P>
The inspector general's conclusions were in a letter to Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan, senior Democrat on the House Judiciary
Committee. The letter, dated Friday, was obtained Monday by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Conyers, who could not be reached immediately for comment, had asked
Fine to investigate after a Government Accountability Office report
showed that Ashcroft's tour and a pro-Patriot Act Internet site had
cost more than $208,000 and also had involved activities by 80 of the
93 U.S. attorneys.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Fine said that the attorney general and U.S.
attorneys, as presidential appointees, are exempt from prohibitions
against executive branch lobbying of Congress. He also noted that a
review of Ashcroft's speeches found he never urged audience members
to contact members of Congress on behalf of the Patriot Act.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, given the DOJ's responsibility to enforce criminal
laws, we do not believe they could be considered `purely partisan,'"
Fine wrote.
</P>
<P>
The Patriot Act, passed by Congress a few weeks after the Sept. 11,
2001, terror attacks, gave federal law enforcement officials broader
powers of surveillance and prosecution against suspected terrorists,
their financiers and their sympathizers. Congress next year must
decide whether to renew major parts of the law.
