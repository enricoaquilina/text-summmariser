The White House's homeland security adviser asked attorneys Thursday to help
foster an honest debate over whether to reauthorize controversial anti-terror
laws.
</P>
<P>
Fran Townsend said White House support for extending the entire USA Patriot Act,
which expires at the end of the year, is "unequivocal." That law, which was
passed in the wake of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, gives the government broad
surveillance and law enforcement powers in terror cases.

<P>
"In the debate over the Patriot Act, we often hear about that delicate balance
that we rightly must make between freedom and security," Townsend told the
American Bar Association. "I value that debate. The president values that
debate. And it is important. What is equally important is that we not permit
this valuable tool to be caught up in unnecessary rhetoric."
</P>
<P>
"I encourage you to keep that debate honest," Townsend said. "...We really
should try to divorce this from partisan politics."
</P>
<P>
Civil liberties groups and privacy advocates have lambasted the Patriot Act
because they believe it undermines freedom.
</P>
<P>
Critics says among the law's more controversial powers is the FBI's ability to
obtain library and bookstore records in terrorism cases, and so-called "sneak
and peek" search warrants in which agents need not immediately tell suspects
their home or business had been searched.
</P>
<P>
Townsend said she said she recently asked an audience to indicate how many
people were concerned about the "library records provision" in the
act.
</P>
<P>
"Probably 70 percent of hands went up," Townsend said. "And people were really
stunned that there is nowhere in the Patriot Act the mention of library
records."
</P>
<P>
Section 215 of the Patriot Act does not specifically mention bookstores or
libraries, but permits secret warrants for "books, records, papers, documents
and other items" from businesses, hospitals or other organizations.
</P>
<P>
Congress has rejected attempts to bar the FBI from using Patriot Act authority
to obtain library and bookstore records.
