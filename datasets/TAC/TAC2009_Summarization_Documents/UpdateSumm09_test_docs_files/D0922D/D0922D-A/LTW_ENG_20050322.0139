Conservative libertarians launched a campaign Tuesday
to persuade President Bush and Congress to fix the sections of the
anti-terrorism Patriot Act that they say intrude on privacy and harm
civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
Long wary of the act's enhanced police powers, the conservatives
announced they had formed the organization Patriots for Checks and
Balances with the liberal American Civil Liberties Union in time for
hearings in the Republican-controlled Congress next month on whether
it should renew 16 Patriot Act provisions that expire at year's end.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Tuesday, ACLU Washington director Laura Murphy
underscored the importance of raising the profile in the debate of
such prominent conservatives as Grover Norquist of Taxpayers United,
David Keene of the American Conservative Union and Paul Weyrich of the
Free Congress Foundation.
</P>
<P>
``Given the number of folks in this room wearing elephant lapel
pins, I don't think the administration can easily discount our
message,'' said Murphy, referring to the symbol of the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
Bush and new Attorney General Alberto Gonzales have said in recent
speeches that one of their priorities this year is to win
congressional renewal of all expiring sections of the controversial
anti-terrorism law, enacted just weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Bob Barr, the group's chair and a former Republican representative
from Georgia who voted for the act in 2001, said the sunsetting of the
provisions and the hearings in the House and Senate provide a ``unique
opportunity'' to add checks and balances to the act.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to the president Tuesday, Barr and his group asked
Bush ``to reconsider your unqualified support'' for three specific
provisions, only one of which is set to expire without
reauthorization.
</P>
<P>
Those are the so-called ``sneak-and-peek'' Section 213, which
allows agents to enter a place without first notifying the owner;
Section 215, which permits agents to get business and library records
more easily; and Section 802, which broadly defines terrorists and
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Barr and his group said that they find hope in Gonzales' remarks
that he will be more open to discussion that his predecessor, John
Ashcroft, who not only staunchly defended the act but sought to expand
it.
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokeswoman Tasia Scolinos said her agency ``has
spearheaded the call for active discussion and meaningful dialogue on
the reauthorization of the Patriot Act.''
</P>
<P>
The ACLU has worked with conservative libertarians for the past
decade with to insist on the inclusion of judicial review and other
safeguards for privacy in anti-terrorism laws.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the ACLU paid Barr $150,000 to be a consultant and
lobbyist, Senate records show. Barr says he also consults for the
American Conservative Union.
