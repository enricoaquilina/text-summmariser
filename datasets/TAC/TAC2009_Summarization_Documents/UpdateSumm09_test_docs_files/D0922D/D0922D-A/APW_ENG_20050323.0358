<P>
Conservative and liberal groups normally at each other's throats over the
direction of government are finding common cause in wanting to gut major
provisions of the U.S. government's premier anti-terrorism law.
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union, the American Conservative Union, Americans
for Tax Reform and the Free Congress Foundation are among several groups that
formed a coalition _ Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances _ to lobby Congress
to repeal three key provisions of the USA Patriot Act.
</P>
<P>
Having people from all sides of the political spectrum working together will
keep politicians from calling Patriot Act opponents un-American or willing to
help terrorists, which happened during the original debate over the law, the
groups said at a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want this argument to be obscured by those who would suggest that
anyone who is for more and more government power is somehow on the side of the
right, and those who are against it or are skeptical of such grants are on the
side of the wrong," said David Keene of the American Conservative Union. "This
is an important question of all Americans on the left, the right or in the
middle."
</P>
<P>
For liberals, partnering with conservatives will ensure that the
Republican-dominated Congress and President George W. Bush's administration will
have to listen to their concerns, said Laura W. Murphy, outgoing director of the
ACLU's Washington legislative office.
</P>
<P>
The coalition wants Congress to repeal or let expire prosecutors' Patriot Act
ability to easily obtain records in terrorism-related cases from businesses and
other entities, including libraries; the provision that allows "sneak and peek"
searches conducted without a property owner's or resident's knowledge and with
warrants delivered afterward; and what they called an overbroad definition of
"terrorists" that could include non-terrorism suspects.
</P>
<P>
The coalition highlighted the provisions in a letter to the president which also
said, "We agree that much of the Patriot Act was necessary to provide law
enforcement with the resources they need to defeat terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokeswoman Tasia Scolinos said the law "contains strong
civil liberties safeguards and has a proven track record of being an effective
tool in the war on terror.
</P>
<P>
"Any suggestion of civil liberties violations is an effort to shift the focus of
the discussion away from the facts," Scolinos said. "There have been no verified
civil liberties violations filed against the Patriot Act. Period."
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers set a 2006 expiration date on many of the wiretapping and surveillance
measures, and will begin holding hearings starting in April on whether they
should be renewed.
</P>
<P>
President Bush and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales have called for renewal of
the Patriot Act, the government's post-Sept. 11, 2001, law that expanded its
surveillance and prosecutorial powers against suspected terrorists, their
associates and financiers.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials have said the Patriot Act has kept America safe, but
opponents have called the law intrusive and contend that it undermines civil
liberties and threatens to let the government snoop into the lives of innocent
Americans.
</P>
<P>
The coalition "is seeking modest changes to only a few extreme sections of the
law," said former Republican lawmaker Bob Barr of Georgia, the coalition's
chairman. "These changes will secure the important powers of the law while
placing reasonable limits on their use."
