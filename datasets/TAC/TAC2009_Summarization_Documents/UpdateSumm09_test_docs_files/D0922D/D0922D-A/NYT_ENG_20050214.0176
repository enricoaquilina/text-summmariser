BUSH RENEWS CALL TO EXTEND PATRIOT ACT
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<P>
President Bush on Monday urged the nation to stay
the course in its "urgent mission" to fight terrorism, and
he called on Congress to move quickly to extend sweeping
law enforcement powers under the USA Patriot Act.
</P>
<P>
"We must not allow the passage of time or the illusion
of safety to weaken our resolve in this new war,"
Bush said in a speech at the Justice Department. "To
protect the American people, Congress must promptly renew all provisions
of the Patriot Act this year."
</P>
<P>
The president's remarks came at the formal swearing-in of his friend
and longtime adviser, Alberto R. Gonzales, as the nation's 80th
attorney general. Gonzales won Senate confirmation 11 days ago by
a vote of 60 to 36 after a sharp debate
that focused on the administration's terrorism policies and their impact
on the treatment of prisoners
</P>
<P>
Bush built his re-election campaign last year around the assertion that
he was the candidate best able to defend the country
against another terrorist attack. In taking on the subject of
the Patriot Act once again, he showed no signs of
backing away from that approach.
</P>
<P>
A number of measures in the act that expand the government's
ability to conduct secret surveillance and use other law enforcement
powers will expire at the end of the year unless
Congress extends them. Many Democrats and some Republicans have voiced
skepticism or outright opposition to an extension, and some lawmakers
have offered competing proposals that would restrict the ability of
federal agents to demand records from libraries and use other
powers granted by the act.
</P>
<P>
Bush's renewed call for an extension met with skepticism from the
American Civil Liberties Union, which called on "cooler heads" in
Congress to scrutinize and fine-tune the law to meet civil
liberties concerns.
</P>
<P>
"The president and the attorney general must realize that security and
liberty are not -- and cannot -- be mutually exclusive,"
the group said in a statement
</P>
<P>
The White House, however, has signaled that it will veto any
effort by Congress to rein in counterterrorism powers.
</P>
<P>
Bush, speaking at the Justice Department's Great Hall before an audience
of visiting officials and Justice Department employees, said that Gonzales
was joining them in "an urgent mission -- to protect
the United States from another terrorist attack."
</P>
<P>
Gonzales echoed that theme, pledging that department employees would "work together
tirelessly to address terrorism and other threats to our nation,
and to confront injustice with integrity and devotion to our
highest ideals."
