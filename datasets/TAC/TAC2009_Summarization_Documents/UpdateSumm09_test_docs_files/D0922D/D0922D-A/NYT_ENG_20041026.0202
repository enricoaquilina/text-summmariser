BUSH AIDE CALLS CRITICISM OF PATRIOT ACT UNINFORMED

<P>
A senior Bush administration official defended the Patriot Act on
Tuesday as a "smart, ordinary and constitutional" tool in fighting
terrorism and rejected attacks on it as rash and misinformed.
</P>
<P>
The comments by James B. Comey Jr., the deputy attorney general,
coming in a speech before the American Bar Association on the third
anniversary of the passage of the Patriot Act, offered a preview of
what is likely to be a fierce fight in Congress next year over the
future of the law.
</P>
<P>
With key elements of the Patriot Act set to expire at the end of
2005, President Bush has urged Congress to renew the law as a
valuable weapon in tracking terrorists. But liberals and some
conservatives in Congress have repeatedly raised concerns about
whether the law has given the federal government too much power and
have urged a go-slow approach in considering whether it should be
renewed in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
In the face of frequent attacks on the law, Bush administration
officials have mounted an increasingly aggressive and public defense
of the legislation and railed against what they regard as distortions
about what it does. Comey's speech came on the same day that Attorney
General John Ashcroft, in an op-ed piece in The Wall Street Journal,
called the Patriot Act "an indispensable tool" in fighting terrorism
and said it "is often portrayed in an outright false light."
</P>
<P>
Critics challenged the Justice Department's aggressive defense of the
law. "It's ironic that the same Department of Justice that has misled
the public about the Patriot Act would complain that the public has
been misled," said Gregory Nojeim, associate director of the American
Civil Liberties Union's Washington legislative office.
</P>
<P>
Comey's own defense of the Patriot Act was significant both because
of his current position as the second-ranking official at the Justice
Department and because of his prospects for a promotion.
</P>
<P>
Many officials inside and out of the Justice Department say they do
not expect Ashcroft to return for a second term as attorney general
if Bush is re-elected, and Comey is thought to be on the short list
of possible successors.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the bar association, Comey defended two aspects of
the Patriot Act that he said have come under unfair attack: a
provision that allows authorities to conduct so-called "sneak and
peek" searches without immediately notifying the target; and a
separate section allowing them to demand business records on terror
and espionage suspects from bookstores, libraries and other
institutions.
</P>
<P>
But civil liberties advocates, who have pushed for the repeal of
secret intelligence warrants under the library records provision,
argue that federal authorities can already use standard criminal
warrants at libraries if they have evidence linking a suspect to
terrorism.
