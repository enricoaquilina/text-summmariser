LEFT AND RIGHT UNITE TO CHALLENGE PATRIOT ACT PROVISIONS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington -- An unusual left-right coalition opened a campaign Tuesday to
sharply curtail controversial provisions of the USA Patriot Act, showing
that Congress and President Bush face a pointed debate over
renewing the law enacted just 45 days after the Sept.
11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
It was a Washington rarity to see the American Civil Liberties
Union line up with conservative lions like David Keefe of
the American Conservative Union and former Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.
But they were among those at a Washington press conference
held to assail such Patriot Act provisions as those allowing
law enforcement agents to look at library users' records or
to conduct unannounced "sneak-and-peek" searches on homes or private offices.
</P>
<P>
"It is not, and never should be necessary, to surrender our
rights under the Bill of Rights to fight the war
on terrorism," said Barr, who as a House member voted
for the Patriot Act, which passed overwhelmingly in the House
and provoked only one dissenting Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
Barr, leader of the new group dubbed Patriots to Restore Checks
and Balances, concedes that the group faces a difficult fight
in making changes to the 4-year-old law. The law's supporters,
many of whom point out that the United States hasn't
been hit by another terrorist attack since Sept. 11, say
it has proven effective and that many of the complaints
offered by civil libertarians have nothing to do with the
act's provisions.
</P>
<P>
Key provisions of the bill are scheduled to expire Dec. 31,
so Congress must deal with the issue this year. The
Senate and House Judiciary Committees plan Patriot Act hearings starting
later in the spring.
</P>
<P>
Instead of seeking wholesale changes, the coalition is focusing on three
of the law's most-controversial provisions. And rather than push for
their repeal, the group wants the wording clarified to establish
that the intention is to fight terrorists -- not let
law enforcement agencies engage in fishing expeditions or silence dissent.
</P>
<P>
The group wants the section giving access to library, medical and
firearm-ownership records modified to require that law enforcement officials present
evidence to a federal judge supporting a link with suspected
terrorism before warrants are served.
</P>
<P>
The group wants similar limits on the provision allowing secret searches
of homes, businesses and personal property.
</P>
<P>
And group members want the language of the section that allows
surveillance of protests rewritten to require a definite connection with
suspected terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"These provisions sweep far too broadly. Whenever people ram through legislation
with broad and vague authority, it eventually will be abused,"
Barr said.
</P>
<P>
"If the Constitution stands for anything, it's that government does not
have the power to peer into our private lives without
evidence of wrongdoing," said Laura Murphy, of the ACLU's Washington
legislative office.
</P>
<P>
Grover Norquist, the conservative activist who heads Americans for Tax Reform,
noted the unlikely coalition of conservatives and the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
"For too long, conservatives assumed it was someone else's job" to
protect civil liberties, Norquist said.
</P>
<P>
So far, almost 400 local and state governments have passed resolutions
opposing the act, or some of its provisions, the ACLU
says.
</P>
<P>
President Bush campaigned last year in favor of renewing the Patriot
Act, and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has indicated he doesn't
favor any changes except, perhaps, to increase the government's powers
in a few instances.
</P>
<P>
"Debate about government exercise of powers that might infringe upon privacy
or civil liberties, I think that's an appropriate debate," he
told a recent meeting of the National Association of Counties.
"But it's got to be a real debate, one based
on facts. And I've yet to hear a strong argument
as to why the Patriot Act should not be reauthorized."
</P>
<P>
At a recent House hearing, FBI Director Robert Mueller praised the
Patriot Act and said he'd like to see it expanded
to include administrative subpoena power in terrorism cases, something the
FBI has in organized crime and health- care fraud investigations.
The subpoenas, which require recipients to disclose information, are signed
by an FBI agent without prior judicial or grand jury
review.
</P>
<P>
Mueller said the Patriot Act is a key part of the
FBI's new post-Sept. 11 approach.
</P>
<P>
"We have changed the way we address terrorism since Sept. 11
to ensure that we have exploited every possibility to gather
intelligence about the motivations, the capabilities of these individuals or
groups in our communities before we go ahead and make
the arrest," he told a House panel.
