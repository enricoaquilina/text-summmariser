<P>
President George W. Bush, giving Supreme Court nominee John G. Roberts a White
House sendoff Wednesday for the Senate confirmation process, voiced confidence
he will get "a timely hearing, a fair hearing" on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday morning, Bush's choice to succeed Sandra Day O'Connor on the
bench was all grins as he and the president emerged from a private breakfast to
stroll before the cameras down the colonnade to the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
Pausing for a moment, Bush said conversations with senators the evening before
had convinced him that "we're off to a very good start for his nomination" and
promised Roberts "all the support that's necessary for the senators to be able
to make up their minds."
</P>
<P>
Bush ignored questions about whether he would talk to Democratic senators who
worry that Roberts would push the nation's highest court too far to the right on
abortion and other polarizing issues.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed how important it is for Judge Roberts to get a fair hearing, a
timely hearing and a hearing that will bring great credit to our nation," Bush
said. "I wish him all the best."
</P>
<P>
Roberts headed to Capitol Hill for meetings with leaders in the Senate, which
will decide whether he will replace O'Connor and thus become the first new
Supreme Court member in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
Abortion, indeed, will be a "hot button" issue in the confirmation process,
former Sen. Fred Thompson, who will shepherd Roberts through the Senate
confirmation process, said Wednesday. Abortion has been legal since a 1973
Supreme Court decision, but remains a controversial topic in the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
But Thompson also said that lawmakers shouldn't read too much into Roberts'
seemingly conflicting legal positions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the positions he's taken are positions he took as an advocate ...
representing a client," Thompson said on NBC television. He noted that Roberts
had served as a deputy solicitor general _ a policy advocate _ in the first Bush
administration.
</P>
<P>
In a brief that Roberts filed with the Supreme Court at that time, he said that
the court decision that legalized abortion _ Roe v. Wade _ "was wrongly decided
and should be overruled." But he told senators during his 2003 confirmation
hearings for his current appellate court post that the decision was "the settled
law of the land." Appearing on CBS television, Thompson added that "one should
not confuse a position a good lawyer takes in representing a client with his own
personal views."
</P>
<P>
The nine Supreme Court justices serve in their posts for life or until they
decide to retire. Although they are nominated by the president, they must be
approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Bush introduced the 50-year-old Roberts to the nation Tuesday night, calling him
a man with "a good heart" and a jurist who will "strictly apply the Constitution
in laws _ not legislate from the bench."
</P>
<P>
Reaction from Republican senators was overwhelmingly supportive.
</P>
<P>
Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee called for confirmation proceedings that
"treat Judge Roberts with dignity and respect" and lead to a yes or no vote
before the court's term begins Oct 3.
</P>
<P>
Democrats reacted more cautiously, but there were no instant predictions of a
filibuster.
</P>
<P>
"The president has chosen someone with suitable legal credentials, but that is
not the end of our inquiry," Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid
said.
</P>
<P>
Roberts is a Washington insider who has worked over the years at the White
House, Justice Department and in private practice.
</P>
<P>
After graduating with honors from Harvard Law School, he clerked for William H.
Rehnquist when he was an associate justice on the Supreme Court. It was
Rehnquist who presided over the swearing-in ceremony when Roberts took his seat
on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
"Before I became a judge, my law practice consisted largely of arguing cases
before the court," said Roberts, who met with the president in the executive
residence for an hour last Friday. "I always got a lump in my throat whenever I
walked up those marble steps to argue a case before the court, and I don't think
it was just from the nerves."
</P>
<P>
He was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit in 1992 by the first President George Bush and again by the president in
2001. The nominations died in the Senate both times. He was renominated in
January 2003 and was confirmed by voice vote. At the time, his nomination to the
appellate court attracted support from both sides of the ideological
spectrum.
