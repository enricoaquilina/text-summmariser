Interest Groups Move Quickly After Announcement of Nominee

<P>
Just after learning that President Bush planned to
nominate federal appeals court Judge John G. Roberts Jr. for a seat on
the Supreme Court, NARAL Pro-Choice America sent an electronic action
alert to its 800,000-person network, encouraging members to call their
senators and talk to friends about their opposition.
</P>
<P>
The abortion rights group also sent out 30,000 e-mails to its
activists around the country Tuesday night, outlining talking points
explaining its opposition to Roberts, and furnishing sample letters to
be sent to local newspapers and background on the nominee. The group
planned to follow that up Wednesday with calls to its 27 national
affiliates, keeping them abreast of any new information that emerges
about Roberts' record.
</P>
<P>
Conservative interest groups, meanwhile, voiced strong support for
Roberts and began their campaign to support the nominee long before he
was announced. Hours before Bush's announcement, Progress for America
staff members were working in the 20th Street studios at Interface
Media, preparing a biographical ad supporting the nomination that will
be ready to air on cable television within 24 to 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
``We understand the crucial importance of defining the nominee
before the opposition has a chance to,'' said Jessica Boulanger, the
group's director of communications, who said the group is prepared to
spend $18 million or more. ``The amount we spend will be dictated by
how much the left puts into fighting the nominee.''
</P>
<P>
Groups on both sides have spent years preparing for this moment.
Their legal experts have been poring over the records of close to 20
potential nominees, and organizers have spent countless hours in
planning meetings and on conference calls to hone their message. Also,
they have amassed huge war chests to finance television, radio and
print ads to define the nominee in the public's mind.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, both sides have clashed over some of Bush's
choices for federal appeals courts, some of which were blocked by
Senate Democrats. But activists on both sides called those minor
skirmishes when compared with the battle they anticipate over the
first Supreme Court nomination in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
Raising the stakes is that with the retirement of Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor, who has been a crucial swing vote on the court, many
liberal activists fear -- and conservatives hope -- that Roberts's
confirmation would move the court decidedly to the right.
</P>
<P>
``We're saddened that President Bush has chosen the politics of
conflict and division over bipartisan consensus,'' said Wade
Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil
Rights.
</P>
<P>
Officials at People for the American Way held conference calls with
allies throughout the day, as speculation swirled about Bush's choice.
After Bush's announcement, the liberal activist group activated a plan
assembled years ago to mobilize opposition to the nominee.
</P>
<P>
The group zipped e-mails to 400,000 members asking them to contact
their senators, to scrutinize the nominee and, at minimum, not to take
a position until after hearings are held.
</P>
<P>
The Federalist Society, in turn, put together a list of
conservative legal experts to advise the media on Roberts and the
issues he will face.
</P>
<P>
``The experts are former Supreme Court clerks or otherwise have
special expertise. ... We believe the experts can help contribute to
and enlighten the public discussion,'' the organization's Web site
said. The public relations firm Creative Response Concepts, which is
working with a number of conservative organizations active in the
Supreme Court fight, is handling contacts between the experts and
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Jan LaRue, chief counsel to Concerned Women for America, said the
conservative group is prepared to gear up a grass-roots campaign in
support of Roberts if Democrats threaten to filibuster. ``Everything I
know tells me he meets the president's criteria very well; he clearly
is in the mold of (Antonin) Scalia and (Clarence) Thomas'' -- both
conservative justices.
