WASHINGTON, July 19
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US President George W. Bush on 
Tuesday nominated a 50-year-old conservative judge to the US Supreme 
Court, a move that could shape the outcome of battles over volatile 
issues like abortion for decades.
</P>
<P>
"The decisions of the Supreme Court affect the life of every 
American," the president said in a televised address from the White 
House, with federal appeals court Judge John Roberts at his side.
</P>
<P>
"A nominee to that court must be a person of superb credentials 
and the highest integrity, a person who will faithfully apply the 
Constitution and keep our founding promise of equal justice under 
law. I have found such a person in Judge John Roberts," said Bush.
</P>
<P>
With the choice, Bush shrugged off pressure to pick a woman to 
replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a moderate conservative who was 
the first woman to serve on the court and often cast the deciding 
vote in controversial decisions.
</P>
<P>
The president urged the divided US Senate, where his Republican 
party has 55 of 100 seats, to confirm Roberts by the first week of 
October, when the high court opens a new session.
</P>
<P>
"This confirmation can be done in a timely manner," said Bush. 
"So I have full confidence that the Senate will rise to the occasion 
and act promptly on this nomination."
</P>
<P>
The nomination was Bush's first chance to reshape the 
ideological balance of the court, which has immense influence over 
the lives of Americans as the final arbiter of the US Constitution 
and court of last resort.
</P>
<P>
Because justices serve for life or until they retire, as 
O'Connor announced she was doing July 1, they regularly decide 
critical and controversial political and legal issues long after the 
president who picked them is gone.
</P>
<P>
In one of those cases, O'Connor sided with her conservative 
colleagues in a majority decision to stop vote recounts in Florida 
in the 2000 election, effectively handing the White House to Bush 
over Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
The top Democrat in the Senate, Harry Reid, neither endorsed nor 
rejected Roberts, but set the stage for tough questioning by saying 
that the nominee had "suitable legal credentials" but required more 
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
"The Senate must review Judge Roberts's record to determine if 
he has a demonstrated commitment to the core American values of 
freedom, equality and fairness," Reid said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Roberts' last notable decision came only last week when his 
appeals court overturned a lower court decision that the special 
military tribunals for suspected terrorists at the Guantanamo 
detention camp in Cuba were illegal.
</P>
<P>
The decision was a victory for the Bush administration in its 
handling of the "war on terrorism" detainees. But a new appeal is 
now expected to go to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Roberts graduated from Harvard Law School in 1979, was a clerk 
to arch-conservative US Supreme Court Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist, served in president Ronald Reagan's White House, and was 
a senior federal prosecutor under Bush's father, former president 
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor was appointed by president Ronald Reagan and took her 
seat in September 1981.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's retirement opened the first vacancy on the Supreme 
Court in 11 years. The last justice appointed was the liberal 
Justice Stephen Breyer, who was named by president Bill Clinton and 
took his seat in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
It left Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the sole woman on the 
nine justice Supreme Court bench.
</P>
<P>
Cancer-stricken Chief Justice William Rehnquist had also been 
seen likely to retire, but he dismissed such talk last week as 
"speculation and unfounded rumors" and pledged to carry out his 
duties "as long as my health permits."
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as Bush's top political strategist, Karl 
Rove, was under close scrutiny over his possible role in a leak that 
may have unmasked a CIA agent in July 2003.
