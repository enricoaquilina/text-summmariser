EDITORIAL: SCRUTINIZING JOHN ROBERTS JR
</HEADLINE>

The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, July
20:
</P>
<P>
The American people know little about Judge John Roberts Jr., other
than that President Bush is nominating him to fill Sandra
Day O'Connor's seat on the Supreme Court. But in the
coming weeks that should change. The Senate has a duty
to scrutinize his background and question him closely at his
confirmation hearings about substantive areas of the law. If he
is a mainstream conservative, in the tradition of Justice O'Connor,
he should be confirmed. But if on closer inspection he
turns out to be an extreme ideologue with an agenda
of stripping away important rights, he should not be.
</P>
<P>
Roberts is a member of the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, and before that he was a lawyer
in the administrations of President Ronald Reagan and the first
President George Bush. Compared with many of the possible nominees
whose names have been circulating, he has a thin record
on controversial subjects. This may have helped him win the
nomination because it gives the other side so little to
work with. But it also puts a greater burden on
the Senate to determine what kind of a judge he
would be.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important areas for the Senate to explore
is Roberts' views on federalism -- the issue of how
much power the federal government should have. The far right
is on a drive to resurrect ancient, and discredited, states'
rights theories. If extremists take control of the Supreme Court,
we will end up with an America in which the
federal government is powerless to protect against air pollution, unsafe
working conditions and child labor. There are reasons to be
concerned about Roberts on this score. He dissented in an
Endangered Species Act case in a way that suggested he
might hold an array of environmental laws, and other important
federal protections, to be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
There are also serious questions about Roberts' attitude toward abortion rights.
As a lawyer in the first President Bush's administration, he
helped write a brief that argued that Roe v. Wade
should be overturned.
</P>
<P>
Bush did the country a service by making his nomination early
enough for the Senate to have ample time to investigate
the judge's record and hold hearings. The leaders in both
parties should resist any pressures to move quickly. It would
be irresponsible to take a position on the nomination of
Roberts until his background is carefully reviewed, and until senators
have a chance to question him at length. The nomination
of a new Supreme Court justice is a great moment
for the nation, providing new vigor to a great American
institution. The entire country has a stake in the outcome.
