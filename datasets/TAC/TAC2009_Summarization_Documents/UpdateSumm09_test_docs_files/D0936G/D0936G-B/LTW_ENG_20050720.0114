Justice Sandra Day O'Connor offered a quick and pithy
reaction to President Bush's nomination of federal appellate judge
John Roberts Jr. as her successor on the Supreme Court. ``That's
fabulous,'' she told the Spokane (Wash.) Spokesman-Review after a day
of fly fishing. ``He's good in every way, except he's not a woman.''
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's reaction reflects the view of just one person, but as
someone who gained a reputation for having an intuitive sense of
public attitudes and mores during her two decades on the court, she
spotlighted the obvious trade-off involved in Bush's decision and may
have given voice to the conflicted feelings of many Americans -- women
and minorities in particular -- to the Roberts selection.
</P>
<P>
Given the opportunity to maintain some modicum of gender balance on
the court, or even make history by appointing the first Latino
justice, as many Hispanics had openly advocated, the president
selected a white male to fill the O'Connor vacancy. In doing so, he
was following the precedent of most other presidents: in the history
of the Supreme Court, only four of more than 130 nominees -- Justices
O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas and former Justice
Thurgood Marshall -- were not white men.
</P>
<P>
Whether that presents a serious problem for a president who has
made the expansion of the Republican Party's coalition central to his
political and governing strategy was a matter of debate Wednesday. But
there was widespread agreement that the selection of Roberts will put
more pressure on Bush to name a woman or minority to the court should
another vacancy occur during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
``I think it raises the stakes significantly for the next one,
whoever that might be,'' Democratic strategist Anita Dunn said. ``I
think right now there's disappointment. If there were another vacancy
(filled by a white male), there would be anger.''
</P>
<P>
Hispanic leaders were most vocal. ``We're disappointed, to say the
least,'' Hector Flores, national president of the League of United
Latin American Citizens, said while attending the National Council of
La Raza convention in Philadelphia. Flores had lobbied hard on behalf
of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Mirabal, president of the National Puerto Rican Coalition,
attending the same convention, agreed, saying there might be political
consequences for Republicans who hoped to cut deeper into the
Democrats' 60 percent share of the Hispanic vote in the last
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Others questioned how much longer-term fallout Bush faces, and even
some Democrats pointed to the fact that he has put together diverse
Cabinets in both terms and has put women in positions of power in the
White House and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
But the failure to fill the O'Connor seat with a woman or minority
wasn't lost on Bush's allies Wednesday as they sought to rally behind
Roberts while addressing the deficiency on the diversity front.
</P>
<P>
``Some people have asked me, well, didn't you want a woman? Well,
yes, of course I did,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. ``Of
course I think diversity is important on the Supreme Court. I would
like to see another woman. I would like to see a Hispanic American on
the Supreme Court. But I believe first and foremost what we want is
the very best person. And, for this time, the president has chosen
John Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ken Salazar, D-Colo., released a letter addressed to the
president lamenting what he said was a missed opportunity to assure
the inclusion of women at all levels of government. ``You and I both
have two daughters,'' Salazar wrote. ``The profound message we should
be giving to them is that their gender creates no limitations for them
to live up to their God-given potential. Yet, I fear that with the
loss of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor from the United States Supreme
Court, we are sending the opposite message.''
</P>
<P>
Hispanic leaders might have been more vocal in their disappointment
were it not for the fact that many worried that Bush would appoint a
conservative Latino whose views conflict with their own agendas. ``My
greatest fear was that President Bush would choose someone who will
not be sensitive to our demands,'' and that fear has not abated, said
Cesar Perales, president of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and
Education Fund.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales was viewed by Hispanics as a Republican centrist, the best
they could hope for among the available candidates, according to
Rudolph de la Garza, a Columbia University political science professor
who specializes in Latino politics, and other experts said. But
supporting him outright would have been awkward, since human rights
groups with whom they are allied opposed Gonzales for his role in
helping to provide legal authority that led to the torture of
prisoners in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Democratic strategist Jim Jordan said that by failing to appoint a
woman or Latino, Bush had ``highlighted a negative stereotype of the
party -- a party that truly only welcomes conservative white males.
That's an unflattering view of the party and one frankly we thought
they were trying to ameliorate.''
</P>
<P>
But Republican National Committee spokesman Brian Jones said the
committee's vigorous outreach to minorities would continue. ``I don't
think this is something that's going to derail the efforts underway at
this point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Republicans said Wednesday they are confident the O'Connor vacancy
will not be the last Bush will be asked to fill, given the health of
Chief Justice William Rehnquist. But the Spokane paper reported that
O'Connor said she doubted the president would name a woman as chief
justice. ``So that almost assures,'' she said, ``there won't be a
woman appointed to the court at this time.''
