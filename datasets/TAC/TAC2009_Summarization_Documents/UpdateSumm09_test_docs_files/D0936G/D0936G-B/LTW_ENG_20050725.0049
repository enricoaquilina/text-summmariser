No More Cheating for a Good Cause

Sandra Day O'Connor's retirement from the Supreme Court should make
us ponder affirmative action. Her most influential piece of writing
might well be the 2003 court opinion allowing the University of
Michigan Law School to continue race-based admissions for the time
being -- so long as there were no racial quotas. It was the first time
the court had ever endorsed race-based university admissions.
</P>
<P>
And of course, O'Connor herself was the first woman on the Supreme
Court. When President Reagan nominated her in 1981, affirmative action
was fairly new; O'Connor made it look good. She was superbly
qualified, yet presumably would have been overlooked had Reagan not
searched expressly for a female.
</P>
<P>
But that was long ago. Today, affirmative action is ripe for the
junkyard. There's dramatic evidence in President Bush nominating a
garden-variety white male to O'Connor's seat. He said something
important by doing so. Consider the fact that for much of the 20th
century, the ``Jewish seat'' was a Supreme Court convention. To have
one Jew on the court (no more, no less) seemed proper and fitting. But
in time Jews went mainstream and the single ``Jewish seat'' quietly
disappeared. (There are now two Jewish justices).
</P>
<P>
Bush has delivered a comparable message to women and minorities:
Welcome to the mainstream! We don't need a ``woman's seat'' on the
court. There are no more outsiders in American life.
</P>
<P>
Now let's get rid of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
In practice, affirmative action means cheating in a good cause.
(But all cheating, for any cause, gnaws at a nation's moral innards
like termites.) Affirmative action means a plus factor in university
admissions, job hiring and promotion for candidates from protected
groups, in the interests of ``diversity.'' (But why should
``diversity'' mean official ``minorities'' and women but not
libertarians, farmers, Mormons, Texans, children of soldiers, aspiring
Catholic priests, etc.?)
</P>
<P>
Affirmative action is highly unpopular: A 2003 Washington
Post-Harvard-Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 92 percent of
the public (86 percent of blacks) agreed that admissions, hiring and
promotion decisions ``should be based strictly on merit and
qualifications other than race/ethnicity.'' Only bureaucrats and
intellectuals (species that are more closely related than they seem)
love affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
Is it really ``cheating''? In 2003, Linda Chavez, the head of the
Center for Equal Opportunity, described University of Michigan
freshman admissions as they stood in the mid-1990s: ``We found that
the odds ratio favoring admission of a black applicant with identical
grades and test scores to a white applicant was 174 to 1.'' The
Supreme Court struck down that admissions procedure, but it's a
frightening reminder of what people can do in the name of fairness.
</P>
<P>
Affirmative actions begs comparison with the Vietnam War: two
hugely ambitious programs with no exit strategies. In 1965, the
Johnson administration launched affirmative action. The Nixon
administration relaunched it in 1970, requiring all federal
contractors to set ``goals and timetables'' to govern black hiring. It
spread quickly (as a legal requirement or voluntary policy) to unions,
government agencies, big business, universities.
</P>
<P>
It was intended originally not to create diversity but to stamp out
prejudice in a hurry. As such, it bears another strange resemblance to
Vietnam. You could argue in both cases that we won but refused to
admit it. Some modern historians insist that we defeated the
Vietnamese communists, then walked off and let them win by default.
And we have stamped out so much prejudice that nowadays we are at
least as strongly bigoted in favor of women and minorities as we are
bigoted against them -- as any 10-year-old can tell you.
</P>
<P>
Textbooks widely used in public schools consistently downplay white
men in favor of women and minorities. (Thomas Edison gets less space
than a black scientist who tweaked one of Edison's inventions. A
Navajo physicist gets a detailed write-up, but Albert Einstein doesn't
appear. A biologist of the Seneca tribe is credited with nothing
noteworthy, but he gets a picture while James Watson and Francis
Crick, co-founders of modern genetics, don't rate a mention. At
virtually any U.S. university, female or minority faculty candidates
are in vastly greater demand than white males.
</P>
<P>
Affirmative action has turned the United States into an
aristocracy. British aristocrats have enjoyed their own kind of
``reverse discrimination'' for a thousand years. America's
affirmative-action aristocrats were only created a generation ago;
until then, they were targets of bigotry themselves. So what? No
aristocracy is acceptable in the United States.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor wrote in the University of Michigan ruling that
affirmative action must end some day. George W. might be just the man
to end it.
