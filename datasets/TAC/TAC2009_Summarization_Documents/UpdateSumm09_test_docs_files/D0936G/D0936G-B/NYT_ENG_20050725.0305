SOME DOCUMENTS OF COURT CHOICE TO BE RELEASED (This article is
part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed version of
a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.)
BRODER WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration plans to release documents
from Judge John G. Roberts' tenure in the White House
counsel's office in the mid-1980s and his earlier job working
for the attorney general, but will not make public papers
covering the four years he spent as principal deputy solicitor
general starting in 1989, two senior administration officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision fulfilled a request for disclosure of the documents made
on Monday by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., the chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, which will hold the confirmation hearings for
Roberts, President Bush's choice to fill the Supreme Court seat
being vacated by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, said the senator's
spokesman, Bill Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
But it falls short of the disclosure sought by Democrats, who
have been demanding access to files from the nominee's work
in the solicitor general's office at the Justice Department from
1989 to 1993, under the first President George Bush. Democrats
say those files could shed light on the nominee's thinking
about a variety of issues that could come before the
court, and are especially important because Roberts has not produced
much of a paper trail when it comes to issues
like abortion. Specter did not seek access to the papers
from Roberts' work as deputy solicitor general, Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the administration had decided to waive any claim
to attorney-client privilege from those documents because the papers are
covered by the Presidential Records Act, the law that governs
the disposition of presidential papers.
</P>
<P>
One of the officials, both of whom sought anonymity to speak
candidly about a decision that had not yet been made
public, said the White House had reviewed some of the
papers from Roberts' work in the counsel's office and saw
nothing in them that could create problems for his confirmation.
</P>
<P>
But the officials said the administration felt it would be wrong
to release the papers from Judge Roberts' work as the
No. 2 person in the solicitor general's office under Kenneth
W. Starr. Those papers, which are not covered by the
Presidential Records Act, record "sensitive, deliberative, confidential" conversations among administration
lawyers in developing legal cases for argument before the Supreme
Court and therefore should not be released publicly, one of
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., the ranking Democrat on
the Judiciary Committee, said lawyer-client privilege did not apply either
to Roberts' work at the Justice Department or to his
work at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Specter and Leahy met Monday to discuss the timing of the
confirmation hearings, but still have no agreement, although they appear
to be close to reaching agreement.
