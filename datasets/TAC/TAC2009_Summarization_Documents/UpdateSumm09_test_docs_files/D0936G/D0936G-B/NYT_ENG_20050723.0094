EXPECTED BATTLE OVER COURT SEAT HAS YET TO FORM

Ed Gillespie, the White House commando in charge of
the selling of Judge John G. Roberts for a seat
on the highest court in the land, was settled into
his temporary West Wing office on Friday with a ready
army and almost no enemy to fight.
</P>
<P>
Some war room: the telephones were silent, Fox News was unwatched
in a corner, no aides bustled in and out. With
Congress gone for another sultry weekend, it was just Gillespie
and his sidekick, Steve Schmidt, a top adviser to Vice
President Dick Cheney who is moonlighting as the communications director
in the Roberts sales campaign.
</P>
<P>
What do the two do all day?
</P>
<P>
"There are meetings punctuated by brief periods of nonmeetings," said Gillespie,
who has temporarily vacated his office in his lucrative downtown
lobbying firm, Quinn Gillespie &amp; Associates. Gillespie, the former Republican
National Committee chairman who attacked Sen. John Kerry as a
waffler in the 2004 presidential campaign, appeared in relative repose
in a wing chair. Schmidt parked himself on Gillespie's empty
desk.
</P>
<P>
The much-anticipated mother of all Supreme Court battles had yet to
be joined. Roberts had not sparked the kind of partisan
uproar that others might have, which would have turned the
capital upside down for the rest of the summer. But
it has not yet been a week since President Bush's
nomination of Roberts, and whether the relative calm of the
moment is a function of the judge's personality or because
the hearings are such a long way off is not
clear.
</P>
<P>
Still, both sides are poised for a fight, with millions of
dollars ready to be spent. Groups on the left have
been sending millions of e-mails messages questioning Roberts' position on
abortion, and Democrats were already preparing their topics for his
expected grilling before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September.
</P>
<P>
"He's seen as a nice, open Midwestern fellow," said Sen. Charles
E. Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the committee. "But if
he refuses to answer any questions or give any further
information about himself, that view could change."
</P>
<P>
In other words, three days after Bush nominated Roberts to replace
the retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, it was still a
long way to the opening of the court on Oct.
3, which is when Bush has said he wants to
have his nominee in place. Gillespie, the White House's favorite
pit bull in the 2004 campaign, and Schmidt, a former
Bush campaign spokesman, knew the relative calm was unlikely to
last.
</P>
<P>
But he said: "Despite the predictions and the anticipation that things
are different now, that it's not going to be like
Breyer and Kennedy and Ginsburg and Souter, the fact is,
it's a lot like Breyer and Kennedy and Ginsburg and
Souter. The fundamentals have not changed."
</P>
<P>
Gillespie was referring to the relatively calm confirmation hearings of Justices
Stephen G. Breyer, Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
David H. Souter.
