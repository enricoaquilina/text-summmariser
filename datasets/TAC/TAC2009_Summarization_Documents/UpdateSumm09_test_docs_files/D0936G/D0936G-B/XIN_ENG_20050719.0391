WASHINGTON, July 19 (Xinhua)

<TEXT>
<P>
Ending speculations and 
debates, US President George W. Bush finally announced Tuesday his
choice for the vacancy in the Supreme Court left by retiring 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
In a live broadcast TV statement Tuesday night, Bush announced 
that John G. Roberts Jr., an appeals court judge and a 
conservative, is his first nominee for the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Praising Roberts "has a good heart", Bush said the 50-year-old 
native of Buffalo, New York State, has been devoting himself to 
the "cause of justice" throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
Roberts, who stood aside when the president was making the 
announcement, said later that he will fulfill his duty and serve 
the nation and justice.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Bush's choice for the Supreme Court seat will 
enhance the government's influence in the nine-seat highest court 
where a balance had been kept between four conservatives and four 
liberals while the outgoing O'Connor stood in the middle.
</P>
<P>
In his early years, Roberts had served as a clerk for Chief 
Justice William Rehnquist before he worked in Republican 
administrations.
</P>
<P>
He joined the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia in May 2003 and has proved his conservative stance when 
he and two other appeals court judges ruled that war crime trials 
in the prison at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, could 
proceed.
</P>
<P>
The US Supreme Court consists of nine judges, including a Chief
Justice and eight Justices. The highest judicial body holds the 
ultimate judicial power and can veto any legislation passed by the
Congress or any state.
</P>
<P>
Members of the court can keep their posts for life if they are 
willing to do so under the condition of no malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, the only female member of the court, announced on 
July 1 that she decided to retire, leaving weeks of speculations 
and debates on who will be Bush's nominee for the court.
