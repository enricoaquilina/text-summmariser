NOMINATION FOLLOWS BUSH'S CONSERVATIVE INSTINCTS

WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his four-and-a-half-year presidency, George Bush has rarely gone
against his conservative instincts and the fundamental interests of his
political base. Tuesday night he stayed true to form, nominating
a conservative favorite, appellate court Judge John Roberts, to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Filling the first court vacancy in 11 years -- the crucial
swing vote held by a retiring Sandra Day O'Connor --
Bush was handed a grand opportunity to make a lasting
mark on the closely divided court. He responded by picking
a judge who has been espousing conservative judicial dogma for
more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
Although he has been a judge for only two years, Roberts,
50, has an extensive written record on behalf of Republican
administrations, notably on the volatile issue of abortion. "We continue
to believe that Roe was wrongly decided and should be
overruled," Roberts wrote in a 1991 Supreme Court brief as
deputy solicitor general.
</P>
<P>
Despite what will be an intense fight, though, there were early
hints that Roberts was headed for likely confirmation. Notably, Bush
passed over several candidates who would have made conservative groups
even happier. And Democrats Tuesday night were reacting with marked
caution, not fiery condemnation. Roberts will be no red-meat target
for opponents.
</P>
<P>
The president made his pick with gusto, making a rare prime-time
announcement in a bid to galvanize a nationwide television audience.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Democrats and Republicans alike will see the strong
qualifications of this fine judge, as they did when they
confirmed him by unanimous consent to the judicial seat he
now holds," Bush said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
In the process, Bush touched off what is likely to be
a spirited and expensive fight in the U.S. Senate over
Roberts' confirmation. Tens of millions of dollars have been squirreled
away in anticipation of a classic Supreme Court battle, and
Roberts' appointment makes it likely that much of it will
be spent.
</P>
<P>
In the weeks leading up to Tuesday's pick, a few prognosticators
thought Bush might try to head off this battle and
offer a consensus appointment that would be in the O'Connor
mold. But Tuesday night he made it clear that his
pick would be a change agent.
</P>
<P>
"He will strictly apply the Constitution and laws -- not legislate
from the bench," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
As presidents have learned time and again, it's never safe to
assume the judicial leanings of a Supreme Court justice newly
armed with a lifetime appointment. But odds are strong that
Roberts would align himself with Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and
Chief Justice William Rehnquist to form a rock-solid conservative core
that would need only a single extra vote to make
new law -- a far different alignment from the one
that's existed for the last decade.
</P>
<P>
As a clerk for Rehnquist, then as a lawyer in the
administrations of Ronald Reagan and Bush's father, Roberts repeatedly proved
his conservative mettle, persuading legions of Republican heavyweights of his
judicial orientation. He also won political points during Bush's contested
2000 victory over Democrat Al Gore, working behind the scenes
on Bush's successful case before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
But given his short stint as appellate judge in the District
of Columbia circuit, White House officials contend Roberts will be
a tough target for opponents to shoot at, with a
thin paper trail of rulings. Beyond that, Roberts will be
buoyed by his reputation as a legal dynamo who has
argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court and whose intellectual
weight makes him a high court natural.
</P>
<P>
Crucial to whether Roberts' nomination results into a historic free-for-all is
the reaction of 14 moderate senators who stepped in earlier
this year to defuse a bitter Senate fight over Bush
appeals court nominees. If some of the seven Democrats in
that group signal that Roberts is acceptable, the Senate battle
could cool.
</P>
<P>
In an early indication, one of the Democrats, Sen. Joe Lieberman
of Connecticut, told reporters last week that Roberts would be
"in the ballpark," making a Senate filibuster against him unlikely.
</P>
<P>
But holding off the well-funded machines that have been established to
support, and oppose, any Bush nomination will be a tall
order -- particularly on the issue of abortion.
</P>
<P>
As deputy solicitor general in 1991, Roberts was co-author of an
administration brief that said clinics receiving federal money should be
prevented from discussing abortion with their patients. As part of
that brief, which was ultimately endorsed by the court, Roberts
wrote that the Supreme Court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion "finds
no support in the text, structure, or history of the
Constitution."
</P>
<P>
Supporters will argue that Roberts' brief represented the position of his
client, the first Bush administration, and not his own view.
Nevertheless, the abortion issue will hang heavily over his confirmation
proceedings. So will the reality that his appointment could dramatically
alter the court's course on issues ranging from religious expression
to affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
Bush got plenty of advice over how he could make his
mark in his first Supreme Court nomination. His wife urged
him to appoint a woman. Minority groups suggested he appoint
the court's first Latino.
</P>
<P>
But the president had his own agenda. Notwithstanding the Iraq war,
his first-term tax cuts and his Social Security plan, changing
the fundamental balance of power on the Supreme Court could
be the president's biggest legacy. And early indications are that
Roberts, a young man who could serve on the court
for decades, will put him on course toward that goal.
