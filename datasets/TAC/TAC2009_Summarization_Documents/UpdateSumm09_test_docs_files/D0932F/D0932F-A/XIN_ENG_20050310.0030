<P>
Tanzania is on the way to 
handle the increasing plastic waste through establishing a 
recycling plant believed to be the first one in east and central 
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Industry and Trade Juma Ngasongwa was quoted by 
local newspaper Daily News on Thursday as saying that the 
Tanzanian government has set aside 1.5 million US dollars to 
operate the recycling plant as the first phase of the country's 
multi-million-dollar anti-plastic litter project.
</P>
<P>
The plant is expected to start operating in May this year, with
the capacity of recycling every day about 10 tons of plastic bags,
bottles and other industrial waste from collection centers.
</P>
<P>
Plastic litter has become an environmental hazard in the east 
African country where the public have not been made aware of 
disposal methods. The abandoned plastic bags and containers can be
spotted in many towns, blamed for clogging sewage and drainage 
systems. It is also reported that cows died after eating this 
material.
