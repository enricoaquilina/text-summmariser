S.F. PROPOSES 17-CENT SURCHARGE ON GROCERY BAGS

<P>
In San Francisco, the free grocery bag soon might go the way of the
full-service gas station.
</P>
<P>
City officials are considering charging grocery stores 17 cents
apiece for the bags, 90 percent of which are plastic -- and are
blamed by environmentalists for everything from clogging recycling
machines to killing marine life and suffocating infants.
</P>
<P>
Although the environmentalists are not as concerned about the effect
of recyclable paper bags on the environment, the proposal would
include them, too, with the idea of reducing waste in general.
</P>
<P>
In turn, the fee would be passed on to the consumer. Proponents of
the surcharge hope this will persuade shoppers to give up the
convenience of the disposable sack.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it's going to be a pain the ass, but that's part of the point,"
said Mark Murray, executive director of Californians Against Waste.
"One thing we've learned is that sending a financial signal to the
marketplace tends to modify behavior much better than voluntary
approaches."
</P>
<P>
Trade groups representing grocers and the plastics industry
predictably aren't crazy about the idea.
</P>
<P>
"We think essentially it's an unnecessary and misguided approach,"
said Tim Shestek, spokesman for the American Plastics Council. "This
tax is going to hurt those who can least afford it."
</P>
<P>
The proposal, set to be considered by the Commission on the
Environment on Tuesday, imitates efforts around the world to stem the
use of plastic bags -- known in China as "white pollution." Ireland,
South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai and Taiwan are just a
few of the places where the government either bans plastic bags
outright or charges a fee to use them.
</P>
<P>
Trade groups contend that the results of those efforts are mixed. In
Ireland, for example, there is anecdotal evidence of increased
shoplifting as people bring in their own bags and higher sales of
boxes of plastic bags, which consumers use for everything from pet
waste to trash cans.
</P>
<P>
Murray said the local effort is the first in California after an
Assembly bill to levy a statewide 2-cents charge on nonrecyclable
disposable bags failed last year.
</P>
<P>
"We've attempted to pursue this at a state level, but the lobbyists
for the retail industry are too strong," he said.
</P>
<P>
After being considered by the commission, the proposal would move to
the mayor's office or the Board of Supervisors in search of
legislative sponsors. A spokesman for Mayor Gavin Newsom said the
mayor is reviewing it. Meanwhile, the proposal has at least one
potential champion on the Board of Supervisors, the newly elected
Ross Mirkarimi, who helped found the city's Department of the
Environment, which is overseen by the Commission on the Environment.
</P>
<P>
"We all have a responsibility to promote a healthy and sustainable
environment, and by doing that, it means we need to help change
people's patterns, and that even means their shopping patterns," said
Mirkarimi, who will take office in January. "This is a sensible user
fee."
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which takes the form of a resolution urging the mayor
and board to take action, also suggests expanding the surcharge in
the future beyond grocers to include drug stores, dry cleaners,
newspapers and other retailers.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of the Environment, consumers lug home
about 50 million bags from San Francisco grocery stores each year. Of
those, 90 percent are nonrecyclable plastic.
</P>
<P>
A report prepared in support of the proposal by Robert Haley,
recycling program manager for the environment department, says
plastic bags gum up recycling and composting machines at Norcal --
San Francisco's waste management provider -- resulting in $1 million
in extra costs and lost revenue from the sale of recyclable
materials.
</P>
<P>
The bags account for 2 percent of the city's total "waste stream,"
and picking up and disposing littered bags cost an additional $7.4
million annually, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It notes that an estimated 12 million barrels of oil go into the
production of plastic bags, while 14 million trees are felled to make
their paper counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Paul Smith, vice president of the California Grocers Association,
said the proposal is strongly opposed by the industry group.
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure where it came from or ... where the 17 cents is going
to go. There's not really a lot of accountability," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, grocers would be able to keep half of the
fee and would be expected to spend it on city-approved programs, such
as discounted reusable shopping bags.
</P>
<P>
Shestek, the American Plastics Council spokesman, said some of the
costs attributed to plastic bags could be recouped by sending plastic
bag waste to companies that can use it as a raw material, such as
decking and composite lumber producers.
</P>
<P>
Heidi Melander, president of the Northern California Recycling
Association, a supporter of the proposal, said the fee was a tangible
way the public can participate in helping reduce waste.
</P>
<P>
"We've been trained to want bags," she said. "It's gotten out of hand
-- everywhere you go, they force them on you, and they think you're
weird if you don't take a bag. We might not have control over the
blister packaging around the electronic equipment we buy. But we have
control over taking that bag."
