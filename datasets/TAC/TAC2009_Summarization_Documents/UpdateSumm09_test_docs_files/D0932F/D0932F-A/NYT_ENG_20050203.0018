FREE GROCERY BAGS MAY GET THE SACK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES - Paper or plastic? It might not matter soon.
</P>
<P>
Supermarket shoppers could end up paying for selecting either bag if
Los Angeles politicians follow a San Francisco proposal -- and
the advice of some environmentalists -- to recoup the cost
of cleaning up grocery-sack litter.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco officials are considering a fee of 17 cents per
bag in a bid to encourage Bay Area shoppers to
bring their own sacks.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city leaders also want to get rid of grocery-bag
blight. Hoping to avoid drastic measures, Councilman Ed Reyes wants
manufacturers of plastics and officials in grocery chains to partner
with him on bag cleanups and recycling programs.
</P>
<P>
"San Francisco has the wherewithal to charge that much. San Francisco
has a different income group," Reyes said. "Here in Los
Angeles, I would rather work with the industry before we
get into that."
</P>
<P>
Reyes' proposal to create a task force on plastic bags will
likely go to the full City Council next week after
being approved Wednesday by the council's Environmental Quality and Waste
Management Committee. Reyes hopes the task force will hold its
first meeting in March and produce recommendations 60 days later.
</P>
<P>
So far, plastics-industry representatives have said they will participate in Reyes'
task force -- particularly in light of the proposed fee
in San Francisco, which they oppose.
</P>
<P>
"The bag manufacturers in the last few years have gotten together
and realize there is an issue," said Donna Dempsey, executive
director of the Film and Bag Federation. "We're willing to
work toward that goal."
</P>
<P>
All sides agree that plastic bags are a blight on the
Los Angeles River, where hundreds of white sacks float on
the shallow water, stick to rocks and dangle like Spanish
moss from tree branches.
</P>
<P>
City officials were spurred to action by a new mandate to
cut trash from the river and from Ballona Creek by
10 percent each year, starting this year, at an estimated
cost of $120 million.
</P>
<P>
Plastics make up more than half of all the trash in
the river, and plastic bags alone constitute slightly more than
one-third of the litter.
</P>
<P>
Unlike paper or wood or other organic garbage, plastics don't biodegrade.
They cause environmental damage by breaking into smaller pieces that
are eaten by fish and wildlife. Plastic bags also clog
the screens installed on storm drains that filter trash from
runoff.
</P>
<P>
"Plastic is the single most important component of the litter. It's
also the most environmentally damaging," said Kosta Kaporis, an engineer
with the Bureau of Sanitation. "It's aesthetically the worst."
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles River ad hoc committee staffer Lupe Vela is in
charge of task force preparation and hopes to bring industry
representatives to the table first to see if they can
develop voluntary programs.
</P>
<P>
Right now only about 5 percent of the plastic used in
grocery bags is recycled. Some grocery stores have bins in
which to deposit used bags, and some offer a discount
-- 5 cents or less -- for shoppers who bring
their own bags.
</P>
<P>
And bags can't be mixed with curbside recyclables. They stick to
bottles and cans, and they clog sorting equipment. Yet there
is a demand for the raw material by companies that
use old sacks to make more bags or plastic building
materials.
</P>
<P>
The task force will likely talk about ways to collect and
recycle bags. Members are virtually certain to consider public-education campaigns
to get people to stop littering, to bring their own
reusable bags when they shop, and to participate in neighborhood
cleanup programs.
</P>
<P>
But some question whether voluntary, public-private programs will deliver the kind
of dramatic cut in plastic litter that is needed for
the city of Los Angeles to meet trash regulations.
</P>
<P>
"I'm skeptical that the plastics industry is going to be capable
of coming up with a solution that involves fewer numbers
of plastic bags being sold," said Mark Murray, executive director
of Californians Against Waste, which has pushed San Francisco and
Los Angeles authorities to consider fee-per-bag systems.
</P>
<P>
He points to the success in Ireland, where use of plastic
bags dropped by 90 percent a year after the nation
imposed a fee of 15 cents per bag.
</P>
<P>
Though Reyes champions the partnership with industry and the community now,
he said he is open to tougher means to get
bags out of the Los Angeles River.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we'll come up with a fine or a tax for
the plastic bags, and give the bag some value, so
people will think twice before throwing it on the streets."
