<P>
The Ugandan government is considering a total ban on polythene bags
after a 50 percent excise duty has failed to reduce their production
and usage, reported local press on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Trade Richard Nduhura was quoted as saying that
the rampant use of polythene bags has led to environmental disasters
like blockage of drainages, suffocation of children and animals and
soil degradation.

<P>
"An excise duty of 50 percent was imposed on plastics in June 2002.
It has not deterred indiscriminate use of the plastics, prompting us
to take drastic measures," Nduhura said at a meeting on plastics
waste management and development of environmentally- degradable
plastics in Kampala which was attended by delegates from eight
African countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government was still looking at optional measures
like controlling importation, production, usage and disposal of
polythene bags.
