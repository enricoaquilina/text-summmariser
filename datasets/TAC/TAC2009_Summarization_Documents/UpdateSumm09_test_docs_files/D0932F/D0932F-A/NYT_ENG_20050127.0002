NET WORTH-COLUMN BAG FEES GENERATE STRONG OPINIONS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've gotten more than 70 e-mails responding to my Tuesday column
about the San Francisco Commission on the Environment's resolution urging
the Board of Supervisors to force supermarkets in the city
to charge shoppers 17 cents apiece for bags.
</P>
<P>
Roughly one-third of these readers love the idea, saying it will
cut down on waste and trash. Some say the proposal
doesn't go far enough, that fees should apply to other
stores and bags.
</P>
<P>
Roughly one-third hate the idea, saying it's a government plot to
raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
The remaining third might warm to the idea, but have some
questions and reservations.
</P>
<P>
Today, I'll share some of these comments, but after this, please,
no more feedback on bag fees.
</P>
<P>
-- The European scene: More than a dozen e-mails came from
people who live or have lived in Germany, Switzerland, Ireland,
Norway or South Africa, where charging for shopping bags is
common. Virtually all of them said it's a minor expense
or inconvenience, but well worth it.
</P>
<P>
"My native Germany charges a fee for these bags, and people
respond in the best way for the environment -- they
bring their own tote bags! When I came to the
U.S. seven years ago, I was astonished (and disgusted) by
the practice of using new bags on each trip. And
while I have to admit that I easily fell into
this behavior myself, the proposed legislation reminded me that bringing
my own tote bag is an easy way to be
a good citizen of our one and only planet Earth,"
says Franziska Marks.
</P>
<P>
"I am an Irish citizen living in S.F. I remember the
same excuses being trotted out when this was first introduced
in Ireland (in 2002). The key difference is that the
retailers embraced this change as a way to tout their
'green' credentials by offering a free, sturdy shopping tote to
each club member for a limited time to carry their
groceries (enabling free advertising). It really has dramatically reduced the
level of plastic bag waste all over the country," writes
Ray Walsh.
</P>
<P>
-- Pooper scoopers: Many readers told me they put their old
bags to good use. One even sent me a photo
of her kitchen recycling center, rigged to hold plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody I know uses plastic grocery bags for garbage bags. They
use them to go to the dog park, empty the
kitty litter, and a dozen other things. If you don't
get plastic bags with your groceries, then you would have
to buy plastic bags. So it sort of defeats the
purpose," writes Jim Knowles of Alameda.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the estimated 85,000 dogs in San Francisco, has anyone factored
the additional citywide expense in cleaning up poo that people
will refuse to pick up in a 17-cent bag three
times a day?" asks Melinda Graves.
</P>
<P>
"For about eight years, I have reused bags many times because
I want to do my part for our environment. In
fact, for one month, I kept count of how many
times I reused a single bag. Seventeen times in one
month meant that 17 bags were not sent to the
dump!" writes Charlotte Pederson.
</P>
<P>
I feel a book coming on: "101 Uses for Old Bags."
</P>
<P>
-- Fuzzy math? My column explained that the San Francisco Department
of the Environment came up with the 17 cents by
dividing the environmental cost of used grocery bags ($8.5 million
annually) by the estimated number of plastic and paper bags
distributed in San Francisco supermarkets each year (50 million).
</P>
<P>
The $8.5 million is the departments' estimate of what it costs
the city to sweep up and dispose of bags, plus
what it costs Norcal Waste Systems to remove plastic bags
from its recycling and composting system.
</P>
<P>
Some readers point out that city residents already pay for these
costs through taxes and garbage-collection fees.
</P>
<P>
"Shouldn't the amount that is presently being paid for garbage service
be taken into consideration when determining how much it really
costs the city? Or are residents supposed to pay twice
for the same service?" asks David Schnapf.
</P>
<P>
Engineer Neil Lillemark says the city's calculation ignores two facts: Some
of the 50 million bags distributed each year get reused
and don't go immediately into the waste stream, and a
fee would cut bag consumption (and thus the city's costs).
</P>
<P>
Using certain assumptions, he suggests that "10 cents a bag would
be a more fair estimate of the charge which should
be applied if they were to go this route."
</P>
<P>
Some readers suggested it would be more economically efficient to ban
free bags, but to allow grocers to sell them for
those who forget or choose not to use their own.
That would eliminate the cost of creating a system to
collect, track and distribute the fees.
</P>
<P>
Mark Westlund, spokesman for the environment department, said the 17-cent fee
is not set in stone, and if a bag fee
went into effect, a reduction in taxes and/or garbage fees
"certainly could be on the table." He adds that the
department "would be open to any ideas that would address
the issue."
</P>
<P>
-- Bad bagger behavior: Several readers said grocers could reduce waste
if they simply instructed their baggers to use fewer sacks.
</P>
<P>
"Baggers can be careless, often double bagging for no reason, or
putting one or two items in a bag that could
have fit into another bag. It's probably faster to use
a lot of bags instead of trying to figure out
how to make the best use of each bag, but
it's so wasteful," says Sarah Stockton of Daly City.
</P>
<P>
Paul Smith, a vice president of the California Grocers Association, explains:
"We try to minimize breakage to product." If a bag
breaks when a customer is moving it from store to
car or car to kitchen, most stores that are members
of his association will replace the contents for free.
</P>
<P>
"There are marketing reasons why we do this," he says. However,
"There are retailers who are right now evaluating their clerk
and bagger training to (encourage) reduction of bags."
</P>
<P>
-- Good question: Ford Kanzler of El Granada writes: "I've often
wondered why food markets don't sell reusable cloth bags at
the check stand (along with) all the impulse-purchase junk."
</P>
<P>
-- Who knows where that bag has been? Mike McHugh fears
reusing bags may be unhealthful.
</P>
<P>
"A new bag is clean! Customers can return home with their
items confident that their purchases have been protected from dirt
and germs. An old reused bag cannot guarantee such a
situation. It may be dirty, even if you can't see
the dirt with your eyes. It might have held raw
meat that may have bled ever so little onto the
sides of the bag. The bag might even have previously
been used to carry poisonous substances!" he writes.
</P>
<P>
Point of interest: When Ireland imposed a 15-cent charge on all
plastic shopping bags in 2002, it exempted a number of
bags, including those that hold raw meat.
</P>
<P>
-- Why just supermarkets? Some readers wonder why the proposal applies
only to grocers.
</P>
<P>
"Saving the environment can be done in many ways," writes Catherine
Ying. "Instead of making our life more complicated by charging
for shopping bags, why don't we start with something that
is more of a luxury, such as Diaper Genie," which
wraps dirty disposable diapers in plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
"What about stores like Walgreens that try to put every little
item in a bag -- even if the customer is
a woman with a large handbag," writes Beth Wells of
San Francisco. And how about restaurants that put food "in
those toxic Styrofoam boxes and then put the box in
a bag."
</P>
<P>
"What bugs me is that my Chronicle is delivered every day
in a plastic bag. They are limited in their re-use
-- I don't have a dog and don't travel that
often, as they make excellent wrappers for shoes or slippers,"
writes Doug Stewart.
</P>
<P>
Chris Blaser, The Chronicle's circulation vice president responds: "Our policy is
to only deliver newspapers in plastic bags on rainy/heavy fog
days. Our other general rule is to bag when the
forecast is mixed.
</P>
<P>
"We do, however, have some carriers who bag more frequently (of
their own initiative) in an effort to assure that the
paper is in good condition. We do notify any of
these carriers to stop bagging (except on rainy days) whenever
we receive a call from a customer. We also make
sure the plastic bags we buy come primarily from recycled
materials."
</P>
<P>
Westlund says the city might consider extending bag fees "to other
areas like fast foods, drug stores, etc. Right now (it's)
strictly supermarkets."
