<P>
India's western state of Maharashtra 
banned the sale and use of plastic bags Wednesday, saying they were 
the main cause of blocked drains during week-long floods which 
killed 1,099 people.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and urban planners have blamed the flooding 
caused by unprecedented monsoon rains in the state's capital Mumbai 
in July on poor drainage.
</P>
<P>
"These (plastic bags) tend to choke drainage and sewage systems. 
The cabinet has now decided to ban the sale and usage of plastic 
bags in the state," the state's Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh 
said at the state assembly.
</P>
<P>
"In the recent floods, the collected water could not flow out 
properly due to poor drainage systems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mumbai, a city of 15 million people and the financial and 
entertainment capital of the country, has a century-old drainage 
system built by India's former British colonial rulers.
</P>
<P>
The poor drainage system clogged with plastic bags and garbage 
combined with unchecked development along natural inland waterways, 
Deshmukh said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation will not improve until we stop using plastic 
bags," he said.
</P>
<P>
People had to wade through stagnant water during the floods 
which led to the outbreak of water-borne diseases across Mumbai and 
neighbouring areas, killing more than 315 people after the water 
receded.
</P>
<P>
However, companies can continue to make plastic bags in the 
state as long as they are sold elsewhere, Deshmukh said.
</P>
<P>
"The manufacture of plastic will be allowed (in Maharashtra) and 
these may be sold only outside the state," Deshmukh said.
</P>
<P>
A period of 30 days would be provided to hear public opinion and 
suggestions, he added.
</P>
<P>
The plastics manufacturing industry said it would oppose the 
government's move.
</P>
<P>
"Plastics usage is not the culprit. The civic administration 
failed to ensure proper roads and effective drainage systems. If 
plastics usage was the issue, why was south Mumbai not flooded," 
said Harpal Singh, president of the Plastics manufacturing industry 
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,800 small units manufacturing plastic bags across 
the country, Singh said.
