<P>
A ban against bistros providing plastic
bags free of charge will be lifted at the beginning of March, the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The EPA has recently amended its policy of restricting the use of
plastic bags and disposable dining utensils after evidence showed the
policy has failed to cut short plastic consumption since its
implementation July 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
According to official tallies, plastic bags used by bistros has
skyrocketed, surging from 5,793 tons per year before the
implementation of plastic restrictions to the current level of over
10,000 tons, EPA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under the original policy, six different types of businesses and
shops -- department stores and shopping centers, wholesale stores,
supermarkets, chain convenience stores, chain fast food stores, and
bistros and restaurants -- were banned from offering customers
plastic bags thinner than 0.06 mm and from offering free plastic bags
with a thickness of over 0.06mm.
</P>
<P>
Consumers were required to pay for plastic bags over 0.06mm
thick, and the use of "thick" plastic bags led to the growth of
plastic consumption due to Taiwanese people's special dining customs,
EPA officials said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, it is common for people to contain and carry food
in plastic bags, which are mostly unrecyclable after carrying greasy
food.
</P>
<P>
The amended policy therefore resumed the use of thin plastic bags
at bistros and restaurants as part of efforts to curb plastic
consumption. Other business stores are not subject to the ban's
suspension.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, encouraged by the fact that the amount of disposable
plastic tableware used actually shrank 85 percent since the EPA began
putting into place plastic restrictions over three years ago, the
administration is scheduled to impose a ban on governmental agencies
and schools from using disposable tableware at dining places on July
1. It is estimated that the new ban will contribute to a reduced
consumption of some 2,600 tons of plastic per year.
</P>
<P>
The EPA proposed the amended policy Monday, which also rules a
ban against the use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in the production of
all kinds of packing bags and cling films.
</P>
<P>
PVC is described by Greenpeace International as a "toxic plastic"
because it produces toxic substances at every stage of its
manufacture, consumption and dumping. Taiwan's PVC demand has
amounted to around 700,000 tons annually. From September, the ban on
PVC use will be put into effect, according to the amended policy.
