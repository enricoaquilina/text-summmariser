<P>
Japan announced a draft plan Monday to 
stop retailers from giving out plastic bags for free amid efforts to 
improve the environment in the nation where the landmark Kyoto 
Protocol was sealed.
</P>
<P>
The proposal by the environment ministry would cut back on 
Japan's widespread use of plastic bags either through legislation or 
agreements with industry to end free distribution.
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes as scheduled, the bill to ban free 
distribution of plastic bags will be sent to the parliament in 2006 
at the earliest," an environment ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry plans to present its 
own report on the bag issue on Thursday after which the two 
ministries will finalize details.
</P>
<P>
Plastic bags are regularly distributed without asking by 
Japanese merchants. According to a survey by the Kyoto government, 
10 percent of the plastic garbage in the western city comes from 
bags given by retailers.
</P>
<P>
"There are no similar nationwide statistics, but we expect 
charging for plastic bags will reduce a significant amount of 
garbage from households," the environment ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government faces an uphill battle to meet its 
target under the Kyoto Protocol of reducing its greenhouse gas 
emissions six percent by 2008-2012 from the 1990 level. It hopes to 
achieve the goal partly by reducing the amount of household 
rubbish.
