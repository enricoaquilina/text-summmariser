Another supermarket chain, 
China Resources Vanguard, announced here Thursday to reduce 
distribution of plastic shopping bags.
</P>
<P>
This is the third voluntary agreement signed after similar 
agreements with Wellcome and PARKnSHOP in February and March.
</P>
<P>
China Resources Vanguard pledged to reduce plastic bag 
distribution at its retail outlets by at least 15 percent in one 
year.

<P>
Hong Kong Permanent Secretary for Environment, Transport &amp; 
Works Keith Kwok said the government is pleased to see the three 
major supermarket chains are committed to reducing plastic bags by
about 90 million in a year.
</P>
<P>
"We are also encouraging other supermarkets and major retail 
chains to join the voluntary scheme," Kwok said.
</P>
<P>
The active involvement of supermarket chains will help change 
consumer behavior over time, he said, adding a large number of 
plastic shopping bags are disposed of at landfills each day. The 
implementation of voluntary agreements will reduce this kind of 
waste at the source.
</P>
<P>
In the longer term, the government plans to prohibit free 
distribution of plastic bags and impose a levy to deter their use 
through legislation. It will consult the trade and the public 
before taking it forward, Kwok said.
