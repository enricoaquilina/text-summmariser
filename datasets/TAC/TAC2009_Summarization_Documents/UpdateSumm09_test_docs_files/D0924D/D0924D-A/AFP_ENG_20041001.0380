The European Medicines Agency is to review all drugs in the same
class as Vioxx after US pharmaceutical giant Merck withdrew the
arthritis drug, a spokesman for the agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Merck announced a global withdrawal Thursday of Vioxx, a blockbuster
arthritis drug, after a study showed it increased the risk of strokes
and heart attacks.

<P>
"We are going to see whether there is a class effect," a spokesman
for the London-based agency said.
</P>
<P>
The US Food and Drug Administration also has said it would study the
effects of other drugs in the same class as the withdrawn drug.
</P>
<P>
Vioxx, which is scientifically known as rofecoxib, has been marketed
in more than 80 countries and produced sales of 2.5 billion dollars
in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The European Medicines Agency carried out a review of the drug class
which includes Vioxx -- known as COX-2 inhibitors -- at the request
of French authorities, but concluded in November 2003 that the
products did not need to be withdrawn from the market.
