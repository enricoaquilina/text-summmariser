LAWYERS ORGANIZING TO PUT VIOXX IN CROSSHAIRS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of plaintiffs' lawyers who claim that people were injured or
killed by the painkiller Vioxx plan to meet next week to lay
groundwork for a nationwide legal assault against the drug's maker,
Merck.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers expect the discussions to begin informally on Tuesday in
Pasadena, Calif., in the hallways of a conference on Vioxx litigation
that will also be open to defense lawyers. On Thursday, at a meeting
in Las Vegas for the plaintiffs' lawyers only, those who are suing
Merck, or plan to, expect to discuss specific strategies.
</P>
<P>
"We can't compete with big pharmaceutical companies by ourselves, but
when we get together, we can become formidable," said Daniel E.
Becnel Jr., a lawyer in Reserve, La., who has led such organizational
efforts in other drug cases and in tobacco litigation. "This is a
case that needs to be managed by the premier lawyers in the country."
</P>
<P>
J. Michael Papantonio, a lawyer in Pensacola, Fla., who organized the
Las Vegas meeting, said about 500 plaintiffs' lawyers were expected
to attend.
</P>
<P>
Even before Merck pulled Vioxx from the market on Sept. 30, citing
what it said was new evidence that the drug increased the risk of
heart attacks, strokes and other serious ailments, hundreds of
patients had filed lawsuits around the country. Since then, countless
other lawsuits have been brought -- no one yet has an accurate figure
-- and more are expected.
</P>
<P>
Merck, which has said it pulled the drug as soon as it had conclusive
evidence of unacceptable risk, declined to discuss its defense
strategy.
</P>
<P>
This week, the incentives to sue have multiplied. The Food and Drug
Administration published a report on its Web site on Tuesday by a
staff researcher, concluding that more than 27,000 deaths could be
attributed to Vioxx based on comparisons with how patients taking
other painkillers had fared.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Lancet, a respected British medical journal,
published an analysis of all the clinical trials of Vioxx completed
by 2001, and concluded that Merck and the FDA should have known
enough about the drug's hazards to withdraw it years ago.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs' lawyers plan to compare notes next week on the types
of clients who may make the strongest cases, with a premium on people
who were in demonstrably good health before taking Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
The group also intends to discuss ways to cooperate in gathering
evidence and expert testimony, and in devising tactics to influence
where the bulk of the cases may end up, as state and federal judges
consolidate them. Until such matters are resolved, how soon any of
the cases may come to trial is uncertain, including one that had been
expected to begin as early as next month in federal court in
Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
Many lawyers will also be jockeying for roles that will maximize
their influence, and ultimately their reimbursement, as the
litigation unfolds.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 million Americans have used Vioxx since it went on the
market in 1999. Millions more used the drug overseas. Based on the
number of Vioxx customers and the seriousness of the injuries, the
Vioxx lawsuits would appear to have the potential to dwarf recent
cases like the one against Baycol, a cholesterol-lowering drug used
by about 700,000 Americans, and the one against the diet supplement
fen-phen, which an estimated 6 million people took.
</P>
<P>
Baycol's maker, the Bayer Group of Germany, said in late September
that it had paid $1.09 billion to settle 2,861 lawsuits and that
7,577 suits were pending. And Wyeth, the marketer of fen-phen, faces
continuing legal battles with plaintiffs who opted out of a
settlement program that pays victims from a $3.75 billion trust fund.
Wyeth has set aside $16.6 billion to cover its liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Many plaintiffs' lawyers say it is too early to make a realistic
assessment of Merck's financial vulnerability. Merck, the nation's
second-largest drugmaker, has long been among the nation's strongest
companies financially, with a credit rating among the highest in
American business.
</P>
<P>
In their meetings next week, the lawyers are likely to weigh the
potential impact of this week's national elections, which
strengthened the Republican-led effort to curb product liability
lawsuits. A related concern for the plaintiffs' lawyers is the FDA's
continuing efforts under the Bush administration to persuade judges
that FDA approval of a drug, along with warnings on the label, should
go a long way toward shielding the maker from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
So far, most state judges have rejected the FDA immunity argument.
But if courts began to accept it -- or Congress made it the law of
the land -- plaintiffs' lawyers would have the higher hurdle of
arguing that Merck deceived the FDA by hiding or distorting damaging
data. That case would be hard to make without supportive testimony
from the agency, some lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
The personal injury lawsuits -- or tort cases, as lawyers call them
-- can be filed in state or federal courts and in many cases name
other parties, like doctors or drug distributor, as co-defendants
with Merck.
</P>
<P>
In the hundreds of Vioxx lawsuits filed before Merck took the drug
off the market, the action was primarily in New Jersey, where Merck
is based, and the big states of Texas and California. But the
financial burden of taking on a giant like Merck while it continued
to insist that Vioxx was safe and effective scared away many lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a quiet little mass tort for a long time," said Carlene
Rhodes Lewis, a Houston lawyer whose firm was among the pioneers when
it began filing Vioxx complaints in 2001. Lewis and her partners took
on nearly 300 such cases by the time Merck pulled the plug on Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
Merck's withdrawal of Vioxx has made it much easier for lawyers to
argue to a jury that the product should not have been on the market.
But proving liability could still be difficult.
</P>
<P>
The data from clinical studies suggest, so far, that the most serious
health problems hit patients who had used Vioxx for 18 months or
longer. Merck has said it does not know yet how large that group is.
</P>
<P>
In addition, many possible Vioxx victims may find it difficult to pin
their health problems on the drug if forced to go to trial, lawyers
who filed the early cases said. The injuries linked to Vioxx are also
common among people who have not used the drug, and they have many
causes.
</P>
<P>
"The person who should never have taken Vioxx and should have been
warned by Merck, the person with multiple risks of cardiac problems,
may not make the best client, because it may be harder to prove that
Vioxx caused the heart attack," said Cynthia Anne Solomon, a lawyer
in Mt. Pleasant, S.C.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the pioneering plaintiffs' lawyers in the Vioxx
litigation have been carefully screening potential clients in search
of those who were relatively healthy before they took the drug and
suffered injuries. Some of those lawyers said they were worried that
lawyers who rushed into the field after Merck withdrew the drug,
including law firms soliciting clients with radio and print
advertising, will muddy the legal landscape with questionable claims.
</P>
<P>
"For every hundred calls we get, there are only two or three top-end
cases," Papantonio said.
</P>
<P>
He and others said that Merck, if it follows the course of other drug
companies in similar situations, is likely to try to settle the
strongest cases against it and fight some of the weaker claims in
trials. If it wins those trials, it could knock down the settlement
value of the vast majority of claims against it and cut billions of
dollars from its potential exposure.
</P>
<P>
Merck recently asked the panel of judges that supervises the way mass
torts are handled in federal courts to assign all of the lawsuits to
one judge. Becnel filed a similar petition.
</P>
<P>
The panel is expected to hear arguments on the petitions and where
the cases should be consolidated at its January meeting.
</P>
<P>
Many lawyers involved in the lawsuits say the federal consolidation
process should hasten final settlement of most of the Vioxx cases.
The state cases in New Jersey and California have already gone
through such a process.
</P>
<P>
But the effort to centralize the federal cases while sorting out
which cases will remain in state courts -- where plaintiffs' lawyers
usually prefer them -- could very likely lead to procedure battles
that may delay the first Vioxx trials. Several were on course to
begin in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
"It's up in air now," said Andy D. Birchfield Jr., a lawyer in
Montgomery, Ala., who had expected to begin trying a Vioxx case in
federal court in Birmingham as soon as next month.
