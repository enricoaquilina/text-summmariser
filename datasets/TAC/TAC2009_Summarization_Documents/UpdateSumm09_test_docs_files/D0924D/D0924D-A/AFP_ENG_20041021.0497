US drugs giant Merck said Thursday 
quarterly net profit tumbled as it took a 552.6-million-dollar blow 
from the withdrawal of blockbuster arthritis drug Vioxx.

A rash of lawsuits also now plagues the firm because of the 
global Vioxx withdrawal on September 30, prompted by a study showing 
it increased the risk for strokes and heart attacks.

Merck said it was unsure if its insurance would provide enough 
money to cover potential lawsuit losses.

Sales fell 3.9 percent from a year earlier to 5.54 billion 
dollars in the three months to September 30.

Net profit slumped 28.7 to 1.33 billion dollars.

Earnings per share slid to 60 cents from 82.

In the last quarter of 2004, Merck said it expected earnings per 
share to slip to 48 to 53 cents, including the impact of about 700 
million to 750 million dollars in lost Vioxx sales.

"The voluntary withdrawal of Vioxx, with sales of 2.5 billion 
dollars last year, represents a significant financial loss for us 
but clearly was the right course of action," Merck chairman, 
president and chief executive Raymond Gilmartin said.

"Merck is redeploying research and development and marketing and 
sales personnel formerly dedicated to Vioxx to areas where 
additional growth opportunities exist, including other research 
programs, support of in-line products and upcoming product 
launches," he said in a statement.

About 20 million people have taken Vioxx in the United States 
since its 1999 launch, the company said. The number of users outside 
the United States was "undetermined."

Merck said it had insurance for up to 630 million dollars 
related to a mass of personal injury lawsuits filed over Vioxx, 
though some of the insurers disputed the coverage, along with 
insurance for shareholder lawsuits.

"The company is unable at this time to determine whether the 
companys insurance coverage with respect to the Vioxx personal 
injury lawsuits and the Vioxx shareholder lawsuits will be adequate 
to cover its defense costs and losses, if any," the firm said.

As of October 15, Merck said the company had been named as a 
defendant in about 300 federal and state personal injury lawsuits 
including 900 plaintiff groups alleging personal injuries from its 
use. There were also several putative class actions.

In addition to the personal injury suits, a number of purported 
class action suits had been filed by shareholders and by former 
employees with company retirement plans, alleging Merck and some 
current or former officials had made false and misleading statements 
about Vioxx.
