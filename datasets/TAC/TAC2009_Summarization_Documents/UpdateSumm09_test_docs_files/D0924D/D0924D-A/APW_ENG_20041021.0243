Merck profit falls 29 percent on costs of Vioxx recall

<P>
Net income plunged 29 percent for pharmaceutical giant Merck &amp;
Co. in the third quarter due to costs for withdrawing its arthritis
drug Vioxx from the market, and the company on Thursday said hundreds
of lawsuits have been filed related to the drug.
</P>
<P>
Merck, one of the world's top five drug makers, said Thursday it
earned $1.33 billion (euro1.06 billion), or 60 cents (48 euro cents)
per share. That was down from $1.86 billion, or 82 cents per share,
in the July-September period of 2003.

It said unsold Vioxx inventory, estimated customer returns and costs
to pull the blockbuster drug from the market worldwide totaled $552.6
million (euro438.4 million) in the third quarter. That's despite the
fact that the company did not announce until the final day of the
third quarter that it was withdrawing Vioxx, a popular treatment for
arthritis and acute pain, because a study found it increased risk of
heart attack and stroke.
</P>
<P>
Revenues for the third quarter totaled $5.54 billion (euro4.39
billion), down 4 percent from $5.76 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Because of lost revenues for Vioxx, which had about $2.5 billion in
2003 sales, or 11 percent of total company revenues, Merck said
Thursday that fourth-quarter earnings per share will only be 48 cents
(38 euro cents) to 53 cents (42 euro cents), with full-year earnings
per share at $2.59 to $2.64 (euro2.05 to euro2.09). Last month, Merck
had said the Vioxx recall would slash 50 cents to 60 cents off its
earnings per share for the year; on Thursday, it said the impact
would be 50 cents to 55 cents.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of the year, net income declined to $4.71
billion (euro3.74 billion), or $2.11 (euro1.67) per share, from $5.44
billion, or $2.41 per share. Revenues inched up to $17.19 billion
(euro13.64 billion) from $16.86 billion in the January-September
period of 2003.
