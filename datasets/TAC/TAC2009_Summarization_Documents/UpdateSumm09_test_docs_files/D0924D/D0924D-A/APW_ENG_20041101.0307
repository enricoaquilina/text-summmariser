Merck shares plunge after reported it had Vioxx risks

Shares of Merck &amp; Co. plunged more than 10 percent Monday after a
media report said that documents show the pharmaceutical giant hid or
denied evidence for years that its blockbuster arthritis drug Vioxx
cause heart problems.
</P>
<P>
Merck, one of the world's top five drug makers, pulled the arthritis
and acute pain drug from the market worldwide on Sept. 30, saying it
was acting in patients' best interest. Vioxx has been taken by about
20 million Americans and had produced 11 percent of Merck's total
revenues.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Prudential Equity Group analyst Tim Anderson
downgraded the stock's rating to neutral from overweight. Anderson
wrote that he believes there is value in the company's drug pipeline
but said it is likely to get lost in the negative Vioxx coverage.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Standard &amp; Poor's placed Merck on CreditWatch with
negative implications, which sends a strong signal that the company's
debt could be downgraded within the next three months. When Merck
withdrew Vioxx, S&amp;P lowered its outlook to negative from stable.
The additional, more serious step taken Monday reflects the momentum
in the Vioxx litigation and the delay in launching Arcoxia, Vioxx's
successor drugs, said S&amp;P analyst Arthur Wong.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against Merck over Vioxx and one
analyst believes it could cost the company up to $12 billion. Last
Friday, the FDA said it wouldn't approve Arcoxia without additional
safety and efficacy information. Wong said it look like the drug will
be delayed more than a year.
</P>
<P>
Merck shares were down $3.19, or 10.2 percent, at $28.12 on the New
York Stock Exchange after The Wall Street Journal reported that
internal e-mails and marketing materials show the company knew as far
back as 2000 that Vioxx was linked to an increased risk of heart
attack but tried to discredit such evidence.
</P>
<P>
Despite a March 9, 2000 e-mail from Merck research director Edward
Scolnick to colleagues conceding an elevated risk of heart attack and
stroke was "clearly there," according to the newspaper, Merck
continued to try to discredit academic researchers critical of the
drug.
</P>
<P>
The Journal reported that one training document from Merck listed
potentially difficult questions about the drug and stated in capital
letters, "DODGE!"
</P>
<P>
Merck declined comment on the article. Last Friday, Merck
acknowledged some sealed trial documents had been made public, noting
that in other similar court cases documents had been leaked to
advance the plaintiffs' lawyers interests. It said that it "acted
responsibly and appropriately as it developed and marketed Vioxx."
</P>
<P>
Merck shares had been trading in the $45 range until the withdrawal
announcement, plunged to the mid $30s that day and have hovered just
above $30 since then. The stock price was as high as $49 per share in
February and was slightly above $90 at the end of 2000, before the
recession.
