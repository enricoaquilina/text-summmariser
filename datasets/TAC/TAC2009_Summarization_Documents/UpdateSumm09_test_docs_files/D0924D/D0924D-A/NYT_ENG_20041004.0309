WAVE OF LAWSUITS EXPECTED AGAINST MERCK AFTER VIOXX SALES HALTED
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Last week's decision by Merck to halt sales of Vioxx, its blockbuster
painkiller, could lead to an onslaught of new lawsuits against the
company.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds and perhaps thousands of new Vioxx lawsuits are likely to be
filed, lawyers said, with many of them class actions that aim to
represent large groups of Vioxx users who have taken the drug for
extended periods. Indeed, radio advertisements seeking plaintiffs are
being broadcast and some suits were filed almost immediately after
Merck's recall announcement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Our lawsuit was in the works but the filing was accelerated by the
recall," said Don S. Strong, a lawyer who filed a suit against Merck
on Thursday in U.S.District Court in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
"The recall makes our burden of proof easier," Strong said, "because
it validates what our experts have been telling us for several
months." The lawsuit says that Strong's client suffered ministrokes
and a number of heart problems from taking Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
But some experienced product liability lawyers say a new wave of
litigation may not necessarily be more distracting for Merck than the
suits that are already working their way through the courts.
</P>
<P>
Assuming the Vioxx cases follow the pattern of other major product
liability battles, a surge in lawsuits could well encourage
court-ordered consolidation of the litigation, hastening its
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Whether the decision to recall the product ends up undermining
Merck's legal defenses or improving its image to juries is less
predictable, according to legal experts.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides will try to spin this in their favor," said Vincent S.
Walkowiak, a Dallas lawyer who has worked for Merck in other cases
but is not involved in the Vioxx litigation. "The plaintiffs will say
this is confirmation of Vioxx's dangers and Merck will use it to
establish that it is behaving responsibly."
</P>
<P>
While declining to comment directly on the legal impact of Vioxx's
withdrawal, Theodore V.H. Mayer, a lawyer at Hughes Hubbard &amp;
Reed, a firm retained by Merck, said the company "continues to
believe it has strong and meritorious defenses to the lawsuits
brought against it."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of lawsuits had been filed against Merck, which is based in
Whitehouse Station, N.J., long before last week's recall decision.
The lawsuits blame Vioxx -- currently used by about 1.3 million
Americans and 700,000 arthritis sufferers in other countries -- for
heart attacks, strokes and other health problems.
</P>
<P>
They also charge that Merck's aggressive marketing of Vioxx failed to
disclose adequately the information the company had about those risks
and that Merck did not diligently pursue research into the hazards of
Vioxx. Some of the lawsuits include drug distributors and doctors as
co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
The decision to recall Vioxx could have an impact on whether the drug
is found to be defective, according to Walkowski.
</P>
<P>
Some states have statutes that create a presumption that there is no
defect in drugs and drug labels that have been approved by the Food
and Drug Administration; Vioxx had such approval. It is unclear,
though, whether courts will rule that the Vioxx recall eliminates
such presumptions.
</P>
<P>
If Vioxx is found to be defective under certain state laws, the
timing and the circumstances of the recall could become a factor in
determining whether Merck behaved so negligently or recklessly that
it should pay punitive damages. State laws will be used to determine
liability, regardless of whether a case is in state or federal court.
</P>
<P>
"It frames the issue for a jury," Walkowiak said.
</P>
<P>
Merck announced that it would withdraw Vioxx from the market after it
learned on Sept. 23 that the drug's users were twice as likely to
suffer heart attacks or strokes as test subjects receiving a placebo.
The data came to light in a major clinical trial that Merck had hoped
would show that Vioxx could help prevent colon polyps, which can
become cancerous.
</P>
<P>
Merck had contested all previous reports that Vioxx was dangerous,
contending they were based on faulty or inconclusive research.
</P>
<P>
Several lawsuits have been filed since Thursday, including a class
action against Merck Frosst, the Canadian subsidiary of Merck,
brought by a consumers' group in Quebec. Some lawyers, including
those who had filed suits against Merck before the Vioxx withdrawal,
said that they already had plenty of evidence of the drug's dangers
before last week's announcement.
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is no better," said Robert E. Cartwright Jr., a San
Francisco lawyer whose lawsuits against Merck are among approximately
285 similar cases that have been consolidated before a single
California state judge in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"It was just a matter of time before the recall occurred," said
Cartwright, whose first case was filed in March 2002.
</P>
<P>
One Vioxx case brought by a plaintiff in Alabama is scheduled for
trial in December.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of Vioxx leaves numerous unanswered questions about
the extent of the risks it poses. Some plaintiffs could ask Merck to
finance more research into the effects of the drug.
</P>
<P>
The most serious health risks associated with Vioxx seem to appear
after consumers have been taking the drug for 18 months or longer.
Merck said Monday that it was still looking into how many Vioxx users
fell into that group. More than 105 million Vioxx prescriptions have
been filled for about 20 million consumers since the drug was first
sold in August 1999, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
Vioxx's $2.5 billion in sales accounted for about 11 percent of
Merck's revenue last year and, according to analysts' estimates,
about $1.2 billion, or 18 percent, of its earnings. The crucial role
Vioxx plays in Merck's portfolio was apparent last week when Merck's
shares plunged 27 percent to $33 after the withdrawal announcement.
</P>
<P>
Since then, shares of Merck have rebounded modestly. They rose 92
cents Monday, to $34.23.
