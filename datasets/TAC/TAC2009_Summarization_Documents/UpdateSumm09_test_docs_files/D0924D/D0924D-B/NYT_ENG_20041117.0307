EARLIER MERCK STUDY INDICATED RISKS OF VIOXX
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a year before Merck received results from the clinical trial
that prompted the company to pull its painkiller Vioxx from the
market, the company received preliminary results from a separate
study of patient records that also apparently indicated the drug
posed cardiovascular risks.
</P>
<P>
Merck has not publicly disclosed that separate study's results or
referred to it in any of its recent statements about Vioxx's safety
record since announcing in late September that it would stop selling
the drug. But a company spokeswoman, in response to a reporter's
questions Wednesday, confirmed the study's existence and said that
Merck, which paid for the research, had received its preliminary
results last November -- and was given a final report 10 days before
the company announced it would stop selling Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
Joan Wainwright, the Merck spokeswoman, said that the separate study,
because it was based on patient records and not on an actual clinical
trial, was inconclusive and had no bearing on the decision to
withdraw Vioxx. When it withdrew the drug from the market, Merck
cited a long-term trial showing that some patients, after taking
Vioxx for 18 months, developed serious cardiovascular problems. But
Merck's critics continue to say that the company should have heeded
signals years earlier that Vioxx might pose dangers.
</P>
<P>
The company's chief executive, Raymond V. Gilmartin, is expected to
be interrogated on the matter on Thursday in a hearing by the Senate
Finance Committee, which will also be examining the Food and Drug
Administration's handling of Vioxx and other drug safety issues.
</P>
<P>
The study report that Merck received on Sept. 20 was an analysis of
patient records from the UnitedHealth Group. It compared the relative
rates of heart attack and stroke in people taking Vioxx, a similar
drug Celebrex and traditional over-the-counter painkillers.
</P>
<P>
Wainwright said that the company, as a matter of policy, did not
discuss study findings before their public release. But one person
who was briefed on the data and who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said that the results indicated that Vioxx posed an
increased risk of cardiovascular problems, compared with the other
drugs studied.
</P>
<P>
Wainwright said that the study had been submitted for potential
publication in a medical journal that she declined to identify and
that there had been no intentional effort to delay disclosing the
results.
</P>
<P>
The Senate hearing comes after the disclosure in recent weeks of
internal Merck documents that suggest that the company may have
side-stepped questions about Vioxx's safety for several years and
used hardball marketing tactics to allay doctors' concerns about the
painkiller.
</P>
<P>
An FDA drug reviewer, Dr. David Graham, has claimed that agency
superiors discounted his efforts to call attention to the drug's
problems. Graham's main evidence is a study of patient records from
the Kaiser Permanente health care system, which is similar in
approach to the UnitedHealth Care study that Merck commissioned.
