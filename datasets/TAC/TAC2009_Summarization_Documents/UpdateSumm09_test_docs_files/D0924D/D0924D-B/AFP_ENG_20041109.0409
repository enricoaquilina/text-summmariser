<P>
Drugs giant Merck and Co.'s shares slumped Tuesday after the firm
revealed civil and criminal investigations into the sale of its pain
drug Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
In the first half hour of trade, Merck shares dropped 55 cents, or
2.1 percent, to 26.02 dollars, completing a 42.3 percent plunge in
the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
In a public filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
on Monday, Merck said it had been told of an informal SEC inquiry
into Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
The firm said it had also received a subpoena from the US Department
of Justice asking for information about its research, marketing and
sales of Vioxx in a criminal health care investigation.
</P>
<P>
"The company will cooperate with the SEC and the Justice Department,"
Merck said in the filing.
</P>
<P>
"The company cannot predict the outcome of these inquiries; however,
it is possible that highly unfavorable outcomes, including a
potential civil disposition from the SEC and/or potential civil or
criminal dispositions from the Justice Department, could have a
material adverse effect on the companys financial position, liquidity
and results of operations," it said.
</P>
<P>
Merck pulled the 2.5-billion-dollar-a-year seller Vioxx off the
market on September 30, when an internal study found it doubled the
risk of heart attack and stroke after 18 months of continuous use.
</P>
<P>
A study sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration estimated
that Vioxx could have caused 27,785 heart attacks or deaths since it
was approved in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Merck has disputed a report in the British medical weekly The Lancet,
however, that there was enough evidence four years ago linking the
drug to an increased risk of strokes and heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
A rash of lawsuits now plagues the firm because of the global Vioxx
withdrawal. Merck said it was unsure if its insurance would provide
enough money to cover potential lawsuit losses.
