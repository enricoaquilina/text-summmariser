Merck said the Justice Department had launched a criminal
investigation into its handling of Vioxx, the blockbuster pain-killing
drug that it withdrew from the market after a study found long-term
use increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The company
warned that government probes, along with civil lawsuits, could have
``highly unfavorable outcomes'' for investors. Moody's, meanwhile,
dropped Merck's credit rating to reflect the sudden loss of revenue
and new litigation exposure.
