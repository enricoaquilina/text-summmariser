<P>
An expert with the Federal Drug Administration on Thursday accused
the agency in Congress of having pressed him to withhold results of a
study showing potential dangers of the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
"I was pressured to change my conclusions and recommendations, and
basically threatened that if I did not change them, I would not be
permitted to present the paper at the conference," said David Graham,
Associate Director for Science with the office of Drug Safety at the
FDA.
</P>
<P>
Graham testified Thursday at a Senate hearing about his 2001-2004
study.
</P>
<P>
"One drug safety manager recommended that I should be barred from
presenting the poster at the meeting and also noted that Merck needed
to know our study results," he said.
</P>
<P>
Merck, the maker of Vioxx, which was approved by the FDA in 1999,
voluntarily took the drug off the market in September.
</P>
<P>
Merck withdrew Vioxx based on the results of an internal three-year
study of 2,600 patients, half of whom received a 25 mg dose of Vioxx
and half of whom received a placebo.
</P>
<P>
The company said these patients, treated with Vioxx to thwart the
resurgence of colorectal polyps, a common precursor to cancer, showed
no undesirable effects during the first 18 months of the study begun
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, said Peter Kim, president of Merck Research Laboratory,
"while the cause of these results is uncertain at this time, they
suggest an increased risk of confirmed cardiovascular events
beginning after 18 months of continuous therapy."
</P>
<P>
Graham said: "the problem you are confronting today is immense in
scope. Vioxx is a terrible tragedy and a profound regulatory failure.
I would argue that the FDA, as currently configured, is incapable of
protecting America against another Vioxx."
</P>
<P>
"The corporate culture within CDRE is also a barrier to effectively
protecting the American people from unecessary harm due to
prescription," he said.
