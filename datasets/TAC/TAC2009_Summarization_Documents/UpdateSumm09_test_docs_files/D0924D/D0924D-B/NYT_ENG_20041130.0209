MERCK IS TARGET OF FEDERAL LAWSUIT BY NEW YORK PENSION FUND
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pension fund of New York State filed a federal lawsuit Monday
against Merck &amp; Co. that accused Merck of misleading shareholders
about the safety of its now-withdrawn arthritis pain drug, Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Trenton, N.J., said that
the pension fund lost about $171 million on Sept. 30 when the
company, citing increased heart risks in tests of people using the
drug for more than 18 months, withdrew it from the market. On that
day, the price of a share of Merck stock plummeted 27 percent. Merck
shares are down about 40 percent for the year, but closed up 35 cents
Monday, at $28.02.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit appears to be the first by a pension fund against Merck.
A spokeswoman for Merck, Joan Wainwright, said that about 15 lawsuits
had been filed asserting that the company misled shareholders have
been filed. Merck is based in Whitehouse Station, N.J
</P>
<P>
Several hundred personal injury lawsuit have also been filed against
Merck by people claiming to have been injured Vioxx. The company has
denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday, the New York State comptroller, Alan G.
Hevesi, maintained that Merck knew, but failed to disclose, that a
growing body of evidence indicated that users of Vioxx were at
increasing risk of suffering heart attacks, strokes and death.
</P>
<P>
"Merck must be held legally responsible for its actions," said
Hevesi, who is also the pension fund's trustee. "These actions have
put lives at risk and cost shareholders billions of dollars."
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit, Hevesi is seeking unspecified monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
Along with the company, the lawsuit names several individuals
including the chief executive, Raymond V. Gilmartin.
</P>
<P>
Merck executives have disputed suggestions that they acted improperly
and said that they moved promptly to withdraw Vioxx from the market
after patients in a clinical trial experienced an increased rate of
cardiovascular problems after 18 months of using the drug.
</P>
<P>
""Merck extensively studied Vioxx before seeking regulatory approval
to market it," the spokeswoman, Wainwright, said. "We promptly
disclosed the clinical data about Vioxx. When questions arose, we
took additional steps, including conducting further prospective,
controlled studies to gain more clinical information."
</P>
<P>
She said that Merck had not seen Hevesi's lawsuit and could not
comment.
</P>
<P>
In his lawsuit, Hevesi cited recent newspaper reports, broadcast
reports and medical journal articles that have raised questions about
Merck's handling of safety issues surrounding Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
The safety questions first emerged soon after Vioxx was approved in
1999 for sale by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, for instance, a major clinical trial of the drug found that
those taking it had a fivefold increased risk of heart attack
compared to patients in the trial who took a comparative pain
reliever, naproxen.
</P>
<P>
However, until recently, Merck executives said that those results did
not reflect any dangers posed by Vioxx but rather that the
cardioprotective effect of naproxen.
</P>
<P>
John Chartier, a spokesman for Hevesi, said that at end of September
the New York State pension fund owned about 9.4 million shares of
Merck.
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit filed Monday in Trenton, Hevesi is asking the court to
consolidate all securities-related claims against Merck in connection
with Vioxx into a single class action and to make him the lead
plaintiff. He also filed a separate but related lawsuit Monday in
U.S. District Court in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
The New York State Common Retirement Fund, as the pension fund is
officially known, is the second-largest public pension fund in the
country after the California fund.
</P>
<P>
It has approximately $120.8 billion in assets and more than 970,000
retirees, beneficiaries and members.
