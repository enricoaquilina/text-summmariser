Hurricane Rita brushed past Key West on Tuesday
and was forecast to strengthen into a major hurricane later
in the week, prompting residents and rescuers to begin evacuating
this feeble city, as well as parts of Louisiana and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
From the tip of the Florida peninsula to Galveston, Texas, thousands
left their homes or made plans to, including many who
had already fled once, from Hurricane Katrina, and were living
in shelters and temporary housing. In Houston, officials began moving
evacuees from New Orleans out of the Reliant Arena where
they had found refuge and sending many of them on
to Arkansas.

In Louisiana, Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco asked President Bush on Tuesday
to declare a state of emergency for her battered state
as it prepares for Hurricane Rita. She requested $10 million
in assistance.

Churning undiminished toward the warm and wide Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane
Rita could strengthen to Category 4 intensity as it approaches
Texas later this week, said Colin McAdie, a meteorologist at
the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Hurricane Katrina was a
Category 4 storm when it devastated parts of the coasts
of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama on Aug. 29.

McAdie said western Louisiana could also bear the brunt of the
storm depending on changes in steering currents. "It's better not
to nail it down too precisely," he said. "Over the
next day or so we'll have a better idea."
</P>
<P>
The official death toll in Louisiana remained at 736. In Mississippi,
219 people died from the storm.
</P>
<P>
In the city, mostly empty of residents but with its physical
core still vulnerable, the possibility of heavy rain and a
storm surge prompted officials to make emergency efforts to bolster
its weakened levee system, station 500 buses on its outskirts
to evacuate remaining residents and establish a military hospital at
the convention center, which just weeks ago was the scene
of violence and desperation for thousands of trapped evacuees from
Hurricane Katrina.
