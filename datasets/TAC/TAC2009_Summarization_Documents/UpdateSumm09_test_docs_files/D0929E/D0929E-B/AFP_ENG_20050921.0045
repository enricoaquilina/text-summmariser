<P>
US meteorologists on Wednesday upgraded 
Hurricane Rita, which roared into the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico after 
slamming Cuba and the Florida Keys islands, to a more powerful 
Category Three category on the five-level hurricane intensity 
scale.
</P>
<P>
At 0600 GMT Wednesday Rita packed winds of 185 kilometers (115 
miles) per hour, officials at the Miami-based National Hurricane 
Center reported.
</P>
<P>
"Additional strengthening is forecast during the next 24 hours," 
the Hurricane Center said in an advisory, "and Rita is expected to 
become a Category Four hurricane sometime later (Wednesday)."
</P>
<P>
Rita's center was located some 235 kilometers (145 miles) west 
of Key West, Florida, and about 210 kilometers (130 miles) northwest 
of Havana, and was moving west in the direction of the Texas 
coastline at a speed of around 22 kilometers (14 miles) per hour, 
according to the Hurricane Center.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane left more than 24,000 homes without power in 
Florida, sent street signs and coconuts flying and flooded parts of 
the only road that links the Florida Keys to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Cuba set up 600 shelters in Havana and Civil Defense reported 
230,000 evacuees, including 12,000 foreigners in the tourist area of 
Varadero. Hurricane warnings were in effect around Havana and 
western provinces.
</P>
<P>
In Louisiana, still recovering from Hurricane Katrina's August 
29 hit, authorities were keeping a close eye on Rita, and New 
Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin suspended the return of the city's residents 
because of the new threat.
