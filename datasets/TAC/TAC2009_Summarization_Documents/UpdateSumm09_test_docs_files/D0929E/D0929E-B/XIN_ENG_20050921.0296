Hurricane Rita gained strength
on its way towards the US Gulf Coast and turned into a Category 5 
storm Wednesday afternoon, forcing authorities to order the 
evacuation of more than 1.3 million residents in the region.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane, with winds up to 165 mph (264 kmp), was forecast
to land somewhere along the Texas Gulf Coast between Galveston and
Corpus Christi Saturday. Texas Governor Rick Perry has urged 
residents along the state's entire coast to begin evacuating.
</P>
<P>
A similar evacuation order was issued in New Orleans of 
Louisiana, which was battered by Hurricane just three weeks ago 
leaving 799 people dead as of Wednesday. The total number of death
from Katrina along the Gulf Coast rose past 1,000 to 1,037.
</P>
<P>
Category 5 is the highest on the five-level hurricane intensity
scale, and only three Category 5 hurricanes are known to have hit 
the US mainland.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for a potential catastrophe as that caused by 
Katrina, authorities have mobilized an estimated 319,000 National 
Guard troops nationwide to respond to Rita if needed.
</P>
<P>
"We hope and pray that Hurricane Rita will not be a devastating
storm, but we got to be ready for the worst," said US President 
George W. Bush on Wednesday, who has declared a state of emergency
in Texas and Louisiana.
