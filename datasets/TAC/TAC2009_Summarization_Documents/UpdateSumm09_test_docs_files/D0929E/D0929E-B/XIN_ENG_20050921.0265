US President George W. Bush 
declared on Wednesday a state of emergency in Texas and Louisiana,
at a time when both states were bracing for Hurricane Rita, the 
White House said.
</P>
<P>
Rita, which picked up strength and has turned into a Category-5
hurricane, could slam Texas by the weekend and bring floodwater to
New Orleans, which was battered by Hurricane Katrina just over 
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
As many as 1 million people were ordered to evacuate along the 
Gulf Coast, and hospital and nursing home patients were evacuated 
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the death toll from Katrina along the Gulf Coast 
rose over 1,000 Wednesday to 1,036. The Louisiana state Health 
Department updated fatalities in the state to 799.
