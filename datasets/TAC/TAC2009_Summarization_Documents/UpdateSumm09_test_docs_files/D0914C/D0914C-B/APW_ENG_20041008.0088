Explosion tears through resort in Sinai Peninsula where Israelis
vacationing; Egypt says at least 30 killed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A car bomb and a suicide bomber set off twin blasts that tore through
a resort hotel in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula where Israelis were
vacationing at the end of a Jewish holiday Thursday night, killing at
least 30 people and wounding more than 160, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt said at least 30 people were killed _ including 12 Egyptians _
but an Israeli official later said he could confirm only 14 or 15
dead, including five or six Israelis. He said, however, that more
were buried under the rubble. Israel Radio reported at least 35
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The explosion was followed by two smaller blasts at other tourist
sites in the Sinai that killed at least two Israelis. Egyptian
hospital officials said four people were killed in those explosions.
</P>
<P>
Two bombs exploded in quick succession at the Taba Hilton. A car
laden with explosives drove into the lobby of the hotel and
detonated, while a suicide bomber blew up near the hotel swimming
pool, the Israeli official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials were investigating the blasts, but could not
confirm witness reports that car bombs caused all three.
</P>
<P>
The Taba blast collapsed a 10-story wing of the luxury Hilton hotel
built by Israel when it controlled Taba from 1967 to 1989. Israelis
described a chaotic scene as the explosion brought the top floors of
the hotel crashing into the lobby.
</P>
<P>
Meir Frajun said his three children were playing one floor below the
lobby when the blast tore through the building. He went down but
found only two of them.
</P>
<P>
"Everything was filled with smoke," Frajun told The Associated Press
after crossing into the nearby Israeli resort of Eilat. "We were
hysterically looking for the child. In the end we found him sitting
outside with an Arab guest of the hotel."
</P>
<P>
Four hours after the blast, Israel's military took command of the
scene, according to the army spokeswoman, Brig. Gen. Ruth Yaron, but
there were delays in sending Israeli forces and rescue workers across
the tense border.
</P>
<P>
The explosions came a month after the Israeli government urged
citizens not to visit Egypt, citing a "concrete" terror threat to
tourists in an area. The warning, issued Sept. 9 by the
counterterrorism center in Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office,
identified the Sinai Peninsula as the target of a potential attack.
</P>
<P>
The initial blast, about 10 p.m., rocked the Hilton hotel in the Taba
resort, only yards from the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
"The whole front of the hotel has collapsed. There are dozens of
people on the floor, lots of blood," witness Yigal Vakni told Army
Radio.
</P>
<P>
Others were trapped in the debris, and the Israeli official said
rescuers expected to find at least 10 more bodies.
</P>
<P>
Just before midnight, two smaller blasts struck the area of Ras
Shitan, a camping area near the town of Nuweiba south of Taba,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Amsalem Farrag, whose uncle and cousin own camps in Ras Shitan, said
both told him that cars exploded outside their camps. The two blasts
were only five seconds apart, he said. He said the camps were full of
vacationing Israelis.
</P>
<P>
No established groups have claimed responsibility for the bombing,
but two previously unknown groups each said they carried it out.
</P>
<P>
Tawhid Islamic Brigades published a claim on a Web site that has been
used frequently for such claims from Saudi Arabia and Iraq. And Jamaa
Al-Islamiya Al-Alamiya, or World Islamist Group, called an
international news agency in Jerusalem. Neither group offered detail
of how it carried out the attack, as such claims usually do, and
there was no way to confirm their authenticity.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian government spokesman Magdy Rady suggested the blasts were
related to the Israeli military operation against the Palestinians in
the neighboring Gaza Strip, where 84 Palestinians have been killed in
an Israeli offensive that began on Sept. 29 to stop militants from
firing homemade rockets into Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I think the explosions are very related to what is going on in
Gaza," Rady told AP. "We condemn these attacks, which have harmed
many people."
</P>
<P>
"I think it is very probable that there is a link between these three
explosions," he added. "It is very unlikely they happened by chance."
</P>
<P>
The security adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Jibril
Rajoub, told Al-Jazeera television that no Palestinian factions were
responsible for the explosions.
</P>
<P>
Egypt upgraded a security alert at the airports in Cairo and in the
southern tourist cities of Luxor, Hurghada and Aswan. Police were
searching cars coming in and out of Luxor and Hurghada and there was
a heavy police presence around hotels.
</P>
<P>
Yaron, the Israeli army spokeswoman, said Israeli Brig. Gen. Efi Idan
"took command over the event in Taba" four hours after the blast. She
said, however, "We still have some trouble in sending over all of the
forces and their equipment to Taba."
</P>
<P>
An Israeli foreign ministry spokeswoman said that Israel would help
evacuate any of the 12,000 to 15,000 Israelis who wish to leave the
Sinai. Friday morning, thousands were streaming into Eilat, across
the border.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up temporary accomodations in community centers, and
Israeli radio reported a nationwide call for surgeons to get to
Eilat.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Army Radio reported that initially, Egyptian policemen fired
in the air at the Taba border crossing as dozens of Israelis tried to
break through to get home. Reporters from the Israeli side were
unable to reach the scene, and no TV images were available several
hours after the blast.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 rescue workers, many wearing hard hats, were later
allowed to cross, and graders were seen clearing rubble at the site.
</P>
<P>
Egyptians reportedly allowed the teams in after Sharon instructed his
diplomats to contact the Egyptians and expedite the crossing. The two
countries signed a peace treaty in 1979, but relations have been
chilly as a result of Israeli military actions in Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
Rady said at least 30 people were killed and 160 injured in the Taba
blast, and another seven Egyptians were injured in the Ras Shitan
explosions. Israel's rescue service said it evacuated 108 casualties
to Israel, including one dead and 48 in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
An official at Taba Hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said his institution had taken in 25 bodies from the Taba explosion
and two more from Ras Shitan. An official at the Nuweiba hospital
said two more bodies arrived there.
</P>
<P>
Taba is the main crossing between Israel and Egypt and the gateway
for thousands of Israelis who travel to the hotels and resorts on the
Red Sea. Thursday was the last day of the weeklong Jewish festival of
Sukkot, when thousands of Israelis vacation in the Sinai.
</P>
<P>
Egyptians also were in the midst of a long holiday weekend marking
the anniversary of the start of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, so popular
resort towns along the Sinai coast were packed.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has long struggled with Islamic militants interested in
overthrowing the secular government, but has contained the threat
with periodic crackdowns and by allowing Islamists some political
activity.
</P>
<P>
The last major militant strike in Egypt was the 1997 massacre of 58
foreign tourists by Islamic extremists in the southern resort town of
Luxor.
</P>
<P>
Rady said the explosions are sure to have a negative effect _ at
least temporarily _ on Egypt's tourism industry, one of the country's
economic mainstays.
</P>
<P>
"There will be damage definitely to the tourism in the area," he
said, "but I hope it will not last long."
