TABA, Egypt, Oct 8 (AFP)

<TEXT>
<P>
Car bombs ripped through a major hotel and two beach resorts packed
with Israeli tourists on the Red Sea coast of Egypt's Sinai desert,
killing at least 19 people and causing scenes of mayhem in attacks
that Israel blamed on Al-Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
The biggest of the string of explosions late Thursday left a trail of
carnage and destruction at the 10-storey Hilton hotel in Taba, a town
just across the Israeli border that once hosted Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"According to our first information, it appears to be an
international terror attack with the hallmarks of Al-Qaeda," Israel's
deputy defence minister Zeev Boim said.
</P>
<P>
The explosions occurred as Israelis were celebrating the end of the
Jewish holiday of Sukkot, and followed intelligence warnings that
Israelis should keep out of the Sinai because of possible attacks.
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the number of dead varied through the night as rescuers
combed the rubbaeli public television.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said the explosion was caused by a powerful car bomb
detonated near the entrance to the four-star Hilton, destroying a
wing of the building. Footage showed collapse staircases and tangled
piles of metal and concrete
</P>
<P>
South Sinai governor General Mustafa Afifi said two charred trucks
were found at the tourist camps of Shitani and Ras Soltan on the
coast road south of Taba, indicating that the blasts were also caused
by car bombs.
</P>
<P>
Egypt threw up a security cordon around the blast sites in the Sinai
-- renowned for its dramatic desert mountains and palm-fringed
beaches -- and boosted airport security in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
A previously unknown group calling itself "Islamic Unity Brigades"
claimed responsibility for the attacks saying they were in revenge
for Israel's assassination of Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin last March.
</P>
<P>
"Four of your martyrdom-seeking brothers (suicide bombers) carried
out this heroic operation... against a den of prostitution and
corruption," said a statement posted on an Islamist website whose
authenticity could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Another group calling itself Jamaa Al-Islamiya Al-Alamiya (World
Islamist Group) also claimed the Taba attack in a telephone call to
AFP in Jerusalem to avenge "the Palestinian and Arab martyrs dying in
Palestine and Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The explosions came amid a massive Israeli army offensive in the
north of the Gaza Strip, a wedge of land near the border with Egypt,
that has left 93 Palestinians dead in less than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Resorts dotted along the Sinai's desert coast have remained popular
holiday spots for Israelis since the territory was handed back to
Egypt as part of a 1979 peace deal, the first between Israel and an
Arab country.
</P>
<P>
But Taba, which in ancient times was once a resting point for
caravans, was only returned in 1989 after years of wrangling
following a ruling by the International Court of Justice.
