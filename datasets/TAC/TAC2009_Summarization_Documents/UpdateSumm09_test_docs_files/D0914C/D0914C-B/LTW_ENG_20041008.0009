A massive explosion tore off the front of a seaside
hotel in the Egyptian resort of Taba late Thursday, killing at least
30 people and injuring more than 100 in what appeared to be a
terrorist attack aimed at Israeli tourists, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred at 10 p.m. at the Taba Hilton, a luxury
high-rise hotel on the Red Sea surrounded by palm trees and coral
reefs, just a few hundred yards over the border from the southern tip
of Israel. The hotel, a popular venue for Middle East peace
negotiators, was reportedly packed with Israeli tourists celebrating
the end of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.
</P>
<P>
News service accounts from the area said two more explosions
subsequently rocked the Red Sea resorts of Ras Shytan and Nuweiba,
about 40 miles south of Taba, but details were sketchy. One witness
interviewed by Israeli television reported that two rockets were fired
at his hotel in Ras Shytan; another said there was a huge blast that
appeared to be from a car bomb. Egyptian hospital officials cited by
the Associated Press said four were killed in the two attacks.
</P>
<P>
At the Hilton, witnesses described scenes of horror and pandemonium
when a huge blast occurred at the front of the hotel, catapulting
bodies across the spacious lobby area, which has a large bar, a casino
and huge plate-glass windows looking out on a large salt-water pool
nestled along the Red Sea. There were reports of large fires burning
inside the hotel and people trapped under fallen debris. The
Associated Press reported that an entire 10-floor wing collapsed.
</P>
<P>
There were no official reports about the cause of the blast, but
based on accounts from the scene and the extent of the damage,
suspicion immediately focused on a possible car bomb detonated at the
front of the building.
</P>
<P>
``The whole front of the hotel has collapsed. There are dozens of
people on the floor, lots of blood,'' said Yigal Vakni, an Israeli
tourist interviewed by Israel's Army Radio. ``I am standing outside
the hotel -- the whole thing is burning and they have nothing to put it
out with.''
</P>
<P>
``I was in my room on the fourth floor when suddenly I heard a
tremendous explosion,'' a tourist identified only as Shimon told the
Israeli Internet site Ynet. ``The explosion was in the entrance of the
hotel, where the cars stop to drop off suitcases. All the glass flew
everywhere. I saw a lot of injured people, at least two dead people
next to the swimming pool.''
</P>
<P>
Svetlana Ahmedallah, 33, said that she was in a room with her
mother on the seventh floor when the blast occurred and that the
building seemed to collapse. The next thing she knew, Ahmedallah said,
she was on the ground.
</P>
<P>
``I was lying in bed and my mother was in the bathroom when
suddenly there was a strong explosion. Everything flew, and I heard my
mother shouting for help,'' Ahmedallah said. She said she and her
mother were in Taba on a two-week vacation from their home in
Tatarstan in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ahmedallah, interviewed at a hospital just across the border from
Egypt in Elat, where she was treated for minor injuries, said she
apparently flew through a window. She did not know what happened to
her mother, but said she assumed her mother had died. ``I fell down to
the ground on the bed. The whole part of the building collapsed. I
don't know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials said they had no evidence of terrorism, the
Associated Press reported. Egyptian security officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the explosion occurred among gas tanks in
the hotel kitchen, which is next to the casino, where many tourists
were at the time.
</P>
<P>
Egypt put the death toll at 30, and the Interior Ministry said 12
Egyptians were among the dead. Israel Radio reported Friday that at
least 35 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
After the explosion in Taba, many Israelis reportedly dropped
everything and fled about 300 yards north to the official Israel-Egypt
border crossing. Israeli officials said that after a period of
confusion, Egyptian authorities began cooperating with Israeli fire
and rescue personnel, allowing ambulances to cross the border to
evacuate the wounded and search for those who remained trapped in the
debris.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Moshiko, a fire department spokesman in Elat, said 30
firefighters were allowed to cross into Egypt to help, but others were
turned away because they did not have their passports.
</P>
<P>
``They are trying to put out the fire and save people who are still
trapped in the ruins of the hotel,'' he told Israel's Channel 10
television. ``The firefighters are climbing up through the hotel,
floor by floor, to save the people inside.''
</P>
<P>
Gideon Meir, a senior official in Israel's Foreign Ministry, said
that in conversations with the Egyptian government, Israel had
requested that Egypt permit free passage across the border for Israeli
citizens and rescue personnel without passports, clearance for Israeli
helicopters to fly to the scene of the attacks and permission for as
many as 30 buses to travel down the coast to pick up any Israelis who
wanted to leave. The Egyptians responded that they would do ``their
utmost'' to help, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Forces later took control of the scene at Taba.
A military convoy including seven ambulances and three buses went to
the site in Nuweiba.
</P>
<P>
Last month, before the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah, the Foreign
Ministry issued a travel advisory warning Israeli tourists not to
travel to the Sinai Peninsula because of possible terrorist attacks.
But officials said they believed that between 12,000 and 15,000
Israeli tourists were in the Sinai on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said they had no concrete information about who
was behind the strikes. But one senior government official noted the
similarities between Thursday's attacks and previous attacks by
al-Qaida. He cited in particular the multiple simultaneous strikes in
other countries.
</P>
<P>
``It looks like al-Qaida,'' he said. ``The characteristics of this
attack are the same as Bali, Kenya, or even Madrid.''
</P>
<P>
No established groups have asserted responsibility for the bombing,
but two previously unknown Islamic groups each said they carried it
out. There was no way to confirm the authenticity of the claims.
</P>
<P>
Elat is one of Israel's most popular resorts, located at the very
southern tip of the country where Israel, Egypt and Jordan converge at
the end of a small finger of the Red Sea. Joseftal Hospital there was
inundated with wounded, said Naomi Halevy, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
``More people are coming in every minute,'' she said in a telephone
interview. ``It's a total mess.'' Hospital officials reported
receiving 112 injured.
</P>
<P>
There were few reliable reports about the other blasts. Assaf Levy,
a tourist who was staying at the Castle Beach Hotel in Ras Shytan,
said he was relaxing with friends when suddenly a missile was fired
from the long, high mountain range that runs along much of the coast.
</P>
<P>
``There was fire, a huge explosion, and we all ran outside,'' he
told Israel's Channel 2. ``Two minutes later we saw another missile
that fell in the parking lot of the Castle Beach. Some people even ran
towards the water and got into the sea because they were afraid of the
missiles.''
</P>
<P>
Aya Reich, 28, a lawyer from Tel Aviv, said she was dining with
about 10 friends at a small beach community called Moon Island when
``suddenly there was a strong explosion about 30 meters away from us,
and everyone flew, and then a minute later there was another
explosion, and we all started running towards the water.''
</P>
<P>
``People were falling on top of each other,'' said Reich, who was
wounded in the foot by shrapnel. ``Everyone was hysterical.''
