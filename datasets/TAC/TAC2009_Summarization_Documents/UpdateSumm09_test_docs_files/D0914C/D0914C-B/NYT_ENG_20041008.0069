RESCUE WORKERS SEARCH FOR BODIES AFTER BLASTS IN EGYPT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TABA, Egypt
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Egyptian and Israeli rescue workers picked through the ruins of a
luxury Sinai hotel Friday after at least 27 people were killed in
bomb attacks on Thursday night that shook the hotel and two others
popular with vacationing Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said they believed the blasts, in which more than
100 were wounded, were caused by terrorist bombs.
</P>
<P>
The workers from the two countries labored side by side at the ruins
of the the hotel, the Taba Hilton, using heavy earthmoving equipment,
their bare hands, and rope to pull apart the rubble, and enlisting
sniffer dogs in a retrieval effort or to search for any remaining
victims.
</P>
<P>
The two other blasts took place to the southwest, in the resort
villages of Ras al-Sultan and Nuweiba.
</P>
<P>
A coordinator of the Israeli rescue efforts, Col. Gidon Baron, said
that the bodies of some of the 27 people he confirmed were killed had
been retrieved from the rubble of the hotel Friday. An Egyptian
doctor at the Taba hospital, Wael Nahran, said 22 bodies had been
taken to the hospital's morgue.
</P>
<P>
A previously unknown pro-al Qaida Islamist group called Islamic
Tawhid Brigades claimed responsibility for the blast on a Web site, a
Reuters report said. The claim, along with one from another unknown
group calling itself the World Islamist Group, could not be verified.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse reported that someone claiming to be from World
Islamist Group had taken responsibility for the Hilton blast in a
telephone call to its bureau in Jerusalem. The caller said the attack
was "in revenge for the Palestinian and Arab martyrs dying in
Palestine and Iraq," the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel's deputy defense minister, Zeev Boim, told reporters the
attack appeared to be the work of "international terror groups like
al-Qaida or branches of it," according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
The largest explosion was at the Taba Hilton, where early reports
suggested that a truck bomb was driven into the hotel, located in a
village just across the border and near the Israeli town of Eilat.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Friday morning that officials thought there was
also a suicide bomber in the Hilton.
</P>
<P>
The hotel was badly damaged by the blast and an ensuing fire, and 10
floors in the complex collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Part of the Hilton apparently crumbled immediately after the blast.
</P>
<P>
"I heard a huge explosion," said Yigal Vakni, an Israeli at the
Hilton who spoke to Israeli Army Radio. "The wall near me collapsed
and people began to run."
</P>
<P>
The blast was outside, he said. "When we went out we saw the shops
and the internal wall of the hotel had collapsed."
</P>
<P>
Many people were lying on the ground, he said, "There is a lot of
blood, a lot of screaming." An unnamed Israeli woman told Israeli
television: "We immediately ran toward the beach, everyone running at
once, and windows continue to shatter as we ran away. Entire families
were wounded; they ran to the beach and were covered with blood."
</P>
<P>
An Israeli tourist, Gal Keshet, who said he took part in the rescue
at Ras al-Sultan, said that one vehicle exploded after it breached
the resort, while another car did not manage to get in but blew up
anyway, without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israeli intelligence warned Israelis to keep out of the
Sinai desert, citing vague but solid information about possible
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Panicked Israelis rushed the border post, trying to flee Egypt,
yelling at the border guards in Arabic that their belongings and
documents were still in the burning hotel. Guards fired shots into
the air to try to disperse them, before finally shutting the terminal
temporarily. Roads were blocked, leaving vacationing Israelis at
other hotels trapped.
</P>
<P>
Hadas Manor, an Israeli journalist staying at another Taba hotel,
told Israeli television: "Most of the people here haven't come with
their cars, so they depend on Egyptian taxis that are not operating
now."
</P>
<P>
Television broadcasts of the border showed an Arab Israeli woman
being carried by her husband. As he put her down, she collapsed, and
medics rushed to her.
</P>
<P>
Israeli television also showed scenes of ambulances arriving at Eilat
hospitals and unloading the wounded, many of them bandaged and
bloody. Others, apparently in shock, were wheeled in on stretchers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli television interviewed a man, identified as Yaniv, who
described the blast near Ras al-Sultan.
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting in a restaurant and suddenly heard a very powerful
blast," the man said. "The electricity went out and rocks were jolted
by the blast," he added. "We then saw a second explosion not far from
the first blast; it was a ball of fire higher on the mountain. We
immediately drove over to the site and found wounded people on the
ground, there were Israelis among them, they were bleeding in the
sand and there was no one there to help them." The warning about
possible attacks came in an unusual public alert from Avi Dichter,
head of the Shin Bet intelligence service, not to go to Sinai resorts
during the harvest festival season of Sukkot, which began last week.
He said there was intelligence about a possible attack against
Israeli tourists in Egypt's Sinai, where as many as 12,000 Israelis
were traveling for the holidays, according to the Israeli Foreign
Ministry. Since his warning, Israel has moved in force into the Gaza
Strip that borders Egypt, trying to stop militant Palestinians like
Hamas and Islamic Jihad from firing rockets into Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli officials suggested that an attack of this magnitude
would have been planned carefully from within Egypt and was not tied
to the Gaza operation. Hamas, which has improving relations with
Cairo, may not want to embarrass Egypt in this way, said Oded Granot,
an Israeli commentator on Arab affairs. He suggested that al-Qaida,
an offshoot of the group or an Egyptian radical group might be
responsible. In November 2002, attackers drove a car bomb into a
hotel popular with Israelis in Mombasa, Kenya, killing 13, and fired
missiles at an Israeli charter jet, but missed the target.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials speculated Thursday night that militants, finding
it increasingly hard to attack Israelis in Israel, are choosing to
attack them abroad. They may also be trying to cause strains between
Israel and Egypt, which are trying to cooperate on the Israeli
government plan for a withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israel also regularly complains that Egypt should do more to stop the
smuggling of arms into Gaza and that Cairo does not take its security
responsibilities seriously enough.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians say that Israel would best protect itself by making
serious progress toward peace with the Palestinians, rather than by
accelerating the cycle of violence. But Egypt will not want the
Israeli-Palestinian struggle to spill across the border and is
expected by Israeli officials to move quickly to try to track down
those responsible.
</P>
<P>
The attacks may also be intended to damage Egypt's tourism industry,
on which it depends heavily. In 1997, after militants attacked
tourists in Luxor and killed nearly 70 people, Egypt cracked down
hard on Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government at first suggested the Hilton explosion was
caused by gas canisters and initially prevented Israeli rescue
workers without passports from crossing the border to the hotel. The
Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, spoke with the Egyptian
president, Hosni Mubarak, and persuaded him to allow Israeli rescue
workers to the scene without delay.
</P>
<P>
Yuval Steinitz, chairman of Parliament's foreign and defense
committee, said: "What is sad is the fact that over recent months we
have received incessant warnings concerning a possible attack in
Sinai, and these warnings grew more and more clear, but the public
failed to listen."
</P>
<P>
Taba is a small village dominated by the Hilton, originally built by
the Israelis. Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt in 1982 but claimed
that Taba was inside Israel according to the international border.
International arbitrators disagreed, and Israel returned Taba, along
with the expensive hotel, to Egypt in March 1989. Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators have met numerous times at the hotel for
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told similar stories of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Elkhin told Israeli Channel 10: "After the blast, parts of the
wall and ceiling began to crumble. I ran to look for my friends and
found them downstairs in the casino. I pulled them out and we managed
to leave the hotel. The walls around us collapsed, and there was fire
around." Standing outside the hotel, he said, "we watched as the
rooms disappeared, they collapsed one after the other."
</P>
<P>
When asked if he wasn't afraid to travel to Sinai, Elkhin said: "I
heard the alerts and warnings, but I never believed anything could
ever happen there, because, after all, every one there is Israeli.
</P>
<P>
"Still," he said, "it happened."
