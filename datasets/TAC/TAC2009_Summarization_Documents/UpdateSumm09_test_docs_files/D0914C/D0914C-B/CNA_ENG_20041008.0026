New York Times: Death toll is uncertain
after three explosions strike resort towns.

Three explosions shook three Egyptian Sinai resorts popular with
vacationing Israelis on Thursday night. There were conflicting
reports on the number of casualties. Egypt said at least 30 people
were killed, including 12 Egyptians. But an Israeli official later
said he could confirm only 14 or 15 dead, including five or six
Israelis. Earlier, Israel Radio had reported that at least 35 people
were killed and more than 100 wounded.

Wall Street Journal: Blasts in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula kill at
least 21, injure scores.

Blasts from a car bomb and a suicide bomber tore through a resort
hotel in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula where Israelis were vacationing at
the end of a Jewish holiday Thursday night, officials said. There
were at least 19 dead and the toll was likely to rise.
