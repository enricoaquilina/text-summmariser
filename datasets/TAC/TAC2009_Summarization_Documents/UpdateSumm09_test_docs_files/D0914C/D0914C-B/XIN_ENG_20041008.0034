At least 12 people were killed and 135 others injured in three blasts
that targeted tourist resorts in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, the
Interior Ministry said in a statement early Friday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The explosions came one month after the Israeli government urged
citizens not to visit Egypt, citing a terror threat to tourists in
the area.
</P>
<P>
The warning, issued on Sept. 9 by the counter-terrorism center of
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's office, identified Sinai as the target
of a potential attack.
</P>
<P>
A huge car-bombing rocked the Hilton hotel in Egypt's Red Sea resort
of Taba late Thursday. The explosion was followed by two smaller
blasts at resort towns of Nuwaiba and Ras al-Sultan in Sinai, dozens
of kilometers southwest of Taba.
