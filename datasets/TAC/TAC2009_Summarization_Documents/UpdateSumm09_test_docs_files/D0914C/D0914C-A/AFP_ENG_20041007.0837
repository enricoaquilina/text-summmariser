<P>
Suspected car bombs ripped through a hotel and two beachside tourist
sites on the Red Sea coast of Egypt's Sinai desert late Thursday,
killing at least 30 people, most of them Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"We know dozens of Israelis have been killed," an Israeli police
source said after a massive explosion devastated the Hilton hotel in
Taba, a tiny town just across the border from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Tourism Minister Ahmed al-Maghrabi put the toll at more than
30 dead and 100 wounded from the three explosions in Taba and two
other resorts on the south Sinai coast, an area popular with Israeli
holidaymakers.
</P>
<P>
The explosions occurred as Israelis were celebrating the end of the
Jewish holiday of Sukkot, and followed intelligence warnings that
Israelis should keep out of the Sinai because of possible attacks.
</P>
<P>
Ambulances were shuttling across the border checkpoint between Taba
and the Israeli resort of Eilat, where hospital staff wheeled in
bloodied victims, including children, on stretchers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli investigators believe a powerful car bomb detonated near the
entrance to the four-star Hilton, destroying much of the building.
Some debris from the vehicle used has been found by investigators,
Israeli radio said.
</P>
<P>
South Sinai governor General Mustafa Afifi said two charred trucks
were found at the two tourist camps of Shitani and Ras Soltan on the
coast road of the desert peninsula south of Taba, suggesting that the
blasts were also caused by car bombs.
</P>
<P>
"At this time of year, most guests at the Taba hotel are Israelis,
along with a small number of Egyptians and some tourists of other
nationalities," Maghrabi told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Egypt threw up a security cordon around the blast sites in the Sinai
-- renowned for its dramatic desert mountains and palm-fringed
beaches -- and boosted airport security in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
A previously unknown Islamist group claimed responsibility for the
Hilton blast in a telephone call to AFP in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Jamaa Al-Islamiya Al-Alamiya (World Islamist Group) claims
responsibility for the explosion at the Taba hotel, carried out in
revenge for the Palestinian and Arab martyrs dying in Palestine and
Iraq," the caller said.
</P>
<P>
The explosions came amid a massive Israeli army offensive in the
north of the Gaza Strip, a wedge of land near the border with Egypt,
that has left 93 Palestinians dead in less than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
"I am standing in front of the hotel. I heard a big explosion about
30 minutes ago that smashed all the windows. The power went off," a
witness who gave his name as Eitan told Israeli radio.
</P>
<P>
Resorts dotted along the Sinai's desert coast have remained popular
holiday spots for Israelis since the territory was handed back to
Egypt as part of a 1979 peace deal, the first between Israel and an
Arab countryis were continuing to flock to the Sinai despite the
warnings. The Jerusalem Post estimated that over the past summer
alone, around 300,000 Israelis took holidays in Sinai, replacing
Turkey as Israelis' most popular tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
Avi Dichter, the head of Israel's Shin Beth domestic security agency,
told the cabinet on September 19 that prompt action had thwarted a
plot by Palestinian militant group Hamas to strike Israeli tourists
in the Sinai.
</P>
<P>
Hamas had threatened to strike Israeli targets abroad after the
killing of a top militant in the Syrian capital of Damascus last
month that was blamed on Israel.
