<P>
A blast ripped through the Hilton hotel in Egypt's Red Sea resort of
Taba on Thursday evening, with medical sources saying at least 100
people had been killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
The blast, the reasons for which were not immediately clear, killed
or wounded at least 100 people of different nationalities, an
Egyptian hospital source said.
</P>
<P>
At least 23 Israelis were killed in the blast, Egyptian police said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli radio reported that the blast was likely an attack, with an
Israeli foreign ministry saying it could have been a car bomb attack,
although the Egyptian public TV had earlier said the blast was due to
a gas leak.
</P>
<P>
"An explosion caused by gas took place at a Taba hotel," Al-Akhbar
news channel said, without citing its sources.
</P>
<P>
"From the first information that we have received it could have been
a car bomb attack," a senior Israeli foreign ministry official told
AFP, requesting anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the hotel blast, a second explosion was heard in the
Sinai desert region of Nuaiba, between the Red Sea resorts of Taba
and Sharm el-Sheikh, an Egyptian police source said.
</P>
<P>
"At least seven people have been brought to the emergency room, one
of them seriously wounded," Coby Arad of Yosseftal hospital in Eilat,
across the border in Israel, told public radio.
</P>
<P>
But he said the number of casualties was likely to rise.
</P>
<P>
"I am standing in front of the hotel. I heard a big explosion about
30 minutes ago that smashed all the windows. The power went off," an
Israeli witness who gave his name as Eitan, told the radio.
</P>
<P>
Israeli intelligence services have been warning Israeli holidaymakers
to keep out of the Sinai desert, where Taba is located. Israelis on
Thursday night wound up the Jewish holidays of Sukkot.
