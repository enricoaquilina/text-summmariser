Three explosions shook popular resorts on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula on
Thursday night as many Israelis vacationed at the close of a Jewish
holiday. Hospital officials said at least 29 people were killed, and
witnesses gave unconfirmed reports that all three explosions were
caused by car bombs.

Egyptian security officials said there was no evidence of terrorism,
but Israel's army radio said officials believed the Taba explosion
was a car bomb, and witnesses at the other two sites told relatives
that cars had exploded.
