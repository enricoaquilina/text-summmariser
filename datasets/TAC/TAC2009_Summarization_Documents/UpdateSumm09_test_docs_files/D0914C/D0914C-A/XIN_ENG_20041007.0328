In the wake of three explosions that had killed at least 35 people in
Egypt's Sinai Desert, Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom on
Friday asked his Egyptian counterpart to help rescue Israeli wounded.
</P>
<P>
Quickly after the blasts, Shalom asked for Egyptian permission to
allow Israelis to pass through the border without checks and to fly
rescue workers into the Sinai.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel wants to send between 20 and 30 buses to the Sinai to
bring home some 15,000 Israelis still staying there.
</P>
<P>
After the explosions, the anti-terror unit in the Prime Minister's
Office called on all Israelis to leave Sinai immediately, and return
to Israel, Israeli Army Radio reported.

<P>
An explosion ripped through the Hilton Hotel in the Egyptian resort
town of Taba in the Sinai Desert on Thursday evening, close to the
border with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Police said that at least 30 people had been killed in the
blast, mostly Israeli tourists. A source at Taba Hospital said that
114 people had been wounded.
</P>
<P>
Two other blasts occurred about two hours later at nearby resort
towns of Ras Satan, a camping area full of Israeli tourists, and
Nueiba, witnesses said. Five people were killed in the twin blasts,
and Egyptian television said 43 people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Many Israelis have visited Egypt over the past month, during the
period of Jewish holidays. Last month, the defense establishment
cautioned Israelis against traveling to Sinai, following warnings of
a potential terrorist attack.
