Suspected car bombs ripped through beach resorts packed with Israeli
tourists on the Red Sea coast of Egypt's Sinai desert late Thursday,
killing at least 30 people and causing carnage and chaos.
</P>
<P>
"We know dozens of Israelis have been killed," an Israeli police
source said after a massive explosion devastated the vast Hilton
hotel in Taba at the main border crossing point between Egypt and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Tourism Minister Ahmed al-Maghrabi put the toll at more than
30 dead and 100 wounded from the three explosions in Taba and two
other resorts on the south Sinai coast.
</P>
<P>
The explosions occurred as Israelis were celebrating the end of the
Jewish holiday of Sukkot, and followed intelligence warnings that
Israelis should keep out of the Sinai because of possible attacks.
</P>
<P>
Ambulances were shuttling across the border checkpoint between Taba
and the Israeli resort of Eilat, where hospital staff wheeled in
bloodied victims, including children, on stretchers.
</P>
<P>
"There was a terrible explosion. In a matter of seconds everything
had collapsed, it was awful," said Liron, a 24-year-old Israeli
woman.
</P>
<P>
"I saw bodies thrown into the sea," one firefighter told journalists
after helping put out the fire at the Israeli-built hotel. "There was
bloody everywhere."
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said the explosion was caused by a powerful car bomb
detonated near the entrance to the four-star Hilton, destroying a
wing of the building.
</P>
<P>
South Sinai governor General Mustafa Afifi said two charred trucks
were found at the Shitani and Ras Soltan camps on the coast road
south of Taba, indicating that the blasts were also caused by car
bombs.
</P>
<P>
Egypt threw up a security cordon around the blast sites in the Sinai
-- renowned for its dramatic desert mountains and palm-fringed
beaches -- and boosted airport security in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
A previously unknown Islamist group claimed responsibility for the
Hilton blast in a telephone call to AFP in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Jamaa Al-Islamiya Al-Alamiya (World Islamist Group) claims
responsibility for the explosion at the Taba hotel, carried out in
revenge for the Palestinian and Arab martyrs dying in Palestine and
Iraq," the caller said.
</P>
<P>
The explosions came amid a massive Israeli army offensive in the
north of the Gaza Strip, a wedge of land near the border with Egypt,
that has left 93 Palestinians dead in less than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Resorts dotted along the Sinai's desert coast have remained popular
holiday spots for Israelis since the territory was handed back to
Egypt as part of a 1979 peace deal, the first between Israel and an
Arab country.
</P>
<P>
But Taba, which in ancient times was once a resting point for
caravans en route to the Fort of Aqaba, was excluded from Israel's
1982 handover of the Sinai and was only returned in 1989 after years
of wrangling following a ruling by the International Court of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
Ties between  security agency, told the cabinet on September 19 that
prompt action had thwarted a plot by Palestinian militant group Hamas
to strike Israeli tourists in the Sinai.
</P>
<P>
Hamas had threatened to strike Israeli targets abroad after the
killing of a top militant in the Syrian capital of Damascus last
month that was blamed on Israel.
