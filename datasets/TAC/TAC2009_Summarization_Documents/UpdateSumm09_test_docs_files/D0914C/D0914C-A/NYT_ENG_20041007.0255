<P>
Three explosions shook three Egyptian Red Sea resorts popular with
vacationing Israelis on Thursday night, killing at least 35 people
and wounding about 100, according to officials from Egypt, Israel and
nearby hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said they believed the blasts were caused by
terrorist bombs.
</P>
<P>
In the largest explosion, early reports suggested that a truck bomb
may have been driven into the Taba Hilton, a large concrete resort
hotel in a little village just across the Israeli border and near the
Israeli resort town of Eilat. The Hilton was badly damaged by the
blast and an ensuing fire, and 10 floors in part of the complex
collapsed. There were reports of people buried in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
The two other explosions took place to the southwest, in the resort
villages of Ras al-Sultan and Nuweiba. At least seven people died at
Ras al-Sultan, most of them Egyptian workers, according to the
Egyptian media. There was no other immediate information about
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israeli intelligence warned Israelis to keep out of the
Sinai desert, citing vague but solid information about possible
attacks.
</P>
<P>
No definitive claims of responsibility were publicized, thought
Agence France-Presse reported that someone claiming to be from a
previously unknown group, Jamaa Al-Islamiya Al-Alamiya, or World
Islamist Group, had taken responsibility for the Hilton blast in a
telephone call to its bureau in Jerusalem. The caller said the attack
was "in revenge for the Palestinian and Arab martyrs dying in
Palestine and Iraq," the agency reported.

Part of the Hilton apparently crumbled immediately after the blast.
"I heard a huge explosion," said Yigal Vakni, an Israeli at the
Hilton who spoke to Israeli Army Radio. "The wall near me collapsed
and people began to run." The blast was outside, he said. "When we
went out we saw the shops and the internal wall of the hotel had
collapsed." Many people were lying on the ground, he said: "There is
a lot of blood, a lot of screaming."
</P>
<P>
An unidentified Israeli woman told Israeli television: "We
immediately ran toward the beach, everyone running at once, and
windows continue to shatter as we ran away. Entire families were
wounded; they ran to the beach and were covered with blood."
</P>

Panicked Israelis rushed the border post, trying to flee Egypt,
yelling at the border guards in Arabic that their belongings and
documents were still in the burning hotel. Guards fired shots into
the air to try to disperse them, before finally shutting the terminal
temporarily. Roads were blocked, leaving vacationing Israelis at
other hotels trapped. Hadas Manor, an Israeli journalist staying at
another Taba hotel, told Israeli television: "Most of the people here
haven't come with their cars, so they depend on Egyptian taxis that
are not operating now."
</P>
<P>
Television footage at the border showed an Arab Israeli woman being
carried by her husband. As he put her down, she collapsed, and medics
rushed to her. Israeli television also showed scenes of ambulances
arriving at Eilat hospitals and unloading the injured, many of them
bandaged and bloody. Others, apparently in shock, were wheeled in on
stretchers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli television interviewed a man who described the blast near Ras
al-Sultan. "We were sitting in a restaurant and suddenly heard a very
powerful blast," the man, identified only as Yaniv, said. "The
electricity went out and rocks were jolted by the blast. We then saw
a second explosion not far from the first blast; it was a ball of
fire higher on the mountain. We immediately drove over to the site
and found wounded people on the ground. There were Israelis among
them, they were bleeding in the sand and there was no one there to
help them."
</P>
<P>
The warning about possible attacks came in an unusual public alert
from Avi Dichter, the head of the Shin Bet intelligence service, not
to go to Sinai resorts during the harvest festival season of Sukkot,
when Israel shuts down. He said there was vague but solid
intelligence about a possible attack against Israeli tourists in
Egypt's Sinai, where as many as 12,000 Israelis were traveling for
the holidays, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. The holiday
this year began last week and ends Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since his warning, Israel has moved in force into the Gaza Strip that
borders Egypt, trying to stop militant Palestinians like Hamas and
Islamic Jihad from firing rockets into Israel. Hamas has vowed
retaliation against Israel and Israelis for the assassination of two
of its leaders this year.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli officials suggested that an attack of this magnitude
would have been planned carefully from within Egypt and was not tied
to the Gaza operation. Hamas, which has improving relations with
Cairo, may not want to embarrass Egypt in this way, said Oded Granot,
a commentator on Arab affairs. He suggested that al-Qaida, an
offshoot or an Egyptian radical group might be responsible.
</P>
<P>
In November 2002, attackers drove a car bomb into a resort hotel
popular with Israelis in Mombasa, Kenya, killing 12, and fired
missiles at an Israeli charter jet, which only narrowly missed their
target.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials speculated Thursday night that militants, finding
it increasingly difficult to attack Israelis in Israel itself, are
choosing to attack them abroad. The militants may also be trying to
cause further strains between Israel and Egypt, which are trying to
cooperate on the Israeli government plan for a unilateral withdrawal
from the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israel also regularly complains that Egypt should do more to stop the
smuggling of arms into Gaza and that Cairo does not take its security
responsibilities seriously enough.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians say that Israel would best protect itself by making
serious progress toward peace with the Palestinians, rather than by
accelerating the cycle of violence. But Egypt will not want the
Israeli-Palestinian struggle to spill across the border and is
expected by Israeli officials to move quickly to try to track down
those responsible.
</P>
<P>
The attacks may also be intended to damage Egypt's tourism industry,
on which it depends heavily. In 1997, after radicals attacked
tourists in Luxor and killed nearly 70 people, Egypt cracked down
hard on Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government at first suggested the Hilton explosion was
caused by gas canisters and initially prevented Israeli rescue
workers without passports from crossing the border to the hotel. The
Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, spoke with the Egyptian
president, Hosni Mubarak, and persuaded him to allow Israeli rescue
workers to the scene without delay.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Yuval Steinitz, the chairman of parliament's foreign and defense
committee, said: "What is sad is the fact that over recent months we
have received incessant warnings concerning a possible attack in
Sinai, and these warnings grew more and more clear, but the public
failed to listen."
</P>
<P>
Taba is a small village dominated by the Hilton, originally built by
the Israelis. Israel returned the Sinai to Egypt in 1982 but claimed
that Taba was inside Israel according to the international border.
International arbitrators disagreed, and Israel returned Taba, along
with the expensive hotel, to Egypt in March 1989. Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators have met numerous times at the hotel for
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses told similar stories. Hassan Elkhin told Israeli channel
10: "After the blast, parts of the wall and ceiling began to crumble.
I ran to look for my friends and found them downstairs in the casino.
I pulled them out and we managed to leave the hotel. The walls around
us collapsed, and there was fire around." Standing outside the hotel,
he said, "we watched as the rooms disappeared, they collapsed one
after the other."
</P>
<P>
When asked if he wasn't afraid to travel to Sinai, Elkhin said: "I
heard the alerts and warnings, but I never believed anything could
ever happen there, because, after all, every one there is Israeli.
</P>
<P>
"Still," he said, "it happened."
