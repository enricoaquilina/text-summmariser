was passed on last Monday by China's National People's Congress to
prevent the secession of Taiwan from China.

In Latin America, the Bolivia-China parliamentarian friendship 
group sent a letter  Tuesday to Wu Bangguo, chairman of China's 
NPC Standing Committee, expressing its support for the newly 
adopted law.

It said the one-China principal has been affirmed by United 
Nations resolutions, and that the Taiwan question is China's 
internal affair and should not be interfered by any foreign 
countries.

In Saint Lucia, both Hilford Deterville, President of Senate,

parliament supports China's efforts to defend national sovereignty
and territorial integrity.

"There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an 
inalienable part of China," she said.

What China has done will be conducive to helping maintain peace
and stability in the Taiwan Straits, the Asia-Pacific region and 
the world at large, said Mensah-Williams.
