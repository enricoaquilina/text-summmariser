Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said 
here Monday that the Anti-Secession law has been made to 
strengthen and advance ties across the Taiwan Straits, instead of 
being a war mobilization order.

The Anti-Secession Law aims to strengthen and advance relations
across the Taiwan Straits and aims at maintaining peace, Wen told 
Chinese and foreign journalists who covered the just-ended annual 
parliament session.

It does not target the Taiwan compatriots, nor is it a law on 
war against Taiwan, he said, adding that the law states clearly it
aims to promote exchanges between the people on both sides of the 
Taiwan Straits, encourage and facilitate economic cooperation, the
three "direct links", as well as exchanges in various fields 
including education, science and technology and culture.
