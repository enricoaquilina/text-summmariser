The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) condemned Beijing Monday for
passing the Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan, saying the law is
causing irreparable damage to the development of cross-strait
relations.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, the DPP caucus condemned the move as
severely infringing upon the freedom, dignity and security of the
Taiwan people, and urged the Taiwan people to spare no efforts in
denouncing it.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Republic of China is an independent
sovereign state belonging to the 23 million people of Taiwan. Any
move to change Taiwan's status quo, if not agreed upon by the Taiwan
people through a democratic referendum, is unacceptable, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are two
separate political entities, it said, adding that the fact that the
ROC government exercises exclusive sovereignty in the Taiwan area
should be respected by the PRC and the international community as
well.
</P>
<P>
The DPP caucus called for the international community to denounce
Beijing's Anti-Secession Law, saying that the law authorizes
"non-peaceful means" against Taiwan and is poised to escalate
cross-strait tension and undermine stability in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
The law also goes against the U.N. Charter's aim of safeguarding
world peace and runs counter to the universal values of freedom,
democracy and human rights, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally
party of the ruling DPP, have decided to hold a 24-hour hunger strike
beginning 4 p.m. Monday to express their vehement opposition to
Beijing's passage of the Anti-Secession Law.
</P>
<P>
The sit-in -- to be staged by TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang,
ranking TSU officials and major party members -- is also aimed at
urging President Chen Shui-bian to immediately initiate a nationwide
defensive referendum, TSU legislative party whip Lo Chih-ming said.
</P>
<P>
Lo said that the Executive Yuan should designate March 14 as
"Taiwan Anti-Aggression Day" to mark the day that China passed a law
to try to legitimatize its suppression of Taiwan's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government should immediately close all
communication channels with China and freeze all exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait to prevent Taiwan from "falling into China's trap."
