BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua)

<P>
The proposed anti-secession law, 
which will be deliberated by China's top legislature, the National
People's Congress (NPC), at its upcoming annual full session, is 
by no means a so-called "law on the use of force against Taiwan", 
nor a so-called "war mobilization order", a spokesman for the NPC 
session said here Friday.
