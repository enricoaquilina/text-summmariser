Mainland China is pushing Taiwan to decide
through a referendum whether to "separate from the mainland" if it
makes the "one country, two systems" or "one China" principle a part
of its proposed anti-secession law, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman
Joseph Wu said Tuesday.

<P>
Speaking with a group of pro-Taiwan independence activists, Wu
said Taiwan will have no choice other than to ask its people to
decide in a referendum whether to unite with the mainland on
Beijing's terms of "one country, two systems" or whether to accept
the "one China" principle if Beijing enshrines either of them in its
proposed law.
</P>
<P>
He warned Beijing that the enactment of the so-called
"anti-secession law" is a provocation and an attempt to change the
status quo across the Taiwan Strait, which Taiwan will not tolerate.
</P>
<P>
The pro-independence activists called on the government to
respond strongly to Beijing's proposal to enact an anti-secession law
designed to frighten Taiwan into giving up moves toward independence.
