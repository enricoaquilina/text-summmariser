An official of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said Wednesday that the government will closely
monitor developments in mainland China's communications with the
United States about its plan to enact an anti-secession law.
</P>
<P>
MAC Deputy Chairman Chiu Tai-shan made the remarks a day after
Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under Beijing's
State Council, arrived in Washington to discuss with U.S. officials
the details of the planned anti-secession law targeting Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's plan to promulgate an anti-secession law is not
only a tremendous provocation of Taiwan but also a unilateral move to
change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, Chiu told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said that the MAC, the top agency in charge of Taiwan's
policies toward the mainland, has expressed on public occasions its
strong opposition to the legislation aimed at legalizing Beijing's
invasion of the country.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan is not part of the People's Republic of
China as the Beijing authorities claim, Chiu said this is also the
feeling of a majority of the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Michel Lu, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, said that officials of the Republic of China representative
office in the United States will keep a close eye on developments.
</P>
<P>
The government will also continue to express its opposition to
the proposed anti-secession law, which, if passed, would offer a
legal basis for Beijing to use force against Taiwan, Lu went on.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC)
agreed in late December to submit the draft bill to a NPC plenary
session for deliberation in March this year.
