The United States hopes mainland China will
put off its plan to enact an "anti-secession law" to help temper the
tension across the Taiwan Strait, an American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT) official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Raymond F. Greene, chief of the political section at the AIT's
Taipei office, made the remarks during a visit to the legislative
caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), according to
Lai Ching-teh, one of the caucus leaders.
</P>
<P>
Greene expressed concern about the DPP's attitude toward the
"anti-secession law" and whether it will promote a law to counteract
it, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed worry that cross-strait tension will escalate
as a result of the enactment of the law and any move by Taiwan to
retaliate, Lai said.
</P>
<P>
Lai told Greene that the DPP has repeatedly displayed goodwill to
Beijing to try to improve cross-strait relations but it has to show
its resolve to defend Taiwan's sovereignty in the face of the
mainland's plan to introduce the "anti-secession law."
</P>
<P>
While the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, will
organize a demonstration for this purpose Feb. 28, they are likely to
cooperate to propose a piece of counteracting legislation after the
"anti-secession law" is passed, Lai said.

<P>
Asked whether the "anti-secession law" is the reason behind the
United States' and Japan's recent decision to list "encouraging the
peaceful resolution of issues concerning the Taiwan Strait through
dialogue" part of their common strategic objectives in the region,
Greene said Washington has a long-standing concern over peace in the
Asia-Pacific region and that this concern will not change because of
the "anti-secession law," according to Lai.
</P>
<P>
Also during the visit, Greene expressed the hope that the
Legislative Yuan will pass the budget for a NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.23 billion) arms procurement package from the United States
within this session.
