<P>
US authorities on Monday urged airlines to step up their passenger
security checks, after a Washington-bound Air France flight from
Paris was diverted when US officials learned that a passenger was in
their "no-fly" list.
</P>
<P>
US authorities asked that the Boeing 777 carrying 263 people be
diverted to Bangor, in the northeastern state of Maine, late Saturday
after discovering that a passenger was on the list of people deemed a
security risk.
</P>
<P>
"We want the airlines to be more diligent about doing the checks," US
Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security Asa Hutchinson
said after a meeting with EU officials.
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson recalled that US authorities were preparing to test a new
system dubbed "Secure Flight" that will allow them to compare the
list of passengers with the no-fly list.
</P>
<P>
"We need urgently the new system of Secure Flight to avoid" incidents
like the one that occurred Saturday, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the number of people barred from entering the United
States has sharply increased.
</P>
<P>
A similar incident involving British singer Yusuf Islam, formerly
known as Cat Stevens, occurred in September, when his
Washington-bound flight from London was diverted to Bangor.
</P>
<P>
The singer, who gave up his successful pop career in the late 1970s
and converted to Islam, was deported back to Britain after being
denied entry into the United States on security concerns.
