FAKE NEWS: MORE POPULAR, AND TRUSTED, THAN EVER

Midway through live analysis of the presidential debate on "The Daily
Show" on Thursday night, the host, Jon Stewart, called on his
"correspondents" in the field for some in-depth analysis.
</P>
<P>
"Ed, how are the Kerry people feeling?"
</P>
<P>
"Ecstatic, Jon," came the response. "Kerry's people couldn't be
happier. Their candidate went up against a sitting war president
who's never lost a debate and held his own."
</P>
<P>
"OK," Stewart said. "And Rob, what's the mood at the Bush camp?"
</P>
<P>
"Triumph, Jon," the correspondent said. "Orgasmic triumph. Their man
faced off against John Kerry, a golden-tongued virtuoso of words and
captain of the Yale debate team. He's been honing his oratorical
skills since the age of 3, and the way they see it, by not allowing
himself to be reduced to tears, the president was the big winner
tonight."
</P>
<P>
The exchange -- which ended with the Bush campaign "correspondent"
pleading "You gotta re-elect him!" -- was a clever evisceration both
of the shallowness of campaign spin and of the news media's capacity
for buying that spin, and ran on Comedy Central the same evening when
the campaign spin doctors were earnestly toiling away on other
networks. Just to make sure there was no misunderstanding, during a
commercial break, Stewart offered a reminder to the guffawing
audience in his studio on West 54th Street. "Remember," he said
gravely. "We are not actual newspeople."
</P>
<P>
Fake news is certainly the comic trope of the moment. Besides "The
Daily Show," Ali G uses the news talk show format to absurd ends,
mocking politicians, celebrities and panels of self-proclaimed
experts. The humorist Andy Borowitz files daily stories in perfect
news-service deadpan on his Web site, www.BorowitzReport.com. The
phony newspaper The Onion is expanding its print operation to new
cities.
</P>
<P>
And in a strange turnabout, mainstream news outlets have been
clamoring to introduce news satire to their programming, never mind
that mainstream news is often what is being mocked. The ABC news
magazine "Prime Time Live" recently began closing the program with a
two-minute musical rendition of satirical headlines. Mo Rocca,
formerly of "The Daily Show," played the role of wisecracking on-air
correspondent for "Larry King Live" during the political conventions.
And Borowitz is a regular on CNN and appears alongside straight-faced
legal experts on Court TV.
</P>
<P>
"Today I spent an hour on Court TV talking about the Peterson case,
and I don't know anything about the Peterson case," Borowitz said on
Wednesday. "It's perfectly appropriate on mainstream news shows now
to have a satirist in the mix."
</P>
<P>
Satirists, perhaps not surprisingly, are loath to talk earnestly
about what they do; Stewart is particularly averse to speaking
seriously about humor. But when pressed, most say their opening has
come because of a polarized electorate that suspects the media of
doing the other side's bidding, coupled with high-profile
journalistic scandals.
</P>
<P>
Let down, perhaps, by the mainstream media, 21 percent of people
under 30 say they are learning about the campaign from satirical
sources like "The Daily Show" and the late-night television
monologues, up from 9 percent in 2000, according to a Pew Research
Center study released in January. Comedy Central mocked CNN's motto
-- "The most trusted name in news" -- and Walter Cronkite's onetime
reputation (as America's most trusted man) on a billboard during the
Republican National Convention, which proclaimed "The Daily Show" as
"the most trusted name in fake news."
</P>
<P>
"This is big because there is this gigantic imbalance and something
has got to fill it," said the cultural critic Neal Gabler, who is
obsessed with "The Daily Show." "Young people get the attitude, the
deflationary truth-telling attitude of these shows because they can't
find it elsewhere," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rocca agreed. "The premise of any joke delivered by oddball
newscasters is that they're making fun of the media's treatment of
news as much as they are the subjects of the news," he said. "And if
there's one thing that everyone can agree on, it's that, right or
wrong, they hate the press."
</P>
<P>
Once they have the audience's sympathies, fake news purveyors have a
simple task: be funny.
</P>
<P>
"A well-told joke that has a Republican target, if it's clever
enough, gets Republicans to laugh too," Rocca said.
</P>
<P>
News satire of course is a time-tested gag. Mark Twain wrote fake
news stories, and they were a staple of The National Lampoon in the
1970s. The television era has produced a steady supply of news spoofs
like "Not Necessarily the News," "That Was the Week That Was" and
"Weekend Update" on "Saturday Night Live." But even the satirists
themselves confess to being surprised by the sudden market for their
craft.
</P>
<P>
"When I got out of school everyone wanted to write for sitcoms,"
Borowitz said. "The idea that you could have a career as a prose
satirist. It's hard to imagine that even five years ago." The latest
evidence of the shift: "America (The Book)" by Stewart and "Daily
Show" colleagues, a spoof of a civics textbook, will appear as No. 1
on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list of Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
Of course no self-respecting satirist would take credit for anything
so profound as affecting the political discourse, or even to having a
political point of view. Asked about the politics of writers for "The
Daily Show," Ben Karlin, the executive producer, insisted, "We have
no agenda other than holding on to our cushy, high-paying, basic
cable jobs."
</P>
<P>
As for the Pew study crediting shows like his for teaching a fifth of
young Americans about politics, Karlin said he was dubious. For one
thing, he said, the audience could not possibly get the jokes if it
did not already know the news stories that were being spoofed.
"People are getting their news from the tops of taxi cabs, from
sluglines on Yahoo and from accidentally stopping on CNN," he said.
</P>
<P>
The hyped-up news cycle has been a boon to the fake news racket. For
one thing, there is a steady flow of new material. And for another, a
more informed public means a bigger potential audience. When Cat
Stevens was barred from entering the country late last month after
showing up on a terrorist watch list, Borowitz said he sat down to
write a fake news story about it. "You don't have to start by saying
to the audience, 'See, there was this singer-songwriter from the '70s
named Cat Stevens,"' he said. "In comedy parlance that was called the
set-up. Now you can go straight to the punch line." (Borowitz came up
with "Angry Cat Stevens Vows to Resume Singing: Broadcasts Threat on
Al-Jazeera.")
</P>
<P>
On its most basic level, news satire derives its humor from the
juxtaposition of earnest newspeak and the absurd. "Nothing is more
serious and pompous than a network news anchor or the earnest prose
style of a newspaper," Borowitz said. "The parody of the style
becomes a joke in and of itself."
</P>
<P>
The form of news satire on "The Daily Show" is more sophisticated,
mocking not just the style of the news but the conventions of
journalism; for example, the mainstream news media's fixation with
fairness.
</P>
<P>
"There's some weird handcuffs on the mainstream news so that they
feel that no matter what, they have to present both sides of the
argument, even if one side of an argument is wrong," Karlin said.
"The idea that we give the guilty an equal opportunity to defend
themselves -- we have no idea why."
</P>
<P>
On one fake newscast, Stewart asked a correspondent in the field for
his opinion on the Swift Boat veterans claims against Sen. John
Kerry. "My opinion?" the reporter responded. "I don't have opinions.
I'm a reporter, Jon. My job is to spend half the time repeating what
one side says, and half the time repeating the other. Little thing
called objectivity; might want to look it up."
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Although he is coy about his politics, Stewart seems to relish
mocking conservatives more than liberals, and at his studio on
Thursday night, the crowd of people in their 20s, divided almost
evenly between men and women, made no secret of their distaste for
President Bush while watching the debate on monitors before the show
began.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Michael Hoyt, the executive editor of the Columbia
Journalism Review, said that in some ways Stewart was providing a
counterbalance to the conservatism of the Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
"People are hungry for some sort of attitude and guidance through an
ocean of spin," he said. "Fox supplies it in one way, and Jon Stewart
in another. Both are reactions to distorted objectivity, what I call
a phony objectivity. They are pieces of the same puzzle."
</P>
<P>
Gabler said, "It's a form of humor that subverts media convention and
reveals the pomposities and idiocies of politicians, but even more
the pomposities and idiocies of the media that covers the
politicians."
</P>
<P>
All of which begs the question: What are programs like "Larry King
Live" and "Prime Time Live" hoping to accomplish by bringing news
satirists on board? Rocca's antics on "Larry King Live" during the
conventions this summer, while occasionally funny, only highlighted
the staid nature of the broadcast, and for his part, King seemed not
to know how to react, other than to laugh a bit too zealously at
Rocca's wisecracks.
</P>
<P>
Shelley Ross, the producer of "Prime Time Live" who came up with the
idea to do the musical news satire gag on her program, inspired by
"That was the Week That Was" in the 1960s, said she felt satire was a
proper response to searching times. "It represents a healthy
society," she said.
</P>
<P>
For his part Rocca said he considered his satirical bits a kind of
public service. "Television newscasts are so calcified and rigid, any
departure from that is exhilarating," he said. "And five minutes of
good satire is a lot more useful than an hour on J.Lo's baby shower."
