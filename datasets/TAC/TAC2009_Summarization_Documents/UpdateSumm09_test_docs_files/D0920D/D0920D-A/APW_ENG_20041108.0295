The singer once known as Cat Stevens, now a peace activist whose name
was on a U.S. list of people suspected of having terrorist links,
will receive a peace prize from a foundation headed by former Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, organizers said Monday.

The singer, now named Yusuf Islam, is expected to attend the ceremony
on Rome's Capitoline Hill on Wednesday, said Enzo Cursio, a spokesman
for the Gorbachev Foundation. Islam will receive the award from Rome
Mayor Walter Veltroni and Gorbachev, the spokesman said.

In September, the British musician was expelled from the United
States after authorities diverted his London-to-Washington flight to
Maine to remove him, saying he was suspected of ties to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He says he was a victim of an "unjust and arbitrary system," and that
he has denounced terrorism.

The "Man for Peace" award was being given to Islam "for his
dedication to promote peace, the reconciliation of people and to
condemn terrorism," said a press release by the Gorbachev Foundation
and Rome's City Hall.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony Wednesday will mark the opening of the fifth reunion of
Nobel Peace Prize laureates, a meeting organized every year in Rome
by the Gorbachev Foundation. The reunion ends Friday.

Other recipients of the "Man for Peace" award include Italian
actor-director Roberto Benigni, who won in 2002. Benigni is the
director of the Oscar-winning "Life is Beautiful."
