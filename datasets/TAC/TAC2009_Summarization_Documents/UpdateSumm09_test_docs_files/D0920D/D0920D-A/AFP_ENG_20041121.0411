US authorities diverted a Washington-bound Air France flight after
discovering that a passenger was part of a "no-fly" list of people
deemed a security risk, a US security official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The flight was diverted to Bangor, in the northeastern state of
Maine, late Saturday, said Transportation Security Administration
spokeswoman Yolanda Clark.
</P>
<P>
US Customs officials took the passenger into custody, as well as a
person who was traveling with the passenger on the no-fly list, Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
"The flight was diverted after it was learned that a passenger on the
no-fly list was onboard the aircraft, so out of an abundance of
caution TSA took swift action to divert the flight to Bangor, Maine,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The flight landed in Maine at 5:30 pm (2000 GMT) and headed back to
Washington's Dulles International Airport two hours later, Clark
added.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 777 had 263 passengers on board, an Air France spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
A similar incident involving British singer and peace activist Yusuf
Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens, occurred in September, when his
Washington-bound flight from London was diverted to Bangor.
</P>
<P>
The singer, who gave up his successful pop career in the late 1970s
and converted to Islam, was deported back to Britain after being
denied entry into the United States on "security grounds."
</P>
<P>
Time magazine reported that Islam's deportation was caused by a
spelling mixup over the name of "Yusuf Islam" on his passport and a
certain "Youssouf Islam" who is on US watch lists.
