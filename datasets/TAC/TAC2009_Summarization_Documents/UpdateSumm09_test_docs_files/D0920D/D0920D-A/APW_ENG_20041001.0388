Yusuf Islam vows to find out why he is banned from the United States
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Puzzled and angry at being barred from the United States, Yusuf
Islam, the singer formerly known as Cat Stevens, returned to London
vowing to find out why.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by a throng of reporters at Heathrow Airport on Thursday,
Islam said it was ludicrous that he's on Washington's no-fly list,
suspected of ties to terrorists, and said he would challenge the
decision to block him from entering the country.
</P>
<P>
"Half of me wants to smile, and half of me wants to growl. The whole
thing is totally ridiculous," said Islam, who had a string of hits in
the 1960s and '70s, but abandoned his music career after converting
to Islam.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows who I am. I am no secret figure. Everybody knows my
campaigning for charity, for peace. There's got to be a whole lot of
explanation."
</P>
<P>
Islam's United Airlines flight to Dulles International Airport was
diverted to Maine's Bangor International Airport when U.S. officials
reviewing the passenger list discovered he was aboard.
</P>
<P>
According to his Web site, the singer was last in the United States
two months ago with his record company. During a visit in May he met
with officials of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community
Initiatives "to talk about philanthropic work," according to White
House spokeswoman Claire Buchan.
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities provided few details about Islam's alleged
connection to terrorism or when he was added to the watch list.
</P>
<P>
Homeland Security spokesman Brian Doyle would only say that the
intelligence community has recently obtained information that
"further heightens concern" about Islam.
</P>
<P>
"Yusuf Islam has been placed on the watch lists because of activities
that could potentially be related to terrorism," Doyle said. "It's a
serious matter."
</P>
<P>
A second government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said U.S. authorities think donations from Islam may have ended up
helping to fund blind sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, convicted for a plot
to bomb New York City landmarks, and Hamas, a Palestinian militant
group considered a terrorist organization by the United States.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw complained Wednesday to U.S.
officials about their treatment of Islam, telling U.S. Secretary of
State Colin Powell "that this action should not have been taken," the
Foreign Office said. It was not clear whether Straw meant Islam's
detention, or his inclusion on the watch list.
</P>
<P>
Islam, who was traveling with his 21-year-old daughter, Maymanah,
told reporters in London he was treated well by FBI agents. He said
he was bound for Nashville to "initiate some recordings."
</P>
<P>
Islam said he had been well treated by U.S. officials. "The one
positive thing I can say is that a lot of security officers are
pleased because they got my autograph," he said.
</P>
<P>
"People make mistakes. I just hope they made a big mistake. We'll
see," he said.
</P>
<P>
A statement on Islam's Web site said he was seeking further
information from U.S. authorities "so that we can challenge the
decision to refuse him entry."
