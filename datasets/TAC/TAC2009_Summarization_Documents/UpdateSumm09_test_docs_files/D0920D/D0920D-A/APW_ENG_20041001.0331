International Red Cross says Britain does not hold women prisoners in
Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross insisted Friday that
Britain does not hold any women prisoners in Iraq, although the
demand of militants holding a British man hostage is that female
prisoners be freed.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC added that it was ready to act as a mediator to help free
Kenneth Bigley.
</P>
<P>
The British government said more than 100,000 leaflets had been
distributed in Baghdad containing a personal plea from Bigley's
family and an appeal to his captors to release him.
</P>
<P>
Bigley, an engineer, was kidnapped two weeks ago in Baghdad along
with two American colleagues who have since been beheaded. The
Islamic militants claiming responsibility for Bigley's abduction have
demanded the release of female Iraqi prisoners. The British
government has repeatedly stressed that it does not hold any.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military says it has two Iraqi women in custody _ Rihab
Rashid Taha, a scientist who became known as "Dr. Germ" for helping
Iraq make weapons with anthrax, and Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash, a
biotech researcher dubbed "Mrs. Anthrax."
</P>
<P>
The ICRC, which visits prisons around the world to monitor the
condition and treatment of prisoners, told The Associated Press that
it had repeatedly visited Britain's sole detention facility in Iraq,
near the southern city of Basra.
</P>
<P>
"We have repeatedly visited Shaiba, the only British detention place
in Iraq. There are no women detained there," said Rana Sidani at the
ICRC in Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Sidani said the ICRC did not have any contacts with the militant
group, controlled by Jordanian terror mastermind Abu Musab
al-Zarqawi, believed to be holding Bigley.
</P>
<P>
"We stand ready if we are contacted to mediate," she added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Thursday that Britain would not pay
a ransom or meet any political demands to secure Bigley's release.
</P>
<P>
"If we did not have this position there would be many, many more
people who would be kidnapped, and the world would be less safe,"
Straw told British Broadcasting Corp. television.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office said Friday that leaflets had been distributed in
the streets around 28 mosques in Baghdad. They contained messages
from Bigley's family and from prominent British Muslims, including
Yusuf Islam, the singer once known as Cat Stevens.
</P>
<P>
"I request you, in the name of Allah ... to release the British
citizen Ken Bigley for the good name of our religion and according to
the sayings of Allah in the Glorious Quran," said Islam, who was
taken off a Washington-bound plane last month and expelled from the
United States after his name turned up on a list of people suspected
of having terrorist links.
</P>
<P>
Britain has complained to the United States about the treatment, and
Islam has said he plans legal action against U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
"Our religion Islam does not allow us to harm the innocent," said the
Muslim Council of Britain's Iqbal Sacranie in the leaflet. "We urge
you to please listen to this appeal and release this man back into
the arms of his waiting family."
