'HIDE AND SEEK' TOPS BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The thriller "Hide and Seek" (20th Century Fox), starring Robert De
Niro, with Elisabeth Shue and Dakota Fanning, opened at No.
1 this weekend with an estimated $22 million in box
office receipts, pushing last week's top film, "Are We There
Yet?" (Sony), with $17 million, to No. 2. With two
Golden Globe awards and seven Oscar nominations, Clint Eastwood's "Million
Dollar Baby" made a grand entrance into most U.S. markets
this weekend with ticket sales of $11.8 million; the film
opened in just over 2,000 theaters on Friday, a big
jump from the 147 screens it had played on since
its limited release last month. (On Saturday in Los Angeles,
Eastwood won the top award from the Directors Guild of
America, a prize closely watched in Hollywood as an indicator
of the films and directors favored to win at the
Oscars, on Feb. 27.) Rounding out the box office Top
5 were Paramount's "Coach Carter" (No. 4, with $8 million
in receipts) and Universal's "Meet the Fockers" (No. 5, $7.6
million).

A REPRIEVE FOR 'EASTENDERS'
</P>
<P>
New York fans of "EastEnders," the British soap opera about a
group of working-class Londoners, have successfully raised the money required
to keep the show on the air in New York
for another year. At the beginning of the month, WLIW,
the Long Island PBS affiliate, announced it would cancel its
broadcasts of the BBC series but would stay the execution
if fans could raise $29,000 -- enough to pay a
year's licensing fees -- by Monday. Led by Larry Jaffee,
an Upper West Side resident and the publisher of a
fan magazine about "EastEnders," supporters of the series held three
fund-raising events: a raffle, a viewing party at SoHo House
and a get-together with Michelle Collins, a former cast member.
Jaffee said the combined efforts raised $33,692, which he would
deliver to WLIW on Monday. A spokeswoman for WLIW confirmed
that the station would honor the agreement to continue broadcasting
"EastEnders" for a year.

A BEETHOVEN PREMIERE
</P>
<P>
A fragment of an unknown piano concerto by Beethoven will have
its premiere in Rotterdam, Netherlands, this week. The eight-minute adagio
was written in 1789, when Beethoven was 19, and has
been reconstructed by musicologists from the composer's notes, which were
discovered in the British Museum, according to reports in the
news media. The first performance is Tuesday at the De
Doelen concert hall, with the pianist Ronald Brautigam and the
Rotterdam Chamber Orchestra. In 2003 that orchestra accomplished another Beethoven
feat, with the first performances in 160 years of a
movement from a lost oboe concerto.

POP CDS IN RELEASE
</P>
<P>
Except for one blockbuster album, the Game's "Documentary," January has been,
as usual, a slow month for new music. February looks
a little more exciting, with new albums by Brian McKnight,
3 Doors Down, Tori Amos, Kings of Leon, Krayzie Bone
and Iron and Wine. Tuesday's new releases include the Chicago
hip-hop crew Do or Die's CD/DVD package "D(AST)O(AST)D" (Atlantic), produced
by Kanye West, Scott Storch and others; the country singer
Nanci Griffith's "Hearts in Mind" (Universal), with guest spots by
Jimmy Buffett and Keith Carradine; Joe Cocker's "Heart and Soul"
(Universal), with Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck; the Cowboy Junkies'
"Open Road" (Rounder); the Italian-born jazz singer Chiara Civello's American
debut, "Last Quarter Moon" (Verve); and two releases by Seal:
the new album "Acoustic" and a double-disc collection, "Best: 1991-2004"
(both released by Warner Bros.).

HONORING A CELTIC FIDDLER
</P>
<P>
An impressive lineup of Celtic musicians will pay tribute this week
to Johnny Cunningham, the Scottish-born Celtic fiddler who died in
December 2003. His brother Phil Cunningham, an accordionist, will join
the singer Susan McKeown, the fiddler Kevin Burke, the multi-instrumentalist
Seamus Eagan and the guitarist Aidan Brennan in a five-city
tour beginning in Sellersville, Pa., on Thursday and arriving at
Town Hall in Manhattan on Saturday. Johnny Cunningham had been
a central figure in Celtic music for more than 30
years, in the group Silly Wizard, on his own and
with McKeown, Burke and others.
