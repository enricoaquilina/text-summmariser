Yusuf Islam, the pop musician known as 
Cat Stevens until he converted to Islam 30 years ago, was set to 
release a new record on Monday in aid of tsunami-orphaned children 
in the Indonesian province of Aceh.

"The tsunami disaster has changed the world in an extraordinary 
way and it requires an extraordinary response from everyone," said 
the 56-year-old, who sold 50 million records in the 1970s with hits 
such as "Matthew and Son", "Peace Train" and "Wild World".

The new song in response to the disaster, "Indian Ocean", 
features Magne Furuholmen of Norwegian group A-Ha and Neil Primrose 
of Britpop band Travis.

The British singer's own charity, Small Kindness, set up a 
regional office in Indonesia and will work on projects "to keep 
families together" by helping orphans in the predominantly-Muslim 
Aceh.

"We try to find other family members who would look after the 
orphans and then keep the family together in that way and then pay 
them subsistence every month," he said on his website.

The total number of tsunami victims is 273,435 dead or missing, 
220,172 of them from Indonesia.
