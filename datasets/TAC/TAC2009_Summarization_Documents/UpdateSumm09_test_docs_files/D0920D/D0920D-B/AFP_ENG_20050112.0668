A New York-bound British Airways plane 
was forced to change course over the Atlantic and head back to 
London Wednesday after US authorities said they would not allow one 
of its passengers to land, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 747, with 239 passengers aboard, was half-way to its 
destination when it decided to return to Heathrow Airport at 1115 
GMT "because of a passenger that the American authorities didn't 
want to land in New York," said a BA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman in London said the male passenger had been 
released by police after being questioned for two hours.
</P>
<P>
But a spokeswoman from the US Transportation Security 
Administration (TSA) said: "There was a person traveling on a French 
passport who was a positive match with an anti-terrorism watch 
list.
</P>
<P>
"Homeland security made the match by checking data transmitted 
after the flight departed from London," Yolanda Clark added.
</P>
<P>
"As a precautionary measure, TSA contacted the FAA (Federal 
Aviation Administration) and requested the aircraft be diverted to 
the nearest landing point to keep the plane from entering northeast 
corridor airspace. That airport would be Bangor, Maine," she said. 
"BA corporate made the decision instead to return the flight to 
London." 
</P>
<P>
A BA spokesman said there was "no threat to the security of the 
aircraft and we took the decision to return to Heathrow."
</P>
<P>
An airline industry source who asked not to be named said it 
appears BA did not have the latest version of the no-fly list. This 
particular passenger was added in December.
</P>
<P>
Last December 26, a Delta Airlines plane was diverted to a 
Florida military airport after US authorities found similarities 
between the name of a passenger and that of a wanted terrorist 
suspect.
</P>
<P>
In November, An Air France Boeing 777 on a flight from Paris to 
Washington made an emergency landing in Bangor, Maine at the request 
of US authorities who wanted to question two passengers.
</P>
<P>
In September, British singer Cat Stevens, who converted to Islam 
in 1977 and changed his name to Yusuf Islam, was barred from 
entering the United States on national security grounds. 
</P>
<P>
His plane was re-rerouted to Bangor as he was flying with his 
daughter to Nashville, Tennessee.
