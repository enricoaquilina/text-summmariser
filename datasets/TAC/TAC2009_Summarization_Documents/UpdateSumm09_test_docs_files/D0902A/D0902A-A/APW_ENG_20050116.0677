U.S. government considers whether 'morning-after' anti-pregnancy pill may be sold without prescription

<P>
The U.S. government is considering whether to make morning-after birth control
available without a prescription, and like most issues that involve sex and
pregnancy, it has generated heated debate.
</P>
<P>
Fierce arguments have gone on inside and outside the Food and Drug
Administration, which may decide as soon as this week whether drug stores can
sell the emergency contraception known as Plan B without a prescription to women
age 16 and older.
</P>
<P>
Each side accuses the other of manipulating science for political
purpose.
</P>
<P>
Plan B supporters say the pill is a safe way to prevent thousands of unwanted
pregnancies and the abortions that sometimes follow. Making the contraception
available over the counter, they say, is crucial for women who might need the
protection over a weekend or when it is difficult to obtain a
prescription.
</P>
<P>
Plan B can prevent pregnancy for up to 72 hours after sex. The sooner the pill
is taken, the more effective it is.
</P>
<P>
"Women's reproductive rights shouldn't hinge on someone else's schedule. We
should have this at our fingertips. It should be next to condoms in drug
stores," said Kelly Mangan, 22, president of the University of Florida's chapter
of the National Organization for Women. She was arrested this month in a protest
outside the FDA's headquarters in suburban Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Opponents worry that the drug encourages women _ teenagers in particular _ to
have risky sex. If over-the-counter sales are permitted, older teenagers or
adults might buy the pills for some of their younger friends or their sexual
partners, critics say.
</P>
<P>
"It encourages risky sexual activity with the promise `just pop a pill in the
morning and you don't need to worry about pregnancy,'" said Wendy Wright of
Concerned Women of America, a conservative group that focuses on social
issues.
</P>
<P>
"What we're concerned about is a number of young people who are not engaged in
sexual activity who feel tremendous pressure, and this will only add to the
pressure that is on them," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
Not contested, by either side, is that the drug is drug is safe or effective.
Some who work for the FDA believed that questions about people's sexual behavior
were overwhelming scientific ones, according to an internal agency memo written
last year.
</P>
<P>
"Some staff have expressed the concern that this decision is based on
non-medical implications of teen sexual behavior, or judgments about the
propriety of this activity," said the memo by the FDA's acting drug chief, Dr.
Steven Galson.
</P>
<P>
"These issues are beyond the scope of our drug approval process, and I have not
considered them in this decision," wrote Galson, who last spring rejected the
first application for Plan B's sale over the counter.
</P>
<P>
A study this month is providing evidence for both sides.
</P>
<P>
Researchers in San Francisco found that women who were given a supply of Plan B
to keep at home were no more likely to have unprotected intercourse than women
who had to go to a clinic or pharmacy for the contraceptive. Women with easy
access were more likely to use Plan B, leading researchers to conclude that easy
access could prevent unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
But the study, which only followed women for six months, found that the two
groups had about the same pregnancy rate, undercutting the argument that Plan B
prevents unwanted pregnancies and abortion.
</P>
<P>
Last May, the FDA rejected nonprescription sales of emergency contraception,
against the overwhelming recommendation of the agency's own scientific
advisers.
</P>
<P>
The FDA said it worried that there was not enough data about the pill's use by
young teenagers. The agency promised to reconsider if the pill's manufacturer,
Barr Laboratories of Pomona, New York, figured out how to sell over the counter
only to those 16 and older.
</P>
<P>
In July, Barr again applied for approval. The company now proposes that drug
stores check customers' ages to be certain that buyers are at least 16, an
approach the FDA has not approved before. Younger teenagers could continue to
get the drug with a doctor's prescription.
</P>
<P>
The morning-after pill is a higher dose of the contraceptive hormones found in
the Pill. It prevents ovulation or fertilization, and can prevent a fertilized
egg from implanting into the uterus.
</P>
<P>
Because medical experts do not consider a woman to be pregnant until after an
egg implants into the uterus, the morning-after pill is not considered abortion,
although some conservatives object to any interference with a fertilized
egg.
</P>
<P>
If a woman already is pregnant, morning-after pills have no effect. But taken
within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, they can cut a woman's chances of
pregnancy by up to 89 percent.
