Nine Women Arrested at FDA for Plan B Protest

<P>
Nine women protesting the Food and Drug
Administration's position on the emergency contraceptive Plan B were
arrested Friday when they blocked entry to the agency's Rockville,
Md., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The women, part of a noisy protest in favor of making the
morning-after pill available without a prescription, were taken away
by officers of the Department of Homeland Security and charged with
disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
The protesters said they wanted to speak with Steven Galson, acting
director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, who in
May rejected an application to allow Plan B to be sold over the
counter. FDA staff reviewers and an advisory panel of outside experts
had strongly recommended approval, saying the emergency contraceptive
could be safely sold without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
Friday's protest came as the agency is preparing to rule later this
month on a second application by Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc. to make
Plan B more easily accessible. That proposal would allow the drug to
be sold to women over 16 without a prescription but would require a
doctor's order for girls below that age.
</P>
<P>
One of the protest organizers, Alex Leader from New York, said the
demonstrators opposed any age restrictions and are concerned that the
agency will not approve the new application at all.
</P>
<P>
``We don't trust the FDA at this point,'' Leader said. ``The Bush
administration is playing to its social conservatives by not approving
Plan B, even though the experts say it's safe. Women need this drug
available now.''
</P>
<P>
FDA officials said Galson was not available to meet the women but
acting Deputy Commissioner Janet Woodcock would be willing to see five
of the demonstrators. They rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
About 40 protesters, mostly from Florida and New York, took part in
the demonstration. Three representatives of Concerned Women for
America, which opposes easier access to Plan B, were also present.
</P>
<P>
Wendy Wright, CWA's policy director, said she hopes ``the FDA won't
base its decision on stunts like this.'' She said allowing
nonprescription sales ``would be simply disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
``You could have a 40-year-old man who is committing statutory rape
on a 14-year-old simply going in and picking up Plan B himself. An age
limit won't stop anyone.''
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration has been cool to the expanded use of
emergency contraception, which some conservatives see as a form of
abortion. This week, the Justice Department issued guidelines for
treating rape victims that make no mention of emergency contraception,
leading to criticism from women's health groups and others that a
standard precaution for rape victims was being ignored. A department
spokesman said the new guidelines do not '' supersede the many state,
local and tribal protocols that are currently in practice.''
</P>
<P>
Kelly Mangan, a National Organization for Women activist from
Florida who was among those arrested, said the group has pledges from
2,000 other women to break the law by sharing their
prescription-purchased Plan B with women who need it but have no
prescription.
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that emergency contraception works for about 72
hours after unprotected sex but is best used within 24 hours. The need
for speed is a key argument made by advocates of easier access.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists called on the FDA to approve the new application.
</P>
<P>
``ACOG and other organizations have estimated that greater access
to emergency contraceptives could cut the U.S. unintended pregnancy
and abortion rates in half,'' the group said in a statement.
