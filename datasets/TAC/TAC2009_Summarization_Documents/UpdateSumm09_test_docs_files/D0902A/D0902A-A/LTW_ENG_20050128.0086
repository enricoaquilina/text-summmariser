Birth Control Too?

This editorial appeared in Friday's Los Angeles Times:

<P>
Only 40 years ago, within the memory of millions of Americans,
birth control could not be legally sold in some states, even to
married couples. If President Bush and his allies in Congress are
successful, the future could look much like that past.
</P>
<P>
For some Bush supporters, religious beliefs about when life begins
or about interfering with ``natural law'' justify limiting access to
common forms of birth control. The motivation for others may be
disapproval of sex outside of marriage -- by adults as well as teens.
Whatever the impetus, the emerging results are astonishing.
</P>
<P>
As part of abstinence-only sex education, which the president
champions and taxpayers now fund to the tune of $170 million annually,
U.S. teens are being taught a bunch of hooey. A recent congressional
report found the program's materials warn that touching another's
genitals ``can result in pregnancy'' and that condoms fail to prevent
HIV transmission one-third of the time. Actually, studies find that
condoms are nearly always effective in blocking HIV and other sexually
transmitted diseases if used properly (and we hope we don't need to
refute the first assertion).
</P>
<P>
Giving teens false and misleading information is bad enough. More
pernicious is the administration's reluctance to back international
AIDS prevention programs that distribute condoms, a reluctance that
could cost millions of Asians and Africans their lives. The policy is
utterly inexplicable, unless it is to placate those who think condoms
could encourage adults to have sex.
</P>
<P>
The same logic is behind ``refusal'' laws. Twelve states now allow
pharmacists who oppose contraception to refuse to fill prescriptions
for birth control, including the ``morning-after pill.'' Sen. Rick
Santorum, R-Pa., plans to reintroduce his bill from last year to
extend that right nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The religious right's fingerprints also can be seen on the Justice
Department's first-ever guidebook, released last fall, on treating
sexual assault victims. It is an otherwise laudable effort to help win
more rape cases, outlining in 140 graphic pages the best practices for
evidence collection, forensic analysis and victim support. For
instance, six pages detail testing protocols for sexually transmitted
disease, treatment and psychological counseling. But the section on
``Pregnancy Risk Evaluation and Care'' is a scant half-page of
euphemisms and generalities. Omitted from the final version was draft
language about the effectiveness of emergency contraception in
preventing pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
The morning-after pill acts by impeding ovulation, fertilization
and implantation. To most doctors, it is not a method of abortion. But
those who believe that life begins at conception think it is, and
Justice officials apparently are seeking to appease them.
</P>
<P>
So, it seems, is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is
stalling a decision on whether to make the morning-after pill
available nationwide without a prescription. Opponents claim that easy
access would encourage promiscuity, despite data to the contrary from
states such as California, where the pill is more freely available.
</P>
<P>
Surely this backward future is not what most Bush supporters
thought they voted for last fall.
