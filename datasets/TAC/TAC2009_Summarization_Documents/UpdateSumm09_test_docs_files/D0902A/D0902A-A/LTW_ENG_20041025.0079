Teen Sex Reality

A strong conviction that teenagers should not have sex can leave no
room for reality -- like the fact that many teenagers do have sex, no
matter what society or their elders say. The Bush administration's
simplistic policies for complicated and difficult family planning
problems like teen pregnancies looked naive four years ago; their
continued application in light of ongoing research looks ridiculous.
</P>

Most parents certainly agree with President Bush that teen sex is a
bad idea. But even though adults may hector endlessly, an estimated
800,000 teen-age girls still become pregnant every year.

The administration's response has been to sink millions of dollars
into abstinence-only education, depleting funds from programs that
provide contraception. No surprise then that the administration argues
that allowing adolescents easy access to the morning-after pill would
only confuse its abstinence message. So earlier this year, when a Food
and Drug Administration panel recommended that emergency contraception
be available without a prescription, a top agency official overruled
the scientists. In most states the drug has stayed off-limits to
everyone -- teens and adults -- who can't get to a doctor within 72
hours after unprotected sex or can't afford one.

A recent study by the University of Pittsburgh Medical School found
that teens who had emergency contraception on hand were not more
likely to have unprotected sex. They were, however, more likely to use
the drug correctly to prevent pregnancy. This study confirms other
findings and is one reason why most obstetricians and gynecologists
back easy access.

The drug's makers are again asking for FDA approval; this time they
propose to sell Plan B (the drug's trade name) only to people 16 and
older without restrictions. Younger teens would have to consult a
physician. The FDA could decide on the request in the coming months.
This time maybe science -- and reality -- will trump moral certainty.
