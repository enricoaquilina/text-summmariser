BILL WOULD LET PHARACISTS REFUSE TO FILL CONTRACEPTIVE PRESCRIPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first of possibly several bills seeking to let Texas pharmacists
"just say no" to filling prescriptions for emergency contraceptives
has been filed before the legislative session that begins in January.
</P>
<P>
Groups opposing the bill, as well as the bill's author, said its
language will probably change during the legislative process to
accommodate certain concerns.
</P>
<P>
In its current form, the bill would allow pharmacists to refuse to
dispense some birth-control pills. The definition in the bill of
emergency contraceptives, commonly called the morning-after pill,
also fits some nonemergency contraceptives, or birth-control pills.
</P>
<P>
That would not sit well with members of the Texas Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, an organization spokeswoman said.
"This bill would cause women to have to rol the dice every time they
went to have a prescription filled," spokeswoman Sarah Wheat said.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation was filed to allow pharmacists the same
protections other Texas health care professionals enjoy, said its
author, state Rep. Frank Corte Jr., R-San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
Pharmacists are worried that they may face repercussions if they
choose to follow their conscience and refuse to serve a customer on
moral or ethical grounds, Corte said. But ifthe bill is passed, it
should not stand between a woman and her health care needs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our intent is to affect the prescriptions that terminate pregnancies
-- that's what most of the pharmacists are concerned about," he said.
"We have pharmacists who have received ultimatums from their
employers."
</P>
<P>
In January, pharmacists at an Eckerd Drug Store in Denton denied a
morning-after pill to a rape victim. Three pharmacists were fired as
a result of that incident. In March, a CVS pharmacist in North
Richland Hills refused to fill Julee Lacey's prescription for birth
control pills.
</P>
<P>
The pharmacist told Lacey that she did not believe in any form of
birth control and advised her to go to a nearby Walgreens for
assistance, said Lacey, of Fort Worth. Lacey remembers feeling
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
"I entrust my care to my physician, not my pharmacist," Lacey said.
"We have to consider what could happen if this should go any further.
There are some people who don't believe in trasplants. I just want to
know where they are going to draw the line."
</P>
<P>
The morning-after pill is a higher dose of regular hormonal
contraception that works to prevent pregnancy if taken within 72
hours after intercourse.
</P>
<P>
When the bill's language is refined, it should only refer to the
morning-after pill, said state Rep. Charles Hopson, D-Jacksonville.
Hopson, who is also a pharmacist, said the bill needs to clearly
state that patients will be presented with an alternative if a
pharmacist refuses to serve them.
</P>
<P>
"Some of th big chain stores are comfortable with the concept, but
they would like to know which pharmacists will fill all prescriptions
and which ones will not," Hopson said. "They also want to make sure
that there is some alternative for the patient."
</P>
<P>
This bill, and similar legislation passed or recently proposed in
about a dozen other states, discriminates against women, said Rachel
Laser, senior counsel with the National Women's Law Center in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
"If yougo into a profession to assist the medical needs of people,
you are not in a position to single out women just because you
believe a prescription is something other than what the FDA says it
is," Laser said. "Women find the experience of being denied a
prescription humiliating and demoralizing."
</P>
<P>
Texas Pharmacy Association policy calls for pharmacists to discuss
concerns about dispensing prescriptions with their employers before
refusing service to a patient, said Jim Martin, the association's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
Pharmacits should make arrangements to ensure that customers can get
their prescription filled, even though one pharmacist may object to
filling a prescription for a specific drug, Martin said. The
association has not formulated a position on this legislation, Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
But, "Our position is that a pharmacist has a right to fill or not
fill a prescription," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
The Texas Alliance for Life supports the legislation, said Joe
Pojman, executiv director.
</P>
<P>
"My basic concern remains that the pharmacist ought to be able to
conscientiously object to participate in something that is the
potential taking of human life," he said. "I'm very concerned that
women get the proper health care, but I'm also concerned with the
health care providers."
