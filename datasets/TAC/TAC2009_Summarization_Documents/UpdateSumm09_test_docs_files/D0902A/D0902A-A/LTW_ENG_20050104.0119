Providing women with easy access to the emergency
contraceptive Plan B did not lead them to engage in more risky sexual
behavior, a study of more than 2,000 young California women has
concluded.
</P>
<P>
The study did find that women given a supply to keep at home were
almost twice as likely to use the drug after unprotected sex as those
who had to pick it up at a clinic or pharmacy. The findings led the
study authors to conclude that easy access to Plan B, also called the
morning-after pill, could cut the number of unwanted pregnancies while
posing no apparent risk to women.
</P>
<P>
The study contradicts a key claim made by opponents of easier
access to Plan B at a time when the Food and Drug Administration is
preparing to decide on a second application to allow nonprescription
sales of the drug.
</P>
<P>
In an indication of the strong feelings on both sides, advocates of
Plan B plan to sit in Friday at FDA headquarters in suburban Bethesda,
Md. Some protesters have called for civil disobedience if the FDA
official who rejected the first Plan B application, Steven Galson of
the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, refuses to meet with
them.
</P>
<P>
The FDA turned down the initial application last May, saying there
wasn't enough information on how easy access would affect the sexual
behavior of young teens.
</P>
<P>
``Our findings were that women don't change their sexual behavior
when the drug is easily available, but rather that they're more likely
to use it if access is easier,'' said lead author Tina Raine of the
Center for Reproductive Health Research and Policy of the University
of California, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
The study looked at 2,117 San Francisco-area women ages 15 to 24
who were randomly put into one of three groups. One third were given
the drug to take home, one third were told it could be picked up
without a prescription at a clinic, and the final third could get it
without a prescription at a pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
The study found that roughly the same percentage of each group had
unprotected sex over a six-month period, that incidence of sexually
transmitted disease was equal, and that about the same percentage
became pregnant.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, about 37 percent of women in the group given Plan B to
take home used it at least once during the six months, compared with
21 percent in the clinic-access group and 24 percent in the
pharmacy-access group.
</P>
<P>
The FDA's initial decision to reject nonprescription sales touched
off sharp criticism -- from FDA's staff and members of its expert
advisory panel, among others -- that the agency was bowing to political
pressure from social conservatives. In a letter to President Bush, 49
members of Congress asked that the application be rejected.
</P>
<P>
The medical profession does not consider emergency contraception to
be an abortion pill like RU-486, or Mifeprex, because Plan B works by
preventing a pregnancy from starting rather than ending an existing
one. But some critics of Plan B consider it an abortifacient.
</P>
<P>
The new study, being published Wednesday in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, supports the position taken by much of
the FDA review staff and 23 of 27 members of the FDA advisory panel
that the drug could be safely and properly used without a
prescription.
</P>
<P>
After the FDA rejected its initial application, the maker of Plan
B, Barr Pharmaceuticals, resubmitted a modified application to address
the concerns about teen-age users. The company's new application would
make the drug available over the counter for women older than 16, and
by prescription-only for those who are younger.
</P>
<P>
Barr spokeswoman Carol Cox said the company still believes the drug
can be safely sold on open shelves but would accept a compromise to
place Plan B behind the counter. That would require a pharmacy
employee to retrieve the drug, making enforcement of an age
restriction easier.
</P>
<P>
Plan B consists of the synthetic progestin levonorgestrel and is
most effective when used within 24 hours of an unprotected sexual
encounter. While the FDA has approved it only for prescription use,
six states have passed laws that allow pharmacists to dispense the
drug without a prescription after a discussion with the woman.
</P>
<P>
The University of California study was initiated in part to see
whether getting the drug from a pharmacy would be more acceptable to
women than getting it from a clinic, and Raine said the results appear
to show it was not. The study was funded by grants from a number of
private foundations that invested in the Women's Capital Corporation,
which initially developed the drug. Raine said neither the foundations
nor Barr Pharmaceuticals, which supplied the drugs for the women, had
any influence over the study.
