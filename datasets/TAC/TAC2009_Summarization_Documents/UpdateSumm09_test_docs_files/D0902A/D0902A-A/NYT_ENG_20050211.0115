ABORTION SHOULD BE RARE -- AND HERE'S HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN

<P>
Over the years, I have met very few
women who didn't regret their abortions. But I haven't talked
to a single woman who regretted having the child she
had considered aborting.
</P>
<P>
That's why U.S. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's recent candor on abortion
-- that it should be rare, but legal -- was
welcome. What we need now is this sort of honest
discussion of the issue that reflects current realities and values.
</P>
<P>
American opinion has shifted since 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court
decided the landmark Roe vs. Wade case. Medical advancements that
permit women to hear their baby's heartbeat at four weeks,
see their fingers and toes at 10 weeks and allow
babies to survive outside the womb at 24 weeks have
influenced our perception of when life begins.
</P>
<P>
Like most Catholics, I oppose abortion. But like most Americans, I
don't want the government deciding the issue for a woman.
Abortion should remain legal. Never again should women be forced
to back alleys or foreign countries to terminate their pregnancies
-- particularly if they've been raped or if pregnancy poses
a life-threatening risk to a mother.
</P>
<P>
We do have the power to make abortions rare, and it
can be done without passing a law. But we need
better choices than those of the moralizing right, whose restrictive
policies on sex education, emergency contraception (the morning after pill)
and medical care for the working poor force many women
to choose between an abortion and rearing a child in
poverty. Their efforts to keep young people ignorant about sex
-- with abstinence-only sex education -- deprives many of them
of the knowledge they need to prevent unwanted pregnancies. In
the United States, 19 percent of women who get abortions
are teenagers.
</P>
<P>
The liberals are no better. Their abortion-on-demand policies ignore medical advancements
and evolving societal values. It has become difficult to think
of a living, growing organism with a heartbeat and brain
as merely a fetus -- whether it is a few
weeks or several months old. It's not a stretch to
visualize a time in the near future when babies will
be able to survive outside the womb much earlier than
they do today. At some point, the left needs to
accept that most Americans have grown uncomfortable with the practice
of terminating pregnancies to avoid responsibility of rearing children and
with partial-birth abortions that are done after the first trimester.
</P>
<P>
Texas' law that requires parents to be notified (or a review
by a judge) if their minor children seek an abortion
is a reasonable restriction that respects the sensibilities of most
Texans. But the State Board of Education's backward move to
prevent sex education regarding condoms and other contraceptives from reaching
Texas classrooms runs counter to most parents' sentiments.
</P>
<P>
It doesn't help that so many Texas children are languishing in
state foster homes. These are minority kids, mostly African-American. Mothers
who can't raise their children face the heartbreaking prospect of
giving their babies over to a callous system that passes
them from one stranger's arms to another.
</P>
<P>
We could make real progress in reducing abortions if groups on
both sides used their resources to help women overcome the
conditions that make abortions so appealing.
</P>
<P>
More than 1 million abortions are preformed each year in this
country. That's a tragedy. Outlawing abortion isn't the answer. Legal
or not, abortions will continue until women no longer have
to seriously contemplate whether their babies would be better off
if they were never born. What a choice.
