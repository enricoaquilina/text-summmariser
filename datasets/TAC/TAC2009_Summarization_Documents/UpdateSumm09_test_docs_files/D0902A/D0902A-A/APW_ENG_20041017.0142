Amid debate, FDA considers teen access to emergency contraception
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some see easy access to emergency contraception as a way to
drastically reduce teen pregnancy, already on the decline in the
United States since the early 1990s. Others worry that its long-term
effects on young women are unknown or argue that the drug, also known
as the "morning after pill," encourages teens to have sex.
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, it will be up to Food and Drug Administration officials
to decide: Should older teens be able to buy emergency contraception
without a prescription?
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the FDA denied one drug company's request to sell
its brand of emergency contraception to anyone. Now that company,
Barr Pharmaceuticals, has submitted a second proposal _ to sell its
Plan B brand to people 16 and older, but to require anyone younger
than that to consult a physician. The company expects a decision next
year.
</P>
<P>
Sale without a prescription have received support from both the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
Such access, some argue, would make it easier to get emergency
contraception on evenings and weekends, allowing more women to take
it in the recommended 72-hour window after unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
Others, including some young women, see it as a way for teens who
don't want their parents to know they're having sex to help prevent
unwanted pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
"Kids are going to end up having kids because they're hiding from
their parents; they're too scared to tell them," said a 17-year-old
in New York City. She asked that her name not be used because her
parents don't know she used the morning-after pill in April.
</P>
<P>
The young woman is a patient of Dr. Bernadith Russell, the attending
physician at Long Island Hospital's obstetrics and gynecology
department who also works in private practice at teen clinics in
Brooklyn. She says the topic of unplanned pregnancy and emergency
contraception comes up with her patients nearly every day. But few
want to discuss it with their parents _ or use insurance to buy
emergency contraception out of fear their parents will find out.
</P>
<P>
"I can't begin to say how much of a barrier that is," Russell says.
</P>
<P>
However, a physician who opposes over-the-counter sale of emergency
contraception fears that young women would skip regular visits to the
gynecologist if they didn't need to see a doctor to get it.
</P>
<P>
"They're not going to get their pap smears; they're not going to get
screened for sexually transmitted disease," says Dr. Gene Rudd, a
gynecologist who serves as associate executive director of the
Tennessee-based Christian Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
He also says some young women might not want to use emergency
contraception if they knew how it worked.
</P>
<P>
A stronger dose of regular hormonal contraception, the morning-after
pill can prevent pregnancy by delaying a woman's ovulation or keeping
sperm from fertilizing an egg.
</P>
<P>
It also can thin the uterus lining, making it difficult for a
fertilized egg to implant. That's a major reason anti-abortion groups
_ from the American Life League to the Pro-Life Action League _ are
among emergency contraception's main opponents.
</P>
<P>
While many in the medical field do not share their view, they see
interfering with a fertilized egg as abortion.
</P>
<P>
"Emergency contraception is not true contraception," says Sierra
Correa, the 22-year-old vice president of Collegians For Life, a
student group that opposes the morning-after pill. "Drug companies
have been getting away with calling it contraception by redefining
pregnancy to mean implantation" of a fertilized egg.
</P>
<P>
Some opponents also have argued that easier access to the
morning-after pill would make teens more likely to engage in risky
sexual behavior _ though some doctors say that research done at the
University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine casts doubt on that
argument.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the April issue of the Journal of Pediatric
and Adolescent Gynecology, found that teens who had emergency
contraception on hand were not more likely to have unprotected sex.
It also concluded that those teens were more likely to use emergency
contraception correctly and sooner after sex, when it is most
effective.
</P>
<P>
Each year, there are about 3 million unintended pregnancies _ and in
about 800,000 of those cases the parents are teenagers, according to
the federal Centers for Disease Control.
