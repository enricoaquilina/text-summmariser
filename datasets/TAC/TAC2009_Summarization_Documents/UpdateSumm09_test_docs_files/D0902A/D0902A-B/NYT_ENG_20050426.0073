DEBATE GOES TO HEART OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS

<P>
Increasingly we are governed by ideologies that don't
in any way reflect mainstream American thought.
</P>
<P>
When Congress made its clumsy bull's rush into the Terri Schiavo
matter, 70 percent of Americans said it should have stayed
out.
</P>
<P>
Roughly that same number supports life-saving stem-cell research that is being
blunted on the grounds of biblical verses.
</P>
<P>
Now in several states, including Texas, lawmakers are being urged to
equate birth-control pills and abortion. This is a distinction I'm
confident a vast majority of American women will classify as
ridiculous and/or immaterial.
</P>
<P>
In Texas, the debate has formed around a bill under whose
original language pharmacists could refuse to fill prescriptions for emergency
contraception (EC) -- the so-called morning-after pill. House Bill 16
would be appended to current law allowing health professionals to
opt out of performing an abortion.
</P>
<P>
Family planning organizations not only opposed the "conscience clause" on EC
but feared that the language could be broadened to include
standard birth-control pills, as is the case in a handful
of states.
</P>
<P>
Abortion foes, including an organization called Pharmacists for Life, assert that
while birth-control pills and EC do prevent conception in several
ways, they also can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting
-- therefore aborting human life.
</P>
<P>
With much attention aimed at whether or not his bill would
affect birth-control pills, bill author Frank Corte, R-San Antonio, offered
a version that took out references to EC. Instead, it
simply would add pharmacists to the health professionals who can
choose not to perform abortions. But abortion isn't something pharmacists
do anyway -- unless one equates birth-control pills and abortions.
</P>
<P>
If passed, seemingly, a pharmacist could cite HB 16 in refusing
to fill out a prescription for EC or contraception.
</P>
<P>
It is skirmishes like this that ought to get a lot
of Americans wondering who is running the country, and to
what end.
</P>
<P>
In a visit to Texas and a stopover in Waco, National
Abortion Rights Action League president Nancy Keenan called this the
newest front in the war against choice. It's "not just
about a woman's right to choose an abortion," she said.
"It's about denying birth control."
</P>
<P>
Keenan said her organization has reformulated its own message to put
pregnancy prevention at the forefront.
</P>
<P>
"We've been debating the abortion issue for years and fought it
on their (abortion opponents') terms. Now we're going on the
offensive" on behalf of prevention and education.
</P>
<P>
It is somewhat amazing that anyone would have to bring such
issues to the forefront of any debate. Stand up for
contraception, something on which millions of women depend to control
their reproductive futures? You mean people weren't already on their
feet? On this issue and more, average Americans have been
planted on the sofa as armies of zeal have dictated
debate.
</P>
<P>
Do Texans think a pharmacist should be able to refuse to
fill a prescription for birth-control pills? According to the Texas
Poll, 87 percent say no. Something tells me that's not
guaranteed to carry the day in Austin.
