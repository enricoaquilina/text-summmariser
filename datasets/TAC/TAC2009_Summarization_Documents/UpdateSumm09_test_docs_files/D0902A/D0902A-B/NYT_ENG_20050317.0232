FDA'S ROLE IN DELAYING CONTRACEPTIVE IS CRITICIZED

<P>
Senate Democrats on Thursday questioned Dr. Lester M. Crawford,
President Bush's choice to lead the Food and Drug Administration,
about why the agency had so far refused to allow
over-the-counter sales of Plan B, the morning-after pill.
</P>
<P>
"What has disturbed many of us is what appears is political
interference in a scientific process," said Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton,
D-N.Y. "We rely on the FDA for everything we take,
and I am hopeful that we will reverse what appears
to be a dangerous slide into political opinion as opposed
to scientific evidence."
</P>
<P>
Sens. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Patty Murray of Washington State
and Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland expressed similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
Crawford said that the FDA's consideration of the morning-after pill's application
was delayed because of its complexity, not because of political
interference.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that this decision will not be based
on politics," Crawford said. "It will be based on science."
</P>
<P>
Crawford appeared before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee
as part of his confirmation process to become the FDA
commissioner. Bush nominated him in February after Crawford had served
nearly a year as the agency's acting commissioner. The committee
is expected to vote on his nomination on April 13.
His confirmation is widely expected.
</P>
<P>
Several of the committee's Democrats said that they wanted answers from
Crawford about the agency's actions on the morning-after pill before
they voted on his nomination. Crawford promised to give them
a more detailed explanation.
</P>
<P>
The FDA's staff and an advisory committee had earlier recommended that
the morning-after pill known as Plan B be approved for
sale on pharmacy shelves. But in an unusual move, Dr.
Steven Galson, acting director of the agency's center for drug
evaluation and research, rejected the application.
</P>
<P>
Galson said that the application failed to deal with concerns that
the easy availability of the contraceptives might lead teenagers to
engage in riskier sex. The FDA has rarely asked an
applicant to study whether the availability of a cure might
lead some people to engage in risky behavior. Galson said
politics did not play a role in his decision.
</P>
<P>
Plan B's maker, Barr Laboratories, has since applied to sell the
pill "behind the counter." People seeking the medicine would need
to prove that they are 16 or older. Those under
16 would need a prescription. No pill is presently sold
this way, although nicotine patches are not supposed to be
sold to those under the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
The FDA was supposed to issue a decision on the later
application by January but did not do so. Crawford said
that missing such deadlines was unusual. He was asked when
the new decision would be issued.
</P>
<P>
"Is it days or weeks?" Kennedy asked.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to say days, I would say weeks," Crawford
answered. He later said that he could not guarantee a
decision before the committee voted on his nomination.
</P>
<P>
Crawford said that the agency "had no real dispute" with the
drug's label at this point. He also repeatedly stated that
the drug's approval had simply been delayed.
</P>
<P>
Some on the panel expressed concerns about the many drug-safety scandals
over the last year. News that antidepressants and some popular
pain pills have lethal side effects has led to criticism
that the agency is not sufficiently vigilant in its regulation
of drugs. Some in Congress have proposed a separate drug-safety
agency that would monitor side effects of approved medicines.
</P>
<P>
Crawford said that he was increasing the budget and the staff
of the agency's drug-safety office, and he promised to make
the group independent of the agency's new-drug reviewers. New-drug reviewers
"may have an affinity with the drug that probably doesn't
look good, at a bare minimum. So we're going to
be making a separation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The agency has been criticized recently for convening advisory committees filled
with experts who have financial ties to drug makers. Crawford
said that the vetting and disclosure of such ties will
change.
</P>
<P>
Crawford was also asked whether he approved of drug imports. "As
far as being safe, that worries me a lot," he
answered.
</P>
<P>
Crawford also said that he was working with the National Institutes
of Health to establish a registry of all human clinical
trials. Medical experts have called for a registry in the
wake of disclosures that drug companies often keep trials secret
if the results reflect poorly on their drugs.
</P>
<P>
"We have heard the unalloyed message from the public that they
want to know about those clinical trials, they want to
be able to read about them," Crawford said. "So that's
a charge to keep and we will move forward as
best we can."
