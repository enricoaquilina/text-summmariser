Some pharmacists around the country are refusing to fill
prescriptions for birth control and morning-after pills, saying that
dispensing the medications violates their personal moral or religious
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
The trend has opened a new front in the nation's battle over
reproductive rights, sparking an intense debate over the competing
rights of pharmacists to refuse to participate in something they
consider repugnant versus a woman's right to get medications her
doctor has prescribed. It has triggered pitched political battles in
State Houses across the nation as politicians seek to pass laws either
to protect pharmacists from being penalized -- or force them to carry
out their duties.
</P>
<P>
``This is a very big issue that's just beginning to surface,'' said
Steven H. Aden of the Christian Legal Society's Center for Law and
Religious Freedom in Annandale, Va., which defends pharmacists. ``More
and more pharmacists are becoming aware of their right to
conscientiously refuse to pass objectionable medications across the
counter. We are on the very front edge of a wave that's going to break
not too far down the line.''
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of clashes are occurring. Pharmacists often
risk dismissal or other disciplinary action to stand up for their
beliefs, while shaken teen-age girls and women desperately call their
doctors, frequently late at night, after being turned away by
sometimes lecturing men and women in white coats.
</P>
<P>
``There are pharmacists who will only give birth control pills to a
woman if she's married. There are pharmacists who mistakenly believe
contraception is a form of abortion and refuse to prescribe it to
anyone,'' said Adam Sonfield of the Alan Guttmacher Institute in New
York, which tracks reproductive issues. ``There are even cases of
pharmacists holding prescriptions hostage, where they won't even
transfer it to another pharmacy when time is of the essence.''
</P>
<P>
That's what happened to Kathleen Pulz and her husband, who panicked
when the condom they were using broke. Their fear spiked when the
Walgreens pharmacy near their home in Milwaukee refused to fill an
emergency prescription for the morning-after pill.
</P>
<P>
``I couldn't believe it,'' said Pulz, 43 , who with her husband had
long ago decided they could not afford a fifth child. ``How can they
make that decision for us? I was outraged. At the same time, I was sad
that we had to do this. But I was scared. I didn't know what we were
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
Supporters of pharmacists' rights see the trend as a welcome
expression of personal belief. Women's groups see it as a major threat
to reproductive rights and one of the latest manifestations of the
religious right's growing political reach -- this time into the
neighborhood pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
``This is another indication of the current political atmosphere
and climate,'' said Rachel Laser of the National Women's Law Center in
Washington. ``It's outrageous. It's sex discrimination. It prevents
access to a basic form of health care for women. We're going back in
time.''
</P>
<P>
The issue could intensify further if the Food and Drug
Administration approves the sale of the Plan B morning-after pill
without a prescription -- a step that would likely make pharmacists the
primary gatekeeper.
</P>
<P>
The question of health care workers refusing to provide certain
services first emerged among doctors, nurses and other health care
workers over abortions. The trend began to spread to pharmacists with
the approval of the morning-after pill and physician-assisted suicide
in Oregon, with support from such organizations as the U.S. Conference
of Catholic Bishops and the Pharmacists for Life International, which
claims 1,600 members on six continents, primarily the United States,
Canada and Britain.
</P>
<P>
``Our group was founded with the idea of returning pharmacy to a
healing-only profession. What's been going on is the use of medication
to stop human life. That violates the ideal of the Hippocratic Oath
that medical practitioners should do no harm,'' said Karen L. Brauer,
the group's president, who was fired from a K-Mart pharmacy in Delhi,
Ohio, for refusing to fill birth control prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
No one knows exactly how often that is happenning, but cases have
been reported across the country, including in California, Washington,
Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Texas, New Hampshire,
Ohio and North Carolina. Advocates on both sides say the refusals
appear to be spreading, often surfacing only in the rare instances
when women file complaints.
</P>
<P>
Pharmacists are regulated by state laws and can face disciplinary
action from licensing boards. But the only case that has gotten that
far involves Neil T. Noesen, who in 2002 refused to fill a University
of Wisconsin student's birth control pill prescription at a K-Mart in
Menomonie, Wis., or transfer the prescription elsewhere. An
administrative judge last month recommended Noesen be required to take
ethics classes, alert future employers to his beliefs and pay what
could be as much as $20,000 to cover the costs of the legal
proceedings. The state pharmacy board will decide whether to impose
that penalty next month.

``He's a devout Roman Catholic and believes participating in any
action that inhibits or prohibits human life is a sin,'' said Aden of
the Christian Legal Society. ``The rights of pharmacists like him
should be respected.''
</P>

Wisconsin is one of at least 11 states considering ``conscience
clause'' laws that would protect pharmacists like Noesen. Four states
have laws that specifically allow pharmacists to refuse to fill
prescriptions that violate their beliefs. At the same time, at least
four states are considering laws that would explicitly require
pharmacists to fill all prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
The American Pharmacists Association recently reaffirmed its policy
that pharmacists can refuse to fill prescriptions as long as they make
sure customers can get their medications some other way.

``We don't have a profession of robots. We have a profession of
humans. We have to acknowledge that individual pharmacists have
individual beliefs,'' said Susan Winckler, the association's vice
president for policy and communications. ``What we suggest is that
they identify those situations ahead of time and have an alternative
system set up so the patient has access to their therapy.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The alternative system can include making sure another pharmacist
is on duty who can take over or making sure another pharmacy nearby is
willing to fill the prescription, Winckler said. ``The key is that it
should be seamless and avoids a conflict between the pharmacist's
right to step away and the patient's right to obtain their
medication,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Brauer, of Pharmacists for Life, defends the right of pharmacists
not only to decline to fill prescriptions themselves but also to
refuse to refer customers elsewhere or transfer prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
``That's like saying, 'I don't kill people myself but let me tell
you about the guy down the street who does.' What's that saying? 'I
will not off your husband but I know a buddy who will?' It's the same
thing,'' said Brauer, who now works at hospital pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
Large pharmacy chains, including Walgreens, Wal-Mart and CVS, have
instituted similar policies that try to balance pharmacists' and
customers' rights. ``We obviously do have pharmacists with individual
moral and ethical beliefs. When it does happen, the pharmacist is
asked to notify the manager that they have decided not to fill the
prescription, and the manager has the obligation to make sure the
customer has access to the prescription by another means,'' said
Tiffany Bruce, a spokesperson for Walgreens. ``We have to respect the
pharmacist but we have to also respect the right of the person to
receive the prescription.''
</P>
<P>
Women's advocates say such policies are impractical, especially
late at night in emergency situations involving the morning-after
pill, which must be taken within 72 hours. Even in non-urgent cases,
poor women have a hard time getting enough time off work or money to
go from one pharmacy to another. Young women, who are often already
frightened and unsure of themselves, may simply give up when
confronted by a judgmental pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
``What is a women supposed to do in rural America, in places where
there may only be one pharmacy?'' asked Nancy Keenan, president of
NARAL Pro-Choice America, which is launching a campaign Monday to
counter the trend. ``It's a slap in the face to women.''

By the time Suzanne Richards, 21, finally got another pharmacy to
fill her morning-after pill prescription -- after being rejected by a
drive-through Brooks pharmacy in Laconia, N.H., one late Saturday
night in September -- the 72 hours had long passed.
</P>
<P>
``When he told me he wouldn't fill it, I just pulled over in the
parking lot and started crying,'' said Richards, a single mother of a
3-year-old who runs her own cleaning service. ``I just couldn't
believe it. I was just trying to be responsible.''
</P>
<P>
In the end, Richards turned out not to be pregnant.
</P>
<P>
Pulz obtained her prescription last June directly from her doctor,
though she does not think she was pregnant either.
</P>
<P>
``I was lucky,'' Pulz said. ``I can sympathize with someone who
feels strongly and doesn't want to be involved. But they should just
step out of the way and not interfere with someone else's decision.
It's just not right.''
