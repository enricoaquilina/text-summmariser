PHARMACIST SUES OVER CONTRACEPTIVE RULE

<P>
A pharmacist in Illinois has filed a lawsuit challenging
an order by Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich requiring pharmacies to
dispense birth control and emergency contraceptives without delay.
</P>
<P>
The pharmacist, Luke Vander Bleek, 42, says in his lawsuit that
the order violates state law by requiring pharmacists to act
against ethical and religious beliefs that oppose morning-after birth control
pills. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday, is the third contesting the
governor's action.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not up on a soap box in the pharmacy screaming
out 'This is not to be done,"' said Vander Bleek,
who owns two pharmacies in Morrison and Prophetstown, about 130
miles west of Chicago. "I simply don't want to be
involved in it."
</P>
<P>
Vander Bleek said he conscientiously objected to the order, which was
issued in April after two women reported that a drugstore
in Chicago would not fill their prescriptions for morning-after pills.
</P>
<P>
"Prior to this rule, I had always practiced pharmacy using my
judgment and my conscience and the law as my guide,"
he said. "Here comes this grenade thrown in here that
says, 'You're going to have to do things that are
morally objectionable."'
</P>
<P>
Abby Ottenhoff, a spokeswoman for Blagojevich, a Democrat, said the governor
issued the order to make sure women had access to
the health care their doctors prescribed.
</P>
<P>
"They've chosen to be in the field of providing contraceptives," Ottenhoff
said. "They don't have the right to pick and choose
who they're going to serve."
</P>
<P>
Vander Bleek, who is represented by Americans United for Life, a
conservative bioethics law firm based in Chicago, said he had
not dispensed or stocked emergency contraceptives and did not plan
to do so. No one has come to his pharmacy
with such prescriptions since the order was issued, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Simply stated, this individual's interest in getting this prescription is not
greater than my interest in preserving my right to conscientious
objection," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, a nurse in Illinois filed a lawsuit against
Eastern Illinois University, where she used to work, claiming she
was denied a promotion because she objected to dispensing the
morning-after pill.
</P>
<P>
Vicki Woodard, a spokeswoman for the university, said the reason that
the nurse, Andrea Nead, was not hired for the position
had nothing to do with her opinion of the morning-after
pill. One of the two people hired for the position
also objects to dispensing it, Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
The American Center for Law and Justice, the conservative legal group
representing Nead, represents six pharmacists in a separate lawsuit against
the governor's order. Another suit was filed by the Center
for Law and Religious Freedom, representing a Chicago pharmacist.
