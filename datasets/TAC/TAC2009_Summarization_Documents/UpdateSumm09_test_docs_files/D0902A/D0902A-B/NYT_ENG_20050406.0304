DEMOCRATS BLOCK NOMINATION OVER MORNING-AFTER PILL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
President Bush's nominee to lead the Food and Drug
Administration is being blocked from Senate confirmation by two Democrats
who said Wednesday that they would hold up a vote
until the agency settled the long-delayed question of whether an
emergency contraceptive could be sold over the counter.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats, Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Patty
Murray of Washington, met with the nominee, Lester M. Crawford,on
Wednesday to discuss what they regard as foot-dragging on the
issue of the so-called morning-after pill. An expert panel of
scientists recommended over-the-counter sales in December 2003, but the agency
has yet to issue a final ruling.
</P>
<P>
"I'm prepared to hold it for as long as it takes
to get a decision made," Clinton said. She added, "From
everything we're able to determine, the agency has substituted politics
and ideology for science and facts."
</P>
<P>
Crawford could not be reached, and an agency spokeswoman, Kathleen Quinn,
said the FDA would have no comment. But at a
hearing last month, Crawford told senators the decision on the
contraceptive "will not be based on politics."
</P>
<P>
He did not say then when a final decision would be
made, nor did he do so on Wednesday, Murray said.
"It was very frustrating and very unsatisfactory," she said, adding,
"I did not get any timeline at all for a
decision and there was no new information."
</P>
<P>
The hold complicates the future of the food and drug agency
at a time when it is already being criticized for
its handling of several drug safety scandals. Studies revealing the
potentially lethal side effects of some antidepressants and popular pain
medicines, like the Merck drug Vioxx, have prompted critics to
charge that the agency is not vigilant enough in protecting
consumers.
</P>
<P>
The White House had hoped Crawford, who is the acting commissioner
of the agency, would help tamp some of that criticism.
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Les Crawford is a well-qualified candidate," a White House spokeswoman,
Erin Healy, said Wednesday, adding that the Bush administration "will
continue to work with the Senate to ensure his confirmation."
</P>
<P>
Crawford has doctorates in veterinary medicine and pharmacology.
</P>
<P>
But ever since his nomination in February, Crawford has been confronted
with questions not only about the safety scandals, but also
about the emergency contraceptive, also known as Plan B. The
senior Democrat on the Senate Health Education Labor Committee, Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, has also raised questions about
the morning-after pill.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, who attended Wednesday's meeting, has decided against putting a hold
on Crawford's nomination, a spokeswoman said. But the spokeswoman, Laura
Capps, said Kennedy "conveyed today that he is hopeful that
the FDA will do the right thing and make a
decision on this product, and until it is settled he
believes it's doubtful that Dr. Crawford can be confirmed."
</P>
<P>
Though Clinton and Murray believe the drug should be made available
over the counter, both said that their interest was solely
in getting a decision from the FDA and that they
would remove the hold regardless of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
Plan B, manufactured by Barr Laboratories, was approved for use by
prescription in June 1999. Consisting of two pills, it is
intended to be taken in the 72 hours after unprotected
sex, either when regular contraception fails or is skipped. But
advocates for women's health said selling it by prescription hampered
its usefulness, because it was difficult for women to see
their doctors quickly enough to get a prescription.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the pill, including religious conservatives, have said it will
encourage sexual promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
But in December 2003, two committees of expert advisers to the
food and drug agency, meeting jointly, voted, 23-4, to recommend
over-the-counter sales. The agency typically follows the advice of its
expert advisers, but the decision has been delayed on several
occasions.
</P>
<P>
More recently, Barr Laboratories has applied to sell the pill "behind
the counter"; women seeking to buy it would have to
prove they are 16 or older while those under 16
would need a prescription. The agency was supposed to issue
a decision on that in January, but missed a deadline.
</P>
<P>
At last month's hearing, before the Senate Committee on Health Education
Labor and Pensions, Crawford said missing such deadlines was unusual.
Asked when the new decision would be issued, he said:
"I wouldn't want to say days. I would say weeks."
But he said he could not guarantee a decision before
April 13, when the committee is expected to vote on
his nomination.
