EMERGENCY BIRTH CONTROL (FOR USE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EMERGENCY BIRTH CONTROLSINCE THE late 1990s, women in need of a
"morning after" emergency contraceptive have been able to get one
by doctor's prescription. But the pill {ndash} actually a short
series of high-dose birth control pills {ndash} loses effectiveness with
any delay. Access would be much better if the Food
and Drug Administration accepted a proposal {ndash} endorsed by the
FDA's own experts {ndash} to make emergency contraception available over
the counter. Since political pressure has kept the FDA from
doing so, there is need for state legislation that makes
Plan B, as the treatment is called, somewhat more available
until the FDA sees fit to allow over-the-counter sales.

Under a bill pending in the Legislature, pharmacists would be allowed
to sell Plan B without prescriptions if they undergo special
training set up by the state Department of Public Health
and establish a relationship with a doctor who would oversee
how the pill is dispensed. Such arrangements are already in
place in six other states, including Washington and California. The
training in Washington has focused on Plan B's side effects
(nausea and breast tenderness) and informed consent issues. The bill
would also require that all hospital emergency rooms in Massachusetts
offer emergency contraception to the victims of rape or sexual
assault. Most emergency rooms in the state already do so.
The bill deserves the support of the Legislature and Governor
Romney.

Plan B prevents 89 percent of pregnancies when it is taken
within 72 hours of intercourse, either by interfering with ovulation
or by blocking fertilization. In some cases, it might also
work by keeping a fertilized egg from implanting in a
woman's uterus. This has kept some opponents of abortion from
supporting use of Plan B. Supporters of Plan B say
that easier access to it would reduce the number of
unplanned pregnancies and abortions. The legislation has won support from
organizations representing women, the medical profession, and pharmacists.

Morning-after pills are far from ideal as a means of birth
control. Their effectiveness rate is lower than that of other
measures, and they do not prevent sexually transmitted diseases, as
condoms do. But they should be a readily available option
for women.

<P>
Last year the state Senate passed an emergency contraception bill, but
the former House speaker, Thomas M. Finneran, blocked action on
it in that chamber. With Finneran departed, advocates of the
bill hope that it will pass both houses. As a
candidate for governor in 2002, Romney answered "yes" to a
questionnaire from the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts that asked
him whether he supported "efforts to increase access to emergency
contraception." The Legislature should pass the bill and, if it
does, Romney should sign it.
