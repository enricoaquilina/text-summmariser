BLOOMBERG HONORED BY ABORTION-RIGHTS GROUP

<P>
It was the kind of election-year event that
illustrates the power of incumbency.
</P>
<P>
There were testimonials hailing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's leadership, standing ovations,
billboard-size video displays of the New York mayor -- and
a chance for him to tell a ballroom filled with
abortion-rights supporters that in his role as mayor he was
going to have the city spend $1 million to help
make women aware of the "morning-after pill."
</P>
<P>
Bloomberg, running for a second term, was honored Thursday by Naral
Pro-Choice New York for creating a program in 2001 that
made abortion training available to doctors in residency in city
hospitals. "I wanted to do this myself," said Kelli Conlin,
the executive director of the group, as she called the
mayor to the stage, "because I wanted you to know
from the bottom of our hearts in this organization how
much your leadership has meant on this issue."
</P>
<P>
Bloomberg could not help but smile. "I can at least go
back and report that this is a friendly crowd," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Early polls have indicated that Bloomberg, a Republican running in an
overwhelmingly Democratic city, could be vulnerable to a popular Democratic
candidate, even though the Democrats seeking the nomination have been
struggling to find a message that resonates. Bloomberg's party affiliation
and his reluctance to criticize Republicans in Congress over issues
that many say are important to New York leave him
open to criticism and more.
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, Bloomberg had a chance to tell an important constituency
that he is more in sync with their thinking than
with that of many Republicans leading the party nationally, especially
on abortion.
</P>
<P>
The mayor picked an issue -- availability of the morning-after pill
-- that is being debated across the country. "He has
stepped into the fray, sided with science and women's health,
and is pushing a program that will directly reduce the
number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in our city," said
Robert Jaffee, deputy director of Naral Pro-Choice New York.
</P>
<P>
"I make this promise," Bloomberg said at the meeting. "As mayor
and as a private citizen, I will continue to do
what I can to make a difference, whether in the
city, in Albany, in Washington or anywhere that the rights
or our daughters, our sisters, our friends or our colleagues
are threatened."
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, Conlin was asked if the unqualified praise for
the mayor amounted to an endorsement. She said the group's
endorsement committee had not yet met, but added, "We are
happy and proud to stand with him today."
