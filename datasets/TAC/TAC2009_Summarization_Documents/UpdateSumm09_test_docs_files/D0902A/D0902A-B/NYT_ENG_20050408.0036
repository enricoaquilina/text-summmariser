EDITORIAL: THE WORST OF THE BAD NOMINEES
</HEADLINE>

The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, April
8:
</P>
<P>
When a president picks his administration officials, the opposing political party
can't expect to be thrilled with the selections. Right now,
Democrats in the Senate are trying to block the nominations
of three men chosen by George W. Bush for important
posts: John Bolton for U.N. ambassador, Stephen Johnson for head
of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Dr. Lester Crawford for
commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. They have excellent
reasons for opposition in each case, but some reasons are
more excellent than others.
</P>
<P>
Bolton stands out because he is not only bad in a
policy sense, but also unqualified for the post to which
he's been named. At a minimum, the U.S. representative to
the United Nations should be a person who believes it
is a good idea. Bolton has never made secret his
disdain for the United Nations, for multilateralism, and for consensus-seeking
diplomacy in general.
</P>
<P>
When the Senate Foreign Relations Committee begins taking testimony on Bolton's
nomination next week, it is also expected to hear other
charges about his fitness, like allegations that when he was
undersecretary of state for arms control, he tried to distort
intelligence reports by intimidating analysts who disagreed with him. After
the invasion of Iraq, complaints that top advisers to the
president had attempted to make intelligence reports conform to a
preconceived conclusion about Saddam Hussein's weapons programs were often aimed
in Bolton's direction.
</P>
<P>
All of this is very much to the point. When the
country chooses an ambassador to the United Nations, it ought
to avoid picking someone whose bullying style of leadership symbolizes
everything that created the current estrangement between the United States
and most of the world. One of the goals of
Bush's second term was supposed to be rapprochement with other
nations, whose assistance the United States desperately needs to curb
the proliferation of the real weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee are fighting to actually kill
Bolton's nomination; all eyes are on Lincoln Chafee, the moderate
Republican swing vote who has a record of being very
supportive of the United Nations. In the case of Crawford
and Johnson, a few senators are threatening to block what
would be easy confirmations by putting a hold on each
nomination before it goes to the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
The right to block a nomination, like the right to filibuster
a bill on the Senate floor, is one of the
few tools the minority party has for affecting public policy.
But it needs to be used with discretion. Johnson, in
particular, seems like a bad choice for such a fight.
His main drawback is that he is unlikely to put
up the slightest resistance to Bush's policies, which have not
been helpful in protecting the nation's clean air and water.
Unfortunately, that will be the case whether this particular nomination
goes through or not, and the president clearly has the
capacity to find a less qualified yes-man for the job.
</P>
<P>
Sens. Barbara Boxer of California and Ben Nelson of Florida are
threatening to stall Johnson's confirmation unless he promises to end
a suspended Florida study in which families would be paid
to allow researchers to study the effects of pesticides on
their children -- a macabre investigation co-sponsored by the American
Chemistry Council. The idea that the EPA would pay families
to continue exposing their children to potentially dangerous chemicals is
on its face outrageous -- and made worse by the
study's ghoulish acronym, Cheers, for Children's Environmental Exposure Research Study.
But the study has already been stopped, pending a review.
It would have been a good sign of independence if
Johnson had called a complete halt, but there seems little
likelihood that the study will ever be revived. This seems
like a weak reason to stop a Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
In the case of the FDA, Sens. Hillary Clinton of New
York and Patty Murray of Washington are threatening to keep
the nomination from the floor unless Crawford prompts his agency
to make a long-delayed decision on whether the so-called morning-after
pill may be sold over the counter.
</P>
<P>
Their cause is righteous. If taken within 72 hours of unprotected
sex, the pills can end unwanted pregnancies -- so making
them readily available could drastically cut down on the number
of abortions. Two committees of expert advisers voted overwhelmingly in
favor of selling the medication over the counter, but the
FDA has failed to do anything. Another proposal, which would
limit its sale to women over 16, has also been
pending.
</P>
<P>
Crawford has been the deputy or acting commissioner during a very
troubled period for the drug agency. He presided over fiascos
involving cox-2 painkillers, antidepressants, and other drugs. He is clearly
afraid to let his agency make a decision on the
morning-after pill that will get him in hot water with
social conservatives or with those who believe that the FDA
should be run on the basis of science, not theology.
That timidity doesn't suggest that he would impose needed reform
in other areas.
</P>
<P>
The Senate should vote on Crawford and defeat his nomination on
the merits. If the Democratic senators are going to choose
a disastrous Bush nomination to block, our choice is Bolton's.
