Poll says confusion over condoms puts health of youths at risk 
in Britain

<P>
Only one-third of British teens use 
condoms consistently, a  health charity said in a report Thursday 
warning that ignorance about sexual health was putting youth at 
risk.
</P>
<P>
Out of 1,300 people aged 16 to 18 surveyed for the Brook study, 
a majority said they had used a preservative at least once, but only 
37 percent of males said they used them consistently and only 30 
percent made their partners use them.
</P>
<P>
"Condom confusion" increased their risk for sexually transmitted 
infections (STIs) since the devices were used primarily to prevent 
pregnancy rather than for health protection, and were often "applied 
too late, or removed too early," Brook said.
</P>
<P>
General ignorance about sexual health risks was widespread: 52 
percent of respondents thought chlamydia affected only women, and 31 
percent thought sexually transmitted infections could be caught from 
a toilet seat.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-four percent also did not know that the "morning after" 
contraceptive pill could remain effective for up to 72 hours after 
sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
There was also a significant gap between teens' general concern 
about STIs and HIV/AIDS, and whether they considered themselves 
personally at risk of disease.
</P>
<P>
While 89 percent of men and 82 percent of women polled expressed 
general worry, only 61 percent and 50 percent, respectively, thought 
they might be at risk.
</P>
<P>
Jan Barlow, chief executive of Brook, said the report should 
serve to "focus" attention on young people's sexual health.
</P>
<P>
"Many (youths) think that STIs are something that happen to 
other people -- they simply don't believe that the risk applies to 
them personally," she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Britain's sexual health crisis won't go away until this problem 
is tackled head-on in sexual health awareness campaigns and in 
improved sex and relationships education in schools."
</P>
<P>
Brook also found that schools were the most frequently cited 
source of information about STIs -- much more so than parents, 
friends or literature.
</P>
<P>
According to the non-profit youth advisory organization, Britain 
has seen a huge rise in acute STIs since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chlamydia cases increased by 190 percent between 1995 and 2003, 
gonorrhea by 137 percent. Syphillis, even though it only affects a 
small number of people, went up by 1,062 percent. The rise in STIs 
was much higher across the board for young people.
