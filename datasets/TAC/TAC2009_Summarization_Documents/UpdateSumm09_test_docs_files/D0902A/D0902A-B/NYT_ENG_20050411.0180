'MORNING-AFTER' PILL BILL COULD COMPLICATE ROMNEY BID
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Massachusetts lawmakers are pushing a bill that would allow certain pharmacists
in the state to dispense the "morning-after pill" without a
prescription and require hospitals to offer it to rape victims,
setting up a debate on a hot-button social issue that
could present problems for Governor Mitt Romney as he mulls
a presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
When he ran for governor in 2002, Romney told Planned Parenthood
that he supported expanding access to the emergency contraception pill,
a high dose of hormones that women can take to
prevent pregnancy up to five days after sex. But he
didn't elaborate, and Monday a spokesman for Romney said the
governor was not prepared to disclose his position on the
measure because he wants to examine it if it reaches
his desk.
</P>
<P>
The Legislature's joint public health committee will hold a hearing on
the bill Wednesday, and may vote as soon as May
4 to send it to the House and Senate floors.
The Senate approved the bill last year, but former House
Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, a devout Catholic, blocked a House
vote.
</P>
<P>
Representative Peter Koutoujian, the Waltham Democrat who co-chairs the public health
panel and backs the bill, said the bill has a
better chance of passing this time around. Sixteen senators and
65 representatives have co-sponsored the bill.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the leadership is more supportive of this. Maybe it comes
down to where the governor stands, and whether we have
two-thirds in support," Koutoujian said, referring to the margin necessary
for the House and Senate to override a Romney veto.
"But we seem to have a window of opportunity here,
and I'm hopeful."
</P>
<P>
On a number of social issues, including gay marriage, sex education,
and embryonic stem-cell research, Romney has struggled to find a
sliver of ground between the views of the Bay State's
moderate voters and the conservative voters who wield tremendous influence
in the Republican presidential primaries. He faces a similar challenge
on the question of emergency contraception.
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church and other abortion opponents oppose the pill because
they believe it quashes a nascent human life by preventing
the implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. Abortion
rights groups argue it will reduce the number of abortions
by preventing unwanted pregnancies, and insist it is especially important
for women who have been raped or abused.
</P>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the emergency
contraception pill as a form of prescription birth control in
1998. But the FDA has refused to grant a request
by the pill's manufacturer to sell it over the counter,
despite the overwhelming vote of an advisory panel in 2003
recommending the move. In the absence of federal action, six
states - Maine, California, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, and New Mexico
- have allowed pharmacists to dispense it without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured by Barr Laboratories, the emergency contraception pill, called Plan B,
could prevent as many as 1.5-million unintended pregnancies a year
and prevent as many as 700,000 abortions nationally, according to
medical and women's organizations that petitioned the FDA in 2003.
The emergency contraception pill is not to be confused with
RU-486, which is used to end pregnancies up to 49
days after the beginning of the last menstrual cycle.
</P>
<P>
Under the Massachusetts legislation, only pharmacists who have gone through a
special training program and have a collaborative agreement with a
doctor would be allowed to distribute the emergency contraception pill
without a prescription. The training program would be approved by
the commissioner of public health to ensure what the legislation
calls "quality assurance." The collaborative agreement would ensure that the
pharmacist works with a doctor overseeing how the pill is
dispensed.
</P>
<P>
Most of the state's hospitals - 12 out of 71, according
to a 2004 poll by abortion rights groups - already
offer the pill to rape victims, but the bill would
require that all of them do so.
</P>
<P>
"It's very, very important to women, particularly women who are victims
of domestic violence. It's like being a victim twice if
you've been raped, you go to a hospital, and you
aren't offered emergency contraception," said Dianne Luby, the executive director
of the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts. "It's just a
question of access. Not every single woman lives within a
couple of blocks of a pharmacy, and not every woman
can easily access their doctor over the weekend."
</P>
<P>
Marie Sturgis, legislative director of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, described the
effects of the emergency contraception pill as "a chemical abortion."
</P>
<P>
"This is going to abort that embryo that is trying to
implant in the uterus," Sturgis said.
</P>
<P>
Although the pill may work for up to five days after
sex, its effectiveness declines over time. If taken within 24
hours, it is 95 percent effective in preventing pregnancy, according
to Planned Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
On a questionnaire Planned Parenthood gave to the gubernatorial candidates in
2002, Romney answered "yes" to the question, "Do you support
efforts to increase access to emergency contraception?" Romney says he
personally opposes abortion, but on the questionnaire he also expressed
support for "the substance of the Supreme Court decision in
Roe v. Wade" and promised not to change the status
quo on abortion in Massachusetts.
