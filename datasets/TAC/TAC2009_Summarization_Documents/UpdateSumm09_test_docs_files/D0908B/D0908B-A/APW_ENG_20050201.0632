<P>
The British government expressed grave concerns Tuesday about political
developments in Nepal, after the king dismissed the prime minister and declared
a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Office Minister Douglas Alexander summoned the Nepalese ambassador in
London and conveyed Britain's concern at King Gyanendra's actions.
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely concerned to hear of the king of Nepal's dismissal of his prime
minister this morning," said Alexander.
</P>
<P>
"This action will increase the risk of instability in Nepal, undermining the
institutions of democracy and constitutional monarchy in the country. We call
for the immediate restitution of multiparty democracy, and appeal for calm and
restraint on all sides during this difficult time."
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in three years that the king has taken control of the
tiny South Asian constitutional monarchy, a throwback to the era of absolute
power enjoyed by Nepal's monarchs before King Birendra, Gyanendra's elder
brother, introduced democracy in 1990.
</P>
<P>
King Gyanendra denied his takeover was a coup, although soldiers surrounded the
houses of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and other government leaders.
Telephone and Internet lines were snapped, flights diverted and civil liberties
severely curtailed.
