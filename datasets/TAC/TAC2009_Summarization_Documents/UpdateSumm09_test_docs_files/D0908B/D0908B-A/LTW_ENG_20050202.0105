Nepal's King Gyanendra named a new Cabinet
Wednesday, a day after dismissing the government and declaring
absolute power in a surprise move that he said was aimed at restoring
democracy and ending a nine-year Maoist rebellion.

<P>
Contact with the outside world remained limited and telephone and
Internet service, severed on Tuesday, had yet to be fully restored.
Dozens of politicians have been arrested and many others have gone
into hiding, an opposition politician told the Associated Press.
Soldiers and riot police patrolled the capital, Katmandu.
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of serious unrest, however, and international
flights to Katmandu resumed on a limited basis. Traffic was moving
normally in the crowded capital and most shops were open, according to
news reports.

State radio said that Gyanendra would head the 10-member Cabinet
but gave few other details. ``The king has expressed confidence that
everyone will support and cooperate with the new Cabinet,'' the palace
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In announcing his decision on Tuesday, Gyanendra said he was
dissolving the government and firing the prime minister -- for the
second time in three years -- because the government had failed in its
duty to hold parliamentary elections and curb the Maoist insurgency,
in which about 10,000 people have died. He vowed to restore democracy
in three years.

Nepal's new home minister, Dan Bahadur Shahi, who was sworn in on
Wednesday, said the government would soon begin laying the groundwork
for resuming peace talks with the Maoists. ``The king has the chief
executive authority now, so it will be easier for the rebels to come
for peace talks,'' Shahi said on state radio. ``It is what they have
been wanting.''
</P>
<P>
Gyanendra's power grab has been widely condemned by Nepal's allies,
including the United States, Britain and India, all of which have been
providing the government with various forms of aid in its struggle
against the rebels. India's Foreign Ministry announced Wednesday that
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would not attend a regional summit in
Bangladesh, where Gyanendra had been planning to represent Nepal.
Bangladesh postponed the summit in response.
</P>
<P>
In addition to dissolving the government, Gyanendra suspended a
number of key civil liberties, including freedom of the press. Such
measures ``put the Nepalese people at even greater risk of human
rights abuses,'' said a statement issued jointly by Amnesty
International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of
Jurists.
