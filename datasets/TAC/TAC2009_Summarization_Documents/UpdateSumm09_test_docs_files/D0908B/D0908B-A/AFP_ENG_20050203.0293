Japan, the top donor to aid-dependent 
Nepal, on Thursday voiced concern at King Gyanendra's power grab and 
urged him to restore democracy and release any detained political 
leaders.

Joining a chorus of international condemnation over the king's 
sacking of the government, Japan said it hoped "Nepal will recover 
its peace and stability as soon as possible on the basis of 
democracy and constitutional monarchy."

<P>
"If political leaders are being detained, the government of 
Japan is deeply concerned about the situation and strongly urges 
that they be released and that the freedom guaranteed by the 
constitution restored promptly," a foreign ministry statement said.

<P>
Japan also urged Maoist rebels fighting to overthrow the 
monarchy "to achieve peace through dialogue."

Japan gave Nepal close to four billion yen (38.5 million 
dollars) in grant aid in the 2003 fiscal year and the following year 
relieved 21 billion yen (202.5 million dollars) of its debt, the 
Japanese government says.

King Gyanendra on Tuesday sacked prime minister Sher Bahadur 
Deuba for the second time in three years and assumed control. He 
accused elected leaders of failing to control the Maoist uprising 
which has claimed some 11,000 lives since 1996.
