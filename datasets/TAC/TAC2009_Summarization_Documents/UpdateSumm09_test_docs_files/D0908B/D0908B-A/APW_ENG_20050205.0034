Nepal's king may seek to play the China card against Maoist rebels, analysts say

<P>
A power grab by Nepal's King Gyanendra provoked condemnation from his most
influential allies, the United States and India, but China remained neutral _ a
sign of Beijing's growing ties with the Himalayan nation, some analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
Beijing said Gyanendra's move to dismiss the government and impose a state of
emergency in Nepal last Tuesday was an "internal matter."
</P>
<P>
China's reaction, coupled with a recent move by Gyanendra to close the Nepal
office of the Tibetan spiritual leader-in-exile, the Dalai Lama _ whom Beijing
despises and labels a dangerous separatist _ has prompted speculation among
Indian analysts that the king wants to enlist China's support in fighting the
Maoist rebels.
</P>
<P>
Gyanendra "must have factored in China into his calculations," said Kalim
Bahadur, a Nepal expert and retired professor of international relations in New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"Any intelligent ruler in Nepal would try to take advantage of its strategic
position," he said. "And Gyanendra is a clever man."
</P>
<P>
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said on Thursday he had no
information on whether Nepal _ a mountainous nation sandwiched between India and
China _ had asked for Beijing's help in the fight against the rebels, but he was
quick to condemn the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Although Nepal's Maoist rebels claim to be inspired by Chinese revolutionary
leader Mao Zedong, Beijing has long distanced itself from the
insurgents.
</P>
<P>
"They steal the name ... (of) China's great leader, Mao Zedong. We feel angry,"
Kong said.
</P>
<P>
He added that as "a close neighbor of Nepal, China considers its peace and
stability most important."
</P>
<P>
S.D. Muni, a former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said Beijing has become
increasingly concerned by growing U.S.-Nepal ties, which the government of Prime
Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba _ dismissed by Gyanendra on Tuesday _ had actively
sought.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Chinese) viewed Deuba as too close to India and the United States,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The closing of the Dalai Lama's office and a recent crackdown on Tibetan
refugees _ both at the instigation of the king _ could reflect closer ties with
Beijing, Muni said.
</P>
<P>
Communist troops marched into Tibet in 1950. Beijing says it has been part of
China for centuries and has spent decades trying to suppress pro-independence
sentiment. In the past, Katmandu had been tolerant of Tibetans fleeing China's
communist rule, with thousands of them settling there.
</P>
<P>
Gyanendra's shift toward China echoes similar moves his father, King Mahendra,
made in the 1960s. Mahendra, himself an absolute monarch, also sought to forge
closer ties with China to counter India's dominance in the Himalayan
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Beijing was eager for improved relations with Nepal as a wedge
against India with whom it fought a brief border war in 1962.
</P>
<P>
But if the king hopes to get China on board against the rebels, he'll have to do
so without offending Nepal's biggest backers _ India and the United States, both
of which have strongly criticized Gyanendra's power play.
</P>
<P>
The United States has given Katmandu millions of dollars in military and
development aid since Nepal signed on to Washington's war on terror following
the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Americans haven't made any decision on the continuation of aid.
"It's a fluid situation," said David Kennedy, spokesman at U.S. Embassy in New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said the U.S. ambassador met the king's newly appointed foreign minister
and conveyed Washington's "concerns about the setback to democracy in
Nepal."
</P>
<P>
India has also held off commenting on the status of military aid to Nepal and
has established contacts with the new government.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi wants to secure its border and minimize links between Nepal's rebels
and its own Maoist insurgents. India's interests in the Himalayan nation
actually go beyond strategic concerns, drawing from the two neighbors'
historical ties, and it is unlikely to back away from support for Nepal in its
fight against the Maoist rebels.
</P>
<P>
"India will try to engage the king. It will not do anything dramatic," said Udai
Bhaskar at the New Delhi-based Institute of Defense and Strategic
Analysis.
