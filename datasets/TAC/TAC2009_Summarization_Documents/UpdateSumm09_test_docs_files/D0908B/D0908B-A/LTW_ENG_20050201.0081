Nepali King Dissolves Government, Claims Absolute Power

<P>
The leader of Nepal, King Gyanendra, unexpectedly
dissolved the government and claimed absolute power Tuesday,
justifying the moves as necessary to restore peace and democracy in
the face of a Maoist insurgency that has spread to nearly every corner
of the picturesque Himalayan nation.
</P>
<P>
Political opponents described the action as a coup. International
air service was suspended, phone and Internet connections were cut and
the army was reported to be patrolling streets in the capital of
Katmandu. Security personnel surrounded the home of the prime
minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, according to news agency reports.
</P>
<P>
In a rare televised address, Gyanendra, 58, said he had decided to
dissolve the government -- the second time he has done so in the past
three years -- because it had failed in its duty to hold parliamentary
elections or end the Maoist rebellion. He said he would form a new
cabinet under his leadership and vowed to restore ``effective
democracy within the next three years.''
</P>
<P>
But the king also imposed a state of emergency and suspended a
number of constitutional liberties, including the rights to free
speech, assembly and privacy, according a statement that was
summarized by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the moves added to the sense in the region that
Nepal is in a downward spiral, with no clear path toward repairing its
dysfunctional politics or bringing an end to the violence that has
claimed an estimated 10,000 lives since the Maoists launched their
``people's war'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Gyanendra's announcement poses a policy challenge for the United
States, which has provided Nepali security forces with about $22
million in light weaponry and other forms of military aid during the
past several years. Human rights groups have condemned both sides in
the conflict for widespread abuses, but U.S. officials have justified
the aid on the grounds that without it, the Maoists might win -- and
Nepal could join the roster of failed states hospitable to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In Katmandu this afternoon, the U.S. Embassy issued a statement
expressing concern at the ``apparent setback for democracy'' and said
its diplomats would be ``consulting with Washington'' on an
appropriate response.
</P>
<P>
The conflict is also of deep concern to neighboring India, which is
waging its own struggle against Maoist rebels -- some with links to
the Nepali insurgents -- in a number of eastern states and has
provided Nepal with military aid. In a strongly worded statement
Tuesday, India's Foreign Ministry condemned Gyanendra's announcement
as ``a serious setback to the cause of democracy in Nepal'' and ``a
cause of grave concern.''
</P>
<P>
With no phone or Internet links to Katmandu, details of the
situation there were sketchy. A New Delhi-based Western diplomat who
spoke with a colleague in Katmandu Tuesday afternoon said the
colleague had described the city as ``relatively calm,'' with streets
filled with traffic and shops operating normally. But the mood was
clearly tense. Anticipating possible unrest, residents formed long
lines at grocery stores and gas stations to stock up on supplies, and
armored vehicles with mounted machine guns patrolled the streets, news
agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
Against that backdrop, some international air carriers canceled
their flights into the capital, while others were turned back by
Nepalese authorities before they could land.
</P>
<P>
For the past two centuries, Gyanendra's family has dominated Nepal,
a country of 25 million people that is as impoverished as it is
breathtaking. The king's action Tuesday effectively restored the
monarchy to the position of absolute power it occupied before
Gyanendra's elder brother, King Birendra, established democracy in
1990.
