<P>
Japan on Monday extended 17.1 million 
dollars in aid to Nepal while urging King Gyanendra to return the 
country to democracy.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government announced the non-military aid in a 
statement here that also said Tokyo was "strongly urging that 
political leaders be released and that freedom guaranteed by the 
constitutional be restored promptly."
</P>
<P>
Tokyo "believes that strengthening of the democratization 
process under a system of democracy and a constitutional monarchy 
will facilitate a sustainable development in Nepal," the Japanese 
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Japan also urge the Maoists to achieve peace through dialogue," 
it added.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after Nepal's Finance Minister Madhukar 
Shumsher Rana said international donors want Gyanendra to end 
emergency rule in the aid-dependent kingdom before promising 
continued development support.
</P>
<P>
Last month Gyanendra dismissed the impoverished country's 
government, imposed emergency rule and suspended civil liberties, 
saying he did so to tackle a nine-year Maoist revolt that has 
claimed more than 11,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Nepal relies on international donor aid and loans for more than 
half its development budget. Its economy has been in growing 
shambles amid the mounting revolt which has scared away tourists, 
another major income source for the Himalayan nation.
