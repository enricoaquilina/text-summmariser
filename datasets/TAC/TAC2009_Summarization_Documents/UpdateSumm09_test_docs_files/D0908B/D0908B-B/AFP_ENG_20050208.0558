<P>
Nine UN human rights experts on Tuesday 
expressed deep concern at King Gyanendra's seizure of power in Nepal 
last week and called for the restoration of democracy.

The arrest of political figures extended from the whole cabinet 
all the way down to middle level party workers and student leaders, 
while the military was running all media outfits in the country, the 
group warned.

<P>
"We are deeply concerned at the actions taken by King Gyanendra 
of Nepal to dissolve the constitutional government ... and to assume 
direct power," the experts said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
"The wave of arrests and detentions, and the actions against the 
media are a serious setback for the country.
</P>
<P>
"We consider that steps should be taken to reinstall democratic 
institutions and to protect Nepalese citizens and their 
representatives, as well as human rights defenders, journalists, 
lawyers and political leaders," they added.
</P>
<P>
Human rights activists and critics of the regime were caught in 
the clampdown and some had gone into hiding to avoid arrest, the 
experts said.
</P>
<P>
The nine included UN special rapporteurs on torture, freedom of 
expression, arbitrary detention, involuntary disappearances and the 
independence of the judiciary.
