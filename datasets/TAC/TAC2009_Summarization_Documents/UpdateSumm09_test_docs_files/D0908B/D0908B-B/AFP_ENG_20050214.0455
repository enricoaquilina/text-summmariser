<P>
US ambassador to Nepal James 
Moriarity has been asked to return to Washington for consultations, 
the State Department said Monday, two weeks after the country's 
monarch sacked the government, declared a state of emergency, and 
took absolute power.

<P>
In a statement, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher 
decried the deteriorating conditions in Nepal, including the arrests 
of several pro-democracy activists, since the February 1 power grab 
by King Gyanendra.
</P>
<P>
"We remain deeply troubled by developments in Nepal," Boucher 
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"King Gyanendra's dismissal of the government, declaration of a 
state of emergency, detention of politicians, human rights workers 
and students and the suspension of fundamental constitutional rights 
is a step away from Nepal's path toward democracy."
</P>
<P>
During a weeklong stay in Washington, Boucher said, Moriarty 
will meet with US officials to assess developments in Nepal, while 
the US government "considers what steps we will take to support the 
Nepalese people's quest for democracy, peace, security and 
development. He will then return to Nepal," Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States supports a peaceful, prosperous and 
democratic Nepal," the spokesman continued.
</P>
<P>
"We call on those in Nepal who are committed to the country's 
future to engage in meaningful political discussions leading to 
national elections," said Boucher.
