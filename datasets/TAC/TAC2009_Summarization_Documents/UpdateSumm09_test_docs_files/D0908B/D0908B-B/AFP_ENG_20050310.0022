<P>
Nepal, facing growing world pressure 
to free political detainees, freed Thursday eight party leaders and 
activists arrested after King Gyanendra's power takeover, a party 
official said.
</P>
<P>
Among those released were former state foreign affairs minister 
Prakash Sharan Mahat, who was a member of the four-party coalition 
government dismissed by Gyanendra February 1.
</P>
<P>
"Eight political leaders and activists were released on 
Wednesday," Bhanubhakta Dhakal, an official of the Nepal Communist 
Party-United Marxist and Leninist, told AFP:
</P>
<P>
Others freed included student leaders and former lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
But two former prime ministers Girija Prasad Koirala, Nepal's 
first elected prime minister, and Sher Bahadur Deuba, who was fired 
by the king when he seized power, remained under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
King Gyanendra seized control of Nepal on February 1, firing the 
government, imposing emergency rule and vowing to tackle an 
increasingly bloody Maoist revolt that has claimed 11,000 lives 
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
He has given himself three years to restore peace and 
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Rights groups say over 400 activists are in detention or under 
house arrest.
</P>
<P>
But Nepal's royal-appointed foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey 
said in New Delhi that "very few people are in detention."
</P>
<P>
Word of the release of the eight came after the World Bank said 
late Wednesday it was freezing release of more aid to Nepal, while 
it assessed events on the ground including protection of human 
rights.
</P>
<P>
Nepal relies on international donor aid and loans for more than 
half its development budget to prop up an economy devastated by the 
Maoist insurgency.
</P>
<P>
Last month, India and Britain suspended military aid to help 
Nepal's ill-equipped army battle the Maoists and called for the king 
to restore democracy. The United States is mulling similar action.
</P>
<P>
India has told the king to mend fences with Nepal's politial 
parties, saying Gyanendra's move had only served to deepen the 
crisis facing the country.
