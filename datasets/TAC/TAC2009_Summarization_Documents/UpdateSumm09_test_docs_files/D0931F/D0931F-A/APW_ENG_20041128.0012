Pakistan downplays CIA report on leaks of nuclear technology to Iran,
Libya
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistan has defended its efforts to halt leaks of nuclear technology
amid suggestions that Iran's nuclear weapons program received more
help from a renegade Pakistani scientist than previously disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The CIA _ which provides the U.S. Congress with six-monthly updates
on reported efforts by Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea and Syria to
obtain chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons
technology _ posted an unclassified version on its Web site this
week.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the report, The New York Times said it indicates that
bomb-making designs provided by Abdul Qadeer Khan to Iran in the
1990s were more significant than Washington has said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman Masood Khan criticized the Times
report, saying it was "based on flimsy evidence, hearsay and snippets
of conversations.
</P>
<P>
"The CIA report does not mention any 'designs for weapons or
bomb-making components.' Weapons and bomb-making are the writer's own
creative insertions," the spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"In the past year, Pakistan has conducted an inquiry to unearth an
illicit network of international black-marketeers, dismantled it and
shared the results of the inquiry transparently with the people of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has been cooperating with the IAEA and the international
community to thwart international black-marketeers from proliferating
sensitive nuclear technology," Masood Khan said.
</P>
<P>
The International Atomic Energy Agency _ the United Nations' nuclear
watchdog _ has been investigating Iran's nuclear activities for about
18 months, but the agency remains unable to determine if nearly two
decades of Iranian nuclear activities were purely peaceful or if the
government had a secret weapons agenda.
</P>
<P>
Tehran says its activities were for generating electricity, while the
United States says they were for making weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iran and European negotiators have reached a tentative compromise
committing Tehran to freeze all uranium enrichment activities,
diplomats say, but the Iranian government still must approve the
deal.
</P>
<P>
A.Q. Khan, considered a national hero for leading the development of
Pakistan's nuclear deterrent, admitted in February to passing nuclear
technology to other countries. He was pardoned by President Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, who cited his service to the nation, but remains
under virtual house arrest in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
"Iran's nuclear program received significant assistance in the past
from the proliferation network headed by Pakistani scientist A.Q.
Khan," the CIA report said. "The A.Q. Khan network provided Iran with
designs for Pakistan's older centrifuges as well as designs for more
advanced and efficient models and components."
</P>
<P>
It said Libya disclosed receiving similar assistance from Khan, head
of Pakistan's nuclear program from the 1970s until 2001.
</P>
<P>
"Even in cases where states took action to stem such transfers,
knowledgeable individuals or non-state purveyors of WMD- and
missile-related materials and technology could act outside government
constraints," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Times focused on the phrase "designs for more advanced and
efficient models, and components," indicating that "components"
refers to weapons components.
</P>
<P>
The Times said American officials have publicly referred only to the
role of A.Q. Khan's network in supplying Iran with designs for older
Pakistani centrifuges used to enrich uranium, but that they also
suspect it provided a warhead design.
</P>
<P>
Citing a tape it obtained of a closed-door speech to a private group,
the paper quoted former CIA Director George J. Tenet describing A.Q.
Khan as "at least as dangerous as Osama bin Laden" because of his
role in providing nuclear technology to other countries.
