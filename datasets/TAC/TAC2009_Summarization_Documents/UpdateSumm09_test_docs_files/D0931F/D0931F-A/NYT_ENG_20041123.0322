A new report from the CIA says the arms trafficking network led by
the Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan provided Iran's nuclear program
with "significant assistance," including the designs for "advanced
and efficient" weapons components.
</P>
<P>
The unclassified version of the report, posted Tuesday on the
agency's Web site (www.cia.gov), does not say explicitly whether
Khan's network sold Iran complete plans for building a warhead, as
the network is known to have done for Libya and perhaps North Korea.
</P>
<P>
But it suggests that U.S. intelligence agencies now believe that the
bomb-making designs provided by the network to Iran in the 1990s were
more significant than the U.S. government had previously disclosed.
</P>
<P>
In a recent closed-door speech to a private group, George J. Tenet,
the former director of central intelligence, described Khan, the
father of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, as being "at least as
dangerous as Osama bin Laden" because of his role in providing
nuclear technology to other countries. A tape recording of the speech
was obtained by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued to Congress, is an annual update, required by law,
on countries' acquisition of illicit weapons technology. The posting
of the unclassified version on the agency's Web site on Tuesday comes
two days before a meeting in Vienna, Austria, of the International
Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear monitoring group,
is scheduled to review the status of Iran's weapons program.
</P>
<P>
"The Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to
Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions" is
the first to be issued by the agency since last November. Its focus
is the six-month period from July to December 2003, but it also
discusses broader trends.
</P>
<P>
The report says the agency remains convinced that Iran is pursuing a
clandestine weapons program, despite claims to the contrary by the
Tehran government. It says Iran's stated willingness to allow
inspections by the IAEA is likely to prevent Tehran from using its
declared nuclear sites to produce weapons, but warns that it may use
covert facilities for those purposes.
</P>
<P>
The CIA began to infiltrate Khan's network in the late 1990s,
according to the account Tenet is now spelling out in his speeches.
That operation led to the unraveling of the network's ties to Libya
and the unmasking last year of Libya's illicit weapons program.
