<TEXT>
<P>
Public enemy No. 1 for most Americans is Osama
bin Laden, the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks
who continues to threaten more deadly strikes against the United
States.
</P>
<P>
In close competition for that dubious title should be Abdul Qadeer
Khan, 68, also known as A.Q. Khan, the Pakistani nuclear
scientist who oversaw the spread of nuclear weapons to U.S.
adversaries, possibly including al-Qaida, bin Laden's terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
Khan arguably has done more to undermine U.S. security than bin
Laden. He has confessed to transferring nuclear weapons know-how to
Iran, Libya and North Korea. U.S. officials and investigators at
the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency are still searching for
other possible customers who possess Khan's digitized blueprints for nuclear-specific
manufacturing equipment and how-to manuals for running uranium enrichment centrifuges,
much of it on handy compact disks.
</P>
<P>
Since the invention of nuclear weapons 60 years ago, no one
has done more to spread those weapons to more countries
than Khan. The Khan network of suppliers, middlemen and front
companies flourished across 30 countries. He was a for-profit nuclear
proliferator, with a one-stop atomic emporium that allowed shoppers to
buy bomb designs, centrifuges for enriching uranium from uranium hexafluoride,
and consulting services to help get weapons plants up and
running.
</P>
<P>
-- "At least as dangerous as Osama bin Laden" -- former
CIA Director George Tenet.
</P>
<P>
-- "A very serious proliferatorvery dangerous to the world" -- Secretary
of State Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
-- Khan's nuclear smuggling network is "mind-boggling" and "beyond anyone's imagination"
-- Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, chief of the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
</P>
<P>
-- "A monstrous creature" -- Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., top Democrat
on the House Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
-- Khan "has poured kerosene on the nuclear proliferation embers." --
Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
-- "He did huge damage" to U.S. security -- Graham Allison,
former assistant secretary of defense and author of "Nuclear Terrorism:
The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
-- Khan is "an evil genius, a Dr. Strangelove" -- Robert
Oakley, former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Despite his notoriety, A. Q. Khan has escaped the "most-wanted" label
applied to bin Laden because of a delicate diplomatic and
political minuet linking Khan, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and President
Bush. Each man for his own reasons has thrown a
cloak of silence over what is emerging as the biggest
nuclear scandal in history.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the missing bin Laden -- target of a
global manhunt -- Khan's whereabouts are well known. He is
living under house arrest in a tony section of Islamabad,
the capital of Pakistan, as part of a deal that
Musharraf unveiled last year.
</P>
<P>
That deal gave Khan a full pardon and allowed him to
keep the millions of dollars he is believed to have
netted from the illicit sales. In exchange, Khan took responsibility
for the crimes and agreed to the house arrest --
a punishment that forced Khan, a high profile and beloved
figure in Pakistan, to vanish from public life and scientific
endeavor.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. alert to Musharraf apparently triggered Khan's confession.
</P>
<P>
According to Secretary of State Colin Powell, the United States by
early 2004 had amassed so much evidence that Khan was
peddling nuclear secrets that Powell telephoned Musharraf and told him
to "deal with" Khan.
</P>
<P>
"I said to him, "We know so much about this that
we're going to go public with it, and within a
few weeks, okay? And you need to deal with this
before you have to deal with it publicly."'
</P>
<P>
The next step came on Feb. 4 when, in a dramatic
televised speech, Khan confessed and -- without naming the countries
that had received his services -- accepted "full responsibility" for
exporting nuclear technology. "My dear brothers and sisters, I have
chosen to appear before you to offer my deepest regrets
and unqualified apologies," he said, speaking in English. The nuclear
proliferation, he said, was "initiated at my behest."
</P>
<P>
"I was confronted with the evidence and the findings, and I
have voluntarily admitted that much of it is true and
accurate," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was quick to absolve the Musharraf government of any involvement.
While some of his colleagues at the A.Q. Khan Research
Laboratories -- Pakistan's top nuclear facility -- are also under
investigation for trafficking, "There was never any kind of authorization
for these activities by the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The next day, it was Musharraf's turn to appear before the
TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
Dressed in an Army jacket, khaki trousers and combat boots, the
Pakistani leader announced at a news conference that he had
pardoned Khan for spreading the potential for nuclear terror. The
Pakistani president signed off by telling how much he admired
the scientist.
</P>
<P>
"All the proliferation, unfortunately, was under the supervision or orders of
Dr. A.Q. Khan," Musharraf told a news conference, quickly adding
that Khan is "still my hero" for developing atomic weapons
for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Dr. A.Q. Khan has made Pakistan a nuclear power," said Musharraf.
"I want to protect his honor."
</P>
<P>
Musharraf insisted that the Pakistani government had no knowledge of Khan's
extensive proliferation network because the scientist had amassed enormous autonomy
during the previous two decades as he developed nuclear weapons
for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The general accused the governments of Libya and Iran of ratting
on Khan to the IAEA. "Muslim brothers did not ask
us before giving our names," Musharraf complained.
</P>
<P>
Khan has been under house arrest since.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf's eagerness to whisk the matter out of sight reflects a
harsh political fact of life for the 61-year-old general. Khan
is a hero in Pakistan and throughout the Islamic world
for perfecting his country's first nuclear weapon -- and, by
definition, the much-anticipated first "Muslim bomb." Pakistan exploded a series
of atomic bombs in 1998, bringing that country into nuclear
parity with archrival India, with whom it has fought three
wars.
</P>
<P>
Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to Sri Lanka and adviser
to prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, says Khan
is so popular in Pakistan that if he announced he
wanted his countrymen to give him money, "150 million Pakistanis
would give it to him. Pakistani kids would empty their
pockets for him." Haqqani teaches international relations at Boston University
and is author of the forthcoming book, "Pakistan between Mosque
and Military."
</P>
<P>
Musharraf presides over a nation festering with Islamic militants, with large
segments of the population sympathetic to al-Qaida and remnants of
the fundamentalist Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which the U.S. military
toppled three years ago. The general is in no position
to get tough with Khan by, for example, putting him
on trial, especially since such a step would appear to
be catering to the United States, which is widely unpopular
throughout the country. Pakistan's religious parties already are angry with
Musharraf for placing Khan along with at least a half-dozen
of his associates under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf won't let U.S. investigators or officials from the U.N.'s International
Atomic Energy Agency question Khan directly ("It's a matter of
national pride" he says) to find out more about his
far-flung proliferation network. From the Pakistani dictator's point of view,
the least said about Khan, the better.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani leader, who has narrowly escaped two assassination attempts, keeps
one eye nervously focused at all times on how Islamic
militants in his nation react to his policies, especially when
they involve coordination with the United States. And there is
a huge amount of coordination. Powell said he speaks with
Musharraf more than with any other foreign leader. "We talk
all the time," Powell said of the estimated 90 conversations
he said they have had.
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration is also tiptoeing around the Khan case.
</P>
<P>
Because Musharraf is a key ally in the U.S. war against
terrorism -- after the Sept. 11 strikes he agreed to
withdraw support for the Taliban, a regime that had supported
al-Qaida -- the Bush administration doesn't want to add to
Musharraf's precarious domestic circumstances by pushing too hard to gain
access to Khan.
</P>
<P>
Another reason the Bush administration is eager to let the Khan
case gently disappear is that it represents a failure of
American intelligence and diplomacy that one man -- the leading
nuclear scientist of a U.S. ally -- could do so
much damage for so long and escape detection.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. silent treatment for Khan also spares the administration from
embarrassing comparisons with another intelligence failure -- the flawed prediction
that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, the administration's stated
reason for invading that country.
</P>
<P>
In the one case, U.S. intelligence flunked with its "slam dunk"
certainty that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. In the
other case, U.S. intelligence failed to detect the massive nuclear
proliferation program based in Pakistan, an American ally. Khan did
much, much more to foster the spread of nuclear weapons
than Saddam Hussein ever did.
</P>
<P>
In their eagerness to downplay the Khan case, American officials have
tried to make it sound like ancient history. For example,
during last fall's election campaign, President Bush declared that Khan's
nuclear network "has been brought to justice." Similarly, Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld asserted that Khan's operations have been "rolled upThe
network is gone."
</P>
<P>
Condoleezza Rice, Bush's former national security adviser and secretary of state-designate,
called Khan's house arrest a sufficient penalty that matched the
crime. "A.Q. Khan, in a sense, has been brought to
justice because he is out of the business that he
loved most," she said.But the IAEA is not as cheery.
</P>
<P>
"While we believe we have identified the major players and suppliers,
we have not yet satisfied ourselves that we have got
all of the subcontractors. Nor have we accounted for all
the material that was produced for the network. Begging the
question, where is it?" said Mark Gwozdecky, the IAEA spokeman.
</P>
<P>
The State Department's Bureau of Non-Proliferation, the lead U.S. agency for
preventing the global spread of weapons of mass destruction, has
declined to discuss the Khan case.
</P>
<P>
"They just feel it's too sensitive and that there is nothing
new they feel they can say," said Jim Kelman, a
State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Born in Bhopal, India in 1936, A. Q. Kahn and his
family migrated to Pakistan in 1952 five years after the
country was formed in a bloody partition with India. Khan
came from modest means -- his father was a teacher
but stressed the value of education as a way to
rise above the crippling poverty that pervades much of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Like many Pakistanis of his generation, Khan's worldview was shaped by
Pakistan's opening conflict with India during the partition. In a
2001 interview, Khan said that when he was a youth
in the late 1940s, during the height of the partition
conflict, he recalled train after train "full of dead Muslims"
pulling into a local train station.
</P>
<P>
When Khan's family -- and thousands of other Muslims -- left
India for Pakistan, Indian soldiers stripped them of their valuables,
a loss of dignity that left a lasting impression on
the youngster.
</P>
<P>
"I had been traveling with a pen that my brother gave
me when I passed my exams, and just as I
was crossing out of India, a border guard reached towards
me and snatched it from my pocket," Khan said. "The
pen had almost no monetary value, but the guard's behavior
hurt me, and it was something I'll never forget."Khan trained
as an engineer at the University of Karachi, where he
obtained his bachelors of science degree in 1960, and then
obtained advanced metallurgical training in the then-West Germany, Belgium and
Holland.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, Khan worked in Europe for Urenco, a consortium
funded by the British, Dutch and German governments that manufactured
high-speed centrifuges that produce enriched uranium U-235 by spinning uranium
hexafluoride gas. It's the U-235 that comprises uranium-fueled atomic bombs.
</P>
<P>
Khan later stole centrifuge designs and fled to Pakistan in 1976
where he ran the country's nuclear program for the next
25 years. In 1983 a Dutch court convicted him in
absentia for stealing nuclear secrets and sentenced him to four
years in prison, but the conviction was later overturned on
a technicality. Those secrets greatly advanced Pakistan's nuclear program that
culminated in the 1998 atomic test explosions.
</P>
<P>
Khan received his nation's highest civilian honors for his contributions.
</P>
<P>
The scientist is something of a Renaissance man. Married to a
South African, he has westernized tastes, is fluent in English
and Dutch, an animal lover who takes in stray dogs,
raises peacocks and enjoys feeding wild monkeys. He has a
special fondness for Urdhu poetry and beautiful houses (he has
owned properties in Pakistan, Mali and Dubai) and expensive cars.
A father of two, he is a self-described " kindest
person," who has funded charities and medical clinics for the
poor in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistanis who have met him describe Khan as passionate about public
issues, always ready with an opinion on science, politics, religion
and foreign affairs. At times garrulous and gregarious, Khan is
described as polite and witty. "He is humble and not
outwardly arrogant," said Hassan Abbas, a former Pakistani security official
and author of " Pakistan's Drift into Extremism."
</P>
<P>
But in his infrequent interviews and public statements, Khan has revealed
another side: He is a virulent Muslim nationalist with an
Islamist's hatred of the United States, Israel and the West.
</P>
<P>
"All the western countries, including Israel, are not only Pakistan's enemies
but also enemies of Islam," he charged in a 1984
interview. He called the U.S. effort to prevent the flow
of nuclear technology around the globe "part of the crusades
which the Christians and Jews had initiated against the Muslims
1,000 years ago." Like many Muslims, Khan has spoken of
a worldwide "Zionist" conspiracy to rob Muslim nations of their
power and glory.
</P>
<P>
In a 2001 interview, Khan said the longstanding rumors about his
work in nuclear proliferation were "unsubstantiated and fabricated lies" fomented
by foreign governments "because I disturbed all their strategic plans,
the balance of power and blackmailing potential in this part
of the world" by building a nuclear arsenal for Pakistan.
"I am not a madman or a nut," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies had long suspected Khan of running
a vast nuclear proliferation enterprise and, according to Secretary of
State Colin Powell, the Bush administration was "well aware of
his activities" in 2001.
</P>
<P>
In a recent paid speech after he left his post as
CIA director, George Tenet said the CIA's involvement in breaking
up A. Q. Khan's proliferation operation dated to 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Working with British colleagues, we pieced together his subsidiaries, his clients,
his front companies, his finances and manufacturing plants," Tenet said,
according to an audiotape of the speech obtained by the
New York Times. "We were inside his residence, inside his
facilities, inside his rooms. We were everywhere these people were."
</P>
<P>
Tenet said the Khan operation stretched across three continents and called
the bust "one of the greatest success stories nobody ever
talks about."
</P>
<P>
As U.S. and British intelligence worked to uncover the Khan network,
the U.N.'s Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency proceeded on a
parallel track. By the spring of 2003, Iranian leaders had
told IAEA officials about a black market where they had
been buying nuclear material for the previous 18 years. The
Iranians claimed they were working through middlemen and were not
aware of the identity of the suppliers, according to Mark
Gwozdecky, the spokesman for IAEA.
</P>
<P>
Around the same time, the Americans and British reaped the benefits
of the close surveillance of Khan's operations. They were tracking
the shipment of nuclear parts to Libya. Italy intercepted once
such shipment on a cargo ship in October 2003 that
was carrying centrifuge parts. Confronted with the evidence, and given
Libya's desire to end longstanding economic sanctions, Tripoli confessed and
renounced its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
After Libya invited IAEA inspectors in December 2003, they uncovered a
trove of incriminating evidence pointing to Khan.
</P>
<P>
"Libya helps fill in the blanks. They were working directly with
Khan and provided IAEA information about the actual supply chain,"
Gwozdecky said.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA believes Khan's network provided Libya with uranium hexafluoride, the
raw material used in centrifuges to produce enriched uranium. The
network also provided the industrial help necessary for Libya to
make its own uranium hexafluoride, as well as centrifuge and
atomic bomb designs and machine shop equipment to service the
centrifuges.
</P>
<P>
Much of this material has been dismantled in Libya and shipped
to the United States where it is being studied at
the Energy Department's Oak Ridge, Tenn., facilities.
</P>
<P>
Iran also received Khan's help on centrifuge technology, according to a
CIA report to Congress. And the CIA says Khan sold
nuclear materials to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
At a minimum, Khan provided a turn-key nuclear bomb program to
Libya, while greatly speeding up the nuclear program of Iran,
a country that sponsors terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Iran wouldn't be talking about getting nuclear weapons if it hadn't
been for Khan," said David Albright, a leading nuclear expert
and president of the Institute for Science and International Security,
a non-proliferation think-tank.
</P>
<P>
Khan's centrifuge designs are particularly important to covert nuclear programs because
they allow the development of bomb-making material with greater secrecy,
compared with the gaseous diffusion method of producing U-235.
</P>
<P>
"Centrifuge enrichment is much less energy-and-time consuming than gaseous diffusion, and
you can hide it a lot easier," said Henry Sokolski,
executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence and the U.N.'s Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency are
trying to determine whether A. Q. Khan or Iran, Libya
or North Korea shared nuclear know-how with third parties, like
al-Qaida. The terrorist group has been pursuing atomic weapons and
has said that it would use nuclear bombs against the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, Pakistan detained two of its
nuclear scientists on suspicion that they shared nuclear information with
Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaida chief. Although they were subsequently
released, the CIA now believes that one of the scientists
"may have provided some assistance to al-Qaida's program" to acquire
nuclear weaponry, the spy agency said in the recent report
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
Based on documents recovered in Afghanistan, the agency described al-Qaida's atomic
efforts "rudimentary nuclear research, although the extent of its indigenous
program is unclear."
</P>
<P>
Investigators are also trying to determine the extent of the Khan
network and all of the companies around the globe that
may have played a part. There are at least 30
companies in 30 countries "all over the globe involved in
this fantastic, sophisticated, illicit trafficking network with Mr. A.Q. Khan
acting as CEO," according to Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, chief of
the IAEA.
</P>
<P>
Major elements of Khan's network have been uncovered in Malaysia and
South Africa. Malaysian police arrested a Sri Lankan businessman --
Bukhary Syed Abu Tahir -- who admitted shipping nuclear components
to Iran and Libya at Khan's behest. Tahir also admitted
receiving two briefcases containing $3 million in cash from Iran
in exchange for providing nuclear weapons material.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, authorities are investigating the sale of nuclear weapons
technology to Libya through middlemen tied to Khan. Three individuals
allegedly tied to the Khan network, including European nationals, were
arrested as part of the South African investigation.
</P>
<P>
Khan, the one person who could provide answers to the many
pending questions, is out of reach of the IAEA and
U.S. intelligence agencies. Pakistan has refused to allow intelligence officers
to talk to Khan, while offering to relay written questions
to him. The problem with that arrangement is that investigators
can't be sure whether it's Khan -- or someone else
-- answering the questions.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a Vienna-based diplomat says the Pakistanis have been cooperative with
U.S. and IAEA officials about disclosing what their investigators have
uncovered concerning Khan's operations. Cooperation between Pakistani government and the
U.S. and IAEA "has moved slowly but positively," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA wants to meet with Tahir, the Sri Lankan businessman
currently in a Malaysian jail, to help officials frame better
questions to Khan, the diplomat said. In addition, the IAEA
has requested permission from Islamabad to send its investigators to
examine Pakistan's uranium centrifuges. By comparing the Pakistan models with
those in Iran, the IAEA can conclusively determine whether Iran's
centrifuges originated in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Given that the Pakistan military, headed by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, is
all-powerful there and that A. Q. Khan was such a
high-profile figure, some experts scoff at Musharraf's insistence that he
didn't know about Khan's nuclear black marketeering.
</P>
<P>
Husain Haqqani, the former Pakistani ambassador to Sri Lanka, said in
an interview that "one would have to stretch the bounds
of credulity to believe that the government wasn't involved."
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe that Pakistan's top scientist could travel to
places like North Korea without the government's knowledge," he said.
</P>
<P>
Robert Oakley, former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, gives Musharraf and other
senior leaders the benefit of the doubt, speculating that the
general may have been shielded from full knowledge of Khan's
proliferation activities. "Did Pakistan's military know something was going on?
I'd say yes, Did they know everything? Probably not," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Oakley added that Khan's illicit export network wasn't a new creation
but rather reversed the flow of information and material on
the import network that Khan and the Pakistan military had
used to acquire nuclear materials for their country's atomic program.
</P>
<P>
The assumption among some informed diplomats and intelligence officials is that,
at a minimum, Khan must have had help from other
senior scientists in the Pakistani government.
</P>
<P>
"Khan is a metallurgist, so he understood well about building centrifuges,"
a Vienna-based diplomat said. "But he wouldn't necessarily understand bomb
designs nor would he understand uranium conversion and the many
other technologies involved."
</P>
<P>
The Bush administration, always working to build-up Musharraf, has accepted his
claims of innocence.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Powell said that when he asked Musharraf if
he had known about Khan's work, the general denied any
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Khan's nuclear network "was so compartmented within government circles" and Musharraf
was "outside the circle," Powell said of Musharraf's explanation. "That's
what he has said to me, and I have no
evidence to prove or disprove his statement."
</P>
<P>
All of which leads to the question of motive, another major
thrust in the IAEA investigation. While Khan profited financially from
the sale of nuclear secrets, money likely was not the
sole motivation.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA's ElBaradei has said that "ideology" also played a factor.
</P>
<P>
For example, Hassan Abbas, the former Pakistani security official, said Khan
may have been motivated by the strategic view held by
some Pakistani military leaders that spreading nuclear technology was a
way to counter U.S. power and what Islamabad fears is
an emerging alliance among India, the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
While Khan is not a religious extremist like bin Laden, he
may also have been motivated by a pan-Muslim view of
spreading weapons to guarantee the influence of Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
"Khan was motivated by some element of ideology, greed and convoluted
strategic thinking," said Haqqani, the former Pakistani diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Another likely motivation is Khan's ample ego, said Oakley. "It may
be a little of, 'Look at me. I am a
great man,"' Oakley said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Khan passes time in his Islamabad estate, forbidden from public
speaking.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has not said how long his limbo will
last, nor has it publicly explained the rules of what
Khan is allowed to do while under house arrest. But
house arrest has a unique history in Pakistani politics, namely
to take controversial individuals out of circulation, a penalty without
substance, until the controversy blows over.
</P>
<P>
"As far as Pakistani law is concerned, Khan has not been
convicted of any crime. He has already been forgiven and
pardoned," said Abbas. "The house arrest isn't meant as a
punishment but more as a sop to the Americans."
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, Khan is often cast as a victim of Western
pressure on the Musharraf government.
</P>
<P>
In a recent editorial, the Islamabad-based Pakistan Newswire summed up Musharraf's
predicament in the Khan case.
</P>
<P>
"Why is a person still acknowledged by no less a person
than the president of Pakistan as a national hero being
subjected to such humiliating treatment?" the editorial asked. "Surely, the
fact that the man had to apologize to the entire
nation was punishment enough."
