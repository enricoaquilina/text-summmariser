AS NUCLEAR SECRETS EMERGE, MORE ARE SUSPECTED
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When experts from the United States and the International Atomic
Energy Agency came upon blueprints for a 10-kiloton atomic bomb in
the files of the Libyan weapons program earlier this year, they found
themselves caught between gravity and pettiness.
</P>
<P>
The discovery gave the experts a new appreciation of the audacity of
the rogue nuclear network led by A.Q. Khan, a chief architect of
Pakistan's bomb. Intelligence officials had watched Khan for years
and suspected that he was trafficking in machinery for enriching
uranium to make fuel for warheads. But the detailed design
represented a new level of danger, particularly since the Libyans
said he had thrown it in as a deal-sweetener when he sold them $100
million in nuclear gear.
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time we had ever seen a loose copy of a bomb
design that clearly worked," said one American expert, "and the
question was: Who else had it? The Iranians? The Syrians? Al-Qaida?"
</P>
<P>
But that threat was quickly overshadowed by smaller questions.
</P>
<P>
The experts from the United States and the IAEA, the U.N. nuclear
watchdog -- in a reverberation of their differences over Iraq's
unconventional weapons -- began quarreling over control of the
blueprints. The friction was palpable at Libya's Ministry of
Scientific Research, said one participant, when the Americans accused
international inspectors of having examined the design before they
arrived. After hours of tense negotiation, agreement was reached to
keep it in a vault at the Energy Department in Washington, but under
IAEA seal.
</P>
<P>
It was a sign of things to come.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a year after Khan's arrest, secrets of his nuclear black
market continue to uncoil, revealing a vast global enterprise. But
the inquiry has been hampered by discord between the Bush
administration and the nuclear watchdog, and by Washington's concern
that if it pushes too hard for access to Khan, a national hero in
Pakistan, it could destabilize an ally. As a result, much of the
urgency has been sapped from the investigation, helping keep hidden
the full dimensions of the activities of Khan and his associates.
</P>
<P>
There is no shortage of tantalizing leads. U.S. intelligence
officials and the IAEA, working separately, are still untangling
Khan's travels in the years before his arrest. Investigators said he
visited 18 countries, including Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, on
what they believed were business trips, either to buy materials like
uranium ore or sell atomic goods.
</P>
<P>
In Dubai, they have scoured one of the network's front companies,
finding traces of radioactive material as well as phone records
showing contact with Saudi Arabia. Having tracked the network
operations to Malaysia, Europe and the Middle East, investigators
recently uncovered an outpost in South Africa, where they seized 11
crates of equipment for enriching uranium.
</P>
<P>
The breadth of the operation was particularly surprising to some U.S.
intelligence officials because they had had Khan under surveillance
for nearly three decades, since he began assembling components for
Pakistan's bomb, but apparently missed crucial transactions with
countries like Iran and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
In fact, officials were so confident they had accurately taken his
measure, that twice -- once in the late 1970s and again in the 1980s
-- the CIA persuaded Dutch intelligence agents not to arrest Khan
because they wanted to follow his trail, according to a senior
European diplomat and a former congressional official who had access
to intelligence information. The CIA declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
"We knew a lot," said a nuclear intelligence official, "but we didn't
realize the size of his universe."
</P>
<P>
President Bush boasts that the Khan network has been dismantled. But
there is evidence that parts of it live on, as do investigations in
Washington and Vienna, Austria, where the IAEA is based.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the U.N. atomic agency and the United States has
trickled to a near halt, particularly as the Bush administration
tries to unseat the IAEA director general, Mohamed ElBaradei, who did
not support the White House's prewar intelligence assessments on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The chill from the White House has blown through Vienna. "I can't
remember the last time we saw anything of a classified nature from
Washington," one of the agency's senior officials said. Experts see
it as a missed opportunity because the two sides have complementary
strengths -- the United States with spy satellites and covert
capabilities to intercept or disable nuclear equipment, and the IAEA
with inspectors who have access to some of the world's most secretive
atomic facilities that the United States cannot legally enter.
</P>
<P>
In the 11 months since Khan's partial confession, Pakistan has denied
U.S. investigators access to him. They have passed questions through
the Pakistanis, but report that there is virtually no new information
on critical questions like who else obtained the bomb design. Nor
have U.S. investigators been given access to Khan's chief operating
officer, Buhari Sayed Abu Tahir, who is in a Malaysian jail.
</P>
<P>
This disjunction has helped to keep many questions about the network
unanswered, including whether the Pakistani military was involved in
the black market and what other countries, or nonstate groups, beyond
Libya, Iran and North Korea, received what one Bush administration
official called Khan's "nuclear starter kit" -- everything from
centrifuge designs to raw uranium fuel to the blueprints for the
bomb.
</P>
<P>
Privately, investigators say that with so many mysteries unsolved,
they have little confidence that the illicit atomic marketplace has
actually been shut down. "It may be more like al-Qaida," said one
IAEA official, "where you cut off the leadership but new elements
emerge."
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
A POTENTIAL DANGER
</P>
<P>
A.Q. Khan may have been unknown to most Americans when he was
revealed about a year ago as the mastermind of the largest illicit
nuclear proliferation network in history. But for three decades Khan,
a metallurgist, has been well known to British and U.S. intelligence
officials. Even so, the United States and its allies passed up
opportunities to stop him -- and apparently failed to detect that he
had begun selling nuclear technology to Iran in the late 1980s. It
was the opening transaction for an enterprise that eventually spread
to North Korea, Libya and beyond.
</P>
<P>
Khan studied in Pakistan and Europe. After he secured a job in the
Netherlands in the early 1970s at a plant making centrifuges -- the
devices that purify uranium -- Dutch intelligence officials began
watching him. By late 1975, they grew so wary, after he was observed
at a nuclear trade show in Switzerland asking suspicious questions,
that they moved him to a different area of the company to keep him
away from uranium enrichment work.
</P>
<P>
"There was an awareness," said Frank Slijper of the Dutch Campaign
against Arms Trade, who recently wrote a report on Khan's early days,
"that he was a potential danger."
</P>
<P>
Khan suddenly left the country that December, called home by his
government for its atomic project. Years later, investigators
discovered that he had taken blueprints for the centrifuges with him.
In Pakistan, Khan was working to develop a bomb to counter India's,
and Washington was intent on stopping the project.
</P>
<P>
It later proved to be the first of several occasions when the United
States failed to fully understand what Khan was up to.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor who has served in several
administrations, said U.S. intelligence agencies thought Pakistan
would try to make its bomb by producing plutonium -- an alternative
bomb fuel. Nye was sent to France to halt the shipment of technology
that would have enabled Pakistan to complete a reprocessing plant for
the plutonium fuel. "We returned to Washington to celebrate our
victory, only to discover that Khan had already stolen the technology
for another path to the bomb," Nye recalled.
</P>
<P>
To gather more atomic gear and skill, Khan returned to the
Netherlands repeatedly. But the United States wanted to watch him,
and a European diplomat with wide knowledge of nuclear intelligence
cited the two occasions when the CIA persuaded the Dutch authorities
not to arrest him. Intelligence officials apparently felt Khan was
more valuable as an unwitting guide to the nuclear underworld.
</P>
<P>
"The Dutch wanted to arrest him," the diplomat said. "But they were
told by the American CIA, 'Leave him so we can follow his trail."'
</P>
<P>
A CHINESE CONNECTION
</P>
<P>
Khan quickly led the agents to Beijing. It was there in the early
1980s that Khan pulled off a coup: obtaining the blueprints for a
weapon that China had detonated in its fourth nuclear test, in 1966.
The design was notable because it was compact and the first one China
had developed that could easily fit atop a missile.
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence agencies only learned the full details of the
transactions earlier this year when the Libyans handed over two large
plastic bags with the names of an Islamabad tailor on one side and a
dry-cleaner on other -- one of several clues that it had come from
the Khan Laboratories. The design inside included drawings of more
than 100 parts, all fitting in a sphere about 34 inches in diameter,
just the right size for a rocket.
</P>
<P>
Equally remarkable were the handwritten notations in the margins.
"They made reference to Chinese ministers, presumably involved in the
deal," one official who reviewed it disclosed. And there was also a
reference to "Munir," apparently Munir Khan, Khan's rival who ran the
Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and was in a contest with Khan to
put together a Pakistani weapon that would match India's.
</P>
<P>
In that race, size was critical, because only a small weapon could be
put atop Pakistani missiles. One note in the margin of the design,
the official said, was that "Munir's bomb would be bigger."
</P>
<P>
Intelligence experts believe that Khan traded his centrifuge
technology to the Chinese for their bomb design.
</P>
<P>
A certain familiarity developed between Khan and those watching him.
</P>
<P>
"I remember I was once in Beijing on a nonproliferation mission,"
said Robert J. Einhorn, a longtime proliferation official in the
State Department, "and we knew that Khan was in Beijing, too, and
where he was. I had this fantasy of going over to his hotel, calling
up to his room, and inviting him down for a cup of coffee."
</P>
<P>
Of course, he never did. But if he had, Khan might not have been
surprised.
</P>
<P>
Simon Henderson, a London-based author who has written about Khan for
more than two decades, said the Pakistani scientist long suspected he
was under close surveillance. "Khan once told me, indignantly, 'The
British try to recruit members of my team as spies,"' Henderson
recalled. "As far as I'm aware, he was penetrated for a long, long
time."
</P>
<P>
Still, for all the surveillance, U.S. officials always seemed a step
or two behind. In the 1990s, noted Einhorn, the assumption was that
Iran was getting most of its help from Russia, which was providing
the country with reactors and laser-isotope technology. Virtually no
attention was paid to its contacts with Khan.
</P>
<P>
"It was a classic case of being focused in the wrong place," Einhorn
said. "And if Iran gets the bomb in the next few years, it won't be
because of the Russians. It will be because of the help they got from
A.Q. Khan."
</P>
<P>
TRIUMPH AND MYSTERY
</P>
<P>
As soon as Bush came to office, his director of central intelligence,
George J. Tenet, began tutoring him on the dangers of Khan and
disclosing how deeply the agency believed it had penetrated his life
and network. "We were inside his residence, inside his facilities,
inside his rooms," Tenet said in a recent speech. "We were everywhere
these people were."
</P>
<P>
But acting on the Khan problem meant navigating the sensitivities of
a fragile ally important in the effort against terrorism. That has
impeded the inquiry ever since.
</P>
<P>
Washington had little leverage to force Pakistan's president, Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, to clamp down on a national hero, especially since
Khan may have had evidence implicating the Pakistani government in
some of the transactions. And in interviews, officials said they
feared that moving on Khan too early would hurt their chances to roll
up the network.
</P>
<P>
Stephen J. Hadley, the deputy national security adviser, went to
Pakistan soon after the Sept. 11 attacks and raised concerns about
Khan, some of whose scientists were said to have met with Osama bin
Laden, al-Qaida's leader. But Hadley did not ask Musharraf to take
action, according to a senior administration official. He returned to
Washington complaining that it was unclear whether the Khan
Laboratories were operating with the complicity of the Pakistani
military, or were controlled by freelancers, motivated by visions of
profit or of spreading the bomb to Islamic nations. The Pakistanis
insisted they had no evidence of any proliferation at all, a claim
U.S. officials said they found laughable.
</P>
<P>
As evidence grew in 2003, Bush sent Tenet to New York to meet with
Musharraf. "We were afraid Khan's operation was entering a new, more
dangerous phase," said one top official. Still there was little
action.
</P>
<P>
But in late October 2003, the United States and its allies seized the
BBC China, a freighter bearing centrifuge parts made in Malaysia,
along with other products of Khan's network, all bound for Libya.
Confronted with the evidence, Libya finally agreed to surrender all
of its nuclear program. Within weeks, tons of equipment was being
dismantled and flown to the Energy Department's nuclear weapons lab
at Oak Ridge, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
Pressures mounted on Musharraf. "I said to him, 'We know so much
about this that we're going to go public with it,"' Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell told journalists last week. "'And you need to
deal with this before you have to deal with it publicly."'
</P>
<P>
On television, Khan was forced to confess but he gave no specifics,
and Musharraf pardoned the scientist. U.S. officials pressed to
interview him and his chief lieutenant, Tahir, a Sri Lankan
businessman living in Dubai and Malaysia, who was eventually arrested
by Malaysian authorities.
</P>
<P>
But the Pakistanis balked, insisting that they would pass questions
to Khan and report back. Little information has been conveyed.
</P>
<P>
"Some questions simply were never answered," said one senior
intelligence official. "In other cases, you don't know if you were
getting Khan's answer, or the answer the government wanted you to
hear."
</P>
<P>
Khan's silence has extended to the question of what countries, other
than Libya, received the bomb design. Intelligence experts say they
have no evidence any other nation received the design, although they
suspect Iran and perhaps North Korea. But that search has been
hampered by lack of hard intelligence.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly believe Iran did," said one U.S. official. "But we need
the proof."
</P>
<P>
Khan has also never discussed his ties with North Korea, a critical
issue because the United States has alleged -- but cannot prove --
that North Korea has two nuclear arms programs, one using Khan
technology.
</P>
<P>
"It is an unbelievable story, how this administration has given
Pakistan a pass on the single worst case of proliferation in the past
half-century," said Jack Pritchard, who worked for President Clinton
and served as the State Department's special envoy to North Korea
until he quit last year, partly in protest over Bush's Korea policy.
"We've given them a pass because of Musharraf's agreement to fight
terrorism, and now there is some suggestion that the hunt for Osama
is waning. And what have we learned from Khan? Nothing."
</P>
<P>
SOME MISSING PIECES
</P>
<P>
In March, U.S. investigators invited reporters to the giant nuclear
complex in Oak Ridge to display the equipment disgorged by the
Libyans. They surrounded the site with guards bearing automatic
weapons, and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham joined the officials in
showing off some of the 4,000 centrifuges.
</P>
<P>
"We've had a huge success," he said.But it turned out that the
centrifuges were missing their rotors -- the high-speed internal
device that makes them work. To this day, it is not clear where those
parts were coming from. While some officials believe the Libyans were
going to make their own, others fear the equipment had been shipped
from an unknown location -- and that the network, while headless, is
still alive.
</P>
<P>
John R. Bolton, the undersecretary of state for arms control and
international security, echoed those suspicions, saying the network
still had a number of undisclosed customers. "There's more out there
than we can discuss publicly," Bolton said in April.
</P>
<P>
Federal and private experts said the list of suspected customers
includes Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Malaysia, Indonesia,
Algeria, Kuwait, Myanmar and Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
Given the urgency of the Libyan and Khan disclosures, many private
and governmental experts expected that the Bush administration and
the IAEA would work together. But European diplomats said the
administration never turned over valuable information to back up its
wider suspicions about other countries. "It doesn't like to share," a
senior European diplomat involved in nuclear intelligence said of the
United States. "That makes life more difficult. So we're on the
learning curve."
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said they were reluctant to give the IAEA
classified information because the agency is too prone to leaks. The
agency has 137 member states, and U.S. officials believe some of them
may be using the agency to hunt for nuclear secrets. One senior
administration official put it this way: "The cops and the crooks all
serve on the agency's board together."
</P>
<P>
The result is that two separate, disjointed searches are on for other
nuclear rogue states -- one by Washington, the other by the IAEA. And
there is scant communication between the feuding bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
That lack of communication with the U.N. agency extends to the
Nuclear Suppliers Group, a loose organization of countries that
produce nuclear equipment. It can stop the export of restricted
atomic technology to a suspect customer, but it does not report its
actions to the IAEA. Moreover, there is no communication between the
IAEA and the Bush administration's Proliferation Security Initiative,
which seeks to intercept illicit nuclear trade at sea or in the air.
</P>
<P>
"It's a legitimate question whether we need a very different kind of
super-agency that can deal with the new world of A.Q. Khans," said a
senior administration official. "Because we sure don't have the
system we need now."
</P>
<P>
THE HUNT GOES ON
</P>
<P>
ElBaradei, the head of the U.N. agency, says he is plunging ahead,
pursuing his own investigation even as the Bush administration
attempts to have him replaced when his term expires late next year.
In an interview in Vienna, he defended his record, citing the
information he has wrung out of Iran, and his agency's discovery of
tendrils of Khan's network in more than 30 countries around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
"We're getting an idea of how it works," he said of the Khan network.
"And we're still looking" for other suppliers and customers.
</P>
<P>
One method is to investigate the countries Khan visited before his
arrest. Nuclear experts disclosed that the countries were
Afghanistan, Egypt, Iran, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mali,
Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, North Korea, Saudi Arabia,
Senegal, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. Many of
them are Islamic, and several of the African countries are rich in
uranium ore.
</P>
<P>
In one of its biggest operations, the agency is hunting for nuclear
clues in a half-dozen of the network's buildings and warehouses in
Dubai, which for years were used as the central location for
assembling and repacking centrifuges.
</P>
<P>
Both in Washington and in Vienna, the most delicate investigations
involve important American allies -- including Egypt and Saudi
Arabia. So far, said European intelligence officials familiar with
the agency's inner workings, no hard evidence of clandestine nuclear
arms programs has surfaced.
</P>
<P>
Suspicious signs have emerged, however. For instance, experts
disclosed that SMB Computers, Tahir's front company in Dubai for the
Khan network, made telephone calls to Saudi Arabia. But the company
also engaged in legitimate computer sales, giving it plausible cover.
Experts also disclosed that Saudi scientists traveled to Pakistan for
some of Khan's scientific conferences. But the meetings were not
secret, or illegal.
</P>
<P>
There is also worry in both Washington and Vienna about Egypt, which
has two research reactors near Cairo and a long history of internal
debate about whether to pursue nuclear arms. But European
intelligence officials said IAEA inspectors who recently went there
found no signs of clandestine nuclear arms and some evidence of
shoddy workmanship that bespeaks low atomic expectations.As for
Syria, the Bush administration had repeatedly charged that it has
secretly tried to acquire nuclear arms. But the IAEA has so far found
no signs of a relationship with Khan or a clandestine nuclear weapons
program. Worried about what is still unknown, the IAEA is quietly
setting up what it calls the Covert Nuclear Trade Analysis Unit,
agency officials disclosed. It has about a half-dozen specialists who
are scanning international files and records and databases for
evidence of secret nuclear deals by the Khan network or its
imitators.
</P>
<P>
"I would not be surprised to discover that some countries pocketed
some centrifuges," ElBaradei said. "They may have considered it a
chance of a lifetime to get some equipment and thought, 'Well, maybe
it will be good for a rainy day."'
