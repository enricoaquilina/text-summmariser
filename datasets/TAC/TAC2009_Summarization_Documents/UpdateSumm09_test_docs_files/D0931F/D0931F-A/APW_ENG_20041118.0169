Pakistan skeptical over claim its scientist gave nuclear bomb
blueprint to Iran
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The government expressed skepticism Thursday over a claim by an
Iranian opposition group that Abdul Qadeer Khan, the disgraced father
of Pakistan's nuclear program, had given Iran a blueprint for a
nuclear bomb and some weapons-grade uranium.
</P>
<P>
"We do not attach importance to this report or claim," Foreign
Ministry spokesman Masood Khan told a news conference in the capital,
Islamabad. "The validity of this claim is being questioned and it is
being viewed with skepticism."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's official reaction came a day after Farid Soleimani, a
former senior official for the National Council for Resistance in
Iran, told reporters in Vienna that Tehran received the bomb diagram
between 1994 and 1996 and a quantity of highly enriched uranium from
Khan in 2001.
</P>
<P>
While the Pakistani spokesman dismissed the claim, he said its
investigations into the unauthorized spread of nuclear technology
were yet not closed. Masood Khan said Pakistan had not received a
report through formal channels on the claim, and it was open to "any
communication."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has said it is cooperating with the International Atomic
Energy Agency in its investigations into the international nuclear
black market, although it has not let the agency question Khan.
</P>
<P>
Khan has been under virtual house arrest in Islamabad since a scandal
broke in December over his alleged black market dealings that
supplied nuclear weapons technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya.
</P>
<P>
President Gen. Pervez Musharraf pardoned Khan _ long revered in
Pakistan for helping build a nuclear deterrent against rival India _
after he made a public confession in February. All but one of Khan's
colleagues have been released after questioning.
