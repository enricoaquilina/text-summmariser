<P>
Pakistan's government on Monday rejected a media report that an international
black market in weapons technology, run by disgraced Pakistani scientist A.Q.
Khan, may have sold equipment to Saudi Arabia and other Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
But while Information Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed described as "baseless" the
allegations printed in this week's edition of Time magazine, he did not rule out
the possibility that Khan could have sold technology to more countries than
initially thought.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know of any other country that he gave nuclear technology to. But if
there is another country, we will investigate," Ahmed told The Associated Press.
"If there are any questions (for Khan) we will ask them."
</P>
<P>
Khan, once regarded as a national hero for his role in developing Pakistan's
nuclear deterrent against rival India, has lived under virtual house arrest here
since he confessed in February 2004 to selling sensitive technology to Iran,
Libya and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
President Gen. Pervez Musharraf has pardoned Khan, and says the scientist's
international network has been dismantled. The government denies any official
involvement in the multimillion dollar (euro) illicit trade that earned Khan a
fortune _ estimated by Time at up to US$400 million (euro311
million).
</P>
<P>
The United States has submitted questions to Pakistan to ask Khan about whether
North Korea and Iran sold nuclear equipment to third parties, but authorities
have apparently not allowed U.S. agents to interview Khan themselves.
</P>
<P>
The Time report cited an unidentified Pakistani Defense Ministry official as
saying that U.S. officials were investigating whether Khan's network might have
sold nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, such as
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan also denied the Time report. He also
denied that Khan's network supplied Saudi Arabia with nuclear
technology.
</P>
<P>
"The international black market network as far as it was related to Pakistan has
been dismantled. It has been neutralized," he said at a weekly news briefing in
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Khan blamed unnamed "constituencies who launch and sustain this kind of
disinformation campaign. Pakistan is a nuclear state and this is one of the
risks that is involved in this status."
</P>
<P>
Ahmed said that Pakistan remained in contact with the Vienna-based U.N. nuclear
watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, but reiterated that it would
not hand over the scientist for questioning by non-Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
"We have inquired as much as we can, if somebody has more questions, we are
ready to satisfy IAEA," he said. "But there is no way to deliver A.Q. Khan to
anyone."
</P>
<P>
He denied that Khan's network was still operating and one specific allegation in
the report that 16 cylinders of uranium hexafluoride gas _ a critical ingredient
for uranium enrichment for weapons _ had gone missing from Pakistan's leading
nuclear lab, the Khan Research Laboratories, named after the
scientist.
</P>
<P>
"There are no cylinders missing from KRL. The inventory is complete," Ahmed
said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker told reporters that investigations into
the full scope of Khan's network were continuing, and that the United States was
looking forward to hearing the full results of Pakistan's inquiries.
</P>
<P>
Khan, the foreign ministry spokesman, said Pakistan has shared the results of
its investigations "transparently and candidly" with the international
community.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a joint responsibility of the international community, all key
actors to act against proliferation," he said. "That's why our investigations
are continuing and if fresh leads emerge we would like to check them out and if
fresh evidence is furnished to us we would like to look into
that."
