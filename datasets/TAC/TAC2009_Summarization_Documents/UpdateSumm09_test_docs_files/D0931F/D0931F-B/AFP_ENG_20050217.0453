<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah 
Badawi Thursday said his country was not going to hand over an 
alleged deputy of Pakistan's disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul 
Qadeer Khah to anyone as investigations were still in progress.
</P>
<P>
"No, there is no move to hand him over to anybody and he is 
still detained by us," Badawi told a press conference in Islamabad 
when asked if Buhary Syed Abu Tahir was being handed over to the 
United States.
</P>
<P>
Tahir has been named by US President George W. Bush as "deputy" 
to Khan in an international nuclear trafficking ring.
</P>
<P>
"Our... intelligence people like to speak and continue to talk 
to him. Obviously, there are lot of things we would like to know 
from him," Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
Tahir told Malaysian police last year that Khan sold nuclear 
centrifuge parts to Iran in the mid-1990s and sent enriched uranium 
to Libya in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Khan, a disgraced one-time national hero credited with making 
Pakistan a nuclear power, confessed in February 2004 to leaking 
nuclear secrets. He was later pardoned by President Pervez 
Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
On the nuclear row between Iran and the United States, Badawi 
said, "We do not want to see Iraq's situation repeated in Iran."
</P>
<P>
The United States accuses Iran of seeking to build nuclear 
weapons. Tehran has vehemently denied the charges, arguing that its 
atomic activities are solely for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
Last month Bush said he could not rule out using force if Tehran 
failed to rein in its nuclear plans, and US Vice President Dick 
Cheney said Iran was "right at the top of the list" of global 
troublespots.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said that any differences between Iran and the United 
States "should be resolved through diplomatic channel."
