'baseless'

<P>
Pakistan Monday dismissed as "baseless" 
a report in a US magazine that its disgraced top nuclear scientist 
Abdul Qadeer Khan sold sensitive equipment to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Sheikh Rashid said the report in the latest 
edition of Time was full of distortion.
</P>
<P>
"The story is without facts and baseless," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
The magazine reported that the United States was investigating 
whether Khan sold nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and some other 
countries.
</P>
<P>
The news weekly, citing a source in Pakistan's defense ministry, 
said Khan had also played a bigger role in helping Iran and North 
Korea with their nuclear programs than had been previously 
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"US intelligence officials believe Khan sold North Korea much of 
the material needed to build a bomb, including high-speed 
centrifuges used to enrich uranium and the equipment required to 
manufacture more of them," Time said.
</P>
<P>
But Rashid said Islamabad was cooperating with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the world community by sharing the 
results of its own probe, which it said led to the dismantling of an 
illegal proliferation network.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has not allowed the US or 
the IAEA to interrogate Khan, who appeared on Pakistani state 
television in February 2004 and took full responsibility for 
transfers of nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf gave him a conditional pardon and has said that no 
government or military body was involved in the proliferation 
scandal.
</P>
<P>
The minister insisted that Pakistan would never hand over the 
father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb to any other country.
