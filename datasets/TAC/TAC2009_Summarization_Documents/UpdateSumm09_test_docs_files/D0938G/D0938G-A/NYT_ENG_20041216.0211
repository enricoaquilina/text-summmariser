The World Trade Center memorial will preserve not only the memory of
those who died on Sept. 11, 2001, but the remnants -- visible and
even tangible -- of the buildings that died that morning, too.
</P>
<P>
Severed during the clearing of ground zero, many steel and concrete
column footings that still outline the perimeters of the twin towers
will be made part of the memorial itself, as will a 70-foot-tall,
250-foot-long section of the original slurry wall.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, almost a year after the world saw the earliest
renderings of the plan called "Reflecting Absence," three architects
guided their listeners -- the governor of New York and the mayor of
New York City among them -- on a trip through the schematic design,
showing in more detail the spaces that will compose the memorial when
it opens in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Beginning on a plaza forested with some 300 oak trees and a
one-and-a-half-acre open area that can double as a civic gathering
place for as many as 10,000 people, visitors will make their way down
two switchback ramps, each as long as a city block, that will take
them 30 feet below ground into the central memorial hall.
</P>
<P>
Here, both pool-filled voids marking the absent towers will be
visible through cascading curtains of water, each ringed with the
names of the dead. The pools will be centered within, but slightly
smaller than, the tower outlines. Forty feet below, within inches of
bedrock itself, unidentified remains will be entombed.
</P>
<P>
On this level, the north tower's foundations will be exposed in a
chamber more than 60 feet high. Visitors will be able to touch the
jagged steel and the rough concrete.
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to the day when I will be privileged to set
foot and walk down those ramps to the bedrock and, like the family
members, bend over and pay my tribute in an appropriate memorial,"
Gov. George E. Pataki said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development
Corp., which is overseeing the memorial, described the new elements
as "simple acts, knitted together to create a powerful memorial at
the heart of the World Trade Center site."
