DESIGN OF WORLD TRADE CENTER MEMORIAL HITS A BUMP

<P>
It is just a few feet high. But
it could profoundly affect a visitor's experience by creating the
need for a wall running more than 200 feet along
the Greenwich Street side of the memorial, marking an abrupt
grade change between plaza level and sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
Between this wall and the museum complex at Fulton Street and
a stairway at Liberty Street, there would be only two
small areas where one could walk straight into the memorial
from Greenwich Street, the approach most visitors will probably take.
</P>
<P>
To the public, the tough part of designing the memorial may
seem to have passed last year with the choice of
a concept, the twin voids of "Reflecting Absence," and the
selection of architects: Michael Arad, Peter Walker &amp; Partners and
Davis Brody Bond.
</P>
<P>
But new challenges are unfolding, largely out of sight, as planners
struggle to reconcile an architectural vision with the physical realities
of a complex site. At stake in these negotiations are
elements as important as the whole east side of the
memorial, which may depend on what may seem like arcane
questions of roadway layout.
</P>
<P>
The bump -- really, more of a hump -- would occur
in Greenwich Street at Dey Street. Here, the surface would
be 2 feet higher than at Fulton Street to the
north and 6 feet higher than at Liberty Street to
the south.
</P>
<P>
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns
the site and will build the streets, said that height
would permit the installation of as many utility lines as
are needed within the roadbed, directly above the subway tunnel
for the Nos. 1 and 9 trains, with sufficient covering
over the tunnel to satisfy Metropolitan Transportation Authority standards. The
slope would allow water drainage and prevent puddling in the
street.
</P>
<P>
However, it would also mean that Greenwich Street would rise almost
5 feet higher than the memorial plaza. There is not
room enough to accommodate a stairway at this location because
the footprint of the south tower -- an immovable element
in the equation -- is too close to the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
And the plaza cannot be canted upward to meet Greenwich Street
because the voids will have walls of cascading water within,
which must be kept absolutely level. Any slope in the
plaza would be apparent around the perimeter of the voids.
</P>
<P>
If Greenwich Street must rise that high, the Lower Manhattan Development
Corp. has concluded that a wall will be needed along
much of the adjacent part of the memorial. Not only
would that wall block physical access but it would also
diminish the designers' goal of direct sight lines into the
plaza from the surrounding sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
As an alternative, the corporation has proposed lowering Greenwich Street by
four feet. That would permit a level approach to the
memorial at Dey Street. (Because of the changing topography around
the site, stairways will still be needed to reach the
plaza level from the sidewalks at the southeast, southwest and
northwest corners.)
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely critical that we take the steps necessary to set
the grade in a way that achieves the objective we
all share of knitting the site back into the community,
both physically and visually," Kevin M. Rampe, president of the
development corporation, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the corporation's alternative raises more questions. Where would utility lines
go if they could not fit in a shallower Greenwich
Street roadbed? Why not raise the entire plaza level a
bit? And how appropriate is it for architecture to set
street heights, rather than the other way around?
</P>
<P>
"The construction of Greenwich Street through the World Trade Center site
is another of the complex engineering issues that must be
carefully studied and resolved as we move forward with the
redevelopment," said Kenneth J. Ringler Jr., the executive director of
the Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
As engaging as last season's architectural beauty contests may have been,
the real form of the future World Trade Center is
being decided now. God is in the details, Mies van
der Rohe is often quoted as saying. So is the
devil.
</P>
<P>
HOW THE HEIGHTS ARE MEASURED
</P>
<P>
How do you measure heights on a site with so many
levels above and below ground? Engineers typically rely on a
datum, a constant plane from which elevations can be uniformly
calculated. Different data are used for different purposes.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Center Downtown Restoration Program datum is closely related
to that of the Hudson &amp; Manhattan Railroad, now PATH,
which was integral to the development of the twin towers
in the 1960s. Because the railroad datum was deliberately set
very deep -- exactly 300 feet below mean sea level
at Sandy Hook, N.J. -- all measurements from it can
be expressed as positive elevations.
</P>
<P>
The trade center datum is 2.653 feet above the old railroad
datum. On this scale, the high point on Greenwich Street
is at elevation 316 feet, the memorial plaza at 311.2
feet.
</P>
<P>
For comparison's sake, the PATH station concourse is at elevation 276
feet, the mezzanine at 264 feet and the passenger platforms
at 250 feet. The base of the trade center site
is at elevation 243 feet. The lowest point in the
PATH system is midway in Tunnel E, the outbound route
from the trade center to New Jersey, at elevation 212
feet.
