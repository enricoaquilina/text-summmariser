<P>
All four living former US presidents have agreed to become honorary
directors of the project for a permanent memorial to the victims of
the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
New York Governor George Pataki said Monday that Gerald Ford, Jimmy
Carter, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton had all pledged their
support for the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation and would
serve as honorary members of the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
"The memorial will be the centerpiece and our first priority in the
rebuilding effort," Pataki said at a luncheon event in New York City.
</P>
<P>
"Reflecting Absence" by architect Michael Arad, which features two
reflecting pools surrounded by gardens, was chosen from 5,201 entries
submitted to an international design competition.
</P>
<P>
The pools are to sit almost empty, with water running down the sides
only, symbolizing the vacuum left by the 2,749 people who died when
two hijacked planes were crashed into the trade center's twin towers.
</P>
<P>
The memorial is scheduled to open in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Carter, Bush and Clinton were all together just last week, when they
attended the dedication of Clinton's presidential library. Ford, 91,
had been unable to attend the event.
