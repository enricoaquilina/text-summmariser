Having been eclipsed for most of this year by other issues at ground
zero, the World Trade Center memorial returned to the forefront
Monday as Gov. George E. Pataki offered a preview of the completed
design, which he said will be ready next month.
</P>
<P>
In describing the memorial -- "Picture the old foundations of the
Louvre in France or the catacombs at the Vatican" -- Pataki said the
column remnants of the twin towers would be kept visible, "laying
bare the very roots of the towers as visitors absorb the meaning of
what took place here."
</P>
<P>
The governor said that financing of the memorial should be the "first
and most important" priority for the $816 million in federal grants
that have yet to be allocated by the Lower Manhattan Development
Corp. He also called for an overall spending plan by March, since
demands downtown far exceed the available grants.
</P>
<P>
Pataki said former Presidents Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, George
H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton would serve as honorary members of the
memorial foundation, which will raise money for the memorial and the
cultural centers. The working members of the board are to be named
next week by the governor and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
And Pataki announced that the underground memorial interpretive
center, where artifacts and exhibits will tell the story of the trade
center and the 2001 and 1993 attacks, will be designed by the
Manhattan firm Davis Brody Bond, which is already associated with
Michael Arad and Peter Walker on the memorial itself; the Norwegian
firm Snohetta, which is working on the museum complex at the trade
center site; and Howard-Revis Design of Washington, which specializes
in designing exhibits.
</P>
<P>
J. Max Bond Jr., a partner in Davis Brody Bond who accompanied Pataki
at ground zero Monday, said, "Of course we're pleased, if somewhat
apprehensive, since the stakes are so high and the projects are
important and demanding."
</P>
<P>
In the governor's fourth progress report on Lower Manhattan, to 420
guests of the Association for a Better New York at the Ritz-Carlton
New York in Battery Park City, he was short on big news -- when will
the damaged Fiterman Hall be razed? what is the status of the West
Street bypass? where will an extra $3 billion come from to build a
train tunnel from downtown to Long Island? -- but long on smaller yet
vital details.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he outlined the early construction schedule of the
Freedom Tower. Excavation of 18,000 cubic yards of bedrock for the
column footings will begin in February, he said. By April, steel and
concrete will arrive. A three-foot-thick concrete liner will be built
to reinforce the slurry wall around the trade center foundations.
Later in 2005, he said, the floor slabs and tower columns of the
skyscraper will start to rise.
</P>
<P>
Next month, Pataki said, construction is to begin on the new South
Ferry subway station and on two stations that are part of the planned
Fulton Street Transit Center on Broadway. Also next month, he said,
deconstruction will begin on the damaged, shrouded 40-story Deutsche
Bank building across Liberty Street from the trade center site.
</P>
<P>
After his speech, Pataki visited the 21st floor of the Deutsche Bank
building and then the muddy pit of ground zero, where outlines of the
column remnants of 1 World Trade Center have been exposed.
