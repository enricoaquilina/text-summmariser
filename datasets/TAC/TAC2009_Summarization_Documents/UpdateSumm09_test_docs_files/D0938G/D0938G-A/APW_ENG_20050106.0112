Robert De Niro, Barbara Walters, David Rockefeller and other members of the
foundation charged with raising money for a World Trade Center memorial held
their first meeting.
</P>
<P>
The 33-member board set up governance and executive committees before meeting
Wednesday with trade center master planner Daniel Libeskind and memorial
architect Michael Arad near the building site.
</P>
<P>
Arad said his memorial will try "to make present what is absent" since the Sept.
11, 2001, terrorist attack that brought down the twin towers and other
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came on the same day that Gov. George Pataki urged passage of an
income tax checkoff that would allow New York taxpayers to donate to the
memorial.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation's board also includes former Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Disney CEO Michael Eisner and several trade
center victims' family members.
</P>
<P>
They have been given the task of raising $500 million (euro378 million) to build
both a memorial to the victims of the 2001 and 1993 trade center attacks and
adjoining cultural facilities.
</P>
<P>
The memorial will include a forest of oak trees with a clearing for Sept. 11
gatherings and a Memorial Hall between the reflecting pools that will mark the
footprints of the lost towers.
</P>
<P>
Lower Manhattan Development Corp. Chairman John Whitehead last month called
Memorial Hall a public space where visitors will be able to "review a directory
of the names, locating their loved ones among the souls that are
there."
</P>
<P>
Whitehead's agency was created to oversee redevelopment at and around the trade
center site.
