FOUNDATION MAY KEEP TRADE CENTER MEMORIAL BUSINESS OUT OF PUBLIC VIEW
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Don't look now -- actually, you can't look
now -- but a great deal of decision-making about the
public realm at the new World Trade Center may disappear
from public view behind closed boardroom doors.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation board met Wednesday for the
first time before emerging for an introduction to the site
by the architects Daniel Libeskind and Michael Arad. Because the
board includes Robert De Niro and Barbara Walters, there were
many cameras and microphones to capture that moment in the
Winter Garden of the World Financial Center, overlooking ground zero.
</P>
<P>
Images and sound bites convey a false sense of accessibility, however.
The truth is that the two-hour meeting was closed to
the public and the news media, since the foundation is
a private corporation.
</P>
<P>
Officials have long complimented themselves -- sometimes with good reason --
on the openness and transparency of planning efforts at the
trade center site. But the future may hold opacity, or
at least translucence, as the nonprofit foundation assumes more of
the role that the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. has performed
until now.
</P>
<P>
The impact of this shift has not received much attention, perhaps
because the very name "Foundation" understates the new body's role
and potential clout. On the face of it, it sounds
like a genteel, cup-in-hand group that will solicit charitable contributions
that the development corporation, a state agency, cannot.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the foundation will be a fund-raising organization. "All levels of
gifts -- from $1 to $100 million -- will be
sought and accepted," said its September 2003 application for tax-exempt
status under section 501(c)3 of the internal revenue code. (With
about $3.5 million now in hand, $496.5 million is still
to be raised.)
</P>
<P>
But the foundation was given a broader range of powers in
its April 2003 certificate of incorporation, beginning with its purpose:
"To own, construct, operate and maintain a memorial and related
structures and appurtenances on the site of the World Trade
Center."
</P>
<P>
Own. Construct. Operate. Maintain.
</P>
<P>
That is a lot of responsibility, with many implications for the
way the public will experience the memorial, the interpretive memorial
center and the museums and the theaters, since the foundation
is also charged with "encouraging the development of cultural facilities
as part of the redevelopment of the World Trade Center
site."
</P>
<P>
The foundation has a lot of power to do these jobs.
It may "solicit, accept, hold, invest, reinvest and administer any
gifts, bequests, devises, benefits of trusts and property of any
sort, without limitation as to amount or value, and to
use, disburse or donate the principal or income." (A devise
is a gift of real property by will.) It may
also "purchase, lease, receive, own, sell and convey real and
personal property of all kinds."
</P>
<P>
But it does not have to let the public listen in.
</P>
<P>
"There is no law that requires that the board must be
open," said Ira M. Millstein, a senior partner in the
law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, who is counsel to
the development corporation board and one of the foundation's directors.
</P>
<P>
The board could choose to operate more openly. "This is a
decision for the board to make," Millstein said. "It's very
difficult to have a hair-down discussion with everyone watching. On
the other hand, we want to be completely transparent."
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's session was largely procedural, according to those who were there.
Deputy Mayor Patricia E. Harris became the 33rd director and
Jason R. Lilien was named counsel. Walters, the one reporter
in the room, raised the issue of openness. John C.
Whitehead, the interim chairman, told board members that meeting minutes
would be made public.
</P>
<P>
The Lower Manhattan Development Corp. maintains a virtual library of important
planning documents on its Web site, www.renewnyc.com, and opens its
monthly board meetings to the public and the press. True,
almost all the substantive work goes on behind the scenes.
But several useful civic purposes are served.
</P>
<P>
For one, the principals almost always attend. This means that citizens
who show up to register their unhappiness with the corporation
-- particularly for its failure to finance more job-creation and
lower-income housing programs -- may be assured at least that
their placards, banners and lapel buttons are being read by
the people in charge.
</P>
<P>
One can argue whether these quiet protests have any meaningful effect
but the board can never adjourn under the impression that
its policies are uniformly popular.
</P>
<P>
Last month, for instance, members of the Restaurant Opportunities Center of
New York showed up to criticize the corporation for not
helping finance a restaurant planned downtown to employ displaced workers
from Windows on the World. The matter was not even
on the agenda but the workers had a chance to
make their grievance felt.
</P>
<P>
Reporters are given about 10 minutes after each meeting to ask
questions of anyone on the board, particularly those who would
otherwise be hard to reach. The principals typically stay for
this question-and-answer session, even though they are sometimes put on
the spot.
</P>
<P>
Meetings can be revealing. Though they are tightly organized, with little
freewheeling discussion, it is possible to see fissures within the
board by paying attention to the questions, objections and exceptions
that members register, even as they vote -- generally unanimously
-- to adopt the items before them.
</P>
<P>
Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the development corporation and a
foundation director, said, "The board clearly understands the public trust
which they have undertaken and are committed to the same
level of transparency as the LMDC."
