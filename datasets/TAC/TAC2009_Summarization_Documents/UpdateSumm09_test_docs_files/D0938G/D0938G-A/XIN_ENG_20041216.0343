The architectural team designing the World Trade Center (WTC)
memorial presented an update on its plans Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Governor George Pataki and Mayor Michael Bloomberg joined the team of
architects to present a more detailed description of what visitors
will experience at the memorial and the surrounding plaza.
</P>
<P>
The updated design will not include any changes to the random listing
of the victims' names. The families of some rescue workers wanted
their loved ones listed separately, though police officers,
firefighters and paramedics will be identifiable by the insignia of
their respective agencies.
</P>
<P>
"We have to have a memorial that really allows us to connect the
sheer enormity of the Twin Towers, to the individuals that were taken
from us," said Bloomberg.
</P>
<P>
Pataki praised designers for creating a fitting memorial to those who
lost their lives at the WTC site. He said the memorial will help tell
the story of Sept. 11 and the lost lives, so that future generations
will understand the enormity of what happened here.

<P>
The new schematic design features a vast landscaped civic plaza,
cascading voids with deeply recessed pools and an area for those lost
but never identified.
</P>
<P>
"The primary responsibility that we have is to those who lost so much
on that terrible day," said memorial designer Michael Arad. "We want
to show, to make clear, what a great loss we all suffered. "
</P>
<P>
In January, 2004, a 13-member jury selected "Reflecting Absence " by
Michael Arad and Peter Walker as the design for the WTC memorial.
Over the past months, the design team, with associate architect Max
Bond, embarked on the schematic design process to develop the
physical and programmatic elements of the memorial.
</P>
<P>
The memorial, which will commemorate the nearly 3,000 victims of the
Sept.11 terror attacks and the 1993 bombing, is expected to be
completed by 2009.
