New York Governor George Pataki 
joined victims' family members, survivors, and rescue workers 
Thursday in laying out a timetable for two temporary Sept. 11 
memorials.
</P>
<P>
One project is an oral history booth called "StoryCorps." Set 
up in the PATH station at the World Trade Center site, it will 
have audio recordings featuring memories of loved ones and the 
events of Sept. 11. The memorial will open to the public on July 
12.
</P>
<P>
The permanent memorial, part of the trade center site 
redevelopment, is due to open in 2009. Governor Pataki said it was
important to have temporary memorials to help the victims' loved 
ones and help tourists understand what happened there.
</P>
<P>
"You come down here any time, any day and there are people 
looking down at the site and imagining in their minds what 
happened on Sept. 11," said Pataki. "Now they can still do that, 
but then they'll be able to go across the street to the tribute 
center and be told the actual story by people who understand it 
and by people who were there on that day."
</P>
<P>
The other project is the Tribute, set to open in March next 
year at a now-vacant storefront and basement at Liberty Street.
</P>
<P>
The center will house a gallery, exhibits and education 
programs, and will offer walking tours around the trade center 
site.
</P>
<P>
The interim memorials will serve as outlets for information 
about the attacks until the permanent memorial is built.
