GATHERING MEMORIES OF THE LOST, WHERE THEY DIED

Down at the Battery, booklets called "Attack on
America," "Tragedy" and "Tragedia" sell for $6, or two for
$10. The pictures make the sale, and the pictures are
all the same. They tell a story exhaustively told in
forests of newsprint, books, government reports, made-for-TV movies and a
Bruce Springsteen record.
</P>
<P>
Inside the World Trade Center PATH train station, the Lower Manhattan
Development Corp. has commissioned a project to tell the story
again, an exercise in populism that takes an approach opposite
to that of the photo booklets. The project, a storytelling
booth set to open Tuesday, depends on words with no
pictures, rambling impressions instead of searing images, the cadence of
voices in place of printed text.
</P>
<P>
In part, it is a stopgap for Reflecting Absence, a six-acre
memorial scheduled to open in 2009 at the site of
the terror attack of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The storytelling idea has won tacit approval from survivors' groups, no
mean feat in light of the controversies attached to memorial
planning at the city's grimmest tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
"People have stories to tell; they need to start doing it
now," said Monica Iken, the founder of a group called
September's Mission and a critic of some memorial plans. "Children
are getting older, people are ready to express themselves." Iken
lost her husband, Michael, a bond broker, at the World
Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
The development corporation paid $350,000 to build the booth and pledged
an additional $150,000 to operate it through December. There are
plans to install listening stations later on. The project is
an extension of work by Story Corps, which began an
oral history archive at Grand Central Terminal two years ago.
In a sparse recording studio at Vanderbilt Hall and later
in mobile booths traveling the country, 3,000 people have conducted
40-minute interviews of friends and family members, keeping a copy
and leaving another for submission to the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
The founder of Story Corps, David Isay, said many participants had
been using their sessions to memorialize dead relatives, so the
notion of a booth devoted to stories of Sept. 11
seemed a natural fit.
</P>
<P>
"There's only one thing that's important about the site or September
11, and that's that people were lost," Isay said. "Nothing
else matters."
</P>
<P>
For the Sept. 11 project, Isay invited survivors and relatives of
victims to make the first recordings at Grand Central. He
expects others will go there, too, instead of to the
World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 50 people have made Sept. 11 recordings, but
cancellations have been common, Isay said. Michael Kuo, 29, whose
father was killed on Sept. 11, canceled an appointment in
December.
</P>
<P>
"You can set an appointment for December 12, an arbitrary day,
and you don't feel it, you don't feel sharp, you
can't explain it," Kuo said.
</P>
<P>
For those who have made recordings, the experience has been emotionally
complex. Keith Meerholz, 39, who escaped from one of the
towers, sat for an interview conducted by his wife, Grete,
with help from a Story Corps worker.
</P>
<P>
"I never thought this would be a good thing for people
to hear," Meerholz said. "I always thought they would think,
'Why did that son of a bitch get out and
not my person?"'
</P>
<P>
The speakers set their own paths. The Leinung family's interview makes
no mention of Sept. 11 for the first quarter-hour; the
McNeal family brings it up almost at the start of
the recording.
</P>
<P>
Because the booth will be open to everyone, not all of
the recordings will be on the same emotional plane. Edward
Linenthal, a professor of history at Indiana University and the
author of "The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory,"
said that policy allowed Isay to avoid some tough choices.
</P>
<P>
In Oklahoma City, he recalled, memorial planners had to decide who
had been in enough danger to be considered a survivor.
</P>
<P>
"It allows for a tremendously rich, complex collective memory," Linenthal said.
"It also attracts, not so positively, people who would seek
to attach themselves to an important moment in history."
</P>
<P>
Mary Marshall Clark, director of the Oral History Research Center at
Columbia University and a co-coordinator of the unrelated Sept. 11,
2001, Oral History Narrative and Memory Project, said the booth's
value would depend in part on what solace it brings
survivors. On that score, she said, the location was not
promising.
</P>
<P>
"Ground zero is by its very definition a place of destruction,
of the end of life," Clark said. "It's inviting them
to re-enter the void, so there should be someone there
after the interview."
</P>
<P>
Isay said members of his staff call families after interviews.
</P>
<P>
The notion of speaking at the trade center site appeals to
Kuo, who canceled his session last winter. He has a
new appointment for July 28, another arbitrary day when he
might or might not feel like talking.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's right to do it at the World Trade
Center site," Kuo said, "because that's where the spirits are."
