LAST PIECE OF TRADE CENTER PUZZLE MAY NOT BE AN EASY FIT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The clock ran out last week for public comments on New
York state's plan to condemn almost an entire block south
of ground zero, the last parcel needed for the full
redevelopment of the World Trade Center site.
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously absent from the comments submitted to the Lower Manhattan Development
Corp. was any objection from the Milstein family, owners of
the land the state proposes to take.
</P>
<P>
"We're hopeful that we will have a satisfactory resolution soon," said
a spokesman for Paul and Howard P. Milstein, father and
son, who run Milstein Properties and are co-chairmen of the
Emigrant Savings Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Milsteins' conciliatory statement, which is all they will say on
the subject, sets the stage for negotiations -- one step
ahead of formal condemnation -- over a vital parcel that
is to serve as the gateway to the ramps, service
roads, loading docks and parking spaces under the future trade
center.
</P>
<P>
"We remain hopeful that we'll be able to reach a negotiated
settlement," Kevin M. Rampe, president of the Lower Manhattan Development
Corp., said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Known on city maps as Block 56, this parallelogram-shaped property is
bounded by Liberty, Washington, Cedar and West Streets. The Milsteins
own all but the lot on which St. Nicholas Greek
Orthodox Church stood until it was crushed by 2 World
Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
But the Milsteins have been unable to use their land since
Sept. 11, 2001. Today, Block 56 is controlled by the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. It serves
as a parking lot, staging area and roadway into the
trade center site.
</P>
<P>
The Milsteins bought their 20,000-square-foot property in 1978. In 1981, they
announced plans for a 35-story, 400,000-square-foot office building, to be
called 1 World Plaza, or 140 Liberty Street. Designed by
the Vilkas Group, it would have been connected at the
second-story level with a pedestrian bridge to 1 Bankers Trust
Plaza, which was later known as the Deutsche Bank building.
</P>
<P>
There was no market for that project, but the Milsteins kept
exploring possibilities. They tried to acquire the St. Nicholas property,
going so far as to discuss projects in which they
would construct a new sanctuary for the Greek Orthodox Church
in the base of a larger building. More recently, they
had focused on residential or hotel development. Meanwhile, the site
was used as a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
Control of the property was assumed by the City Department of
Design and Construction after Sept. 11, 2001. The city then
passed control to the Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
The authority has never entered into a lease or other agreement
with the Milsteins, although there were some discussions in 2002.
The authority has not paid any money to the Milsteins
for using this block.
</P>
<P>
(The church property will not be taken by eminent domain but
swapped for a larger parcel nearby on which a new
sanctuary and interdenominational center will be built.)
</P>
<P>
The planners of the trade center site originally envisioned that Block
56 would be part of the new Liberty Park, with
St. Nicholas Church at its west end. The ramp to
the underground roadways was to be on the north side
of Liberty Street.
</P>
<P>
Plans now call for the ramp to be on the south
side. That permits two-way traffic on Liberty Street and separates
what will be a heavily used ramp from the memorial.
</P>
<P>
But the trade center site is an interlocking puzzle. No planning
problem can be solved without creating another one. To accommodate
trucks and buses, the ramp entrance will need a great
deal of headroom; so much that it will force the
construction of a 20-foot earthen mound, or berm, in the
middle of Liberty Park.
</P>
<P>
This berm could overwhelm the new church and loom over the
south end of the memorial plaza. On the other hand,
if it were creatively conceived and designed, it might offer
a fine vantage from which to view the memorial.
</P>
<P>
Before any of that happens, however, the Milsteins will almost certainly
seek compensation for the three-and-a-half years -- and counting --
in which they have been deprived of access to their
property.
</P>
<P>
Just how much compensation remains to be seen. They have already
turned down a $30 million offer from the development corporation.
(Last week, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development
approved the corporation's plan to spend $44.5 million to acquire
the whole site, including the Milsteins' property.)
</P>
<P>
The Milsteins are also interested in a land swap. It would
not take much imagination to conclude that their sights are
set on Battery Park City, which is controlled by a
state authority. They have already developed four apartment buildings there:
Liberty Court, Liberty House, Liberty Terrace and Liberty View.
</P>
<P>
"All options are on the table," Rampe said.
