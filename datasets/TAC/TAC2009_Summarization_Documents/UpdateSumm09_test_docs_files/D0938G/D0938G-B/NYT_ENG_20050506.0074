WORLD TRADE CENTER SITE REBUILDING PLAGUED BY SETBACKS

<P>
Uncertainty is looming large at Ground Zero as
plans to heal the scars of Sept. 11, 2001 face
new setbacks and revisions.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Tower meant to rise from the World Trade Center's
ashes will be redesigned because of security concerns, officials said
this week. Plans for a memorial for the terror victims
also will likely undergo many changes.
</P>
<P>
This comes amid slowed construction, the resignation of a leading development
official, bickering over design and continuing questions about whether so
much new office space can be filled in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
Some groups representing victims' families, who faced a Friday deadline to
submit public comments on proposed memorial changes, blame government officials
and developers for rushing the rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
"The memorial has taken a back seat to the commercial interests,"
said Anthony Gardner, a board member of the Coalition of
9/11 Families whose brother, Harvey, was killed in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
The coalition opposes many proposed changes, including reducing the number of
pedestrian ramps into the memorial from four to two.
</P>
<P>
"They're going to be recreating that claustrophobic sort of environment that
was going on during the attack as people were descending
the stairwells," Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
Changes to the Freedom Tower could be even more extensive.
</P>
<P>
The skyscraper was envisioned as a twisting 1,776-foot spire of glittering
glass and steel, its form evoking the Statue of Liberty's
silhouette.
</P>
<P>
But the building is going back to the drawing board, Gov.
George Pataki said Wednesday, responding to security concerns from the
New York Police Department. One of the worries expressed last
month was that the building would be too close to
the street and vulnerable to a truck bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that (architect) David Childs will come up
with yet another magnificent design that will once again inspire
the nation and serve as a fitting tribute to freedom,"
Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
A first look at that new design, which should still reach
the same patriotic height, could be released in several weeks,
development officials said.
</P>
<P>
The security concerns will likely push back the tower's completion date
to at least 2010, a year later than first planned.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of these security issues so recently -- the tower's
design was unveiled in December 2003 and the cornerstone laid
on the last Fourth of July -- has led to
finger-pointing by government officials, with some expressing surprise over the
police concerns.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., while praising Pataki for acting to get
the project back on track, had said a day earlier
that the rebuilding was "losing steam."
</P>
<P>
"A culture of inertia has infected downtown redevelopment and our city
in general, making large public projects like this one nearly
impossible to complete," he said. "We seem to be losing
our way."
</P>
<P>
Last month, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. suspended plans to build a
$2 billion, 40-story headquarters at the site. The state scrapped
plans for a nearby traffic tunnel that concerned the company,
but the building's future remains in limbo.
</P>
<P>
The planned Freedom Tower and the nearby 7 World Trade Center,
which is almost complete, lack major tenants.
</P>
<P>
Adding to this, Kevin Rampe, president of the Lower Manhattan Development
Corp., which oversees the rebuilding effort at the World Trade
Center site, announced on Monday his resignation effective later this
month. Rampe has said his departure was long planned and
unrelated to the current redevelopment issues.
</P>
<P>
Schumer warned that continuing delays could put federal funding for the
area at risk.
</P>
<P>
He added that while security concerns need to be taken seriously,
"the Freedom Tower cannot become a barricaded, windowless fortress --
a dark and uninviting presence in a neighborhood that desperately
needs the shops, people and bustle unique to this great
city."
</P>
<P>
"The Freedom Tower is more than a building to anchor lower
Manhattan," he said. "It is a statement of American resolve."
