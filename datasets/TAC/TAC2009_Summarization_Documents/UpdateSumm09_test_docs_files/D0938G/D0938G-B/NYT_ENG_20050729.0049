EDITORIAL: A SENSE OF PROPORTION AT GROUND ZERO

Somewhere in the ill-conceived campaign to "take back the memorial" at
ground zero, false impressions have managed to triumph over facts.
This week, Debra Burlingame, a board member of the World
Trade Center Memorial Foundation, and others called for a boycott
of fundraising for the memorial until the International Freedom Center
and the Drawing Center have been banished from ground zero.
She argues that money for the memorial will be intermingled
with funds for the cultural building that is supposed to
house the Freedom Center and the Drawing Center. This is
both misleading and harmful to the memorial itself. The World
Trade Center Memorial Foundation has pledged that its first priority
is to build the memorial and create an endowment for
it. Private donors are free to specify how they choose
to have their money spent.

The attacks on the International Freedom Center -- and, more broadly,
on the cultural component of Daniel Libeskind's master plan --
make it all too easy to forget the existence of
a Memorial Museum that is devoted wholly to the events
of 9/11. Opponents of the Freedom Center, like Burlingame, claim
that the Memorial Museum will be dwarfed by the cultural
center. In fact, they overstate the size of the Snohetta
building, which is being scaled back for other reasons, and
they have exaggerated the floor space allotted there for the
International Freedom Center. They also make it sound as if
the Memorial Museum, which at 50,000 square feet is larger
than the public spaces in the Whitney Museum, is somehow
an afterthought relegated to the basement. It will be built
underground, but that is because the 9/11 families asked to
have access to the bedrock and to what remains of
the foundation of the twin towers. To argue over the
size of these two spaces is to assume that emotional
power is solely the result of square footage. It is
also to forget the profound effect that going to the
roots of the World Trade Center will have on most
visitors.

But this is not really a campaign about money or space.
It is a campaign about political purity -- about how
people remember 9/11 and about how we choose to read
its aftermath, including the Iraq war. On their Web site,
www.takebackthememorial.org, critics of the cultural plan at ground zero offer
a resolution called Campaign America. It says that ground zero
must contain no facilities "that house controversial debate, dialogue, artistic
impressions, or exhibits referring to extraneous historical events." This, to
us, sounds un-American.
