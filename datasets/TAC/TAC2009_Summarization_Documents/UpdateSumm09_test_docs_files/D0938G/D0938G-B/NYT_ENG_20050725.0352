CRITICS CALL FOR BOYCOTT OF MEMORIAL FUND-RAISING

In the ever fiercer fight over a year-old
plan to build a home for the Drawing Center and
the International Freedom Center alongside the World Trade Center memorial,
some relatives of 9/11 victims called on Monday for a
fund-raising boycott.
</P>
<P>
"We urge you to not donate to the World Trade Center
memorial until the IFC and the Drawing Center are eliminated
from the memorial plans," said "An Open Letter to the
American People." The letter appeared on a Web site, Take
Back the Memorial, until questions arose over how many of
the 14 relatives' groups that were signed to the letter
had approved the use of their names.
</P>
<P>
Despite that withdrawal, critics of the cultural plan -- including two
members of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation, which is
charged with soliciting contributions -- said the freedom center had
to be removed before they would support the use of
public money for the overall project. Opponents have objected in
advance to what they say will be an anti-American bias
to the center's offerings, a charge that the center has
just as strongly rejected.
</P>
<P>
"We owe it to the American people or anyone else who
wants to donate to tell them what they're paying for
and not mislead them," said Debra Burlingame, a foundation board
member and one of the letter's authors. She said financing
for the memorial would be intermingled with that for the
building at Fulton and Greenwich Streets that is intended to
house the International Freedom Center and the Drawing Center.
</P>
<P>
The assertion was disputed by Lynn Rasic, the vice president for
public affairs at the foundation. "The first fund-raising efforts are
devoted to the memorial and the museum dedicated to Sept.
11," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate and wrong to block efforts to make sure that
our nation and the world remember those we lost during
the attacks," Rasic said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether it was a conflict of interest for board members
to urge prospective donors to withhold support, Rasic said any
potential conflicts would be reviewed by the governance committee.
</P>
<P>
Monica Iken, a board member and the founder of September's Mission,
which supports the development of a memorial, said she had
not approved the use of her group's name on the
letter. "I never signed off on anything like that," she
said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"I have an obligation to fund-raise for the memorial," she added.
</P>
<P>
But Burlingame said her objections were in line with her fiduciary
responsibilities as a board member. "You can't go out to
the public and say, 'We're raising $500 million,' and not
tell them they're building on the same site a building
so large it will dwarf the memorial," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lee Ielpi, another member of the foundation board, is also vice
president of the September 11th Families Association, which was listed
as supporting the open letter.
</P>
<P>
"I'm fully comfortable asking Americans who shared our sorrow and came
to help us in the worst of times to help
us honor our dead and the sacrifice they made," he
said. "I am not comfortable asking them to play a
role in a political, economic or ideological passion play whose
ending has yet to be written. I believe the freedom
center is a bad idea."
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Shurbet, the founder of Take Back the Memorial (takebackthememorial.org),
said that the open letter was a draft that had
been "posted prematurely" and that the link to it was
removed "pending final approval" by the relatives' groups.
</P>
<P>
As to the larger issue of the cultural organizations, Stefan Pryor,
the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., said officials
were having "continuing conversations with the two institutions regarding their
response" to concerns raised by Gov. George E. Pataki. On
June 24, the governor asked for an "absolute guarantee" that
programs on the site not denigrate America or offend victims'
families.
</P>
<P>
Eric Foner, the DeWitt Clinton professor of history at Columbia University,
resigned from the freedom center's committee of scholars and advisers
early this month, after a letter from the center to
Pryor that tried to address those concerns. News of his
resignation was reported on Saturday in The New York Post.

Alternative locations for the Drawing Center on and off the trade
center site are already being explored
