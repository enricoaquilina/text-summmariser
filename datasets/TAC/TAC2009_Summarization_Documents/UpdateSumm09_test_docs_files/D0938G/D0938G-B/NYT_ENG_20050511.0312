AIDE TO PATAKI IS PUT IN CHARGE AT GROUND ZERO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George E. Pataki will appoint his chief
of staff to take control of the rebuilding effort in
Lower Manhattan, aides to the governor said last night. He
will also use hundreds of millions of public dollars to
jumpstart the fund-raising effort for the Sept. 11 memorial at
the World Trade Center site, they said, and will push
ahead the timetable for producing a redesign of the Freedom
Tower office building.
</P>
<P>
Pataki, in a speech Thursday to the Association for a Better
New York, is to announce that John P. Cahill, one
of his closest aides, is set to leave Albany to
spend the majority of his time working on the complex
multibillion-dollar redevelopment project, and that he will be charged with
the power to bring together the disparate agencies and agendas
at the site, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
They spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve relationships with
interested parties who had not yet been briefed about the
changes.
</P>
<P>
Among Cahill's first priorities will be to lure Goldman Sachs &amp;
Co. back to Lower Manhattan. The investment bank recently scrapped
plans to build a new $2 billion headquarters across the
street from the former World Trade Center site.
</P>
<P>
Pataki, the aides said, will also energize the fund-raising effort for
the planned memorial by earmarking $300 million in federal money
for construction and maintenance of the complex, which includes a
study center, underground exhibits and twin reflecting pools marking the
footprints of the twin towers. Finally, Pataki will announce that
a new plan for the Freedom Tower, which was deemed
vulnerable to a terrorist attack, will be released in one
month.
</P>
<P>
Pataki's latest plans amount to his starkest and most public acknowledgement
that the large and emotionally delicate effort in Lower Manhattan
has suffered serious setbacks in recent weeks. The governor is
eager not only to mollify the executives at Goldman Sachs
but also to quiet a growing chorus of critics --
from U.S. Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., to business leaders
and real estate experts -- who have complained that the
project seems derailed.
</P>
<P>
Pataki has long hoped that a rebuilt and prospering downtown would
be the cornerstone of his legacy. His third term expires
next year, and he has not announced whether he will
seek a fourth.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the speech is more than an update," one
aide to the governor said. "The purpose is to restore
confidence in the rebuilding process." The aide added that the
lesson that was learned in recent weeks "is that anything
can hit a snag, and we don't want things out
of control again."
</P>
<P>
To that end, Pataki has assigned Cahill to coordinate the work
of each government agency and private institution and to serve
as the final word from Albany. Cahill, a lawyer who
early in his career handled some real estate and development
projects, once served as the head of the State Department
of Environmental Conservation and has long been one of the
governor's senior policy advisers.
</P>
<P>
All those involved at ground zero will report to Cahill, including
the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the agency
set up in the aftermath of Sept. 11 to run
the redevelopment. Kevin Rampe recently announced that he would resign
as president of the development agency, and his successor has
not yet been named. The Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, the Battery Park City Authority and the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority will also report to Cahill.
</P>
<P>
He will also be the governor's liaison to the city and
to private business.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs expressed pleasure. "We have had an
excellent relationship with John Cahill," the spokesman, Peter Rose, said.
"We think he is the right person to provide leadership
to bring the variegated parts of downtown together."
</P>
<P>
Pataki's speech will likely be greeted with some relief as well
as skepticism, given that some three and a half years
have passed since the trade center attacks. "Timetables and speeches
haven't gotten us anywhere so far," said Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver, who was briefed on the plan Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The families of the Sept. 11 victims were one of Pataki's
key constituencies as the new plan for the site was
developed, and the governor is to make a gesture to
that group as he pledges public dollars to build and
preserve the memorial.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation was created in December to
raise money and run and preserve the memorial and the
nearby cultural buildings. But the foundation, which garnered some private
contributions, has also fallen short of the initial expectation of
its founders.
</P>
<P>
It only recently named a president and began fund-raising in earnest,
and is far short of the hundreds of millions of
dollars needed to proceed. Pataki will announce that $300 million
of the remaining $800 million in Lower Manhattan Development Corporation
funds would go toward the memorial, with $200 million serving
as a challenge grant for private donations.
