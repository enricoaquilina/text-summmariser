DESIGNER OF 9/11 MEMORIAL STAYS FOCUSED ON THE GOAL

<P>
Sometime it's hard to believe that Michael Arad
is still in the picture.
</P>
<P>
Bit by bit, elements of his original design for the World
Trade Center Memorial have been whittled away, whether because of
logistical realities at ground zero (the memorial will be built
above PATH train tracks), client demands (the Lower Manhattan Development
Corp. is calling the shots), the many other interests involved
(the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which
owns the site; victims' families; downtown residents) or the assorted
architectural cooks (three other firms).
</P>
<P>
For example, Arad included no trees in his original design, which
was chosen in January 2004 after a competition. The memorial
jury expressed a desire to make his design more green,
so he teamed up with the landscape architect Peter Walker.
Now Arad is fending off a veritable forest at the
site and dealing with how the trees might impinge on
the memorial below them.
</P>
<P>
Arad originally designed four ramps leading into and out of the
memorial. Now there are two.
</P>
<P>
His reflecting pools were not centered in the footprints of the
twin towers. Now they are.
</P>
<P>
Two considerably more experienced architectural firms are taking part in the
process: Peter Walker &amp; Partners and Davis Brody Bond. Handel
Architects is also involved; Arad, now 35, joined the firm
last year to give himself institutional backup.
</P>
<P>
Some planning and design experts marvel that Arad has not been
completely marginalized or discouraged. "He may be crumbling internally, but
I think he's shown surprising maturity for his tender years,"
said David J. Burney, the commissioner of the New York
City Department of Design and Construction and an architect himself.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview yesterday, Arad was cautious in fielding questions
about the current state of his design. (Joanna Rose, the
development corporation spokeswoman, was in the room on speakerphone.) Asked
whether he was satisfied with the two ramps, Arad did
not respond. His partner, Gary Edward Handel, piped up, "We're
not happy about every decision that's made, but we trust
the process."
</P>
<P>
Arad would say only that he was keeping his eye on
the finish line. "My role in this is to be
the advocate for the memorial," he said. "That is what
I do every day in this project."
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the conflicts over the design of the memorial
have not brought the architects to a standoff or the
process to a standstill, as occurred when David Childs and
Daniel Libeskind fought over the design of the Freedom Tower.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even as the Freedom Tower has become a big question
mark at ground zero in terms of what it will
look like and when it will be finished, the memorial
is proceeding apace. Groundbreaking is expected early next year for
an opening on Sept. 11, 2009.
</P>
<P>
The party line is that people are working through their differences
and that those differences will make for a better final
product. "There's a healthy dialogue and differing opinions," said Kevin
M. Rampe, president of the development corporation. "I think that's
been great. Each brings their unique experience."
</P>
<P>
Walker is largely concerned with "how the landscape interacts with the
memorial," Rampe continued, adding that J. Max Bond Jr. of
Davis Brody Bond "brings an enormous wealth of practical experience
about engineering considerations, and Michael brings the vision."
</P>
<P>
Despite the varying levels of professional experience, Rampe said Arad had
managed to hold his own. "Michael has earned a level
of respect," he said. "I don't think one feels they
can overwhelm the other. They come with different perspectives, different
skills, and ultimately they will end up with good results."
</P>
<P>
The architects largely echoed that assessment. Bond said, "The design benefits
from the interaction of the three different firms and the
consultants."
</P>
<P>
Walker said, "Sometimes it's heated, sometimes it works very smoothly."
</P>
<P>
Arad said: "It's not about this being a harmonious process. It's
about it being a productive process."
</P>
<P>
But some of those involved say Arad was unprepared for the
harsh realities of the process -- above all, how much
his plan would have to change in light of engineering
concerns and competing priorities.
</P>
<P>
"We viewed the competition as the beginning of the evolution," said
Douglas Findlay, a partner in the Walker firm. "He often
views it as the end."
</P>
<P>
Walker offered, "I'm glad I didn't deal with something of this
magnitude at the beginning of my career." He added, "This
is the process to end all processes."
</P>
<P>
Arad said he was by no means naive about the logistics
involved; in addition to the PATH tracks, a chiller plant
lies under the site. "The technical complexity of the site
is challenging," he said. "But our team has a thorough
grasp of the issues."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Arad said, his vision for the site
remains clear. "I know exactly what I want to see
here, and it's just a matter of advocating for the
memorial," he said. "I think people understand that and appreciate
it."
</P>
<P>
When he won the design competition, Arad was only 34 and
had never done anything nearly so big before, let alone
at one of the most scrutinized architectural sites in the
city's history.
</P>
<P>
After earning his master's degree from Georgia Tech's College of Architecture
in 1999, Arad spent three years at Kohn Pedersen Fox
Associates, where he worked on projects like Espirito Santo Plaza
in Miami and Union Station in Hong Kong. Then he
joined the New York City Housing Authority, where he was
working on two new police stations when his memorial design
was selected.
</P>
<P>
Before becoming an architect, Arad spent three years in the Israeli
Army. And he is no stranger to politics or diplomacy:
his father, Moshe, served as Israeli ambassador to the United
States from 1987 to 1990 and as the ambassador to
Mexico from 1983 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
The memorial is expected to cost $350 million, including the Memorial
Center, a separate area being designed by Davis Brody Bond
that is to include artifacts from the Trade Center. The
architects are still in the thick of resolving each of
the design details that will make up the memorial, from
how much noise and splash the waterfalls will give off
to how people will find the names of their loved
ones inscribed in stone around the two pools.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, for example, the parties involved have clashed over the
number of ramps; the decision to have two instead of
four was clearly made over Arad's objections.
</P>
<P>
According to Findlay, the best architects are the ones who "are
able to deal with these obstacles and turn them around
to make them into something, make them a virtue --
not to resist it," and to keep their eyes open
"for the great ideas that flow by."
</P>
<P>
That is not to say that an architect should say yes
to everything if he believes it compromises his design, Findlay
said. He cited his own objections to the Port Authority's
proposal to place a huge vent in the middle of
the park.
</P>
<P>
Arad's initial design did not address questions like crowd circulation or
security. An information center called Memorial Hall has been added
between the two pools.
</P>
<P>
Walker said the experience had deepened his respect for Maya Lin,
who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. "I've never
had the appreciation for her that I have now," he
said. "How she got through it and got something that
is really good and still has got her head about
her -- I think about it all the time."
</P>
<P>
But Findlay emphasized that the ground zero memorial raises different challenges.
"This site is where the event occurred," he said, adding,
"The memorial is essentially people's grave site."
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, the architects are working on the spiritual
aspect of moving through the memorial -- going from the
bustle of the secular city into the park into the
sobering memorial and up again into the living world.
</P>
<P>
"Imagine walking around a five-acre oak woodland," Findlay said. "You will
be drawn into it. You can see across the plain
and see the plain go away. You can hear the
waterfalls, and at night it glows. So in all ways
the voids have been made very important."
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, some of the Sept. 11 families are unhappy with how
the memorial is shaping up. Some want the names of
the victims listed alphabetically, or by tower, or by police
or fire department affiliation. Some even want the remains of
the World Trade Center victims to be moved to the
site from the Fresh Kills landfill. "You can't call these
people heroes and leave their remains in a garbage dump
in Staten Island," said Edie Lutnick, executive director of the
Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund, set up to aid families of
victims who worked for the financial services concern at the
World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
As for creative tensions, some architects say they are to be
expected. "You put capable and strong-willed design firms in a
room and there is a discussion of options," said Fredric
M. Bell, executive director of the New York chapter of
the American Institute of Architects. "That's how it should be."
</P>
<P>
"I think Michael is a very reasonable and smart and flexible
person -- not the type to say, 'I'm taking my
marbles and going home,"' he said. At the same time,
Bell added: "He does have strong ideas. Winning a competition
is incredibly empowering. That's the card that Michael has."
