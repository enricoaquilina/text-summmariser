Gretchen Dykstra, the city consumer affairs commissioner, who
previously led the redevelopment of Times Square, was named Thursday
as president and chief executive of the foundation charged with
raising more than $500 million for a memorial and two
cultural buildings at ground zero.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation was created in December to
raise money and run the memorial and the cultural buildings,
which include a performing arts center and museum. Its board,
which includes David Rockefeller, Robert De Niro,Barbara Walters and Michael
D. Eisner, is expected eventually to take over many of
the responsibilities of the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., which is
overseeing the rebuilding effort at ground zero.
</P>
<P>
"It's important, it's historic, it's unique and it's doable," Dykstra, 57,
said of her new job in an interview at the
corporation's offices near ground zero. She said she was confident
that it would not be hard to drum up financial
support -- "not for this event, not for this purpose."
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get moving," she said, adding that the foundation
members had "already begun to lay the groundwork."
</P>
<P>
At a news conference at the trade center site after the
foundation's second board meeting Thursday, John C. Whitehead, the chairman
of the development corporation, said the foundation began its fund-raising
effort about two weeks ago and had already received large
financial commitments. He said that by large gifts he meant
pledges of $10 million to $25 million.
</P>
<P>
Dykstra was selected from about 12 candidates, Whitehead said, because "she
has all the qualities we were looking for in a
president."
</P>
<P>
Dykstra said she would start in her new post next month.
She will face the challenge of balancing the competing concerns
of the parties involved at ground zero, including city and
state officials, families of those who died in the Sept.
11 attacks, downtown residents, real estate developers and big-name architects.
</P>
<P>
That may be what she had in mind Thursday when she
said it was important "to make sure the process of
getting there also makes us proud."
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of players," she added, "a lot of
pressures."
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the performing arts center to be shared by
the Joyce Theater, which presents dance, and the Signature Theater
Company, an off-Broadway company. The museum is to be shared
by the Freedom Center, a nascent organization that plans to
focus on human rights exhibitions, and the Drawing Center, which
presents drawing shows in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
But prospects for all four groups remain murky given that the
development corporation has yet to say how much it will
contribute toward the groups' construction and operating costs and how
much they will have to provide.
</P>
<P>
The corporation has delayed its announcement of a design of the
performing arts center, by the architect Frank Gehry, citing complications
related to fitting both the Joyce and the Signature into
a single building with limited space.
</P>
<P>
Whitehead spoke of the performing arts center as part of a
"second phase" with a separate fund-raising goal of "roughly $200
million"; the first $500 million will cover the memorial, a
memorial center and the museum component, which includes the Freedom
Center and Drawing Center. The development corporation later said the
$200 million figure was uncertain until a design was completed.
</P>
<P>
The corporation also has delayed releasing a design of the museum
building by the Norwegian architecture firm Snohetta, citing details still
to be resolved. In addition, the design of the memorial
itself has been complicated by the fact that three different
architectural firms are involved.
</P>
<P>
Born on Staten Island and raised in Philadelphia, Dykstra received her
bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin and a master's
in education and an honorary doctorate from the Bank Street
College of Education.
