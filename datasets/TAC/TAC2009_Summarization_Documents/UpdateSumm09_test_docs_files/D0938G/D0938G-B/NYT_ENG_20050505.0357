CONTROVERSY CONTINUES OVER SEPT. 11 MEMORIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the focus at ground zero has suddenly
veered to the Freedom Tower and the rough-and-tumble blame game
involving its security redesign, the most vocal members of a
powerful constituency -- the Sept. 11, 2001, families -- have
seized the hour to be heard above the growing clamor
of politicians, developers, architects, cultural administrators, community advocates and other
Lower Manhattan stakeholders.
</P>
<P>
Family members of the 2,749 World Trade Center victims, and other
interested parties, have until 5 p.m. Friday to formally express
their concerns about the memorial's evolving design. That witching hour
officially halts the period of public commentary on a new
round of amendments to the reconstruction effort's originally approved environmental
assessment.
</P>
<P>
September's Mission and several other family groups have objected to many
of the announced amendments, among them reducing the number of
pedestrian ramps into the memorial to two from four. They
say that this would re-create the claustrophobic experience of fleeing
from the Twin Towers, and that it would pose a
hazard if the projected 2,000 visitors per hour had to
exit in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
At least eight of the dozens of Trade Center groups have
blitzed hundreds of families with e-mail messages encouraging them to
"Make Sure That the Families' Voices Are Heard," as one
of the entreaties put it.
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's now or never," said the executive director of
the World Trade Center United Family Group, Anthony Gardner, whose
brother, Harvey Joseph Gardner III, died in the north tower.
"People are putting egos aside, and we've come together again,
because we feel the memorial concerns are being ignored. Originally
the memorial was the heart of the site, and now
it's getting less and less important."
</P>
<P>
The founder of September's Mission, Monica Iken, whose husband, Michael, died
in the south tower, said that "everyone is talking about
the Freedom Tower, but the memorial is all that many
of us will have of our loved ones, and it
has to be done right."
</P>
<P>
Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation,
which is overseeing the project and the public-comment process, said
of the changes that "the reason the number of ramps
was reduced from four to two was that our consultants
told us that was the best way to provide security
there."
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, he said, the importance of the Trade Center memorial
has been undiminished. And, he added, some of the family
critics were using the environmental-comment period "as an opportunity to
rehash issues that have been out there since the beginning."
</P>
<P>
Some of the family groups insist on direct access to the
Trade Center bedrock at the tower footprints, considering it sacred
ground that offers the only connection to their loved ones,
since the remains of 42 percent of the victims --
including those of Iken's and Gardner's relatives -- have not
been identified. Current plans appear to require family members to
traverse the spaces occupied by tourists and by graphic exhibits
about the attack.
</P>
<P>
"We have plans that will allow people to have access to
bedrock and the columns separately," said Michael Arad, the architect
who designed the memorial. "We have met with the families
every step of the way," he said, "and we will
continue to."
</P>
<P>
Other design criticism from family groups centers around the streetwalls --
or heights of buildings facing the streets -- which, according
to the proposed site changes, could be as high as
150 feet, a prospect that could be "forbidding and unwelcoming"
to pedestrians, Iken said, "and could detract from the memorial,
shadowing it."
</P>
<P>
To Rampe, though, "the streetwall height is exactly the same as
across the street at the World Financial Center."
</P>
<P>
"This was an aesthetic decision," he added, "to make it correspond
with surrounding architecture."
</P>
<P>
Arad said, "We are trying to give the memorial quadrant a
strong definition, so it can be a counterpoint to the
development around it."
</P>
<P>
Important elements of the memorial design are now under intensive study
in Richmond Hill, Ontario, just north of Toronto. There, a
consultant to the memorial-design team has constructed a full-scale mockup
of one corner of one of the voids. Water troughs
at the upper level empty into a pool below, in
a test of one of the most critical elements of
the memorial: the walls of water that will cascade down
all four sides of each enormous void. Architects are experimenting
with ways to reduce noise, splashing, freezing, blowing and clogging.
</P>
<P>
The public commentary process that ends Friday is made mandatory not
only by New York State environmental law, but also by
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which has awarded
$2.78 billion in grants to the Development Corporation for the
rebuilding effort.
</P>
<P>
The Development Corporation has the authority to choose among the comments
it receives -- some 400 arrived by Thursday -- and
the power to enact the changes it sees fit. The
public-comment process "is not a meaningless exercise," Rampe said, pointing
out that the original plan was altered in many respects,
including the access to bedrock and the preservation of Trade
Center remnants at the towers' footprints.
</P>
<P>
The family members are highly diverse, and some said that none
of the disparate and sometimes fractious Sept. 11 groups could
speak for all the families in regard to progress at
ground zero. "We never thought it would be smooth sailing,
and I think that a lot has been accomplished on
the site," said Paula Berry, a member of the Families
Advisory Council. "On the whole, the LMDC has done an
incredible job, and they have made great effort to be
transparent."
</P>
<P>
But Frederic M. Bell, executive director of the New York Chapter
of the American Institute of Architects, echoed charges of some
of the family activists in saying that the development corporation
"has not put out enough public information for the public
to weigh in."
</P>
<P>
"The LMDC garnered input early on," he added, "but that has
diminished, and there is not enough public discourse on how
the project has evolved." His organization has filed an entry
in the public-comment process.
</P>
<P>
Rampe has rejected any extension of the public-comment period, as some
family groups requested. But to Bell, "The comment period ends
when people stop commenting. So the comment period never ends."
</P>
<P>
In keeping with that reality, some family members are also taking
issue with long-known aspects of the project plan, including the
prominence of the cultural buildings that, they say, encroach on
the memorial.
</P>
<P>
"We've ended up with a memorial that's underground, with a museum
that's hovering over the site," said Mary Fetchet, the founding
director of Voices of Sept. 11, who lost her son,
Bradley, in the south tower.
</P>
<P>
Families are also concerned that visitors will be confused by the
International Freedom Center. "You're going to think that's the 9/11
museum," said Edie Lutnick, executive director of the Cantor Fitzgerald
Relief Fund. Because the program planned for the center will
not be purely commemorative, some say it does not belong
there.
</P>
<P>
She and others suggest moving the cultural institutions into the bases
of the commercial buildings on the site.
</P>
<P>
"You've got 10 million square feet of unrented office space," Lutnick
said. "Put it there." The development corporation has said this
is not under consideration.
</P>
<P>
Fetchet said she would urge Gov. George E. Pataki to "take
a leadership role and scrutinize what's being done to the
memorial."
</P>
<P>
"If the memorial fails," she added, "the governor fails."
