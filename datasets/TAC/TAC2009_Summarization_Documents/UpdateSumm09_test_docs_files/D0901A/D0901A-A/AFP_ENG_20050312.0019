<P>
India's prime minister will 
personally flag off the first bus to travel between the Indian and 
Pakistan zones of divided Kashmir in almost six decades when the 
service resumes next month, an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Kashmir in April will 
be his third since he assumed office in May.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister will be in (the Indian Kashmir summer 
capital) Srinagar to flag off the first bus on April 7," Singh's 
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The bus service is the first tangible result of 14 months of 
dialogue between the nuclear-armed neighbours who have fought three 
wars including two over Kashmir, which each hold in part but claim 
in full.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan agreed last month that Kashmiri residents 
would not need passports to cross the divided state by bus but would 
use permits issued by the civil administration after being cleared 
by police.
</P>
<P>
The bus service was suspended in 1947 after the first 
India-Pakistan war over Kashmir. The second was in 1965.
</P>
<P>
Indian Kashmir is in the grip of a 15-year-old insurgency that 
has so far left thousands dead.
</P>
<P>
India blames Pakistan for fomenting the insurgency in Kashmir 
which has left at least 40,000 dead according Indian estimates, 
though separatists put the toll at twice that number.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan denies supporting the rebels though it admits to 
extending moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiris' 
freedom struggle.
</P>
<P>
Indian authorities last week said some 150 permits had been 
issued to applicants from Indian-Kashmir to travel by the bus 
linking Srinagar to Muzaffarabad, capital of the 
Pakistan-administered zone.
</P>
<P>
Of the 150 applicants, 60 will be short-listed for the first two 
trips -- the first on April 7 and the second a fortnight later -- an 
official said.
