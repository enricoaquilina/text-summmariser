Roundup: Kashmiris waiting for festival and peace to come

Markets are overcrowded, traffic jam is heavy and the shops are
jostling with shoppers in the capital city of Srinagar in the
Indian-administered Kashmir as the holy Moslem festival of Eid
approaches here.
</P>
<P>
Kashmiris are known as incorrigible festive shoppers and because of
that reputation, unscrupulous shopkeepers have been minting money by
over-charging the locals for everything from a chop of mutton to the
chickens and hosiery items that the locals must buy to protect
themselves from the biting cold of the winter.
</P>
<P>
But, around this Eid festival, there is more to the happy public mood
than just the urge to over spend during the festival.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who arrives here on a two- day
visit next week, announced on Thursday that orders had been given for
the reduction of troops inside Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
This measure has obviously been taken to take care of the building
tensions between the Indian army and local people who often come into
unpleasant contact during encounters, crackdown operations and search
and cordon exercises that have become so routine in Kashmir ever
since the present armed struggle against the Indian rule started here
18 years back.
</P>
<P>
It must also be mentioned that the Indian army on Friday suspended
and took into custody an officer who had been accused of having raped
a woman and her daughter in a north Kashmir village last week.
</P>
<P>
It is, therefore, clear that the Prime Minister's decision has not
been influenced by any dramatic improvement in the ground situation.
</P>
<P>
Coinciding with the announcement made in the Indian capital New
Delhi, Indian paramilitary police was battling it out with two
suicide guerrillas that forced entry into their camp in Srinagar' s
Dalgate area on the banks of the Dal lake that is regarded as one of
the most secured places in Kashmir and the hub of the tourist
activity in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patil, who had recently
visited Kashmir for three-days, told reporters in Delhi that he was
yet to submit his report to the Prime Minister about his perceptions
of the ground situation in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Patil was obviously trying to suggest that the Prime Minister Singh
had taken the decision to reduce the troops inside Kashmir on his
own.
</P>
<P>
Kashmir is a very tricky situation. One grenade blast can put things
back by months here. That is why the prime minister has said that
together with the reduction in the number of troops in Kashmir, there
would be no lowering of vigil.
</P>
<P>
This also is the reason that many locals believe the Indian
government is acting under international pressure. Interestingly,
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf had recently put forth a new
formula on Kashmir that was seen as a climb down from the previous
Pakistan position on Kashmir. Significantly, Musharraf had suggested
withdrawal of Indian troops from Kashmir region.
</P>
<P>
Does this mean that both Musharraf and Singh are simply trying to
play roles that have been scripted for them by the international
community?
</P>
<P>
For most Kashmiris who have been fed up with the stiffening of Indian
and Pakistan approaches on Kashmir, this appears to be the right
argument. And that has given them new hope to celebrate the
forthcoming Eid with more joy and confidence.
</P>
<P>
It is possible the solution ahs already been drafted and both India
and Pakistan are slowly but surely moving in that direction step by
step so that the people of the two countries are not taken by
surprise when the final agreement is signed, said Samad Sheikh, 71, a
village headman in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
For Kashmiris the recent developments and the fact that the bilateral
ceasefire on the borders between the two countries was holding for
the last one year are indications that their troubles might soon end.
