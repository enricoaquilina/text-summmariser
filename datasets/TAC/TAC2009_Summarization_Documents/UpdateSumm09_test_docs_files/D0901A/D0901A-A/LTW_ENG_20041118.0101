<P>
The leader of moderate Kashmiri separatists
warned Thursday that lasting peace between India and Pakistan would be
impossible unless his people were seated at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
During more than a year of talks with Pakistan, India has refused
to let Kashmiri leaders have a direct role in deciding possible
solutions to the 57-year conflict over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Kashmiri leader Mirwaiz Omar Farooq insisted Thursday that
``historic realities,'' such as a guerrilla war against Indian rule
that began in 1989, meant three-way talks were the only way to end the
dispute over the divided territory.
</P>
<P>
``Kashmiris have expressed themselves in red-hot blood for the last
15 years, and this reality cannot be ignored, neither by India nor
Pakistan,'' said Farooq, who heads a loose alliance of separatist
groups called the All Party Hurriyat Conference.
</P>
<P>
``So if anybody believes that you can have a bilateral agreement on
Kashmir, they are highly mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
The official death toll in the Kashmir insurgency is more than
45,000, but Kashmiris say the real number is more than twice that.
</P>
<P>
Almost 1,600 people have died in the conflict this year. Indian
authorities said about half the dead were militants, 456 were
civilians and 269 were members of the security forces.
</P>
<P>
In January, former Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's
government began the first talks with Kashmiri separatist leaders, but
two rounds of discussions showed little progress.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has been slow to resume
negotiations with Kashmiri leaders since defeating Vajpayee in May
elections.
</P>
<P>
Singh repeated here Wednesday that Kashmir is part of India and
insisted any peace deal with Pakistan could not redraw international
borders or divide Indian territory along religious lines. Kashmiri
leaders feared those were new condset out specific proposals for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
A third round of talks with India's government can't start until it
agrees to let Kashmiri leaders visit Pakistan to discuss peace
proposals with its government and guerrilla commanders in the part of
Kashmir under Pakistan's control, Farooq said.
</P>
<P>
``Both things have to be addressed,'' he told reporters here, after
insisting Hurriyat leaders were not setting conditions for resuming
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Farooq said Hurriyat leaders would travel to New Delhi next week to
meet Pakistan's Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, who is expected to
discuss new efforts to advance a peace process that began last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Farooq, Aziz plans to discuss recent proposals by
President Pervez Musharraf for a settlement, which included granting
autonomy to the divided region and putting parts of it under joint
rule by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
After hearing Kashmiri leaders' views, Aziz will formally present
the proposals to India's government, said Farooq, who called
Musharraf's suggestions ``a step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
``The Hurriyat has three road maps for resolving the Kashmir
issue,'' Farooq said, without providing details. ``And we are ready to
discuss all three, with both the Indian and Pakistan governments, so
that a way forward can be charted that is acceptable to all.''
