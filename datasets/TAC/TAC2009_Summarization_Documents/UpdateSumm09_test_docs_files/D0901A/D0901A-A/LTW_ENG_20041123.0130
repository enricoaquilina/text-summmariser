Indian, Pakistan Leaders to Meet on Kashmir Issue

<P>
The prime ministers of India and Pakistan plan to meet
here Wednesday in an effort to find new grounds for compromise in the
long-running conflict over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz arrived here Tuesday on a
tour of regional capitals as head of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation, which promotes closer economic ties within the
region.
</P>
<P>
Aziz has said he will use his visit with Indian leaders to seek
progress in peace efforts that began last year.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have hinted that Aziz's meeting with Indian Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh may produce agreement on opening bus service
between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled sections of Kashmir for
the first time in 57 years of conflict over the Himalayan territory.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also are said to be near a deal on a $4.2 billion
pipeline to deliver natural gas from Iran to India through Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Aziz's two-day visit comes amid mixed signals from India and
Pakistan on their willingness to compromise on Kashmir. After
insisting for months that they were ready to give up entrenched
positions and make lasting peace, leaders of both countries in recent
days have repeated hard-line views on the disputed region.
</P>
<P>
Indian security forces said they were winning a war against the
separatists in Kashmir, which began in 1989. Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf insisted again last week that the guerrillas were
freedom fighters acting without anything but moral support from his
country.
</P>
<P>
The Indian military says so far this year it has blocked about 60
attempts by militants to infiltrate Indian-held territory from the
Pakistani side. The number climbed in recent weeks as Musharraf
pressed Singh to move more quickly on negotiations over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
``Let me tell you that I have no reason to believe that there has
been any lack of effort in infiltration attempts from across the
border,'' India's chief of army staff, Gen. Nirmal Chander Vij, said
Monday. ``During the current month alone, there have been eight such
attempts, including two taking place during the last two to three
days.''
</P>
<P>
After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the United States pressured
Pakistan to rein in the militant groups, several of which were allies
of the al-Qaida network. But as the guerrillas lose their strength,
Pakistan loses leverage on the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
India tightened the noose around the insurgents by completing a
12-foot-high fence this year that runs 340 miles along its
international border with Pakistan and a 1972 cease-fire line, or Line
of Control, that divides the disputed region between the two.

When the British pulled out of the subcontinent in August 1947,
they told the Indian princes, including the Hindu maharajah who ruled
the mainly Muslim territory of Jammu and Kashmir, to choose between
joining India or Pakistan. As the king delayed, the two neighboring
nations went to war over the region in October of that year, and it
has been divided since.
</P>
<P>
Within days of the war, the maharajah chose India, but Pakistan has
long insisted that he did so under pressure and that the people of
Kashmir should be allowed to decide their fate in a binding referendum
promised in a 1948 United Nations Security Council resolution.

<P>
Musharraf is the first Pakistani leader to publicly suggest that
the dispute might be resolved without a vote by Kashmiris -- if India
makes significant concessions. But he also has suggested that India is
hardening its position.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Musharraf revived Pakistan's demand for the plebiscite,
in the face of New Delhi's continued claim that Kashmir was its
territory and that India's boundaries could not be redrawn.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will only drop its demand for a vote ``if India is
prepared to show flexibility,'' Musharraf told an interviewer last
week, adding that ``at the moment ... we don't see that.''
