Kashmiris cherish reunions with loved ones as historic bus service begins
</HEADLINE>

CHAKOTHI, Pakistan _ Sixty-year-old Khalid Hussain hugged the brother-in-law he
had only seen before in photos after traveling from Indian- to
Pakistani-controlled Kashmir on the bus service revived between the divided
region after a half-century of conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We are so happy we can't express how we feel," Hussain said Thursday after
crossing a narrow bridge over a rushing river that spans the military Line of
Control that cleaves the disputed Himalayan region.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later he embraced his wife's brother, Asif Solaria, who lives on the
Pakistan side and came to meet him.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-seven years of conflict has divided thousands of Kashmiri families. Some
migrated in the aftermath of the bloody partition of the subcontinent in 1947,
many more fled to the Pakistani side when a separatist insurgency took hold in
the Indian portion of Kashmir in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the only way to reunite was through the long and difficult process
of applying for a visa to the other country _ or, during lulls in the violence,
by yelling greetings across the roar of the water at the riverine frontier when
authorities permitted it.
</P>
<P>
All that changed Thursday, when two buses, carrying about 50 people in all, many
of them elderly, shuttled in each direction between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad,
the capitals of the Indian and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, for 15-day
stays.
</P>
<P>
It was an event treated with pomp on both sides and observed with glee by
thousands of Kashmiri villagers scattered on the steep mountainsides of the
Jehlum Valley despite storm clouds, rain and lightning. Many more lined the road
on both sides of the frontier.
</P>
<P>
The bus service _ heralded by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as a "a
caravan of peace" _ will only run once every two weeks, but it's the most
concrete sign that a yearlong peace process aimed at burying the historic enmity
between the nuclear-armed rival nations is bearing fruit for
Kashmiris.
</P>
<P>
Until a year-and-a-half ago, the two armies would routinely shell each other,
often killing civilians who were displaced from their homes in their thousands
by the conflict. On Thursday, white flags fluttered at either side of the "peace
bridge," its approaches recently cleared of land mines.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has also led to resumption of trains, buses and flights
between India and Pakistan, but the launching of the bus link across Kashmir _
severed in 1948 _ is more resonant, holding out some hope of an end to the
intractable conflict over the region, which is claimed by both countries in its
entirety.
</P>
<P>
India has long accused Pakistan of fomenting a separatist insurgency in Kashmir
that has left more than 66,000 people dead over the past 15 years. Pakistan says
it gives political backing to the rebels but denies giving military
support.
</P>
<P>
The bus service was launched despite an attack Wednesday in Srinagar by
suspected militants on a government tourism complex where passengers were
staying. They traveled anyway the following day, apparently undeterred and
making a small piece of history.
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I would see this day in my lifetime," said Zahir Uddin, 57, as
he waited in Chakothi on the Pakistan side of the frontier for two uncles, both
aged in their 80s, who took the bus from India. "It's taken a long time. It
should have happened much sooner."
</P>
<P>
Raja Ferozuddin, 75, a retired government official from Muzaffarabad, was
greeted in a village on the route to Srinagar by two of his Indian nephews after
crossing from Pakistan. The three kissed and wept with joy as they held each
other.
</P>
<P>
"I was eight years old when I left this place," Ferozuddin said. "All this has
happened very late in my life. I want to embrace all this into my heart _ the
trees, the hills, the rocks."
