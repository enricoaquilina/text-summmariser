Pakistan plays down Indian premier's comments on Kashmir solution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pakistan says it would not accept the existing military line dividing
Kashmir as an international border, and is playing down concern that
India is irreconcilibly opposed to adjusting that frontier.
</P>
<P>
During a rare visit to the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir,
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh offered Wednesday to hold talks
on Kashmir "with anyone and everyone," but ruled out any redrawing of
the Himalayan territory's frontier.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan said that Singh's
comments did not necessarily represent an intractable position.
</P>
<P>
"Let us not read too much into these statements because, as you can
see, we have this track of confidence-building and dialogue, and
there is no definitiveness in these statements," Khan told a news
conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Singh's trip to Kashmir came as India began withdrawing some of its
troops from the region, a goodwill gesture to war-weary Kashmiris and
Pakistan ahead of planned talks between the nuclear armed rivals on
the problem due next month.
</P>
<P>
Kashmir is claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan, and
the countries have fought two wars between over the territory since
1947. The Indian- and Pakistan-controlled portions are separated by
the so-called Line of Control.
</P>
<P>
"Any solution based on the Line of Control will not be acceptable to
Pakistan," Khan said. "This is very clear. We are asking for a
solution that is acceptable to the people of Pakistan, India and the
Kashmiris."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India began a peace process early this year, and are due
to start formal talks on Kashmir next month.
</P>
<P>
In a shift in stance, Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf last
month suggested that some areas of Kashmir be made independent,
placed under joint Indian and Pakistani control, or put under United
Nations administration.
</P>
<P>
The proposals have been greeted with little enthusiasm by India,
although it has since announced its troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Khursheed Kasuri advised
India to avoid controversial statements, saying the relations between
the two nations were at a "very delicate stage and required careful
nurturing."
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that Jammu and Kashmir is a dispute which Pakistan and
India have to resolve through dialogue and negotiations," he was
quoted as saying by state-run news agency the Associated Press of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz is due to make his first trip
to India next week since taking office in August, and will hold talks
with Singh. Khan said the two prime ministers would discuss "all
issues."
