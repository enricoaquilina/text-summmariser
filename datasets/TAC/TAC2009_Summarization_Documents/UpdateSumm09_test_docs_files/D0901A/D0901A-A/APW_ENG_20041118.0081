Kashmiris divided by Pakistan-India conflict greet each other across
river

Crying, waving and throwing letters wrapped around stones to each
other, hundreds of Kashmiris gathered on either side of a river that
separates the disputed Himalayan region between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
The emotional reunion Wednesday across the Neelum River came on the
final day of the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr _ and as Indian Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh paid a rare visit to Indian-controlled
Kashmir, his country's only Muslim-majority state.
</P>
<P>
Families separated for decades by the Kashmir conflict shouted
greetings over the noise of the fast-flowing river. Despite easing
tensions between South Asia's nuclear rivals, Kashmiris are still
forbidden from crossing the watery border.

Nosheen Akhtar, 22, and her mother, Khonshad Begum, 40, burst into
tears, wailed and beat their chests _ unable to meet Begum's mother
on the Indian side.
</P>
<P>
"I want to jump into the river. My mother is there and I cannot go
over to meet with her," said Begum, her relatives holding her back.
</P>
<P>
Authorities on both sides were restricting access to the riverside at
Karin, 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of Muzaffarabad, the capital of
Pakistan-held Kashmir. Indian soldiers were preventing people from
getting too close, and on the Pakistan side, police said authorities
had not given formal permission for the reunions.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani and Indian portions of Kashmir are separated by a
heavily militarized cease-fire line where skirmishes were once common
between their forces. The guns have fallen silent for the past year
amid the thaw in relations, and since then there have been several
opportunities for family reunions _ albeit at a distance of 25 meters
(yards) across the river.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India both claim Kashmir in its entirety and have fought
two wars over it since their independence from British rule in 1947.
The conflict has only deepened since an Islamic insurgency began on
the Indian side in 1989. India accuses Pakistan of helping foment it,
which Pakistan denies. Some Kashmiris have fled from the Indian to
the Pakistan side, accused of involvement with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Singh, the Indian leader, expressed a commitment to
make peace with Pakistan, while Islamabad hailed India's withdrawal
of some of India's troops in Kashmir _ a move hoped to spur the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
But Kashmiris are impatient for progress that will allow them to
reunite with relatives across the cease-fire line, known as the Line
of Control.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are due to start formal talks on Kashmir next
month, and people on both sides are eager for a long-standing
proposal for a bus service between Muzaffarabad and Srinagar, the
summer capital of Indian-held Kashmir, to finally get off the ground.
</P>
<P>
"Both the countries have not been allowing us to meet," said Raja
Azhar Khan, a 55-year-old refugee, whose wife and son live on the
Indian side of the Neelum River.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries are getting friendly. They are allowing people to
meet each other at Wagha (the main land border between Indian and
Pakistan). Why are we Kashmiris not being allowed to meet?"
