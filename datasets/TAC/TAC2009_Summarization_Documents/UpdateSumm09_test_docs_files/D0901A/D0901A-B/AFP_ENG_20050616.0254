Moderate separatist 
leaders from Indian Kashmir returned home Thursday from a historic 
trip to Pakistan in upbeat mood, saying they were ready to hold a 
new round of talks with New Delhi on the future of the troubled 
Himalayan region.
</P>
<P>
The eight leaders, who have been on a two-week visit to 
Pakistan, arrived on the new bi-monthly trans-Kashmir bus service at 
Kaman Post, on the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border 
dividing mainly Muslim Kashmir between India and Pakistan, early 
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
They were to continue their journey to Srinagar, the summer 
capital of Indian-administered Kashmir, in a motorcade under tight 
security by India's security forces.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very successful trip for us," said Mirwaiz Umar 
Farooq, leader of the moderate faction of Kashmir's main separatist 
alliance, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference.
</P>
<P>
"We're ready for talks with New Delhi but it's for them to 
decide when they want to talk," Farooq told AFP shortly after 
crossing back into the Indian zone of the divided territory.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi had previously forbidden separatist leaders from 
travelling to Pakistan and refuses negotiate with them, despite a 
peace process launched by India and Pakistan in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian rivals have fought two of their three wars over 
Kashmir, which they each hold in part but claim in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
The moderates, who are demanding that Kashmiris be included in 
talks between India and Pakistan on resolving their decades-old 
dispute on Kashmir, held two meetings with India's government early 
in 2004 but the talks stalled when the Congress party won power in 
elections last May.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest benefit from the trip is that Kashmiris are being 
accepted as a party to the dispute," Farooq said.
</P>
<P>
Separatist leaders in Indian Kashmir seek a three-way dialogue 
with the Indian and Pakistan governments to sort out the region's 
future.
</P>
<P>
"Our triangular approach has been appreciated in Pakistan and in 
Pakistan-administered Kashmir," Farooq added.
</P>
<P>
During their visit, the Hurriyat leaders held talks with 
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, 
and a host of other leaders, including Syed Salahuddin, chief of a 
broad alliance of groups battling Indian rule in Muslim-majority 
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"We spoke to Syed Salahuddin about how to consolidate the 
ongoing peace process," Farooq said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf said Thursday during a 
trip to Australia that there was "light at the end of the tunnel" in 
the dispute but warned flexibility was needed on both sides to 
resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
The insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir has left more than 
40,000 people dead by official count. Separatists say the toll is 
twice as high.
