<P>
India and Pakistan Wednesday agreed 
to start a bus service in October linking two cities on either side 
of their only border crossing as part of an ongoing peace process, 
an official here said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after two days of talks in the Indian 
capital. It will be only the second bus service crossing India and 
Pakistan's international border.
</P>
<P>
"The trial run of the Lahore-Amritsar bus service being operated 
by both sides will take place in the second half of October 2005 
with a view to starting regular bus service in the first half of 
November 2005," Dilip Sinha, a joint secretary at the Indian foreign 
ministry, read from a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
In April, India and Pakistan agreed on the first bus service to 
link divided Kashmir in almost 60 years as part of a peace process 
begun in January 2004.
</P>
<P>
But the service, which crosses the ceasefire Line of Control 
separating the Indian and Pakistan zones of the Himalayan state, has 
been opposed by some separatist groups as well as by Islamic rebels 
fighting Indian rule in the disputed region.
</P>
<P>
The Lahore-Amritsar bus, covering 45 kilometres (28 miles), will 
link the two countries via the only international land crossing at 
Wagah in the state of Punjab, divided between India and Pakistan at 
partition in 1947.
</P>
<P>
A bus service linking New Delhi and Lahore, originally started 
in 1999 by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee but suspended 
after a 2001 attack on India's parliament by suspected 
Pakistan-backed militants, was restarted in July 2003.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also said Wednesday they would hold further talks 
on a proposed bus service between Amritsar and the Pakistani town of 
Nankana Sahib, the site of a Sikh shrine near Lahore.
</P>
<P>
The bus services are part of broader efforts by nuclear-armed 
neighbors India and Pakistan to normalise relations after coming to 
the brink of war after the parliament attack.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed in January last year to enhance economic, 
transport and cultural links while working to resolve a dispute over 
Kashmir, the cause of two of their three wars since indepndence.
