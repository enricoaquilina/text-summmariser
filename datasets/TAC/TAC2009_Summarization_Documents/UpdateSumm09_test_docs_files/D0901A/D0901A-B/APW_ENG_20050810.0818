India and Pakistan on Wednesday agreed to expedite the opening of bank branches
in each other's country and improve air and shipping services, a government
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Ministry officials from both countries met Tuesday and Wednesday to
devise a roadmap for economic cooperation and review progress made in easing
customs rules and non-tariff barriers since the trade talks were launched a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have lifted some trade barriers and allowed goods to be shipped
by road between them after a gap of nearly five decades. Officials would meet
soon to formulate recommendations to further ease non-tariff barriers and
enhance customs cooperation and trade, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Requests for opening of bank branches in both countries would be processed
expeditiously to facilitate bilateral trade relations," it said.
</P>
<P>
Indian and Pakistani banks had branches in each other's country until they
closed in 1965 when the rivals fought one of the three wars between them since
they gained independence from Britain in 1947.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that talks to review the existing air services agreement
and the shipping protocol would be held in September.
</P>
<P>
A fiber optic link to improve telecommunications between the neighboring
countries would be established soon, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Economic ties between India and Pakistan improved after peace talks began last
year. Trade between them totaled US$600 million in the year that ended in March
_ double the annual average for the past decade, said India's Commerce Ministry
spokeswoman, Shipra Biswas.
</P>
<P>
But that's still only about 0.5 percent of the value of trade the two nations
carry on with the rest of the world each year.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders say there is vast potential for expanding commercial ties
between India and Pakistan, which together have some 1.2 billion people. The
growth of cross-border trade, however, has been stunted by their five-decade
dispute over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which both nations
claim.
