Pakistan President Pervez 
Musharraf Monday said nobody will be allowed to disrupt the Indo-
Pak peace process, according to New Delhi TV (NDTV).
</P>
<P>
Musharraf, who met Indian editors over breakfast at New Delhi's
Taj Man Singh Hotel, said that India and Pakistan have approached 
all issues with sincerity.
</P>
<P>
Giving a call for creating a consensus on the Kashmir issue, 
Musharraf said the Kashmir issue should be resolved amicably. He 
said the Line of Control (LoC) and soft border cannot be accepted 
as the solution.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said he had come to India with a renewed mindset and 
had achieved more than he had expected. He added that the talks 
between the Indian and Pakistan officials were for harmony and 
goodwill.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf also said that an "out of the box" solution has to be
found with regard to Kashmir which is acceptable to India, 
Pakistan and the people of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The Kashmir "dispute" has to be resolved and it needs analysis,
and the two countries have to move forward on it, Musharraf said.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that the terrorist attack to derail the bus service 
between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad was not acceptable, Musharraf 
said a decision has been taken and the peace process cannot be 
allowed to be disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf asserted that unless the Kashmir "dispute" was 
resolved it can "erupt" in the future under "different leadership 
and different environment" in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we are having a very good relationship with Prime 
Minister Manmohan Singh. But nobody is permanent in this world," 
Musharraf said emphasizing that the issue has to be resolved.
