<P>
One hundred one years after the Wright brothers ushered in
the age of powered flight, Steve Fossett is ready to
tackle what may be the last great challenge in world
aviation. From Kansas, not Kitty Hawk.
</P>
<P>
Weather permitting, the 60-year-old millionaire will take off from the Salina,
Kan., municipal airport today and be back three days later,
by way of Montreal; London; Paris; Rome; Cairo, Egypt; Bahrain;
Karachi, Pakistan; Calcutta, India; Shanghai; Tokyo; Honolulu; and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
There will be no stops. No refueling. And not much sleep
for Fossett, who will be wedged in the 7 foot
cockpit of a veritable flying fuel tank as he attempts
the first solo flight around the world on one tank
of gas.
</P>
<P>
If he's successful, Fossett will earn a place in history alongside
aviator Wiley Post, who circled the globe alone in 1933
in a single-engine airplane, the Winnie Mae. Post made 11
stops and took just under eight8 days.
</P>
<P>
"Flying around the world has always been a great adventure," Fossett
says. "I hope to make it with no stops and
in under 80 hours."
</P>
<P>
It won't be his first around-the-world flight. In 2002, he became
the first person to solo the globe in a balloon
-- a 14-day odyssey, which began and ended in Australia.
It was his sixth attempt.
</P>
<P>
The solo aspect of the record is important to Fossett.
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-one people flew across the Atlantic before (Charles) LIndbergh did," he
says. "The hallmarks of aviation are that solo flights are
ranked higher than crew flights just because of the difficulty
and the level of self-reliance required."
</P>
<P>
He may be flying solo, but he will be supported by
more than 40 engineers, meteorologists and pilots at Salina "mission
control" who will advise him by radio as he circles
the globe. A network of amateur spotters will report "Fossett
sightings" as he travels. And a chase plane will rendezvous
with him several times during the three-day flight.
</P>
<P>
Fossett, who made his fortune as a trader on the Chicago
Board Options Exchange, is the most visible of three aviation
giants who have pooled their talents for the record attempt.
</P>
<P>
Virgin Atlantic Airways founder and chairman Richard Branson, himself an avid
balloonist, is funding the $2.5 million project, which he calls
"the last great aviation record inside the Earth's atmosphere and
the first great aviation achievement of this century."
</P>
<P>
Branson, whose $2.2 billion net worth makes him No. 247 on
Forbes' list of the world's richest people, isn't fretting about
the cost. Besides, he says the flight will demonstrate technology
that will help develop "a new generation of more fuel-efficient
commercial aircraft."
</P>
<P>
The airplane is decked out in the red-and-white livery of Branson's
airline, but the craft is the brainchild of aviation design
genius Burt Rutan, whose SpaceShipOne last year became the first
privately built craft to reach the edge of space. Rutan
won the $10 million Ansari X Prize for the advancement
of space tourism.
</P>
<P>
The Virgin Atlantic Global Flyer -- first sketched by Rutan on
the back of a napkin in 1999 -- is undoubtedly
one of the strangest-looking flying machines ever to take wing
over the Kansas heartland.
</P>
<P>
Built by Rutan's Scaled Composites of Mojave, Calif., it consists of
two 44-foot lightweight carbon fiber torpedoes joined at the hip.
A cigar-shaped cockpit is suspended between, with a single jet
engine -- a modified turbofan like those used in corporate
jets -- mounted above and behind the cockpit. Fossett has
to sit on padded cushions to see out of the
bubble-like canopy.
</P>
<P>
The design is so aerodynamically perfect that the plane has to
deploy two drogue parachutes to help it descend for a
landing. With a 114-foot wing span that makes it 2
1/2 times wider than it is long, however, the contraption
looks like it might have trouble just getting off the
ground.
</P>
<P>
Taking off may, in fact, be one of the toughest challenges.
Fully loaded, the plane carries 3,000 gallons of jet fuel,
six times its own weight. Commercial airliners carry less than
half their weight in fuel.
</P>
<P>
At takeoff, because so much fuel is stored in the plane's
hollow wings, they will droop to within 3 feet of
the runway -- meaning any sudden gust of wind could
become an adventure-ending disaster.
</P>
<P>
"It's an experimental aircraft with such lightweight construction there's a risk
of structural failure," Fossett says. "The first time it flies
with a full load of fuel will be when I
take off on the mission. If I miscalculate, I will
run right into the cornfields."
</P>
<P>
The dicey aspects of the takeoff are one reason Fossett chose
the Salina airport. Its 12,300-foot runway and a 1,300-foot overrun
-- built when it was Schilling Air Force Base --
provide plenty of room for the Global Flyer to get
up to takeoff speed.
</P>
<P>
Once he is airborne, Fossett intends to climb to around 50,000
feet, well above the altitude flown by commercial traffic. The
plane will be so heavy early in the flights that
he'll have to avoid the turbulence of the jet stream.
</P>
<P>
As the plane's fuel load lightens, however, the jet stream will
play a major role in whether Fossett will make it
home. As he crosses Europe, the Middle East, Asia and
the Pacific Ocean, he hopes to use the tailwind to
add an average of 70 miles to his ground speed
and increase his range.
</P>
<P>
The Global Flyer carries only enough fuel to cover 20,000 miles
in still air -- a good 3,000 miles short of
the 36,787.559-kilometer minimum distance required for the arbiter of world
aviation records, the Paris-based Federation Aeronautique Internationale, to recognize the
feat.
</P>
<P>
But Fossett has another reason for using a midcontinent location for
his takeoff and return. In the final hours, he'll be
running close to empty.
</P>
<P>
"If I run out of fuel in the last thousand miles,
I will be able to glide to a safe landing
at almost any airport in the western United States," he
says. "If I had chosen a West Coast airport, I
would risk ditching in the Pacific."
</P>
<P>
So critical is the jet stream to Fossett's ambitions -- both
as an early obstacle and a late-in-the-game friend -- that
the flight has already been delayed more than two weeks
in hopes of a more favorable alignment.
</P>
<P>
Although the plane has been ready to fly since Feb. 2,
the weather has prompted several delays. A meteorological "go" requires
the proper speed and course of winds aloft, the right
local weather (cold and calm) for the absence of any
major storms along Fossett's planned route.
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the behavior of the jet stream over the last
five5 or 10 years, things only line up the way
we need them about 50 percent of the time," says
David Dehenauw, a Belgian meteorologist doing long-range forecasting for the
flight.
</P>
<P>
The Global Flyer won't be the first airplane to circle the
world without refueling. Voyager, an earlier Rutan creation that now
hangs in the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum, did that
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
But Voyager had two pilots, Burt Rutan's older brother Richard Rutan
and pilot Jeana Yeager. It also had two engines and
a speed that averaged a little over 100 miles an
hour. Because it couldn't fly high enough to make use
of the jet stream, the flight took nine days --
and nearly failed when it had to be rerouted due
to Libya's refusal to let the plane enter its airspace.
</P>
<P>
Unlike his marathon balloon flights, which have allowed time for napping,
Fossett -- cruising at nearly 300 miles an hour --
will have to stay awake for most, if not all,
of the 80 hours he is airborne.
</P>
<P>
But as a precaution, the plane also carries a control system
that would maintain the course in the event Fossett nods
off.
</P>
<P>
Fossett hasn't said publicly what he'll do if he doesn't make
it, but his earlier balloon flights have made it clear
that he doesn't quit easily.
</P>
<P>
His successful around-the-world flight in 2002 was his sixth attempt in
eight years -- including one flight that ended in a
near disaster when a thunderstorm shredded his balloon and he
had to ditch off the coast of Australia. He was
picked up by a passing yacht -- and promptly began
making preparations for his next attempt.
