American adventurer Steve 
Fossett flew over the Middle East on Tuesday after overcoming a 
navigation equipment problem that threatened to derail his historic 
bid to make the first non-stop flight around the world without 
refueling.
</P>
<P>
Fossett, who took off from here in the Virgin Atlantic 
GlobalFlyer on Monday for a flight expected to last between 60 and 
80 hours, said he hae navigation aid.
</P>
<P>
"This was my sole source of navigation so this was very 
serious," he said, adding that the GPS had not functioned for about 
half of his flight over Canada. "I believe it was an antenna 
problem," Fossett said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that other problems could arise and there was still 
a long way to go. "There may be new things that come up so there's 
no real basis for confidence," he said, "but I'm happy with the 
situation."
</P>
<P>
At Mission Control, flight controllers were carefully monitoring 
fuel consumption.
</P>
<P>
"One of the critical factors we are monitoring is the amount of 
fuel he has left," said project manager Paul Moore. "He's eaten 
quite substantially into his fuel (so far)  but that's as we 
expected."
</P>
<P>
Moore said the GPS problem had been potentially fatal to the 
flight. "This could have been a showstopper," he said. "This was 
really a big worry as we are unable to fly without GPS especially 
when were out of radio range.
</P>
<P>
"Steve was essentially flying blind," Moore said. "Happily, 
after a couple of hours of malfunction the GPS system did 
reengage."
</P>
<P>
Moore said cabin pressure was good and the temperature in the 
cramped cockpit was 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius). "His 
feet are a bit chilly," said Moore.
</P>
<P>
The three-day journey will test the endurance and piloting 
abilities of Fossett, a 60-year-old millionaire who has set dozens 
of world records and world firsts with jet airplanes and gliders, 
hot air balloons and sailing.
</P>
<P>
At takeoff, the 3,350-pound (1,522-kilogram) single engine 
aircraft was carrying nearly 19,000 pounds (8,636 kilograms) of fuel 
in 13 tanks for the 23,000-mile (37,260-kilometer) journey at 
altitudes as high as 52,000 feet (15,850 meters).
</P>
<P>
Virgin Atlantic Airways of Sir Richard Branson is funding the 
GlobalFlyer and the British entrepreneur is in Salina monitoring the 
flight.
</P>
<P>
The GlobalFlyer was designed by aviation legend Burt Rutan, who 
recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million 
dollar "X Prize" for sending a privately-designed craft into space 
twice in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother 
Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a record of nine days 
for a non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world.
</P>
<P>
Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 
hours, and by doing it on his own.
