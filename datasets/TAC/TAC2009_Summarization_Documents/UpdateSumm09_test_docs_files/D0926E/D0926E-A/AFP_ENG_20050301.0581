American adventurer Steve 
Fossett likes to joke that his attempt to fly around the world 
without stopping or refueling has no "practical" purpose.
</P>
<P>
But the research that went into developing the super-light and 
aerodynamic aircraft could one day lead to more fuel-efficient and 
environmentally friendly commercial planes, said Sir Richard 
Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, which is funding the project.
</P>
<P>
"As an airline, we hope that Virgin Atlantic airplanes will (one 
day) be made of composite materials and that metal will be thrown 
away," Branson said at a press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
The single engine turbofan aircraft designed by Burt Rutans 
Scale Composites is constructed with lightweight, composite 
materials in order to maximize fuel efficiency. It is so 
aerodynamically perfect that it needs drag parachutes to land.
</P>
<P>
While he admits that his taste for adventure and publicity also 
drove his interest in the GlobalFlyer, Branson said he also hopes 
that the project will spur further interest in aviation and 
adventure.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of benefits to mankind come from projects like this," 
Branson said. "Kids around the world can log in and participate in a 
great adventure and perhaps aspire to something like it in the 
future."
</P>
<P>
The aircraft will also allow the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration to test a new state-of-the-art communications system 
that will one day be used on spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
NASA said that the equipment has the potential to "reduce the 
cost and infrastructure of the current ground-based communications 
systems" by using satellites to relay tracking and flight data.
</P>
<P>
The GlobalFlyer is also being used as a platform for research 
into cosmic radiation.
</P>
<P>
The experimental aircraft took off from Salina Municipal Airport 
here on Monday for a flight around the world that is expected to 
last between 60 and 80 hours. Fossett crossed the Atlantic and was 
over Africa on Tuesday.
