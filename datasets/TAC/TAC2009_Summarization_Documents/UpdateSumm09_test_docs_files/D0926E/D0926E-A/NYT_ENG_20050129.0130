Kansas town basks in glow og GlobalFlyer
</P>

The Kansas City Star SALINA, Kan. -- Anytime Jeff Palmer hears
a plane overhead, he peers out the front window of
Mr. G's Market.
</P>
<P>
"I look to see if it's the GlobalFlyer," says Palmer, who
from behind the store counter demonstrates how he bends down
and tilts his head toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
For more than two weeks the store cashier has been peering
out this window, hoping to get a glimpse of the
cutting-edge plane designed to break yet another aviation record for
millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett.
</P>
<P>
Having already shattered records in a hot-air balloon and a glider,
Fossett hopes to soon become the first to make a
solo, nonstop flight around the world without refueling.
</P>
<P>
As early as next Sunday, the first window of opportunity, Palmer
should get a pretty good look at the plane as
Fossett and the Virgin Atlantic team attempt the feat from
the Salina airport, less than a mile from Mr. G's.
</P>
<P>
The team was attracted to the central Kansas town and its
airport for the extra-long runway and newly renovated hangar 703.
</P>
<P>
It's inside hangar 703 where the GlobalFlyer, with its 114-feet wing
span and 13 gas tanks, has been housed and worked
on since it arrived from Mojave, Calif., on Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
While the team waits for good weather around the world, constantly
measuring barometric pressures and monitoring jet streams, residents are preparing
for what they say is their town's best bet to
get into the history books.
</P>
<P>
Employees at the Holiday Inn are ready to roll out their
red carpet -- literally -- for the hordes of international
and national reporters and television crews. The hotel bar is
concocting a special GlobalFlyer drink, with ingredients not yet revealed.
</P>
<P>
"It'll be like the flight," says smiling Holiday Inn sales manager
Gala Bloyd, referring to how the details of the mission
are kept under wraps until closer to the departure. "We'll
announce that (the ingredients) when they take off."
</P>
<P>
The welcome parties are planned for people like Virgin Atlantic's chairman,
Sir Richard Branson, and town leaders have scheduled tours to
introduce Salina to an international audience. Hundreds of volunteers are
lined up to make sure guests are treated right.
</P>
<P>
"This gives us the opportunity to introduce our visitors here to
what this community is all about," says Gerald Cook, president
of the Salina Area Chamber of Commerce, who has already
fielded questions from reporters in New York, London and Italy.
"It's a show and tell, if you will."
</P>
<P>
But before all that, and before Fossett hits the sky for
what could be up to an 80-hour flight, some preparations
remain. For Fossett, the crews from Virgin Atlantic and Scaled
Composites (which designed and built the plane) and the Kansas
State University Airway Science students who've become an integral part
of the mission, there's a lot of unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
When officials with Virgin Atlantic came to look at the Salina
airport facilities and runway, which measures 12,300 feet long, they
visited Salina's K-State campus. The location's main focus is its
College of Technology and Aviation.
</P>
<P>
By that time Salina officials knew there was a good probability
the town would be the location for the launch and
the landing. But they had no idea where the flight
would be controlled from, or in more technical terms, where
Mission Control would be.
</P>
<P>
"It could have been in London, Hong Kong, anywhere," says Tim
Rogers, executive director of the Salina Airport Authority. But "when
they saw the campus facility, immediately the light came on
for Virgin Atlantic staffers, 'This is ideal for Mission Control.'
"
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the announcement was made that the entire mission would
take place in Salina, school officials got in touch with
several Airway Science students -- aspiring professional pilots and airplane
mechanics. From there, 12 students were hand-picked to help on
the mission.
</P>
<P>
They thought they would run a few errands, do minor research
and, if they were lucky, pick up valuable knowledge from
seasoned aviation professionals.
</P>
<P>
Monica Chester, a senior from Phillipsburg in the professional pilot program,
laughs now as she and three other students describe how
they are instead helping map the mission's flight plan by
researching weather patterns and jet streams.
</P>
<P>
And the eight aviation mechanics students are helping improve and repair
the plane to ensure a successful mission.
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely not a stand-back-and-see-how-it's-done kind of job," Chester says. "It's
step up and get it done."
</P>
<P>
Under the supervision of Philip Grassa, the crew chief from Scaled
Composites, the aviation mechanics students work nearly every day on
the plane. After a test flight, the students helped repair
a valve that was causing trouble with cabin pressure.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week the students installed the flight tires on the
plane. The tires were new, but the tread was shaved
down to save on weight.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't think they'd get to work on the airplane as
an actual mechanic," says Grassa, who has worked on GlobalFlyer
for two years. "They thought they'd be running errands for
me."
</P>
<P>
Grassa hollers, "How we doing over there?" to a small group
working on a shield to go over the flight controls
in the back of the cabin.
</P>
<P>
After offering a suggestion of where to put glue, Grassa was
back to talking about the students and how they have
been integral in helping get GlobalFlyer ready.
</P>
<P>
"This is basically my adopted crew for the preparation for this
mission," Grassa says.
</P>
<P>
Some of the students get wide eyes as they talk about
working with Scaled Composites employees and with Fossett -- whom
senior Seth Short from Burrton describes as "your grandpa in
real good physical shape. He's as nice as can be."
</P>
<P>
As Chester puts it: "We hoped we'd get to meet him,
but now we're on a first-name basis with him."
</P>
<P>
For the students in the professional pilot program, their work is
in front of the computer calculating fluctuations in the weather.
They balance the benefits of flying at high altitudes where
the jet engine is more efficient versus lower where a
plane gets the best winds.
</P>
<P>
Short explains how the weather needs to be just right.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for cold weather, high barometric pressure and favorable jet
stream," says Short. "He can't take off in any precipitation
that would freeze."
</P>
<P>
Another pilot student, Nancy Milleret of Tonganoxie, jumps in to interpret.
</P>
<P>
"You don't want ice on the plane," says the junior who
is used to breaking down aviation talk to the students
she guides in the air. "Ice is bad."
</P>
<P>
That's because the plane is not equipped with de-icing gear. That
would add weight to the plane. And for a trip
around the world without refueling, extra weight is also bad.
</P>
<P>
Student Pat Rinearson of Olathe explains why the plane needs the
favorable jet stream.
</P>
<P>
"He wants the tail winds," Rinearson says. "The jet stream moves
every minute. What we're trying to do is figure out
where it is and average what the tail wind component
will be through the flight."
</P>
<P>
The plane will travel east to west. It doesn't have enough
gas to make the 20,000-nautical-mile trip without the benefit of
tail winds. As Milleret explains: "West to east, he wouldn't
make it. He'd be going against the wind."
</P>
<P>
Whatever the students come up with in their research and calculations,
they often show to Fossett.
</P>
<P>
"What we put into the computer, Steve looks at that," Short
says. "When we come up with a flight plan, we
show it to Steve and he says, 'Explain it to
me.' "
</P>
<P>
As the students work, the town and nearby residents wait.
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 question airport director Rogers gets: "Can we see
the airplane?"
</P>
<P>
Looks like Palmer isn't the only one disappointed that there has
been no general public viewing of the plane.
</P>
<P>
"It's the question everyone has," says Rogers, who has watched the
airport's Web site go from 500 hits a day to
20,000 because of interest in GlobalFlyer.
</P>
<P>
Rogers says that "time is the most critical part of the
process" and taking time out to show the airplane would
hurt the preparation phase.
</P>
<P>
"Once I've had the opportunity to explain that, individuals seem to
understand," Rogers says.
</P>
<P>
On the day of departure and landing, the airport can accommodate
as many as 30,000 spectators. Two areas have been set
up, one on the north side and one at the
south, for people to watch.
</P>
<P>
Some still think the residents deserve a special viewing.
</P>
<P>
"You'd think they should just fly over the town someday," says
Dustin Forsberg, 23, as he sat outside Cozy Inn Hamburgers
with his brother Derek and a friend. "Just as a
'Thanks for letting us be here.' "
</P>
<P>
Others say that while having the flight take off and land
in Salina is exciting, it's what the mission does for
the town that beats all.
</P>
<P>
Cook, the chamber president, estimates the town has already benefited from
"millions of dollars" in advertising -- and the plane still
sits in hangar 703.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to put Salina on the map," says aviation student
Samuel Butler, originally from Cleveland, as he stands outside the
town's municipal airport. "That's what I like about it. ...
It's history."
