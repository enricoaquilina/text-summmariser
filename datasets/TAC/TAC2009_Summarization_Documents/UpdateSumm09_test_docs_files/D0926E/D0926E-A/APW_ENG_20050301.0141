Fossett takes off on attempt at first nonstop, solo flight around the world

<P>
Millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett has taken off on his attempt to become the
first person to complete a solo trip around the world in an airplane without
making a single stop.
</P>
<P>
Fossett, the first person to circle the globe solo in a balloon, launched his
GlobalFlyer from the Salina Municipal Airport shortly before 7 p.m. Monday,
beginning a 66-hour journey by climbing northeast into a darkening
sky.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of spectators, braving a bitterly cold wind, gathered along the
two-mile (three-kilometer) runway to watch the takeoff. Fossett hoped to return
to Salina on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The 23,000-mile (37,000-kilometer) flight had already been postponed several
times because of shifting jet stream patterns or weather at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a bit nervous about takeoff," said Fossett, 60, who has logged about 30
hours in the jet-powered aircraft. "I will be the ultimate test pilot. I have a
lot to worry about. It's a major endeavor."
</P>
<P>
Financed by Virgin Atlantic founder Sir Richard Branson, it would be the first
solo flight around the world without stopping to refuel.
</P>
<P>
Branson watched the takeoff from the side of the runway with Fossett's wife. "It
was obviously an emotional moment and the most dangerous part of the journey,"
he said. "It was an enormous relief when it actually came off the
ground."
</P>
<P>
By late Monday night, Fossett was soaring over Canada.
</P>
<P>
"He was pretty determined to get away," project manager Paul Moore said at a
briefing hours after the takeoff.
</P>
<P>
Aviation pioneer Wiley Post made the first solo around-the-world trip in 1933,
taking more than seven days and stopping numerous times along the way. The first
nonstop global flight without refueling by a duo was made in 1986 by Jeana
Yeager and Dick Rutan, brother of Burt Rutan, designer of the
GlobalFlyer.
</P>
<P>
Besides the nonstop record, Fossett will attempt to break seven other aviation
records, including the longest flight by a jet aircraft. The current record is
more than 12,000 miles (19,300 kilometers), set by a B-52 bomber in
1962.
</P>
<P>
Mission control director Kevin Stass said Fossett would fly over Chicago,
Detroit and Canada before heading across the Atlantic late Monday night. The
route would then take him over Africa, the Middle East, India, China and the
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The flight plan was adjusted once more later Monday after Algeria closed a
portion of its airspace, mission control director Kevin Stass said. The change,
he said, would slightly reduce the overall length of the flight and save some of
the 18,000 pounds ( 8,100 kilograms) of fuel aboard the single-engine
jet.
</P>
<P>
Fossett planned to fly at an average speed of 287.5 mph (462.6 kph) and rely on
the jet stream to stretch his fuel. The GlobalFlyer will have about 15 percent
extra fuel to allow for weather conditions or other changes to the flight plan,
said Jon Karkow, chief engineer for the flight.
</P>
<P>
There was a risk the fuel could freeze from flying in the cold at altitudes of
52,000 feet (15,600 meters) for such a long time.
</P>
<P>
Fossett will survive on diet milkshakes. "I just picked a bunch of flavors off
the shelf at the store," he said.
</P>
<P>
Branson planned to follow Fossett in a chase plane for the first day of the
flight and on the last leg. He gave Fossett his wristwatch, complete with
emergency beacon device, to wear for the flight.
</P>
<P>
"We want you and (the watch) back in one piece at the end," Branson
quipped.
</P>
<P>
Fossett became the first to fly a balloon solo around the world in 2002 after
nearly dying twice in six attempts to set the record. He has also tried to break
the world gliding altitude record for the past four years in New Zealand but has
failed because of poor conditions.
