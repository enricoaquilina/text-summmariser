American adventurer Steve 
Fossett has decided to continue his historic bid for the first solo 
non-refueled flight around the world despite loss of fuel, project 
managers announced here late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go for it," Fossett told Mission Control via satellite 
radio as his plane cruised north of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Project manager Paul Moore told reporters that the goal of the 
first solo non-stop, non-refueled circumnavigation of the globe was 
"within Steve's grasp," despite the fact that the plane had leaked 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
The mission was called into question earlier Wednesday, when it 
was discovered the plane had 2,600 pounds (1,181 kilograms) less 
fuel than expected. 
</P>
<P>
While the cause of the loss has not been determined, organizers 
said it was possible that the fuel evaporated or escaped. More fuel 
than expected may have been used during takeoff.
</P>
<P>
The plane had never before been flown with full tanks and some 
fuel may have spilled out through a venting system used to maintain 
adequate pressure in the tanks, organizers said. A leak is unlikely 
as the fuel loss ceased after the first few hours of flight.
</P>
<P>
Organizers are hopeful that Fossett will be able to make it back 
to Salina on Thursday if tailwinds remain strong.
