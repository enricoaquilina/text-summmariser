American adventurer Steve 
Fossett was remarkably alert and chipper as he soared over India 
Wednesday, on the second sleepless day of his attempt to make the 
first solo, non-stop flight around the world without refueling, 
organizers said.
</P>
<P>
"Unless he's talking in his sleep he's pretty cogent," joked 
project manager Paul Moore, who added that the record-breaking 
millionaire has gotten through numerous similar challenges due to 
"his level-headedness, stamina and self-reliance."
</P>
<P>
At 05:30 GMT, Fossett was at 46,750 feet (14,250 meters) after 
being aloft for nearly 29 hours. The Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer was 
over northwestern India heading towards Calcutta at speeds of around 
300 knots (345 miles per hour/555 kilometers per hour).
</P>
<P>
Should everything continue to go as planned, Fossett is expected 
to return to Salina on Thursday morning after spending between 60 
and 80 hours in the air.
</P>
<P>
While Fossett is relying on an autopilot throughout the journey, 
he cannot safely ignore the complex demands of the experimental 
aircraft for much more than ten or twenty minutes at a time, 
organizers said. As a result, he can only take power naps for the 
rest of the three-day journey.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, in a series of radio hook-ups with reporters at 
Mission Control here, Fossett said he had a "good chance" of 
completing the record-breaking flight.
</P>
<P>
"I have picked up a 100 mile per hour (160 kilometers) jet 
stream just behind me and I am covering territory fast, which is 
very encouraging," he said. "It's interesting to watch things go by 
and I am looking forward to another good day tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
The most serious problem was a temporary failure of the Global 
Positioning System, Fossett's satellite navigation aid.
</P>
<P>
"This was my sole source of navigation, so this was very 
serious," he said, adding that the GPS had not functioned for about 
half of his flight over Canada. "I believe it was an antenna 
problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that other problems could arise and that there was 
still a long way to go. "There may be new things that come up so 
there's no real basis for confidence," he said, "but I'm happy with 
the situation."
</P>
<P>
Moore said cabin pressure remained good even after Fossett 
climbed to 49,500 feet (15,090 meters) and the temperature in the 
cramped cockpit was 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius). "His 
feet are a bit chilly," said Moore.
</P>
<P>
Fossett nonetheless reported being "comfortable enough" in the 
7.7 foot (2.3 meter) long cockpit.
</P>
<P>
"I have got elbow room, I can get to everything, I'm not 
complaining," he said. "It is a long trip - especially the nights. I 
feel a little bit tired, but I have been through this before and I 
am going to be okay."
</P>
<P>
The three-day journey will test the endurance and piloting 
abilities of Fossett, a 60-year-old millionaire who has set dozens 
of world records with jet airplanes and gliders, hot air balloons 
and sailing.
</P>
<P>
British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson - who has set a number 
of aviation and sailing records of his own - is funding the project 
through his company Virgin Atlantic Airways.
</P>
<P>
Interest in the record-setting attempt has drawn journalists 
from all over the world to Salinas, and the mission's website, 
virginatlanticglobalflyer.com, has drawn more than eight million 
hits the past 24 hours.  
</P>
<P>
The GlobalFlyer was designed by aviation legend Burt Rutan, who 
recently made headlines when his SpaceShipOne won the 10 million 
dollar "X Prize" for sending a privately-designed craft into space 
twice in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Rutan also designed the Voyager, which was used by his brother 
Dick Rutan and Jeanne Yeager in 1986 to set a nine-day record for a 
non-stop, non-refueled flight around the world.
</P>
<P>
Fossett hopes to beat that record by making it in less than 80 
hours, and by doing it on his own.
</P>
<P>
At takeoff, the 3,350-pound (1,522-kilogram) single engine 
aircraft was carrying nearly 19,000 pounds (8,636 kilograms) of fuel 
in 13 tanks for the 23,000-mile (37,260-kilometer) journey at 
altitudes as high as 52,000 feet (15,850 meters). By 04:00 GMT there 
was just 9,600 pounds (43,540 kilograms) of fuel remaining.
