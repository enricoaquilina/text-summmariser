Aviator Completes Historic Flight

Madcap aviator Steve Fossett glided his GlobalFlyer
to a picture perfect landing here Thursday 67 hours after taking off,
becoming the first pilot to circle the globe nonstop, alone and
without refueling.
</P>
<P>
Fossett stayed awake by drinking a dozen chocolate protein
milkshakes as he broke what his supporters consider the last great
aviation feat. His mission of some 23,000 miles set several world
records, registering as the fastest nonstop flight around the world.
</P>
<P>
``That's something I've wanted to do for some time,'' Fossett, 60,
said, shortly after squeezing out of the tiny cockpit before a raucous
crowd of about 5,000. ``I've achieved my ambition.''
</P>
<P>
After landing, Fossett exchanged high-fives with British
billionaire Richard Branson, a long-time friend who financed the
project and commissioned legendary aircraft designer Burt Rutan to
build the catamaran-shaped plane. It was powered by a single jet
engine.
</P>
<P>
``Can you walk?'' Branson asked Fossett before spraying him with
champagne.
</P>
<P>
The flight marked the second major privately funded aerospace event
since the fall with a Rutan design. In October Rutan's SpaceShipOne
rocket soared into the edge of space on a suborbital flight and back
with a single pilot, claiming a $10-million prize.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Fossett's round-the-world solo flight was done for the
technological and human endurance challenge, with no prize money
involved.
</P>
<P>
In recent decades most aviation records have been set by commercial
aircraft or government-funded space missions. Aviation enthusiasts
applauded Fossett's exploit as a reminder of the early days of flight
when adventurous pilots frequently broke records, became instant
celebrities and drew front-page newspaper headlines and massive
crowds.
</P>
<P>
In Fossett's case, much of the town of Salina showed up at the
airport to welcome him, including a high school marching band and
several people holding up signs: ``Go Go GlobalFlyer!''
</P>
<P>
``It's the biggest thing that ever happened in our lives,'' said
Amber Windholz, a 17-year-old baton twirler for the band.
</P>
<P>
The first plane to circumnavigate the globe nonstop and without
refueling was another designed by Rutan, the Voyager in 1986. But that
aircraft was powered by two propeller engines and flown by two pilots
taking turns. And it took nine days to fly around the world.
</P>
<P>
Fossett began his journey Monday at 6:47 p.m. CST when the Star
Trek-lookalike craft, with a 114-foot wingspan took off from the
Salina Municipal Airport with 18,000 pounds of fuel -- or about 82
percent of the aircraft's weight.
</P>
<P>
Salina was chosen mainly because its runway is one of the longest
in the Midwest, and because it allowed Fossett to spend the last
segment of his mission over land.
</P>
<P>
To break the world record,Fossett had to fly the craft more than
22,858 miles, or the same circumference as the Tropic of Cancer, and
pass a dozen waypoints.
</P>
<P>
During the flight, Fossett kept to drinking protein milkshakes,
which minimized bowel movements while providing nutrition. He also
took half a dozen catnaps of about one to three minutes.
</P>
<P>
A millionaire and former options trader in Chicago, Fossett has
broken 60 aviation records, competed in triathlons and the 1,100 mile
Iditarod sled dog race in Alaska. In 2002 he became the first pilot to
make a solo, nonstop hot air balloon around the world in 13 days and 8
hours .
</P>
<P>
Beside the fastest and the longest records Fossett has broken, the
Tennessee native also set the world record for the slowest swim across
the English Channel, completing the 21-mile ocean swim in 22 hours.
</P>
<P>
``Steve is a different animal than most of us,'' Rutan said.
</P>
<P>
At 1:48 p.m. CST, Fossett landed the GlobalFlyer on the same runway
where he took off 67 hours, 2 minutes and 38 seconds earlier. The gas
tank caps and the cockpit door still had the same adhesive tape that
been applied before the flight as a way a way to verify there were no
surreptitious refueling stops.
</P>
<P>
The trip wasn't without tense moments. Problems with some equipment
jeopardized the mission at the onset and toward the end.
</P>
<P>
In the early part of the flight, Fossett had to rely on directions
from mission control because of problems with the aircraft's global
positioning system, which provides near precise geographic location of
the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Then toward the end, as he flew past Japan and began the trek
across the Pacific, gauges showed that the airplane was low on fuel.
Fossett decided to continue after the airplane picked up strong
tailwinds of up to 160 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
``We got beautiful tailwinds over the Pacific,'' said Rutan. ``If
we didn't have the tailwinds, we would not have made it.''
</P>
<P>
Fossett looked surprisingly refreshed after he landed. But one of
his first wishes, he said, was to be able to ``sleep for a full day.''
