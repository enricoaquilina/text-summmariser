A GLOBAL AVIATION RECORD IS SET AS 'FLYING FUEL TANK' RETURNS TO KANSAS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An audacious solo flight around the world -- the first without
stops or refueling -- ended Thursday afternoon where it began
as the GlobalFlyer touched down safely, its 13 fuel tanks
nearly empty.
</P>
<P>
The plane, piloted by Steve Fossett, a 60-year-old investment executive and
avid sailor, glider pilot and balloonist, covered about 23,000 miles
on a zigzag course across the Atlantic, Africa, Asia and
the Pacific to ride the tailwinds, which sometimes blew at
150 mph. It touched down shortly before 2 p.m. local
time on Thursday at a former Air Force base in
Salina, Kan., 67 hours after it took off.
</P>
<P>
The voyage, apparently the longest solo airplane flight in distance and
time, was also a test of human endurance. Fossett, who
emerged from his cramped cockpit through a small access hatch
to the cheers of spectators and his ground crew, said
he did not sleep at all for the first 24
hours, had only a few catnaps for the rest of
the trip, and subsisted on a dozen diet milkshakes.
</P>
<P>
Fossett, who became the first to fly around the world solo
in a balloon on his sixth attempt in 2002, said
on the runway in Salina that this solo flight was
"a major ambition."
</P>
<P>
Richard Branson, the flamboyant Virgin Atlantic airline magnate who bankrolled the
project for an undisclosed sum, waved a giant checkered flag,
and later doused Fossett in champagne.
</P>
<P>
Before the trip Fossett called the mission "highly interesting from a
technical standpoint." On landing, he said, "I had the good
fortune of getting the right people associated with it."
</P>
<P>
The plane consisted of a tiny fuselage flanked by twin booms
to hold the fuel, each with its own tail. A
gliderlike wing, as long as the wing on a Boeing
737, but lacking the flaps and slats that help pilots
control most long-distance planes, connected the cabin and the booms.
The jet engine was attached to the top.
</P>
<P>
The flight was a test of how fuel-efficient a plane could
be and how much fuel it could carry. The 18,100
pounds of fuel on takeoff Monday evening made up 82
percent of the plane's weight.
</P>
<P>
The builders nicknamed the plane the "flying fuel tank." One consideration
in carrying so much fuel was that on landing, the
plane was radically different from the one that took off.
The GlobalFlyer departed to the east weighing as much as
a 19-seat commuter plane, and approached from the west weighing
less than a medium-sized sport utility vehicle, a difference that
posed substantial challenges because of changes in its handling characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Fossett said early in the flight that it handled well, but
with only one pilot aboard, much of the flying was
done by autopilot. He made the trip in a cigar-shaped
cabin in a seat that resembled a recliner. He could
not stand up.
</P>
<P>
The GlobalFlyer was designed by Burt Rutan and built by Rutan's
company, Scaled Composites, of Mojave, Calif.
