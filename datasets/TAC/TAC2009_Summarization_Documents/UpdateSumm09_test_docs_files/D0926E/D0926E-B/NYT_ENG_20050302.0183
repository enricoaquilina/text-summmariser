FUEL SHORTAGE THREATENS FLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SALINA, Kan. 
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett's solo flight around the world
flight encountered its first major hurdle Wednesday with the discovery
of a serious fuel shortage aboard his Global Flyer that
threatened to cut short the journey.
</P>
<P>
As Fossett was flying over mainland China, mission control officials in
Salina, Kan. reported their conclusion that he had a fuel
shortage -- 2,600 pounds, or 450 gallons -- less than
they had counted on.
</P>
<P>
The shortage was blamed on a discrepancy between gauges monitoring the
rate of fuel consumption and fuel tank sensors measuring the
remaining fuel. "This is a huge setback to think we
might not have enough fuel for the remainder of the
flight," Fossett said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the bad news, Fossett decided to press on to Hawaii
and re-evaluate his fuel supply when he reached the islands,
sometime around 10 p.m. EST Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If he continues, he expected to land at Salina Municipal Airport
around midday today.
</P>
<P>
"The whole mission is jeopardized, but we will just have to
take it one step at a time," Fossett said.
</P>
<P>
Fossett, who left Monday night on the solo flight, was taking
catnaps Wednesday to stay alert.
</P>
<P>
He planned to pump fuel from the airplane's dozen or so
wing tanks to two central fuel booms to get a
final, accurate measurement of exactly how much fuel remained.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a very high level of confidence at this
point," he conceded. "The fuel that remains in the wings
still has to be transferred to the main tanks, and
if there is some kind of blockage, that could boil
the whole clam."
</P>
<P>
He and mission control officials said they would decide Wednesday night
whether to press on to the west coast of the
United States, seven hours of flying time away, to return
to Fossett's starting point in Salina.
</P>
<P>
"Steve and all of us in mission control are fairly optimistic,
but there is still a long, long way to go,"
said mission director Paul Moore.
</P>
<P>
As Fossett started across the Pacific, his single-engine jet was burning
approximately 30 gallons of jet fuel an hour, with enough
fuel estimated on board for another 25 hours or so
of flying.
</P>
<P>
With the aid of a 110-mile-per-hour tail wind and a ground
speed of nearly 400 miles per hour, that would be
more than enough to get him all the way to
Kansas. But flight officials said they expected the tail winds
to subside east of Hawaii, and that could make the
difference.
</P>
<P>
Once the fuel is exhausted, the Global Flyer would be light
enough to allow Fossett to glide the last 200 miles
of his journey.
</P>
<P>
"Right now he has insufficient fuel to make it home without
a tail wind," Moore reported. "Steve is quite literally at
the mercy of the winds."
</P>
<P>
Fully loaded at takeoff, his single-engine jet carried 18,100 pounds of
fuel, so the missing fuel amounted to nearly 15 percent
of the plane's total. Because the Global Flyer's full load
of fuel included about a 15 percent margin, mission control
officials said the chances of completing his flight were too
close to call.
</P>
<P>
Mission control officials said the first indication of a fuel problem
came within hours of takeoff. "We saw it early in
the flight, but we really didn't want to admit that
the discrepancy was real," engineering director Jon Karkow acknowledged Wednesday.
"It now looks like that within the first three and
a half hours of flights, 2,600 pounds of fuel simply
disappeared."
</P>
<P>
Mission engineers still aren't sure what happened, but they said fuel
apparently vented unexpectedly from the craft's four wing tanks during
the aircraft's initial climb to cruising altitude.
</P>
<P>
Until the start of its global flight, the plane -- which
carries six times its own weight in fuel -- had
never taken off with a full load, a maneuver so
risky that Fossett didn't want to try it until he
was ready to circle the globe.
