Cindy Sheehan, the mother of a soldier killed
in Iraq who has set up a vigil near President
Bush's ranch, said Tuesday that she was "very disturbed" that
a local resident had mowed down hundreds of small crosses
bearing the names of other dead American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Further, Sheehan promised that her 10-day-old protest was "only the beginning"
of what she called a growing national movement to bring
all American men and women home from the war.
</P>
<P>
Camp Casey, Sheehan's increasingly crowded roadside encampment named after her son,
will soon move to a large property even closer to
the president's ranch, she said.
</P>
<P>
"A kind gentleman from down the road offered us the use
of his property," Sheehan told reporters Tuesday night. She identified
the man as Fred Mattlage, whom she described as a
distant cousin of Larry Mattlage, a local resident who fired
a shotgun across the road from the encampment on Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan said the property, near a Secret Service checkpoint about a
mile from Bush's ranch, would have plenty of space for
the parked cars that have jammed the roadside, irritating local
residents. Fred Mattlage could not be reached on Tuesday to
confirm Sheehan's account.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a group of Bush's neighbors appeared before the
McLennan County Commission on Tuesday morning asking that a no-parking
zone near the president's ranch be expanded, effectively forcing Camp
Casey to move to the town of Crawford, seven miles
away.
</P>
<P>
Neighbors have complained of traffic jams and blocked roads, and some
said they worried about the safety of their children, who
started school on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, the police arrested a local resident who had
used a truck to mow down about half of the
500 small wooden crosses hammered into the roadside dirt. Sheehan's
supporters put the crosses back in place on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"What happened last night is very disturbing to all of us,
and it should be really disturbing to America," Sheehan said
in a news conference at Camp Casey on Tuesday morning.
"Because no matter what you think about the war, we
should all honor the sacrifice of the ones who have
fallen. And to me it's so ironic that I'm accused
of dishonoring my son's memory by doing what I'm doing,
by the other side, and then somebody comes and does
this."
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, who has vowed not to leave until Bush comes off
his ranch and speaks to her, said that if local
residents wanted her to leave, "they should talk to their
neighbor, George Bush, and tell him to talk to us."
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Bush did meet with Sheehan in June 2004, but she has
said that the president was disrespectful to her by referring
to her as "Mom" throughout the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Bush has since said he is sympathetic to Sheehan, 48, of
Vacaville, Calif., whose son, an Army specialist, was killed at
24 in Baghdad on April 4, 2004. On Tuesday a
White House spokeswoman, Dana Perino, said that while the president
disagreed with Sheehan's views, "he says he respects her right
to peacefully protest."
</P>
<P>
Sheehan's supporters said they had planned nearly 1,000 anti-war vigils across
the country on Wednesday night.
