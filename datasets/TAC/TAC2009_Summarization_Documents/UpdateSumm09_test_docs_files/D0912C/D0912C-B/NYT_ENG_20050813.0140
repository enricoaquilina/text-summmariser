CRAWFORD, Texas - President Bush, noting that lots of people want
to talk to the president and "it's also important for
me to go on with my life," on Saturday defended
his decision not to meet with the grieving mom of
a soldier killed in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Bush said he is aware of the anti-war sentiments of Cindy
Sheehan and others who have joined her protest near the
Bush ranch.
</P>
<P>
"But whether it be here or in Washington or anywhere else,
there's somebody who has got something to say to the
president, that's part of the job," Bush said on the
ranch. "And I think it's important for me to be
thoughtful and sensitive to those who have got something to
say."
</P>
<P>
"But," he added, "I think it's also important for me to
go on with my life, to keep a balanced life."
</P>
<P>
The comments came prior to a bike ride on the ranch
with journalists and aides. It also came as the crowd
of protesters grew in support of Sheehan, the California mother
who came here Aug. 6 demanding to talk to Bush
about the death of her son Casey. Sheehan arrived earlier
in the week with about a half dozen supporters. As
of yesterday (Saturday) there were about 300 anti-war protestors and
approximately 100 people supporting the Bush Administration.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan is seeking a justification for the war, as well as
her son's death.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want comfort from him," she said Friday. ""I want
answers. I want the truth."
</P>
<P>
Bush on Saturday said, "I've heard their complaints about my policy.
I think it would be a big mistake to withdraw
immediately from Iraq, which is what they're suggesting we do."
</P>
<P>
In addition to the two-hour bike ride, Bush's Saturday schedule included
an evening Little League Baseball playoff game, a lunch meeting
with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, a nap, some fishing
and some reading.
</P>
<P>
"I think the people want the president to be in a
position to make good, crisp decisions and to stay healthy,"
he said when asked about bike riding while a grieving
mom wanted to speak with him. "And part of my
being is to be outside exercising."
</P>
<P>
"So I'm mindful of what goes on around me," Bush added.
"On the other hand, I'm also mindful that I've got
a life to live and will do so."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Bush's motorcade drove by the protest site en route
to a Republican fund-raising event at a nearby ranch. As
Bush rolled by, Sheehan held a sign that said, "Why
do you make time for donors and not for me?"
</P>
<P>
Later Friday, more than 100 supporters of Bush led by Mike
Gallagher, a radio talk show host, showed up at the
protest site to show their support for his Iraq policy.
On Saturday, authorities kept the two groups separated.
</P>
<P>
Bush on Saturday also defended his Iraq policy in his weekly
radio address, saying the war is going well.
</P>
<P>
"Iraqis are taking control of their country, building a free nation
that can govern itself, sustain itself and defense itself," he
said. "And we're helping Iraqis succeed."
