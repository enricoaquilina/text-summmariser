<HEADLINE>
Conservative Backlash Aimed at Antiwar Protester Sheehan
</HEADLINE>

CRAWFORD, Texas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cindy Sheehan rode into town 10 days ago, a
forlorn mother with a penetrating question for her president: Why did
my son die in Iraq?
</P>
<P>
But now the same wave of publicity and political anger that she
rode to become a nationally known symbol of the antiwar movement
threatens to crash down on Sheehan herself.
</P>
<P>
Conservative commentators and Web sites are taking aim at Sheehan
with the same ferocity she has aimed at President Bush. In part, they
are using her own words as ammunition against her -- reciting such
controversial comments as her vow to refuse pay taxes to a government
waging an ``illegal'' war and her desire to see Bush impeached.
</P>
<P>
The backlash is becoming a new object lesson in how saturation
media coverage and the instinct for personal attack are shaping
political debate. Some independent commentators said the pushback on
the right had succeeded in part at scuffing the public sympathy and
deference she had earned as the mother of a fallen soldier, and shown
how virtually any subject relating to the Iraq war and Bush's
presidency is viewed through a partisan lens.
</P>
<P>
``Cindy Sheehan has emboldened the progressives who oppose the war
and caused the conservative die-hards who are behind the war to go
into a defensive mode,'' said Michael Harrison, publisher of Talkers
magazine, a trade publication for talk radio. ``Cindy Sheehan is going
to be a target, and they'll probably go through her past to find what
they can to discredit her.''
</P>
<P>
Since her son, Casey, 24, was killed in Iraq last year, Sheehan has
traveled the country trying to drum up opposition to the war in Iraq.
She has participated in peace conferences, demonstrations and a mock
congressional hearing about the infamous Downing Street memo, notes of
a meeting with British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his top advisers
that said the Bush administration had decided to go to war and molded
intelligence findings to support that decision.
</P>
<P>
In that time, Sheehan, 48, a soft-spoken woman who says she was
radicalized by her son's death, has engaged in her fair share of
inflammatory rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
``It's obvious Cindy Sheehan has become a political player, whose
primary concern is embarrassing the president,'' Fox Television
personality Bill O'Reilly wrote Tuesday in an online column. ``She is
no longer just a protester.''
</P>
<P>
Bush, Sheehan said, lied to the American people about the war and
should be impeached. And she is refusing to pay taxes in hopes that
the Internal Revenue Service will come after her to collect. ``I'm not
supporting a government that wages an illegal, immoral war,'' she
said. ``I want them to come after me, so I can put the war on trial.''
</P>
<P>
Still, she called some of the statements attributed to her
distortions. Contrary to a letter attributed to her that is
circulating widely on the Internet, she claims she never said that the
United States is waging the war in Iraq to protect Israel.
</P>
<P>
``I have said a lot of strong things, and I'll stand by everything
I said,'' Sheehan said, adding that she thought the document had been
altered. ``But I didn't say that.''
</P>
<P>
The scrutiny that has accompanied Sheehan's quick rise to
prominence has extended to her family. Several of her in-laws have
publicly criticized her protest -- announcing their displeasure in a
release to the Drudge Report. And news that Sheehan's husband,
Patrick, has filed for divorce has been trumpeted by some bloggers as
evidence of her extreme views.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan acknowledges that that some of her views are becoming a
distraction. Also, she said, some of the groups that have aided her
protest have agendas -- including conspiracy theories about the Sept.
11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and some vaguely anti-Semitic theories
about the cause of the war -- that she says she does not share.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, she has asked that her camp site near Bush's ranch be
restricted only to organizations of military families, or those that
have lost loved ones in the war.
</P>
<P>
``Attention got focused on the messenger and not the message,''
Sheehan said. ``My thing is ending the war in Iraq. But there are a
lot of people who want to attach their horse to my wagon because of
the exposure I'm getting.''
</P>
<P>
The increased scrutiny of Sheehan is coming as some residents here
are growing irritated with the stream of antiwar protesters drawn to
her vigil.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Sheehan Tuesday announced plans to move the camp
from the drainage ditches next to the winding road about two miles
from Bush's 1,600-acre spread to a field on a ranch offered by one of
Bush's neighbors. The new camp would be about a mile from Bush's
ranch. All that would be left behind at the original site would be
three tents and hundreds of white, wooden crosses bearing the names of
troops killed in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The move followed complaints by about 60 of Bush's neighbors, who
petitioned the county to expand a no-parking zone around the camp, in
an effort to avert the traffic tie-ups that have become commonplace as
the protest has grown. Also, Monday night a truck dragging chains and
a pipe demolished some of the crosses.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan has promised to remain encamped throughout Bush's five-week
stay here and to return whenever the president does. She also
announced plans for a series of nearly 1,000 candlelight vigils
nationwide on Wednesday night. Liberal advocacy groups MoveOn.org
Political Action and Democracy for America are organizing the
protests.
</P>
<P>
``All of this other b.s. just clouds my message,'' Sheehan said.
``My message is that of a brokenhearted mom sitting down in front of
George Bush's ranch wanting to know why my son died.''
