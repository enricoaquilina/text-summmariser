PINKERTON COMMENTARY: United In Their Desire to Cause Change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two women, both of whom have lost children, are out to change
government policy. Can they succeed? Should they succeed?
</P>
<P>
The two women are Beth Holloway Twitty and Cindy Sheehan. Twitty's
daughter, Natalee Holloway, went missing in Aruba in May. Sheehan lost
her son, Casey, in Iraq last year.
</P>
<P>
Both women have proved savvy in using the media. And, although we
must sympathize with both, we must also consider the impact of their
efforts on the institutions that have been created to deal with
problems of law and war.
</P>
<P>
Twitty believes that Aruban authorities are not working
energetically and competently to find out what happened to her
daughter. In taking her case to the public, she has enlisted much of
the media, particularly cable news. Yet, while many have criticized
TV's infatuation with the Case of Yet Another Pretty White Girl, a
deeper point needs to be remembered: the importance of victims'
rights.
</P>
<P>
For decades, even as the crime rate soared, the legal and popular
culture chose to dwell on the sympathetic side of criminals -- that
they, too, were victims of a racist and unjust society. Finally,
law-abiding Middle America said, ``Enough!'' In the last two decades,
tragic events have propelled such new figures as John ``America's Most
Wanted'' Walsh into rightful prominence. Politicians have responded to
this cultural shift by toughening laws, hiring more cops and
increasing prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
Yet there's obviously still more work to be done. The recent case
of Joseph Edward Duncan -- charged with triple homicide and abduction
of an 8-year-old girl -- demonstrates that the revolving door still
spins out of control. Duncan was legally deemed a sexual psychopath in
1980. Yet, for much of the last quarter-century, he has been out of
jail, free to do who knows what. It's apparent that even today many
officials still calculate that it's not really worth worrying about
catching criminals and keeping them caught.
</P>
<P>
By this reckoning, the Natalie Holloway case should not be seen as
the opportunity to exploit the memory of a telegenic blonde, but
rather to change the lenient professional calculus of cops, judges and
parole boards.
</P>
<P>
Cindy Sheehan, too, wishes to use the media for her cause, getting
the United States out of Iraq. After stumping the country for months
in obscurity, she hit upon a media-friendly stratagem. She camped
outside George W. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, where bored
reporters were eager for a lively story.
</P>
<P>
It's Sheehan's right to protest, and most likely her efforts will
increase opposition to the war; every movement, to be effective in the
media age, needs a face. And now the anti-war movement has its face.
</P>
<P>
But it's worth pausing over the one specific request Sheehan has
made: that the president meet with her to talk about Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Were Bush to do so, it would set a bad precedent. Without regard to
the merits of this particular war, a president should not be
media-blackmailed into such a meeting. During World War II, some
400,000 Americans were killed, and so should President Franklin D.
Roosevelt have met with each one of those families?
</P>
<P>
In wartime, we need a commander in chief, not a consoler in chief
or a debater in chief.
</P>
<P>
It's possible that Bush policies will be overturned at the ballot
box in the coming elections. If so, that would be an example of the
system responding legitimately to public pressure.
</P>
<P>
What connects Twitty and Sheehan is that they want to make change.
What will validate their efforts permanently is if they make change
that strengthens useful institutions as opposed to weakening them.
That means forcing the criminal justice system to do its job, on the
one hand, while leaving Bush and the electorate to do their jobs on
the other.
