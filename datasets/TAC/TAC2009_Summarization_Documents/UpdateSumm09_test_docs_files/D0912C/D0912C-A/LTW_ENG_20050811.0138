Bush Expresses Sympathy for Grieving Families But Says
</HEADLINE>

CRAWFORD, Texas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a roadside anti-war vigil initiated by a
California woman who lost a son in Iraq continued near his ranch
Thursday, President Bush said that he sympathizes with her loss but
that agreeing to her demand to immediately withdraw troops ``would be
a mistake for the security of this country.''
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with members of his national
security team, Bush said he has heard the voices of Cindy Sheehan and
grieving family members who say the United States should leave Iraq
because of the mounting death toll.
</P>
<P>
``I grieve for every death,'' Bush said. ``It breaks my heart to
think about a family weeping over the loss of a loved one. I
understand the anguish that some feel about the death that takes
place.''
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Bush added, withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq before
that nation's security forces are able to cope with the ongoing
insurgency ``would send a terrible signal to the enemy,'' that the
United States is weak and easily intimidated
</P>
<P>
While Bush met with Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of
Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to
discuss the war and other foreign policy concerns, a growing clutch of
protesters were encamped along the muddy shoulder of the narrow,
winding road leading to Bush's 1,600-acre ranch.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, who began her vigil Saturday, has been joined by several
dozen protesters from across the country, including some others who
have had loved ones killed in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
``The president says he feels compassion for me, but the best way
to show that compassion is by meeting with me and the other mothers
and families who are here,'' Sheehan said. ``Our sons made the
ultimate sacrifice and we want answers. All we're asking is that he
sacrifice an hour out of his five-week vacation to talk to us, before
the next mother loses her son in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
Celeste Zappala of Philadelphia, said her son, Sgt. Sherwood Baker,
was killed in Baghdad while looking for nonexistent weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
``This war is a disaster,'' Zappala said. ``It is a betrayal of our
military. It is a betrayal of our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
The protesters have strung placards along the roadside saying
things such as, ``Who would Jesus bomb?'' and ``Who lied? Who died?
Who paid? Who profits?'' They also drove dozens of small, white wooden
crosses into the ground along the road, in honor of those killed in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan's son, Casey Sheehan, 24, a former Eagle Scout and altar
boy, was killed in Baghdad on April 4, 2004, within a week of arriving
in Iraq. Sheehan met Bush two months later, as part of a group of
grieving military family members. She has alleged that Bush treated
her callously during their private conversation, and she has demanded
a second meeting to air her grievances about the war and to tell Bush
about the devastation she has felt since losing her son.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of her son's death, Sheehan, 48, co-founded Gold Star
Families for Peace, an organization of people who have lost loved ones
in Iraq or who oppose the war.
</P>
<P>
Although she met Saturday with two top Bush aides, Sheehan has
vowed to maintain her vigil -- both here and, if necessary, outside the
White House -- until she is granted another meeting with the president.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan's protest has created a delicate situation for the White
House, which has resisted being drawn into a public battle with a
woman who lost a son in Iraq. While officials would not publicly
refute Sheehan's description of her meeting with Bush, they did point
out that the president has met with about 900 family members of 272
fallen soldiers -- sessions they describe as often emotional and
moving.
