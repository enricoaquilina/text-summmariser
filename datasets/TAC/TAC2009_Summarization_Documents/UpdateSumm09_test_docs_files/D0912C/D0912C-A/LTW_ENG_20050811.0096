Soldier's Mother Takes Protest to Bloggers
</HEADLINE>

Cindy Sheehan, the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq who has been
camped outside President Bush's ranch near Crawford, Texas, has taken
her antiwar protest to the Internet, joining a conference call with
bloggers around the country, along with a stray congresswoman.

Sheehan, who has been demanding an audience with the president,
told the bloggers that she has felt intimidated by the Secret Service,
has been awakened in the middle of the night by thunderstorms and has
a sore throat. But, Sheehan said, she has no plans to end her vigil
until Bush meets with her to discuss the war, he goes back to the
White House or she is arrested.

``This is going to be a very, very long haul,'' Sheehan said in a
call hosted by Democratic strategist and Internet guru Joe Trippi.
Trippi, who managed Howard Dean's presidential campaign, urged the
bloggers to write about her protest on their individual sites. The
liberal online advocacy group MoveOn.org is also taking up Sheehan's
cause, soliciting signatures for a petition in support of her cause
and announcing plans to run an ad in the local paper, the Waco
Tribune-Herald.

Many of the bloggers on the call gushed over her protest (``We love
you, Cindy'') while Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., also chimed in to
express her support.

Sheehan, of Vacaville, Calif., earlier this week described her
protest on the popular liberal blog Daily Kos, complaining that the
mainstream news media have not paid enough attention to her cause,
although she was interviewed Sunday on CNN's ``Late Edition.''

<P>
``If we didn't have the Internet, none of us would really know what
was truly going on,'' she said. ``This is something that can't be
ignored.''
