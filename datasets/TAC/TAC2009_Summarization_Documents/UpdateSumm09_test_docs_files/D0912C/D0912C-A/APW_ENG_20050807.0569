U.S. war families torn by conflict; peace activist holding vigil near Bush's ranch

The mother of a fallen U.S. soldier who is holding a roadside peace vigil near
President George W. Bush's ranch shares the same grief as relatives mourning the
deaths of Ohio Marines, yet their views about the war differ.
</P>
<P>
"I'm angry. I want the troops home," Cindy Sheehan, 48, of California, who
staged a protest that she vowed on Sunday to continue until she can personally
ask Bush: "Why did you kill my son? What did my son die for?"
</P>
<P>
Jim Boskovitch, father of slain Cpl. Jeffery Boskovitch, 25, of Ohio, is
supporting the U.S. military action in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe, and I would echo my son's feeling on this, it is very, very
important for our country to remain steadfast and complete the mission that they
set out to accomplish," Boskovitch told ABC on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Boskovitch is among several families mourning Ohio Marines who suffered heavy
losses in three attacks starting July 28, when two were killed in a gun battle.
On Monday, five were killed in an ambush. Nine were killed Wednesday when an
armored vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb.
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Palmer, the mother of Lance Cpl. Edward Schroeder, 23, another Ohio
Marine killed in Iraq, sided more with Sheehan. If the United States continues
its current course in Iraq, the death toll of U.S. troops, now at more than
1,820, will only grow, she told ABC.
</P>
<P>
"We either have to have more people there to do the job and better equipment, or
we have to leave _ one or the other," she said.
</P>
<P>
Boskovitch said his son, Jeff, "felt extremely, extremely strongly about the
Iraqi people and our government deciding to go over there."
</P>
<P>
"His commander in chief needed him to be there, as well as those fellow
soldiers, to help those people, help that country to be able to stand on its own
and to liberate those people," Boskovitch told ABC.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan was among grieving military families who met with Bush in June 2004 at
Fort Lewis, near Seattle, Washington. That was just two months after her son,
Casey, was killed in Sadr City, Iraq, on April 4, 2004.
</P>
<P>
Since then, she said, various government and independent commission reports have
disputed the Bush administration's claims that Saddam Hussein had mass-killing
chemical and biological weapons _ a main justification for the March 2003
invasion.
</P>
<P>
"I was still in shock then," Sheehan said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
"All of those reports prove my son died needlessly," said Sheehan. "This proved
that every reason George Bush gave us for going to war was wrong."
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, who formed a group called Gold Star Families For Peace and has spoken
out against the war across the nation, talked for about 45 minutes on Saturday
with Steve Hadley, Bush's national security adviser, and Joe Hagin, deputy White
House chief of staff, who went out to hear her concerns.
</P>
<P>
Appreciative of their attention, yet undaunted, Sheehan said she planned to
continue her protest along the road during Bush's stay through the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
"If he doesn't come out and talk to me in Crawford, I'll follow him to D.C.,"
she said. "I'll camp on his lawn in D.C. until he has the courtesy and the
integrity and the compassion to talk to somebody whose life he has
ruined."
