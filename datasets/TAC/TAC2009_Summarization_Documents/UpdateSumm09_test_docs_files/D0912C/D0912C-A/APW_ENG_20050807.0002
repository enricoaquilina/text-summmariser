<P>
The angry mother of a fallen U.S. soldier has met with advisers of President
George W. Bush after staging a protest near his ranch to demand an accounting of
how the president has conducted the war in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Supported by more than 50 demonstrators who chanted, "W. killed her son!" Cindy
Sheehan told reporters: "I want to ask the president, 'Why did you kill my son?
What did my son die for?'"
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, 48, didn't get to see Bush, but did talk about 45 minutes with national
security adviser Steve Hadley and deputy White House chief of staff Joe Hagin,
who went out to hear her concerns.
</P>
<P>
Appreciative of their attention, yet undaunted, Sheehan said she planned to
continue her roadside vigil, except for a few breaks, until she gets to talk to
Bush. Her son, Casey, 24, was killed in Sadr City, Iraq, on April 4, 2004. He
was an Army specialist, a Humvee mechanic.
</P>
<P>
"They (the advisers) said we are in Iraq because they believed Saddam Hussein
had weapons of mass destruction, that the world's a better place with Saddam
gone and that we're making the world a safer place with what we're doing over
there," Sheehan said in a telephone interview after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"They were very respectful. They were nice men. I told them Iraq was not a
threat to the United States and that now people are dead for nothing. I told
them I wouldn't leave until I talked to George Bush."
</P>
<P>
She said Hagin told her, "I want to assure you that he (Bush) really does
care."
</P>
<P>
"And I said if he does care, why doesn't he come out and talk to
me."
</P>
<P>
Sheehan arrived in Crawford aboard a bus painted red, white and blue and
emblazoned with the words, "Impeachment Tour." Sheehan, from Vacaville,
California, had been attending a Veterans for Peace convention in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
The bus, trailed by about 20 cars of protesters and reporters, drove at about 15
(24 kph) toward Bush's ranch. After several miles (kilometers), they parked the
vehicles and began to march, in stifling heat, farther down the narrow country
road.
</P>
<P>
Flanked by miles (kilometers) of pasture, Sheehan spoke with reporters while
clutching two photographs, one of her son in uniform, and the other, a baby
picture, when he was seven months old.
</P>
<P>
She said she decided to come to Crawford a few days ago after Bush said that
fallen U.S. troops had died for a noble cause and that the mission must be
completed.
</P>
<P>
"I want to ask the president, `Why did you kill my son? What did my son die
for?" she said, her voice cracking with emotion. "Last week, you said my son
died for a noble cause' and I want to ask him what that noble cause
is?"
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Trent Duffy said response that Bush also wants the troops
to return home safely.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the hundreds of families the president has met with know their loved
one died for a noble cause and that the best way to honor their sacrifice is to
complete the mission," Duffy said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a message the president has heard time and again from those he has met
with and comforted. Like all Americans, he wants the troops home as soon as
possible."
