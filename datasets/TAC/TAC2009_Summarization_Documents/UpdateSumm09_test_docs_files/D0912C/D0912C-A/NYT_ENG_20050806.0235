MOTHER TAKES WAR PROTEST TO BUSH'S RANCH

The mother of an American soldier killed in
Iraq led a protest march on President Bush's ranch here
on Saturday, prompting the White House to send two senior
officials to meet her after she was blocked by the
authorities from approaching Bush's home.

<P>
The mother, Cindy Sheehan, who has made regular public appearances in
opposition to the war, was accompanied by several dozen chanting
anti-war activists, including other parents who had lost children to
the war, as she walked down a country road toward
Bush's ranch. About five miles from the ranch, they were
met by the local police, who barred them from getting
any closer. Sheehan said she would remain as close as
possible until Bush agreed to see her.

Later on Saturday afternoon, the two senior officials -- Stephen J.
Hadley, the national security adviser, and Joe Hagin, a deputy
White House chief of staff -- went out to meet
with Sheehan and several other protesters, said Trent D. Duffy,
a spokesman for the White House.
</P>
<P>
They met for about 45 minutes, and Sheehan told the two
men she appreciated their seeing her.
</P>
<P>
Her son, Spc. Casey A. Sheehan of the Army, a Humvee
mechanic, was killed April 24, 2004, in Sadr City, Iraq.
He was 24. As she walked through Crawford on Saturday,
Sheehan carried pictures of him as a toddler and in
his Army fatigues.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with the officials, she told reporters, "I want to
ask George Bush: Why did my son die?"
</P>
<P>
She said she was particularly upset by Bush's characterization, in a
speech on Wednesday in Grapevine, Texas, of the war and
the sacrifice of the families of fallen troops.
</P>
<P>
"Our men and women who have lost their lives in Iraq
and Afghanistan and in this war on terror have died
in a noble cause, in a selfless cause," Bush said
in the speech.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation came at the end of a particularly deadly week
in Iraq for American troops, and at a time when
polls have shown that public approval of Bush's handling of
the war has reached new lows.
