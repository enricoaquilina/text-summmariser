Antiwar Effort Mobilizes Behind One Disenchanted, Mourning Mom

CRAWFORD, Texas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a year, a modest bungalow known as
``Peace House,'' located a few miles from President Bush's ranch, has
served as a headquarters for antiwar activists. It is lonely work,
with little more than a skeleton crew on hand much of the time.
</P>
<P>
But then Cindy Sheehan hit town.
</P>
<P>
The 48-year old mother of Army Spc. Casey Sheehan, who was killed
in an ambush in Baghdad, Iraq, last year, is consumed by the kind of
grief that turns into a furious determination to do something -- in
her case, to confront the president and force him to explain why her
son died.
</P>
<P>
Now, in the space of just a few days, what started out as a
seemingly quixotic personal mission has become something of a
phenomenon -- with media swarming around Sheehan, leading liberal and
antiwar activists parachuting in to try to make her their long-sought
voice, and political experts in both parties working to assess what
role she may have in galvanizing the public's gathering unhappiness
with the increasing American casualties in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Antiwar leaders hope that putting the spotlight on Sheehan will
motivate Americans who oppose the war, creating a political force
strong enough to compel the Bush administration to change course.
</P>
<P>
MoveOn.org and other liberal groups have rushed to provide support,
offering media expertise and attempting to assemble a corps of others
who have lost relatives in Iraq or have family members serving there.
</P>
<P>
Liberal voices have swung into action on the Internet as well. On
Wednesday, Democratic media consultant Joe Trippi organized a
conference call with Sheehan for bloggers, aiming to garner more
publicity. By Wednesday afternoon, ``Cindy Sheehan'' was the
top-ranked search term on Technorati.com, the search engine for blog
postings.
</P>
<P>
The White House, meantime, has sought to cope with Sheehan's vigil
without abandoning its strategy for dealing with the families of
troops who have died. On a number of occasions, Bush has met with
bereaved relatives -- including some who have challenged him sharply
on the war -- but he has done so privately, away from news cameras and
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, a Vacaville resident who opposed the war even before her
son's death, was a member of one such group in June 2004. She came
away from that meeting dissatisfied and angry.
</P>
<P>
``We wanted (the president) to look at pictures of Casey, we wanted
him to hear stories about Casey, and he wouldn't. He changed the
subject every time we tried,'' Sheehan said. He wouldn't say Casey's
name, called him: `your loved one.' ``
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, a co-founder of the antiwar group Gold Star Families for
Peace, has said that she will remain in Crawford until she gets to see
Bush face to face.
</P>
<P>
Until a sudden cloudburst forced her to move to Peace House early
Wednesday morning, Sheehan had been camping in a tent along a road
about two miles from Bush's Prairie Chapel Ranch. On Saturday, the day
she arrived in Crawford, two senior White House aides -- national
security adviser Stephen Hadley and deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin --
left the ranch to meet with her on a dusty road for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
That, she said, was not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday night, Sheehan had given so many interviews that she
was sucking on lozenges to soothe an inflamed throat. Her ears were
sore from cradling a telephone. Her media adviser, newly arrived from
San Francisco, said Sheehan had developed a fever.
</P>
<P>
None of that stopped her. Whether talking to newspaper reporters,
People magazine or radio and television interviewers -- some from as
far away as Japan -- she was relentlessly on message.
</P>
<P>
''I don't believe his phony excuses for the war,`` she said of Bush
in an interview with a CBS reporter for the network's northern
California affiliates. ''I want him to tell me why my son died.
</P>
<P>
``If he gave the real answer, people in this country would be
outraged -- if he told people it was to make his buddies rich, that it
was about oil ... ''
</P>
<P>
Sheehan is certainly not the first to denounce the president over
the war. From the beginning, activists have been outspoken in
criticizing Bush's policy and his stated reasons for sending U.S.
troops into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
For the moment however, the personal nature of Sheehan's protest --
with its edge of raw emotion -- and the concentration of news media
staked out in Crawford, where Bush is spending much of August, have
combined to raise her voice above the crowd.
</P>
<P>
``Anything that focuses media and public attention on Iraq war
casualties day after day -- particularly (something) that is a good
visual for television, like a weeping Gold Star mother -- is a really
bad thing for President Bush and his administration,'' said
independent political analyst Charlie Cook.
</P>
<P>
``Americans get a little numb by the numbers of war casualties, but
when faces, names and families are added, it has a much greater
effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
``Cindy Sheehan has tapped into a latent but fervent feeling among
some in this country who would prefer that we not engage our troops in
Iraq,'' said Republican strategist Kellyanne Conway, president of the
Washington-based firm The Polling Company.
</P>
<P>
``She can tap into what has been an astonishingly silent minority
since the end of last year's presidential contest. It will capture
attention.''
</P>
<P>
But other analysts predicted Sheehan would soon fade from the
scene.
</P>
<P>
``The president has an Iraq problem, but I don't think it's much
worsened by Mrs. Sheehan,'' said Stephen Hess of George Washington
University. ``One Gold Star mother is a sympathetic figure, but
collectively -- as Gold Star Families for Peace -- she is a movement
and, as such, can be countered by a counter-movement.
</P>
<P>
''I think the president might have defused the situation if he had
invited her in instantly,`` Hess said, predicting that GOP strategists
would soon mount a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
Already, there were signs of just that.
</P>
<P>
Some have suggested that Sheehan is disloyal to criticize the
president in time of war. Even in Vacaville, Sheehan said, some people
say she is shaming her son's memory. Conservative blogger Michelle
Malkin disdainfully called the activists promoting Sheehan ''grief
pimps.``
</P>
<P>
The antiwar activists who have rushed to Sheehan's side are all too
well aware of the danger that her moment in the spotlight could become
just another partisan shouting match.
</P>
<P>
Said Tom Matzzie of MoveOn.org: ''Cindy reached out to us. We're
e-mailing our members about her story today, running a print ad in
Waco (Texas). Cindy is a morally pure voice on the war, so we're
trying to keep the focus on her and not jump in and turn it into a
political fight.``
</P>
<P>
Since Sheehan arrived in Crawford, Peace House has been transformed
into a beehive.
</P>
<P>
On the porch, bottles of water -- and a huge box of collapsible
pink umbrellas -- were waiting Wednesday to be ferried out to ''Camp
Casey,`` the muddy staging area along Prairie Chapel Road where
Sheehan and about 100 of her supporters were gathered.
</P>
<P>
On a table in the living room were stacks of white T-shirts that
read ''BUSH ... Talk to Cindy! Moms and Vets Will Stop the War!``
</P>
<P>
In the tiny kitchen, two women busily chopped carrots and celery as
they prepared to feed a growing cadre of activists. Other volunteers
talked on their cellphones, coordinating with supporters around the
country.
</P>
<P>
There was much speculation about ``other moms'' and parents of
troops serving in the war coming to join Sheehan, although no one
seemed to know for certain. ``A busload is coming from Seattle,'' one
woman called out.
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Frizzell, 30, said she drove from Dallas with her son,
Julian, 4, ``to provide support for Cindy.'' They met last weekend at
a Dallas convention of veterans for peace.
</P>
<P>
According to Ann Wright, who identified herself as a former U.S.
diplomat who resigned to protest the war, Sheehan seemed to make a
spontaneous decision to come to Crawford when she was while addressing
the convention Friday. Wright said countless hands were raised,
offering to join her mission.
</P>
<P>
As Sheehan put it Wednesday: ``I just had the right idea in the
right place at the right time.''
