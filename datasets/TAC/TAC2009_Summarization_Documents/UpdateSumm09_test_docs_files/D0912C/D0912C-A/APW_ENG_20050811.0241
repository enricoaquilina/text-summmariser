Bush holds ranch meeting with defense, foreign policy teams

CRAWFORD, Texas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. President George W. Bush was meeting with his defense and foreign policy
teams Thursday at his Texas ranch, from where he'll look at world hotspots from
Baghdad to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dick Cheney and top-rung advisers, including Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, were coming for the
serious talks about issues ranging from ongoing violence in Iraq and standoffs
with Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs to anti-American sentiment
abroad, especially in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Keeping with tradition, Bush is spending August at the ranch in
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
The unhurried pace of this one-stoplight town stands in sharp contrast to events
across the globe: suicide bombings in Iraq; on-again, off-again negotiations
with the reclusive North Korea; Iran's decision to restart sensitive nuclear
work; next week's pullout of some 9,000 Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip and
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Bush's update on defense and foreign policy issues comes at a time when his
approval ratings are hovering below 50 percent. An AP-Ipsos poll conducted Aug.
1-3 showed Bush's overall job approval was at 42 percent, with 55 percent
disapproving. That's about where his approval rating has been all summer, but
slightly lower than it was when the year began. His approval on his handling of
Iraq stood at 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, where the death toll of U.S. troops has topped 1,840, is likely to take a
center stage.
</P>
<P>
The administration is hoping that progress on the political front will help
deflate violence and allow the United States and its partners to begin
withdrawing troops next year.
</P>
<P>
Rumsfeld said success in drafting a new Iraqi constitution is critical toward
persuading the majority of Iraqis that the "new Iraq is worth fighting for." But
a deadlock has arisen over the drafting of the charter, which is supposed to be
completed by Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cindy Sheehan, a California mother of a fallen soldier, is holding a roadside
protest to bring the troops home.
</P>
<P>
So far, Rumsfeld has not publicly voiced his thoughts on when U.S. forces may be
able to come home in large numbers _ a decision that hinges on the level of
violence and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces, which now number
178,000.
</P>
<P>
A joint U.S.-Iraqi committee that is identifying areas to revert to Iraqi
control will submit its final report by the end of September. That is the first
step toward what Gen. George W. Casey, the top commander in Iraq, has said could
lead to a "fairly substantial" reduction in the 138,000-strong U.S. force by the
spring and summer of next year.
</P>
<P>
Casey has not disclosed numbers, but Pentagon officials have mentioned a
reduction figure of 20,000 to 30,000 troops. That would still leave about
100,000 Americans in Iraq well into next year.
</P>
<P>
But first the Pentagon will likely have to increase the number of U.S. troops
above the current 138,000 to improve security for a planned October referendum
and a December election, when a burst of insurgent violence is expected,
Rumsfeld spokesman Lawrence Di Rita said this week.
</P>
<P>
In January, when Iraq held its first elections, troop levels were raised as high
as 160,000, mainly by overlapping some units arriving in Iraq to begin a
one-year tour with those who were ending their yearlong tours. Di Rita said that
this time commanders could also ask for volunteers to serve extended tours or
send some U.S.-based troops to Iraq to augment the force during the fall
election period.
</P>
<P>
The White House says Rumsfeld will brief the president on the Quadrennial
Defense Review, a congressionally mandated top-to-bottom review of defense
strategy and plans. The review, begun earlier this year, will be completed
around January, in time for the February budget submission.
