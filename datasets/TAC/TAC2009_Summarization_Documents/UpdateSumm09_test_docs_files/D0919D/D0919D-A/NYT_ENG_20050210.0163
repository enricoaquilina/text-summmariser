PRINCE CHARLES ANNOUNCES HE WILL MARRY AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They have been friends for 30 years and lovers
for most of that time. They have survived marriages to
and divorces from other people; the icy disapproval of relatives;
the resentment of the public; and, perhaps most excruciating of
all, the publication of intimate details of their risque pillow
talk.
</P>
<P>
But now Charles, the Prince of Wales, and Camilla Parker Bowles,
whose love affair is said to have begun when she
cheekily declared, "My great-grandmother was your great-great-grandfather's mistress, so how
about it?," are to take the most radical and surprising
step of their long, star-crossed romance. They are getting married.
</P>
<P>
The wedding is to take place on April 8 in a
civil ceremony at Windsor Castle, Charles announced Thursday, but the
57-year-old bride will not become the Princess of Wales --
that position having already been more than filled by the
prince's late and much-remembered ex-wife, Diana. Instead, Parker Bowles will
be known as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
Nor will she be crowned queen. In a move that addresses
one of the thorniest issues surrounding the marriage, Parker Bowles
will become the Princess Consort if Charles, 56, succeeds his
mother on the throne. It will be the first time
in the history of the English monarchy that such a
title has been used, according to Vernon Bogdanor, professor of
politics at Oxford University, and the first time an English
king's wife has not been queen. (Queen Victoria did have
Albert as Prince Consort.)
</P>
<P>
The announcement gives official status for the first time to Parker
Bowles, who has been living in an uneasy purgatory --
part of the prince's life, but bound by royal custom
and social protocol to be an unequal partner. Although in
recent years the two have appeared more often together in
public, their murky status has put her in a difficult
and oddly anachronistic position.
</P>
<P>
In earlier eras, of course, royals were not allowed to marry
divorced people (never mind, unless they were Henry VIII, being
divorced themselves). In 1936, Edward VIII renounced the throne rather
than give up Wallis Simpson, an American divorcee. In 1955,
Prince Charles' Aunt, Princess Margaret, broke off a relationship with
a divorced man rather than relinquish her royal status and
all its perks.
</P>
<P>
But in a sign of how much things have changed, this
time Queen Elizabeth gave her permission for, and blessing to,
the engagement of her divorced son to his divorced lover.
Saying that she and her husband, Charles' father, were "very
happy," she ordered that the Round Tower at Windsor Castle
be lit in celebration.
</P>
<P>
The queen has not always appeared to be Parker Bowles' biggest
fan. Although Charles has for some time been openly living
with Camilla, his mother has very rarely entertained the two
of them as a couple and indeed seemed intent on
distancing herself from the relationship. But the two met in
2000, and on Thursday the Queen said that "we have
given them our warmest good wishes for their future together."
</P>
<P>
In their own statement, the prince's two sons, Prince Harry and
Prince William, said: "We are both very happy for our
father and Camilla and we wish them all the luck
in the future."
</P>
<P>
While the majority of respondents in several snap public opinion polls
in Britain on Thursday said they disapproved of the engagement,
crowds of well-wishers cheered Prince Charles during a public appearance
in London, and politicians rushed to congratulate the couple.
</P>
<P>
Even officials of the Church of England, which until 2002 did
not even allow divorcees to marry in church, have come
around to the idea that Charles and Camilla would be
better off married than not. The question has been complicated
by the fact that when he becomes king, Charles will
also become supreme governor of the church.
</P>
<P>
The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, said he was pleased at
Charles and Camilla's decision "to take this important step." After
the civil wedding ceremony, he has agreed to lead a
service "of prayer and dedication" at St. George's Chapel in
Windsor.
</P>
<P>
In a world of expendable relationships, where middle-aged men trade in
middle-aged women for younger, firmer models as easily as they
might dispose of a creaky toaster or last year's car,
the enduring relationship of Charles and Camilla, as the newspapers
call them, carries a sweet poignancy for many.
</P>
<P>
Although in recent years she has had something of an image
makeover, appearing more in couture dresses and less in frumpy
countrywoman garb, Parker Bowles can hardly be called glamorous and
does not appear to care. She once called herself "your
devoted old bag" in a love letter to Prince Charles.
</P>
<P>
Even those unable to forgive Charles for cheating on the late
Princess of Wales can take a certain comfort in knowing
that if he had to do it, at least he
took the counter-intuitive route, choosing someone older, wrinklier and less
svelte than his wife, rather than the other way around.
</P>
<P>
It has always been clear that, unlike many couples who are
actually married, Charles and Camilla truly like each other. They
share a passion for hunting, fishing and other outdoor sports.
They have bawdy senses of humor. More than that, it
seems, the fun-loving Camilla is relatively uncomplicated (at least compared
with Diana) and has been stolidly supportive of Prince Charles
over the years, despite all the angst the relationship has
put her through. The Prince of Wales and Camilla Shand,
as she was then, hit it off from the first
time they met, at a polo match in 1970. But
Charles was something of a playboy, and when he dithered
and went abroad to join the Navy, Camilla married a
longtime suitor, Andrew Parker Bowles. The two remained friends with
the prince. Andrew Parker Bowles even took on the ludicrously
named ceremonial post of Silver Stick in Waiting to the
prince, while his wife took another traditional role -- that
of the prince's mistress.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Charles married Lady Diana Spencer, a coltish 19-year-old who captivated
the world -- but not her husband -- with her
demure good looks and blue-eyed charisma. The two were spectacularly
ill-suited for each other and, sunk by rancor and poor
behavior on both sides, the marriage fell part.
</P>
<P>
Although Charles later said he took up again with Camilla only
when his marriage broke down, Diana claimed that "there were
three people in the marriage, so it was quite crowded."
She reportedly called Camilla "the Rottweiler," while Camilla reportedly referred
to her as "that ridiculous creature."
</P>
<P>
It was Camilla Charles loved, and when he and Diana divorced
in 1996, it seemed that finally the couple could stop
sneaking around. But in the national convulsion of grief following
Diana's horrific death from a car accident in Paris in
1997, public opinion turned viciously against Parker Bowles. At one
point, irate shoppers pelted her with bread rolls in her
local grocery store.
</P>
<P>
It was not until 1999, at a party in Piccadilly, that
the two even appeared publicly together -- an orchestrated event
in which Parker Bowles walked well behind the prince.
</P>
<P>
The two were together on Thursday night at a formal dinner
in Windsor Palace. In contrast to his first post-engagement appearance
with Diana all those years ago, in which he answered
a question about whether he loved her by smirking and
saying "whatever love means," Charles seemed positively ebullient this time
around.
</P>
<P>
Dressed in fuschia and flashing her enormous diamond engagement ring, a
royal heirloom, Parker Bowles had the glow of a teenager
at the prom. "I'm just coming down to earth," she
said.
