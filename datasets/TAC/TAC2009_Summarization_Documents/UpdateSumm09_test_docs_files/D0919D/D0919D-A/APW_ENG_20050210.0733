Many Britons welcomed Prince Charles' surprise announcement that he would marry
his lover Camilla Parker Bowles, but some said she never will win their hearts
the way Princess Diana did.
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of Charles' announcement that the couple will marry at Windsor
Castle on April 8, it was hard to find anyone on the streets of central London
who hadn't heard the news.
</P>
<P>
"We've all been expecting that sooner or later, said Dina Pine, 73, a retired
restaurant owner. "But I don't think she should be queen."
</P>
<P>
"I'm fine with him marrying her. They seem to suit each other," said Bonita
Archibald, 39, a hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
Archibald said Prince Charles should be given the benefit of the doubt in such
decisions, even though he has been known for occasional gaffes. "Charles seems
to have his head screwed on," she said.
</P>
<P>
Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, and other well-known British public
figures, said it's time for the public to forget about royal tragedies of the
past and welcome Camilla into the fold.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, who is divorced from Prince Andrew, Charles' brother, said through a
spokeswoman in the United States that she "is very happy for" for the engaged
couple.
</P>
<P>
Winston Churchill, the grandson of Britain's wartime prime minister of the same
name, said the couple are entitled to be happy together.
</P>
<P>
"They are clearly very much in love. It must be the end of a series of nightmare
years for Camilla, every day reading in the papers about being the mistress this
and that. They are entitled to have their own happiness the same as everyone
else," Churchill told Sky News.
</P>
<P>
Asked how he thought the British public would react, veteran broadcaster Sir
David Frost said: "I think there will be quite a bit of controversy for 24
hours, but then I think everyone will be happy and feel that Prince Charles
deserves his happiness."
</P>
<P>
Charles and Camilla _ divorcees and longtime lovers _ will marry in a civil
ceremony, not in the Church of England, and that Parker Bowles will be called
Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall after the marriage, and called the
princess consort, not the queen, when Charles becomes king.
</P>
<P>
Grocer Phillip Way, 37, said he believes royals such as Prince Charles often
earn too much money from their many estates. But Way said he doesn't care who
Charles marries.
</P>
<P>
"We could have Queen Camilla or the Queen of Sheba, and it would make no
difference to me," he said with a laugh. "Who do you think the best man is going
to be?"
</P>
<P>
Chris Morris, 54, a building engineer, said that he thought Charles was smart to
marry Camilla before becoming king. But whatever happens, Morris said, she will
never be as popular as Princess Diana was.
</P>
<P>
"Diana is still in so many people's hearts," he said. "Queen Camilla wouldn't be
so popular."
</P>
<P>
Charles divorced Diana in 1996, a year before she was killed in a Paris car
crash, and some Britons believe the long-standing Charles-Camilla affair was the
main reason the Charles-Diana marriage fell apart.
</P>
<P>
Joe Stolerman, 17, a student, said that if Camilla ever becomes queen "I'm sure
she won't be well received."
</P>
<P>
Paul Curley, an IT manager, 33, said he doesn't care about the royal family,
adding that "they are more for tourists than for us." But he also said, "It's
not going to be an easy ride for Camilla."
</P>
<P>
Princess Diana's brother Earl Spencer declined to comment on the announcement by
Prince Charles.
</P>
<P>
In Diana's home village near the Spencer family's Althorp estate north of
London, the reaction was mixed.
</P>
<P>
Jacqui Ellard, 33, the landlady of the Brington village pub, the Althorp
Coaching Inn Fox and Hounds, welcomed the news.
</P>
<P>
"They should be allowed to do whatever they want and it is as simple as that. It
is nobody else's business but their own," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Diana was obviously special in many people's hearts for many different reasons,
but I don't think there is strong opinion about Charles and Camilla in the
village," Ellard said.
</P>
<P>
Other villagers disagreed.
</P>
<P>
Retiree Ann Rogers said Prince Charles should abdicate the throne if he wants to
marry Camilla, a divorcee.
</P>
<P>
"I think that Diana was duped into marrying Charles. He didn't really want to
marry her because he already had this relationship with Camilla. That is how I
see it," said Rogers, 60.
