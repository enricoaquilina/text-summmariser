Charles's bride-to-be free to shape her public role after 
wedding

<P>
In opting for the future title of 
Princess Consort, Britain's royal bride-to-be Camilla Parker Bowles 
will be taking on a flexible public role which can be adapted 
according to both circumstances and public opinion, experts said 
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Following her marriage to heir to the throne Prince Charles on 
April 8, the 57-year-old divorcee will officially become Her Royal 
Highness the Duchess of Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
Assuming Charles takes over as monarch from his mother, Queen 
Elizabeth II, Parker Bowles will then assume the specially-coined 
role of Princess Consort, royal officials said in announcing the 
nuptials on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While the British public now largely tolerates the couple's long 
relationship, opinion polls show Parker Bowles remains notably less 
popular than Princess Diana, Charles's ex-wife who died in a Paris 
car crash in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thus, many pundits have pointed out, making Parker Bowles 
Princess of Wales -- Diana's old title -- or queen would risk 
massive public ire.
</P>
<P>
The title of Princess Consort is deliberately vague, experts 
say, allowing Parker Bowles to shape her public role over time, 
something greatly helped by the extreme vagueness of Britain's 
unwritten constitution on such issues.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the monarch and the heir to the throne, "no other 
member of the royal family has any constitutional obligations", said 
Professor Adam Tomkins, a constitutional law expert from Glasgow 
University in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
"Think about the current Duke of Edinburgh, the queen's husband. 
His role is not constitutionally defined, his role is not 
constitutionally required or legally mandated in any way," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These days it looks like one of the considerations that is 
borne in mind when senior members of the royal family have shaped 
their role is public opinion."
</P>
<P>
Public opinion is certainly against a Queen Camilla -- an 
opinion poll in Friday's Daily Telegraph newspaper showed that while 
40 percent of those asked backed the Princess Consort notion, just 
seven percent thought she should be queen, with 47 percent wanting 
no title at all.
</P>
<P>
Royal pundits believe Parker Bowles will initially keep a low 
profile, and gradually build up her place in public life through 
carefully-chosen charitable works and the like.
</P>
<P>
In the Daily Telegraph poll, 57 percent of respondents thought 
Parker Bowles should carry out the normal duties of a monarch's 
wife, whatever her title.
</P>
<P>
Her closest role model is seen as Prince Albert, the husband of 
19th century monarch Queen Victoria, who was made Prince Consort and 
overcame initial public suspicion to become a well-loved figure.
</P>
<P>
Camilla's role was purely a matter for the royal family and 
government, as there were no constitional issues at stake, Tomkins 
said.
</P>
<P>
"Parliament has had the unambiguously clear power since the late 
17th century to legislate on any matter of the crown," he said, 
pointing out that the 1701 Act of Settlement even changed the royal 
succession.
</P>
<P>
"So if parliament can change the identity of the monarch... then 
parliament can certainly decide that we can call her Queen Camilla, 
or parliament can certainly decide that we can call her Mrs Parker 
Bowles," he said.
</P>
<P>
The one sticking point could be opinion in more conservative 
countries from the Commonwealth, the association of former British 
colonies, who might not welcome a twice-married adulterer as their 
de facto queen, Tomkins added.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's extremely unlikely that any constitutional problem 
will arise in Britain as a result of this marriage, but if any 
constitutional problem is going to arise as a result of this 
marriage it is more likely to be a problem for the Commonwealth."
