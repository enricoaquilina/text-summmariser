<P>
The heir to the British throne's 
engagement to his controversial love Camilla Parker Bowles elicited 
Friday a modicum of support both at home and abroad that one pundit 
predicted will increase with time.
</P>
<P>
The British news media, which often runs no-holds barred stories 
on the private life of Prince Charles and his royal relatives, held 
fire for once by praising his plans to remarry on April 8 and saying 
Charles deserved happiness.
</P>
<P>
It is "the right time" for Charles to wed his live-in 
girlfriend, whom he has known for more than 30 years, The Times 
said, praising the "dignity and due care" with which they have acted 
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The coupch, saying that although he jilted their beloved Diana, the 
prince still deserved "sympathy and understanding".
</P>
<P>
Snap polls have shown most Britons were cool or even hostile to 
the marriage plans.
</P>
<P>
However, David Frost, a prominent British broadcaster and 
interviewer, said he shared in the delight friends of Charles had 
for the wedding plans and predicted the public would eventually warm 
to them.
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be quite a bit of controversy for 24 hours 
but then I think everyone will be happy and feel that Prince Charles 
deserves his happiness," Sir David said.
</P>
<P>
The mass-circulation Daily Mirror struck the same note.
</P>
<P>
"Admittedly the Prince of Wales behaved badly to Diana... But in 
that he is no different from thousands upon thousands of men. It 
doesn't make it right or acceptable, but it is not a reason for him 
to spend his life in misery."
</P>
<P>
"Our love for Diana is still strong and will continue. But it is 
time to move on," it added. "Charles has the right to happiness."
</P>
<P>
The Sun, Britain's best-selling daily paper, celebrated that "at 
last, Prince Charles makes an honest woman of Camilla Parker 
Bowles."
</P>
<P>
And it recalled, "it must be remembered that nobody criticized 
Diana when she formed new friendships after her marriage had fallen 
apart" -- a reference to the princess's own romantic affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph also told Britons to "respond with maturity" 
to the announcement and recalled that his sons "Princes William and 
Harry are said to want the couple to be happy."
</P>
<P>
The Daily Express regretted that Parker Bowles and the prince 
had not wed when their romance was kindled in the 1970s, after a 
meeting at a polo match.
</P>
<P>
"If only Charles had been brave enough to go against palace 
wishes 35 years ago and wed the young, single Camilla Shand, whom he 
adored, then Diana may have been spared heartbreak good day to get married."
</P>
<P>
In Australia, people were divided over Prince Charles' plans to 
re-marry, with republicans renewing calls for links to the British 
crown to be severed and loyalists congratulating the heir to the 
throne.
