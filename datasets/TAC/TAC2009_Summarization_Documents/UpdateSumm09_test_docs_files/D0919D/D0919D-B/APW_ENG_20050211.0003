<P>
Thirty years after their first romance, Prince Charles and Camilla Parker
Bowles, both now graying divorcees, will finally wed in a civil ceremony and put
the official seal on a relationship Princess Diana blamed for the breakdown of
her marriage to the man who would be king.
</P>
<P>
In a nod to those who have not warmed to Camilla, the royal family said Thursday
she will never hold the title of Queen. But after the tribulations of a
relationship that has played out over three decades, Charles seemed overjoyed to
be able to take her as his wife.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited," the usually reserved prince said as he entered London's
storied Goldsmith's Hall, home of the gold and silversmiths' guild, and looked
at wedding rings.
</P>
<P>
In their first public appearance together since the announcement, Charles and
Camilla smiled broadly as they walked into a reception at Windsor Castle on
Thursday night, and the guests applauded.
</P>
<P>
A radiant Parker Bowles, wearing a fuchsia gown, showed off her engagement ring
against a black clutch bag. She told the crowd the prince had gone down on one
knee to propose.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just coming down to Earth," she said.
</P>
<P>
The April 8 wedding between the two divorcees will be a civil ceremony at
Windsor Castle, in contrast to the pageantry of Charles' 1981 wedding to Diana
at St. Paul's Cathedral. The divorce issue is a delicate matter for the man who
would be head of the Church of England.
</P>
<P>
The engagement ring Charles, 56, has given his fiancee is a royal family
heirloom, according to the prince's office, Clarence House. The platinum band
has a square-cut central diamond with three diamond baguettes on each side.
Parker Bowles, 57, was to wear it Thursday evening to a dinner at Windsor
Castle.
</P>
<P>
The news of the nuptials was received with warmth in Britain, where public
opinion was once so hostile to Camilla that shoppers pelted her with rolls in a
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
The House of Commons burst into cheers at the news, and ordinary Britons offered
their congratulations. Charles and Diana's sons welcomed the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
"We are both very happy for our father and Camilla, and we wish them all the
luck in the future," Prince William, 22, and Prince Harry, 20, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
One Very Important Person also gave her blessing: Queen Elizabeth II granted the
necessary formal permission for the union. And as mother of the bridegroom said
she and Prince Philip "are very happy that the Prince of Wales and Mrs. Parker
Bowles are to marry."
</P>
<P>
To mark the royal engagement, the queen decided that the Round Tower at Windsor
Castle should be illuminated Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The civil marriage will take place at the castle and will be followed by a
service of prayer and dedication at St. George's Chapel within the castle walls.
Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, spiritual head of the church of
England, will preside, the prince's office at Clarence House
said.
</P>
<P>
Williams said Thursday that the wedding service plans "have my strong support
and are consistent with Church of England guidelines concerning
remarriage."
</P>
<P>
The archbishop's approval and participation could well help allay concerns of
those with questions about the fitness of the divorced Charles to be supreme
governor of church when he becomes king. In general, the Church of England, the
established faith of the nation, disapproves of remarriage of divorced people in
church.
</P>
<P>
There is no Act of Parliament saying the wife of a king should be queen, but it
is a historical convention. Clarence House said there was no legal reason
Charles' second wife could not be queen, and that the decision was made by the
couple.
</P>
<P>
When Charles accedes to the throne, his wife will be known as the HRH _ Her
Royal Highness _ Princess Consort.
</P>
<P>
Prince Charles, in addition to being Prince of Wales, is Duke of Cornwall and
Rothesay. After her marriage, Parker Bowles will not use the title Princess of
Wales, but would like people to call her the Duchess of Cornwall, Clarence House
said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was delighted at the impending marriage. At
his regular meeting with the queen Wednesday night, the two discussed the
wedding plans, and Blair gave her legal advice before she went on to grant the
wedding her royal consent, officials said. They refused to discuss the
advice.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important vote of approval is still pending.
</P>
<P>
The British public who took Princess Diana to their hearts have been divided
about the Camilla-Charles romance. The nation's tabloid press dubbed Parker
Bowles "the other woman" as details of their relationship became public in
1992.
</P>
<P>
But in the years since Diana's 1997 death in a Paris car crash, much of the ill
will against Charles has eased. The warmth of his relationship with his sons has
been seen positively and suggests a warmer character than he is often credited
with.
</P>
<P>
Parker Bowles, who stays well out of the limelight, has won a degree of respect
for her discretion. Many people simply wish them well as a couple whose love has
withstood the test of years of anguish and vilification
</P>
<P>
"They are clearly very much in love. It must be the end of a series of nightmare
years for Camilla. ... They are entitled to have their own happiness the same as
everyone else," Winston Churchill, the grandson of Britain's wartime prime
minister, told Sky News.
</P>
<P>
On the streets of central London, many Britons welcomed the announcement but
said they may never love Camilla as they had Diana.
</P>
<P>
"Diana is still in so many people's hearts," said Chris Morris, 54, a building
engineer. "Queen Camilla wouldn't be so popular."
</P>
<P>
Charles, the queen's eldest son first met Camilla in the early 1970s and they
had a brief romance which ended in late 1972 when the prince was called away on
naval duties. Camilla married Andrew Parker Bowles, a long-standing admirer, in
1973.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the late 1970s Charles and Camilla kept in touch, and they became
close friends again toward the end of the decade. They remained so after
Charles' 1981 marriage to Diana.
</P>
<P>
Diana blamed the friendship for the failure of her marriage to the Prince of
Wales. "There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded," Diana
said in a 1995 TV interview.
</P>
<P>
While the saga of the disintegrating royal marriage played out publicly, Parker
Bowles was often cast as the villain, the object both of invective for being a
"marriage breaker" and of ridicule over tapes of intimate conversations between
her and the prince that emerged in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Prince Charles admitted in a TV documentary that he had strayed from
his marriage vows, but insisted the infidelity happened only after the marriage
was "irretrievably broken down, us both having tried." It was widely assumed,
but never confirmed, that Parker Bowles was the other woman.
</P>
<P>
Charles and Diana divorced in 1996, a year before she was killed. Parker Bowles
obtained her divorce from army officer Andrew Parker Bowles in
1995.
</P>
<P>
In April 1997, Parker Bowles took a tentative step into public life when she
became patron of the National Osteoporosis Society. An official photograph was
released to mark the occasion. In July that year, Charles hosted a party for
Camilla to celebrate her 50th birthday.
</P>
<P>
The couple appeared less frequently in public after Diana's death in August
1997, but in 1999 Camilla met Charles' sons Prince William and Prince Harry for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, she has regularly accompanied Charles to galas and become
accustomed to appearing in front of the media.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a poll indicated that more Britons support Prince Charles marrying
Parker Bowles than oppose it. Thirty-two percent of respondents to the Populus
poll said they would support Charles if he remarried, while 29 percent were
opposed. Thirty-eight percent said they didn't care and 2 percent had no
opinion.
