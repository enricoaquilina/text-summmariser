<P>
Prince Charles may have been unlucky 
in love in the past, but if Hong Kong's famed fortune tellers are 
anything to go by, his marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles will be a 
great success.
</P>
<P>
Chinese soothsayers Friday predicted a happy and long marriage 
for the heir to the British throne, who announced he would wed his 
long-time lover Parker Bowles on April 8.
</P>
<P>
"April 8 will be auspicious for people born in the Year of the 
Rat," feng shui Master Edwin Ma told AFP, referring to Charles' 
Chinese zodiac sign. "It is a good day to get married."
</P>
<P>
Chinese fortune tellers divine the future by consulting ancient 
Chinese almanacs based on astrological observations.
</P>
<P>
They also take into consideration the relative weights of forces 
that Chinese folklore believes emanate from all things, especially 
specific "elements" that are said to dominate different years.
</P>
<P>
In the present Year of the Rooster, the element of metal 
predominates. However, Charles -- a keen believer in mysticism -- 
was born in 1948 under the influence of the element of water. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Bowles was born in 1947, the Year of the Pig, also a 
water sign.
</P>
<P>
"That is good, because the metal element will burn the water," 
Ma explained. "It will bring good fortune in the marriage."
</P>
<P>
Fellow feng shui Master Leung Tin-ming warned however that the 
marriage would not be without its challenges.
</P>
<P>
"As this is their second marriage they will be better at keeping 
it stable ... but in many ways it will not be a normal marriage," 
Yeung told AFP. 
</P>
<P>
"They will be apart for lots of the time and that will put 
stress on the relationship -- and also on Prince Charles' ability to 
carry out his duties."
