Australian republicans boast surge in support following royal wedding news

A group that wants Australia to sever its ties with the British monarchy
reported a surge in new members Friday after Prince Charles said he will marry
longtime companion Camilla Parker Bowles.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Republican Movement (ARM) said its Web site has been overwhelmed
with hundreds of membership applications since news of the April 8 wedding broke
Thursday night Australian time.
</P>
<P>
ARM chairman John Warhurst said the "surge in interest" could not be described
as anti-Parker Bowles, demonized as the mistress whom Princess Diana blamed for
breaking up her marriage with the prince, which ended in divorce in
1996.
</P>
<P>
"There's no anti-Camilla feeling by any means; Charles is the issue for
republicans but she'll come along with the package as the wife of our head of
state," Warhurst said. But it's "Charles, who hasn't been here in 11 years _
that ignites people's republican passions."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard, however, rejected as "silly" the argument that the
marriage will renew calls to change Australia into a republic from a
constitutional monarchy with the British king or queen as its head of state.
Australians voted to retain the monarchy in a 1999 referendum.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's got anything to do with the debate about the constitutional
monarchy," Howard told Nine Network television. "It's about the lives of two
people."
</P>
<P>
"I congratulate them, I wish them well, I think it's sensible and a good thing
that they've decided to marry," he added.
</P>
<P>
A Newspoll survey last month found that 46 percent of Australian adults want a
republic compared to 35 percent who favor maintaining the constitutional
monarchy.
</P>
<P>
Australia became an independent state in 1901. But, like many former outposts of
the British Empire such as Canada, it still recognizes Britain's monarch as head
of state.
</P>
<P>
The queen's representative in Australia is the governor general, a largely
ceremonial role, but one with potentially sweeping powers, including the ability
to dismiss a government and the prime minister _ something that has happened
only once, in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy (ACM) accused the ARM of intruding
"into this happy occasion" to revive interest in their cause.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's Anglican Church welcomed the announcement.
</P>
<P>
"As a church leader, I think it's far better that he should marry and have a
clear married relationship if he is actually living with this person," Bishop of
Christchurch, David Coles, said.
</P>
<P>
Parker Bowles will not accompany the Prince Charles when he departs this month
on a tour of Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, officials
said.
