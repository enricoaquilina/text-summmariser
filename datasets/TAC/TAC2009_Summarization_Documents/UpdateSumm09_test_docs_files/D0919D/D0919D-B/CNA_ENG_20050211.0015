The Times: After 30 years, Charles puts
his affair in order.

The Prince of Wales announced his engagement to Camilla
Parker Bowles yesterday after being warned that he had to
marry her to avoid a looming constitutional crisis. 

The Times has learnt that the Prince was told by his most
senior advisers that, effectively, he must choose between marrying
or banishing his long-term partner. Mrs Parker Bowles agreed to
marriage, but only after being persuaded that the Prince needed
to place his personal affairs on a conventional footing before he
could become King.



Financial Times: Russsia restricts foreign bids.

Russia will bar foreign-owned companies from bidding for the
country's most lucrative natural resources this year in the most
explicit and sweeping manifestation of a nationalistic state policy
developed under the presidency of Vladimir Putin.

The Ministry for Natural Resources said companies would have
to be at least 51 per cent Russian-owned to take part in this year's
tenders for strategic oil and metals deposits. The rule may prevent
oil companies such as ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco from
developing new Russian oil reserves, and also stymie TNK-BP, a
pioneering 50-50 owned Anglo-Russian oil company.
