Prince Charles to Marry Camilla Parker Bowles

<P>
So ends years of tabloid and taxicab speculation.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise announcement, Britain's future king, Prince Charles,
declared Thursday that he would marry his live-in lover, Camilla
Parker Bowles, in a spring ceremony at Windsor Castle.
</P>
<P>
The divorcee will never become Queen Camilla, nor will she take the
title princess of Wales that was bestowed on Diana, her predecessor.
Diana's marriage to Charles ended in divorce, partly because of Parker
Bowles, and she died a year later, along with her boyfriend, in a
Paris car accident.
</P>
<P>
In a sort of constitutional compromise, Parker Bowles, 57, will
receive the title her royal highness the duchess of Cornwall. If
Charles becomes king, she will be called her royal highness the
princess consort. ``Those are the only royal titles that have been
confirmed so far,'' said a representative of the prince of Wales.
</P>
<P>
Charles' great-uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated in 1936 so he
could marry an American divorcee. However, Britain barely batted an
eyelash at the consequence of the prince's impending nuptials.
</P>
<P>
But the newspapers were having a field day. Even the stuffy Times
of London couldn't resist. Its headline read: ``After 30 Years,
Charles Puts His Affair in Order.''
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair wished the couple ``every happiness'' on
behalf of himself and his Cabinet. Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan
Williams, who serves as spiritual leader of the worldwide Anglican
Church, said, ``I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs. Camilla
Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step.''
</P>
<P>
The announcement came in the form of a brief, formal statement from
the prince's household, which read, ``It is with great pleasure that
the marriage of HRH the prince of Wales and Mrs. Camilla Parker Bowles
is announced. It will take place on Friday 8th April, 2005, at Windsor
Castle.''
</P>
<P>
Later, Charles issued a statement that said, ``Mrs. Parker Bowles
and I are absolutely delighted. It will be a very special day for us
and our families.''
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth gave the union her royal blessing. ``The duke of
Edinburgh and I are very happy that the prince of Wales and Mrs.
Parker Bowles are to marry. We have given them our warmest good wishes
for their future together.''
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old prince's two sons by Diana, Prince William and
Prince Harry, announced that they too were delighted at the news of
their father's marriage.
</P>
<P>
Although the marriage will cause little political repercussion
around Britain, the news dominated the airwaves Thursday. Discussions
and surveys showed general acceptance of the marriage but strong
reservations about Charles' new wife becoming ``Queen Camilla.''
</P>
<P>
The memory of Diana is still strong among the British public, which
saw Parker Bowles as the spoiler of what began as a fairy-tale
marriage.
</P>
<P>
Charles and Lady Diana Spencer, a onetime nursery school teacher,
were wed in a lavish, glamorous ceremony in 1981 in London's classic
landmark St. Paul's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
Their marriage was made in tabloid heaven, their every move
scrutinized and documented by eager paparazzi. But it was also marked
by widespread speculation about their apparent unhappiness and by
questions of infidelity.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the tabloid press published a transcript of a taped
explicit phone conversation between Charles and Parker Bowles, then
wife of a British brigadier general.
</P>
<P>
Charles' relationship with Parker Bowles began in 1971 when they
met at a polo match on the grounds of Windsor Castle. They continued
to see each other throughout Charles' tumultuous marriage to Diana,
who said the relationship was the cause of her eventual breakup with
the prince. ``There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit
crowded,'' she said in a TV interview.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, it was clear that Parker Bowles, who married in
1973 and divorced in 1995, shared Charles' sporting life more than
Diana, his junior by 13 years.
</P>
<P>
Since the early days of his marriage, Charles was clearly more at
home on a horse or shooting grouse and fishing for salmon than on a
dance floor, listening to pop music or watching ballet, which were
among Diana's favorite pastimes.
</P>
<P>
Charles and Parker Bowles were often seen fox hunting together or
on the polo field where Charles was a regular player.
</P>
<P>
Charles and Diana divorced in 1996. Diana, as princess of Wales,
found her calling as an active patron of myriad charities,
particularly those supporting sick and disadvantaged children and old
people. She championed AIDS victims and traveled to war-torn and
poverty-stricken countries, visiting orphanages and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Her sudden death in a car accident in August 1997 in Paris, along
with boyfriend Dodi Fayed, provoked an outpouring of grief in Britain
and abroad, forcing Charles and Parker Bowles to keep their
relationship in the background for some time.
</P>
<P>
Gradually the couple began appearing together in public in
carefully choreographed occasions. Many see their decision to marry as
the logical conclusion to a difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
``I don't think the public is hostile to the remarriage,'' said
Sarah Richardson, a constitutional historian at Warwick University.
``What does surprise me is the recognition of her role as princess
consort, which will put her in a spotlight where she will have to
deliver and be an active supporter of Charles almost on a par with
Diana.''
</P>
<P>
Relief rather than pleasure was expressed by many Britons
interviewed Thursday by TV networks.
</P>
<P>
``I guess it was better that they got married rather than not,''
said Marianne McElwee, 24, a Web site manager.
</P>
<P>
``I'm not keen on her,'' McElwee added. ``After all, Charles was
always in a relationship with her before he met Diana and he went on
seeing her after that, which didn't make Diana very happy.''
</P>
<P>
``I think it was inevitable, but I feel saddened,'' marketing
consultant David Pickering, 44, told the British Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
Although the acceptance of a king-to-be, himself divorced, with a
divorcee wife, is indicative of the changing face of Britain, the
announcement also forces official recognition of the flawed and human
side of royalty.
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Williams said Thursday on TV broadcasts, ``These
arrangements have my strong support and are consistent with Church of
England guidelines concerning remarriage, which the Prince of Wales
fully accepts as a committed Anglican and as prospective Supreme
Governor of the Church of England.''
</P>
<P>
The monarch of Britain is also the recognized head of the Church of
England; Defender of the Faith is one of the many royal titles. It had
been considered unsuitable for kings and queens to marry divorced
partners.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, however, a slow change has come over the royal
family as one by one, Queen Elizabeth's daughter and two of her sons
went through divorce.
</P>
<P>
``This wedding is a pragmatic response and reflection of the fact
that Charles is in this long-term relationship and it would be more
difficult and embarrassing for him to carry on with it than to get
married,'' said historian Richardson.
</P>
<P>
Royal marriages must be approved on several levels, so Blair's
statement of approval was essential. Charles also will require an Act
of Parliament before his wedding day, a foregone conclusion in this
case.
