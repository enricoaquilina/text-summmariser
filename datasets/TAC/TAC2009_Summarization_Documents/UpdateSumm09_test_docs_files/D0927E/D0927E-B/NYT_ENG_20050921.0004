Peter Jennings, the ABC News anchor who died
last month, was recalled as a devoted father, hard-driving journalist
and a man who befriended homeless people, during a service
at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday. The service was sprinkled with
reflections from Jennings' colleagues at ABC, his two children and
friends, like the actor Alan Alda. Because Jennings was a
music lover, there was music, too, with selections that included
bagpipers escorted by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
Wynton Marsalis on trumpet and a cello solo by Yo-Yo
Ma.

"We're left now with just a little bit of snow at
the bottom of the screen," Alda said in describing Jennings
as irreplaceable. He was a "truly authentic" person who conveyed
his mix of graciousness, candor and concern to the millions
who watched him as anchor of "World News Tonight," Alda
said.
</P>
<P>
He never left Jennings' home without a book in tow, Alda
recalled, and Jennings -- a Canadian who became a U.S.
citizen -- always carried a copy of the Constitution. Others
recalled Jennings' fondness for canoeing, his way of putting people
at ease and his heart-on-his-sleeve sentimentality. He was, they said,
a friend who stuck around for life's inevitable heartbreaks.

<P>
"He never, ever let us down," said Charles Glass, a journalist
who helped Jennings cover the Arab-Israeli war for ABC.
</P>
<P>
With lines stretching around the block, the two-hour service attracted ordinary
people paying their respects, ABC and Walt Disney Co. executives
and colleagues who included Ted Koppel, Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer,
Larry King, Jon Stewart and Katie Couric. Mayor Michael R.
Bloomberg and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani also attended, as
did Al Sharpton.

<P>
Photographs of Jennings, often with friends or with his children, Christopher
and Elizabeth Jennings, were flashed on a big screen in
the cavernous Stern Auditorium. Jennings, one of the most recognizable
journalists on American television, died on Aug. 7 from lung
cancer. He was 67 years old.

<P>
Koppel drew laughter throughout his remarks. He facetiously announced that he
was not gay, but then said that during their 41-year
friendship he was keenly aware of his friend's extraordinary charisma.
"I felt a thrill whenever I saw him," he said.
He continued: "Peter was notoriously attractive to women. Even so,
he only married four of them."
</P>
<P>
Robert A. Iger, president of the Walt Disney Co., remembered Jennings'
"uncanny ability to entertain and to inform," as the primary
face of ABC during significant world events. At the same
time, during a recent lunch, Jennings agreed with him that
nothing was more satisfying than seeing their children grow up,
Iger said.
</P>
<P>
Tom Nagorski, the producer of "World News Tonight," said Jennings' former
staffers now wear plastic blue bracelets that say, "What would
Peter do?" Jennings was forever arranging and rearranging his staff's
personal and professional lives, he said. He even chided Nagorski,
then the foreign editor, for planning his wedding at the
same time as the elections in South Africa. Then, with
characteristic good cheer, Jennings offered to help with wedding plans,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Jennings' widow, Kayce Freed, has been stopped in recent weeks by
numerous homeless people offering their condolences, said Mary Brosnahan Sullivan,
executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless. For the
homeless, Jennings delivered meals, inquired about their lives and donated
money to organizations, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Jennings said his father integrated his children into his world,
taking them to his office and on assignment, soliciting their
viewpoints. Jennings was often described as cosmopolitan, he said, but
he was also a man who always cherished "the ability
to be awed."
