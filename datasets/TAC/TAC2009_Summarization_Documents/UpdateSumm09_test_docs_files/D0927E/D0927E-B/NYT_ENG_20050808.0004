PETER JENNINGS, ABC NEWS ANCHOR, DIES AT 67

<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Jennings, a high school dropout from Canada
who transformed himself into one of the most urbane, well-traveled
and recognizable journalists on American television, died Sunday. He was
67 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
The cause of death was lung cancer, said Charles Gibson, who
announced the death of his colleague on television in a
special report just after 11:30 p.m. Jennings had disclosed that
he was suffering from lung cancer on April 5, first
in a written statement released by ABC and later that
night on "World News Tonight," the evening news broadcast that
he had led since September 1983.
</P>
<P>
In brief remarks at the end of that night's program, Jennings,
his voice scratchy, told viewers that he hoped to return
to the anchor desk as his health and strength permitted.
But he never did.
</P>
<P>
It was a jarring departure for someone who for so long
had been such a visible fixture in so many American
homes each night. Along with the two other pillars of
the so-called "Big 3" -- Tom Brokaw of NBC and
Dan Rather of CBS -- Jennings had, in the early
1980s, ushered in the era of the television news anchor
as lavishly compensated, globe-trotting superstar. After the departure of Brokaw
from his anchor chair in December, followed by Rather's retirement
from the evening news in March, Jennings' death brings that
era to a close.
</P>
<P>
For more than two decades, the magnitude of a news event
could be measured, at least in part, by whether Jennings
and his counterparts on the other two networks showed up
on the scene. Indeed, they logged so many miles over
so many years in so many trench coats and flak
jackets that they effectively acted as bookends on some of
the biggest running stories of modern times.
</P>
<P>
Jennings' official ABC biography notes, for example, that as a foreign
correspondent, he was "in Berlin in the 1960s when the
Berlin Wall was going up," and there again, as an
anchor, "in the 1990s when it came down." Similarly, he
was on the ground in Gdansk, Poland, for the birth
of the Solidarity labor and political movement, and later for
the overthrow of the country's communist government.
</P>
<P>
In addition to every major world capital and war zone, Jennings
also reported from all 50 states, according to the network.
He seemed to draw on that collective experience -- as
well as his practiced ability to calmly describe events as
they unfolded live -- not long after two hijacked planes
struck the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. Over
the course of that day, and those that immediately followed,
he would spend more than 60 hours on the air
in what Tom Shales of The Washington Post, among other
critics, praised as a tour de force of interviewing and
explanatory broadcast journalism laced with undisguised bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
"This is what it looked like moments ago," Jennings said at
one point that first morning, as he introduced a piece
of videotape recorded moments earlier in Lower Manhattan. "My God!
The southern tower, 10:00 Eastern time this morning, just collapsing
on itself. This is a place where thousands of people
worked. We have no idea what caused this."
</P>
<P>
The coverage of all three broadcast networks that week underscored a
maxim of the television news business: that however much the
audience of the evening news programs may have eroded in
recent years, viewers usually return during moments of crisis.
</P>
<P>
At the peak of his broadcast's popularity, in the 1992-93 television
season, Jennings drew an average audience of nearly 14 million
people each night, according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
He reached that milestone midway through an eight-year ratings winning streak,
during which his audience sometimes exceeded those of both Brokaw
and Rather by 2 million or more viewers. (For nearly
a decade since, to his periodic frustration, his broadcast had
lagged behind that of NBC's, even after Brokaw yielded to
Brian Williams in December.)
</P>
<P>
Though the audience for the evening news has fallen precipitously in
recent years -- a casualty of changes in people's schedules
and the competition offered by the cable news networks and
the Internet -- Jennings' broadcast (and those on CBS and
NBC) still drew a combined audience of more than 25
million viewers this past year.
</P>
<P>
And however much his audience had aged -- the median age
of a Jennings viewer this past season was about 60,
according to Nielsen -- advertisers still spend in excess of
$100 million annually on each of the evening news programs.
Like Brokaw, Rather and now Williams, Jennings was well paid
for his efforts: he earned an estimated $10 million a
year in recent years.
</P>
<P>
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
His most recent contract with the network was due to expire
later this year, but at least until he took ill,
the network was preparing to extend Jennings' time in the
anchor chair for "several years to come," according to David
Westin, president of ABC News.
</P>
<P>
Jennings' broadcast training had begun at an astonishingly young age, a
function at least partly of his pedigree. Peter Charles Jennings
was born July 29, 1938, in Toronto. His father, Charles,
was a senior executive of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and
a pioneer in Canadian radio news.
</P>
<P>
In "The Century" (Doubleday, 1998), one of two coffee-table-worthy history books
that he cowrote with Todd Brewster, Jennings recalled an early
exercise that his father put him through in an effort
to sharpen his powers of observation. "Describe the sky," his
father had said. After the young boy had done so,
his father dispatched him outside again. "Now, go out and
slice it into pieces and describe each piece as different
from the next."
</P>
<P>
By age 9, he had his own show on Canadian radio,
"Peter's Program." He dropped out of high school at 17,
and by his early 20s was the host of a
dance show similar to "American Bandstand" called "Club Thirteen."
</P>
<P>
His rise to the pinnacle of Canadian television news, and later
its far larger counterpart to the south, was swift. In
1962, at age 24, he was named co-anchor of the
national newscast on CTV, a competitor of his father's network,
a job that he held until 1964.
</P>
<P>
That year, he moved to the United States to begin work
as a correspondent for ABC. Barely a year later, the
network named him an anchor of "ABC Evening News," then
a 15-minute newscast, which put him -- at age 26
-- head-to-head with Walter Cronkite on CBS and the formidable
tandem of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley on NBC. Though
he would serve ABC in that capacity for nearly three
years, Jennings said in an interview last year that he
was ill-suited for the job and unhappy in it.
</P>
<P>
"I had the good sense to quit," he said.
</P>
<P>
What followed was more than a decade of postings abroad as
a foreign correspondent for ABC, during which, Jennings said last
year, he got an on-the-job introduction to the world with
a tuition bill effectively footed by his employer.
</P>
<P>
"I have no formal education to speak of," Jennings said. "ABC
has been my education and provided my education. ABC has
enabled me to work everywhere in the world and has
ended up paying me beyond handsomely."
</P>
<P>
From 1968 to 1978, Jennings traveled extensively, including to Vietnam, Munich,
Germany (where he covered the hostage-taking at the 1972 Summer
Olympics), and Beirut, Lebanon (where he established the network's first
news bureau in the Arab world.)
</P>
<P>
In 1978, he began his second tour as an anchor for
the network, serving as one of three hosts of "World
News Tonight," along with Frank Reynolds and Max Robinson, in
a format devised by Roone Arledge, the legendary sports programmer
who had added the news division to his portfolio. Jennings
was the program's foreign anchor, and reported from London until
1983.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after Reynolds died following a battle with bone cancer,
Jennings was named the sole anchor (and managing editor) of
the broadcast, titles that Mr. Jennings continued to hold at
his death.
</P>
<P>
As an anchor, Jennings presented himself as a worldly alternative to
Brokaw's plain-spoken Midwestern manner and Mr. Rather's folksy, if at
times offbeat, Southern charm. He neither spoke like many of
his viewers ("about" came out of his mouth as a-BOOT,
a remnant of his Canadian roots) nor looked like them,
with a matinee-idol face and crisply tailored wardrobe that were
frequently likened in print to those of James Bond.
</P>
<P>
Though his bearing could be stiff on the air (and his
syntax so simplistic at times as to border on patronizing),
Jennings was immensely popular with his audience.
</P>
<P>
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
During a trip last fall through Kansas, Pennsylvania and Ohio in
the weeks before the presidential election, he traveled at times
aboard a coach customized by the news division to trumpet
its campaign coverage and frequently received a rock star's welcome
when he decamped.
</P>
<P>
For example, in the parking lot of a deli just outside
of Pittsburgh, where he had come to interview a long-shot
candidate for Congress whose threadbare headquarters was upstairs, Jennings found
himself on the receiving end of several hugs from loyal
viewers.
</P>
<P>
"He's so handsome," one of those viewers, Vilma Berryman, 66, the
deli owner, observed immediately after meeting him. "He's taller than
I thought. He speaks so softly."
</P>
<P>
Like all of the Big 3, Jennings was not without his
detractors. Among his critics were those who contended he was
too soft on the air when describing the Palestinian cause
or the regime of the Cuban leader Fidel Castro --
accusations he disputed. Similarly, an article published in July 2004
in the National Review portrayed him as a thinly veiled
opponent of the American war in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The article quoted Jennings as saying: "That is simply not the
way I think of this role. This role is designed
to question the behavior of government officials on behalf of
the public."
</P>
<P>
Jennings was conscious of having been imbued, during his Canadian boyhood,
with a skepticism about American behavior; at least partly as
a result, he often delighted in presenting the opinions of
those in the minority, whatever the situation.
</P>
<P>
And yet, he simultaneously carried on an elaborate love affair with
America, one that reached its apex in the summer of
2003, when he announced that he had become an American
citizen, scoring, he said proudly, 100 percent on his citizenship
test.
</P>
<P>
In a toast around that time that he gave at the
new National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, he described his adopted
home as "this brash and noble container of dreams, this
muse to artists and inventors and entrepreneurs, this beacon of
optimism, this dynamo of energy, this trumpet blare of liberty."
</P>
<P>
Jennings' personal life was at times grist for the gossip pages,
including his three divorces. His third wife, the author Kati
Marton, whom he married in 1979 and divorced in 1993,
is the mother of his two children, who survive him.
They are a daughter, Elizabeth, and son, Christopher. He is
also survived by his fourth wife, Kayce Freed, a former
ABC television producer whom he married in December 1997. Having
prided himself on rarely taking a sick day in nearly
40 years -- and being dismissive, at times, of those
high-paid colleagues who did -- Jennings had missed the broadcast
and the newsroom terribly in recent months.
</P>
<P>
In a letter posted on April 29 on the ABC news
Web site, excerpts of which were read on that night's
evening news, Jennings described how treatments for his cancer had
proven more debilitating than he had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday I decided to go to the office," he wrote. "I
live only a few blocks away. I got as far
as the door. Chemo strikes."
</P>
<P>
"Do I detect a knowing but sympathetic smile on many of
your faces?" he added.
</P>
<P>
About a month later, Jennings did make a rare visit to
the ABC News headquarters on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan. With a gray sweater draped over his shoulders, and
his feet clad in thick wool socks and moccasins, Jennings
held court for about a half-hour late one morning from
his desk, in what is known as "the rim," a
newsroom one floor below the "World News Tonight" studio.
</P>
<P>
His voice soft and his body as much as 20 pounds
lighter than usual, Jennings told several dozen staff members who
had gathered around his desk about the doctors and other
patients he had been meeting and of a first-time radiation
treatment that he had just received, according to one veteran
correspondent who did not wish to be identified so as
not to offend Jennings' family.
</P>
<P>
Jennings brought himself and many of his colleagues to tears when
he turned to Charles Gibson, one of his two principal
substitutes on the program, and thanked him for closing each
night's broadcast with the phrase, "for Peter Jennings and all
of us at ABC News." Jennings then put his hand
over his heart and said, "That means so much to
me," according to his colleague.
</P>
<P>
But whatever maudlin feelings were in the air quickly evaporated, Jennings'
longtime colleague recounted, when the anchor brandished a familiar black
calligraphy pen and began marking up the rundown for that
night's broadcast. "No, that's not a good one," he could
be overheard telling Jonathan Banner, the program's executive producer, about
one segment. Of another, he added, "You want to move
this higher up."
</P>
<P>
For his closest colleagues, the reassuring sight of the anchor-as-editor provided
a fleeting moment of normalcy in what had been a
disorienting and heartbreaking few months.
