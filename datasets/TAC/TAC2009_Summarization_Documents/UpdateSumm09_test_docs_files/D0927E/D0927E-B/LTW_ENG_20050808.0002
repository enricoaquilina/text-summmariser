ABC Anchorman Peter Jennings Dies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Jennings, the urbane anchorman of ABC's evening newscast for
the past 22 years, died Sunday, it was announced by his network. He
was 67.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that he had died at his home in New York.
</P>
<P>
Jennings had not been on the air since April 5 when he revealed he
had lung cancer. He had been conspicuously absent from the coverage of
Pope John Paul II's funeral in Rome. A smoker until about 20 years
ago, he said he relapsed under the pressure of Sept. 11, 2001 but
later quit again.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian-born Jennings was a familiar face in millions of
households for more than 40 years. His well-rounded tones, world-savvy
air and matter-of-fact delivery led ``World News Tonight'' to the top
of the ratings for 11 of the past 20 years, even as all the networks
lost huge numbers of viewers to cable television, to the Internet and
to the longer workdays and busier lives of those who used to watch the
news over the family dinner.
</P>
<P>
Jennings ranged the world as a reporter and anchorman, specializing
in the Middle East long before many domestic viewers knew much more
about the region than the location of Jerusalem and the movie
``Lawrence of Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
He was at the Summer Olympic Games in Munich Sept. 5, 1972 when
Arab terrorists seized and killed Israeli athletes. Familiar with the
history and goals of the Black September terrorist group, Jennings
filed a series of reports, and moved his camera crew close enough to
get clear pictures of the terrorists, which ``displayed considerable
moxie,'' wrote Barbara Matusow in ``The Evening Stars: The Making of
the Network News Anchor.'' She called it ``among the most gripping
episodes ever shown on live television.''
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine years later, Jennings was on the air within minutes
after two airliners crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11,
2001, and stayed on the air for more than 12 consecutive hours, and
for 60 hours that first week, ABC News said in its biography of the
anchor. His steadiness and ``Herculean'' work during that period was
widely praised.
</P>
<P>
``We watched Peter Jennings' beard grow, and we were somehow
reassured that he did not shave, that through morning, afternoon,
evening and on into the night, he did not leave the desk, that he
confided in us his uncertainties, that he shared the confusions of
each hour,'' Washington Post columnist Marc Fisher wrote. ``He grew
more pale and more vulnerable, as if he knew that we needed him to be
human, so that we could be together.''
</P>
<P>
During that devastating day, as all activity stopped and Americans
remained glued to their televisions, Jennings' trademark cool warmed
as he faltered just a bit.
</P>
<P>
``We do not very often make recommendations for people's behavior
from this chair,'' he told viewers, ``but as (one ABC News
correspondent) was talking, I checked in with my children, and it --
who were deeply stressed, as I think young people are across the
United States. So, if you're a parent, you've got a kid'' -- he paused
and smiled awkwardly -- ``in some other part of the country, call them
up. Exchange observations.''
</P>
<P>
He became a citizen of the United States in 2003, 39 years after he
left Canada. ``There's no explaining the timing,'' he told USA Today.
``Did 9/11 make a difference? Yes, it did make a difference. Did
working on (his book) 'In Search of America' for the last several
years, which kept me on the road a lot and dealing with both
contemporary and historic national issues -- about which I felt very
deeply? That made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
His death marked a year in which the evening anchors of all three
major broadcast networks left the anchor's chair. NBC's Tom Brokaw
retired in December 2004, and CBS' Dan Rather stepped down from the
anchor's job in March 2005.
</P>
<P>
Born in Toronto, the son of pioneering Canadian broadcaster Charles
Jennings, an 11-year-old Peter Jennings first broadcast ``Peter's
People,'' a radio show for children. He dropped out of high school,
worked briefly in a bank and then entered broadcasting. He became a
radio news reporter in Brockton, Ontario and worked briefly for the
Canadian Broadcasting Corp. before switching to co-anchor CTV National
News at Canada's first privately owned network in 1962. While covering
the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, Jennings
attracted the attention of the then-president of ABC, Elmer W. Lower,
who offered him a job. Jennings turned it down but three months later
reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
Based in New York City, he was immediately seen as a rising star. A
year later, at age 26, he was named co-anchor and then sole anchor of
ABC Evening News' 15-minute broadcast. His inexperience showed,
especially in comparison to veteran competitors Walter Cronkite at CBS
and Chet Huntley and David Brinkley on NBC. Widely derided as a
``glamorcaster'' and ``anchorboy,'' Jennings was ridiculed for his
Anglicized diction and ignorance of American history and culture.
After three years, he returned to the ranks of domestic news
correspondents.
</P>
<P>
He was sent to the Middle East in 1969 to establish the first
American television news bureau in the Arab world, and there he found
his niche. For seven years, based in Beirut, he traveled to virtually
every Arab country and built a store of knowledge he would draw upon
for years. His reporting during the 1973 Israeli-Arab war earned the
respect of viewers. He conducted the first television interview with
Palestine Liberation Organization's Yasser Arafat, and his 1974
profile of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat won his first George Foster
Peabody award. He was the first U.S. reporter to interview the Iranian
Ayatollah Khomeini, then in exile in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Jennings returned to the U.S. in 1975 as Washington correspondent
and news reader for the predecessor to Good Morning America. After 10
months, he was reassigned overseas as chief foreign correspondent,
based in London.
</P>
<P>
ABC executive Roone Arledge then created a three-anchor broadcast,
with Frank Reynolds in Washington, Max Robinson in Chicago and
Jennings in London. In 1983, after Reynolds died of cancer, Jennings
was called back to the U.S. to retrieve his role as ABC's sole
anchorman.
</P>
<P>
His years at the helm were not without glitches. He, along with the
other major networks, prematurely and erroneously reported that
Democratic nominee Al Gore won Florida in the 2000 presidential
election. Jennings was frequently accused of liberal bias by
conservative media watchdog organizations, and pro-Palestinian bias by
Israeli partisans. A 2004 commentary in a journalism trade magazine,
the Columbia Journalism Review, dismissed criticism that ABC's
newscast was ``anti-war,'' noting that ``despite the pressure to be a
cheerleader, World News Tonight with Peter Jennings was more probing
during the war than its rivals. The center's anti-war label is looking
like ABC's red badge of courage.''
</P>
<P>
Washington Post television critic Tom Shales, who is no fan of
Jennings, in 1994 praised his special on the Bosnian war, writing,
``You have to hand it to Peter Jennings. He has managed to maintain
his dignity and his stature even as network news has grown
increasingly tabloidian all around him. He has stayed above the fray,
and as frays go, this one is particularly unsavory... It isn't lurid
or sexy and it probably won't get big ratings, but it's the kind of
thing a network news division ought to be doing just for the sake of
doing it.... It could easily be argued that CBS News remembers (Edward
R.) Murrow in words, whereas ABC News remembers him in deeds -- deeds
like tonight's Jennings report.''
</P>
<P>
Five times he was named the country's best anchorman in a poll of
readers of another trade magazine, Washington Journalism Review. He
won Harvard University's Goldsmith Career Award for excellence in
journalism and the Radio and Television News Directors Paul White
Award, chosen by the news directors of all three major networks.
``World News Tonight'' was honored with the Edward R. Murrow award for
best national newscast in 2004. He won 14 national Emmys, two George
Foster Peabody awards, several Overseas Press Club awards and several
Alfred I duPont Columbia University Awards for journalism.
</P>
<P>
In addition to anchoring, he covered issues in depth on hour-long
primetime specials, called ``Peter Jennings Reporting.'' Begun in
1990, the show ranged from historic issues such as the Kennedy
assassination to religious controversies to the crisis in arts funding
to a chronicle of the bombers of Oklahoma City, as well as
international crises. He anchored live news specials for children, and
co-wrote ``The Century'' (1998) with Todd Brewster, which later became
a 12-hour ABC series. He and Brewster also collaborated on ``In Search
of America'' (2002).
</P>
<P>
His marriages to Valerie Godsoe, Annie Malouf and Kati Marton ended
in divorce.
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Kayce Freed of New York City; and two
children from his third marriage, Elizabeth and Christopher.
