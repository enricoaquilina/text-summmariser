Longtime ABC Anchor Peter Jennings, 67, Dies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Jennings, a Canadian-born high school dropout who became the
face of ABC News and a household name in the United States, died of
lung cancer Sunday at his home in New York. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
ABC News announced his death Sunday night and released a statement
from his wife Kayce Freed, his 25-year-old daughter Elizabeth Jennings
and his 23-year-old son Christopher Jennings.
</P>
<P>
``Peter died with his family around him, without pain and in
peace,'' it read. ``He knew he'd lived a good life.''
</P>
<P>
His death was met with grief at ABC, where he functioned as both
the public face and behind-the-scenes manager of ``World News
Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
ABC News President David Westin called the 41-year ABC veteran --
known for his urbane demeanor and driven perfectionism -- ``our
colleague, our friend, and our leader,'' adding: ``None of us will be
the same without him.''
</P>
<P>
Westin said Jennings had faced his fight against lung cancer ``with
realism, courage, and a firm hope that he would be one of the
fortunate ones.''
</P>
<P>
``In the end, he was not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in U.S. men and
women, accounting for 163,510 deaths this year. Most cases of lung
cancer are directly attributable to smoking.
</P>
<P>
A lung cancer diagnosis presents a poor prognosis, with a one-year
survival rate of only 42 percent and a five-year rate of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jennings' death comes as a bitter bookend to a decades-long era in
television news dominated by three well-known figures: the longtime
ABC newsman, CBS' Dan Rather and NBC's Tom Brokaw. Brokaw retired in
December, and Rather stepped down from the evening news in March.
</P>
<P>
A longtime smoker, Jennings first announced his diagnosis April 5,
when he said he would begin chemotherapy treatment.
</P>
<P>
In a poignant taped message that aired on ``World News Tonight,''
Jennings -- his voice already hoarse and raw -- said he had quit
smoking 20 year ago but was ``weak'' and took it up again after the
Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He pledged to continue to anchor ``World News
Tonight'' on ``good days.''
</P>
<P>
That was his last time on the air. In his absence, ``Good Morning
America'' co-host Charles Gibson and ``20/20'' co-anchor Elizabeth
Vargas, among others, have filled in for him.
</P>
<P>
During his four decades at ABC -- especially his last 22 as anchor
-- Jennings developed a reputation for rigorous standards and a
devotion to substantive stories, especially international affairs. As
managing editor of ``World News Tonight,'' he combed over every script
that went on the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
``Peter was a real guardian at the gate,'' said Judy Muller, a
contributing ABC correspondent and an assistant professor at the
University of Southern California. ``He was so committed to the
integrity of news.''
</P>
<P>
Peter Charles Archibald Ewart Jennings was born on July 29, 1938,
in Toronto. He spent most of his childhood in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
He gained his passion for broadcast news from his father, Charles
Jennings, who was the first person to anchor a nightly national news
program in Canada and became head of the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation's news division.
</P>
<P>
Jennings once referred him as his ``only hero.''
</P>
<P>
At age 9, Jennings was already hosting a weekly children's show
called ``Peter's People'' on CBC radio, reading letters from children
on the air. But he was unenthusiastic about school and dropped out of
high school in the 10th grade.
</P>
<P>
He quickly made his way in broadcasting, working for a small radio
station in Brockville, Ontario, and then landing a job as the host of
a CBC public affairs show in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
At age 24, he was already co-anchoring Canada's first private
network newscast and was spotted by an ABC correspondent covering a
NATO meeting. ABC recruited the young anchor in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Impressed with his good looks and poise, the network thrust him
briefly into the anchor chair, but the 26-year-old proved to be too
green for the post.
</P>
<P>
In 1967, he began his career as a foreign correspondent, opening
the network's bureau in Beirut, Lebanon. He rapidly made his mark in
covering hot spots around the world. He was in Munich, Germany, in
1972 when Arab terrorists took Israeli athletes hostage at the
Olympics. He covered the battle over apartheid in South Africa and was
in Berlin to report on the Berlin Wall coming down.
</P>
<P>
Jennings became ABC's chief foreign correspondent and was based in
London when the network asked him to return to the anchor desk as part
of a three-person team, with Frank Reynolds based in Washington and
Max Robinson in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
When Reynolds died of cancer in 1983, Jennings took over as the
only anchor. He helped power ABC to the top of the ratings for a
decade, winning over viewers with his witty, sophisticated manner. He
continued to travel extensively to cover stories, and was most
recently in Iraq in January to report on the elections there.
</P>
<P>
``He was a person with an enormous amount of experience and
self-confidence -- and a presence,'' said Richard Wald, a former ABC
News executive. ``That's all you can say about him. He had it, he
always did.''
</P>
<P>
Aside from his wife and children, he is survived by his sister
Sarah Jennings.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word on services.
