Peter Jennings' four-decade career as a network
television reporter and anchor made him a national media star, but
those who knew the ABC newsman best remembered him Tuesday in deeply
personal terms, recalling the ``goofy'' father who loved to dance the
jitterbug while cooking and the man of quiet generosity who took a
personal interest in the homeless living in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
A two-hour memorial service, held at Carnegie Hall a little more
than a month after the 67-year-old anchor died of lung cancer, focused
less on his work as a broadcast journalist and more on recollections
of his private life by family, friends and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
``He was often described as cosmopolitan, but I think my father
valued awe over sophistication,'' said Christopher Jennings, his
23-year-old son, noting his love of canoe trips and his fierce
devotion to his family.
</P>
<P>
``The slightest achievement by his children -- or even his dog --
could wet his eyes,'' he said. ``My father gave love in earnest.''
</P>
<P>
``Each day is, above all else, a day without him,'' his son added.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 people filled the gilded auditorium for the emotional
celebration of Jennings' life, including nearly all of the top
television network executives and journalists: NBC anchor Brian
Williams, ``Today'' co-hosts Katie Couric and Matt Lauer, former CBS
anchor Dan Rather, current CBS anchor Bob Schieffer, ``Good Morning
America'' co-hosts Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer, Fox News host Bill
O'Reilly, CNN anchor Aaron Brown and PBS interviewer Charlie Rose.
(Former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw was caring for his mother in California
and could not attend.) New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg attended, ,
as did his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and the Rev. Al Sharpton.
Performers included cellist Yo-Yo Ma and jazz trumpeter Wynton
Marsalis.

<P>
``From the time I first met Peter 41 years ago until our last
meeting a few weeks ago, I felt a thrill whenever I saw him,'' said
Ted Koppel, host of ABC's ``Nightline.'' ``Not many people have
genuine charisma, that kind of animal magnetism that makes it
difficult to focus on anyone else in the room. Peter had that.''
</P>
<P>
Jennings' death on Aug. 7, just four months after he had announced
his diagnosis, has been a major blow to ABC. The network has not
settled on who will replace him as anchor of ``World News Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
Robert Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Co., ABC's parent
corporation, said the company owed Jennings ``an extraordinary debt of
gratitude'' for his work, adding how difficult it was to accept his
death.
</P>
<P>
``When you know someone of Peter's dynamism and presence, you
simply think they will always be there,'' Iger said at the memorial.
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, speakers took note of their private loss. A
montage of photos projected on the back of the stage throughout the
service depicted Jennings' off-air life: bicycling and hanging off the
side of a sailboat, embracing his children and walking arm in arm with
his wife, Kayce Freed. In the images, Jennings looked tan and healthy,
squinting into the sun with a contented smile.
</P>
<P>
Actor Alan Alda said Jennings was simply ``authentic.'' He recalled
how the anchor would insist on staying to help wash dishes after
dinner parties and how he always gave him a book to read after visits,
most recently a copy of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
``There's a vacancy now that no president can fill, no power on
Earth can fill,'' Alda said. ``Others will step in and fill in his
shoes excellently. But no one can replace the unique presence that was
Peter.''
</P>
<P>
Mary Brosnahan Sullivan, executive director of the Coalition for
the Homeless, said a number of homeless people who live in the park
across from Jennings' Manhattan apartment approached his widow, Kayce,
after he died, offering their condolences and noting how he frequently
took the time to speak with them. Jennings often volunteered to
distribute meals to the homeless around the city, she said, and would
engage in long conversations with the people he met.
</P>
<P>
``Maybe today,'' she said, ``we can try to see the world the way
Peter saw it.''
</P>
<P>
Jennings' 25-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, spoke last, telling the
tearful audience: ``Without him, I find myself stumbling and in the
dark. ... Loving him so much and not having him with me is the hardest
thing I've ever done.''
