Jennings Brought Reportorial Experience to Anchor Post
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Jennings' untimely death Sunday put a period to the era in
which network anchors derived their ``authority'' from journalistic
experience, as well as on-camera presence.
</P>
<P>
If television viewers are unlikely to see his equal again, it has
less to do with Jennings' unique personal qualities -- formidable as
they were -- than with the melancholy state of the three broadcast
networks' news operations. Years of shortsighted and unremitting
cost-cutting by their corporate proprietors have made them shells of
what they once were. Among the network and cable news divisions, only
CNN maintains anything like a full-service foreign reporting
operation; increasingly, even the others' commitment to comprehensive
domestic coverage is withering.
</P>
<P>
So if ABC wanted to cultivate another Jennings -- someone with a
sophisticated reportorial background and an engaging broadcast persona
-- it simply lacks the organizational ability to do it.
</P>
<P>
In 1965, for example, when the then-26-year-old Jennings had a
disastrous first go at anchoring ABC's nightly newscast, he described
himself as ``simply unqualified.'' To remedy that, he spent more than
a decade reporting from ABC bureaus in the Middle East and Europe. By
the time he was named as one of three co-anchors of the network's
``World News Tonight'' in 1978, he was ABC's chief foreign
correspondent.
</P>
<P>
Can anybody name the person who occupies that assignment today?
Perhaps more important, can anyone imagine one of the current crop of
television news ``personalities'' admitting he or she is unqualified
to do anything from brain surgery to stand-up comedy?
</P>
<P>
Although wealth and celebrity came with his anchorman's chair,
Jennings never lost his field reporter's legs. It seems a commonplace
observation to make, but constantly gathering facts and, then,
thinking about them in some systematic way is what prepares
journalists to respond intelligently to the demands of breaking news.
Most recently, many Americans saw Jennings do just that in the more
than 60 hours of sober and reflective broadcasting he did in the
immediate aftermath of the 9/11 atrocities.
</P>
<P>
Monday, his former colleague Barbara Walters was among those who
singled out Jennings' nearly unmatched ability to ad lib smartly and
often eloquently while covering developing stories. Canadian news
anchor Lloyd Robertson said that ``Peter brought a high quality of
literature to electronic journalism. There was nobody who could put
things together on the air as easily and as rapidly as he did.''

Part of that was mental agility, part unremitting attention to his
work. During the mid-1990s, my wife, Leslie Abramson, was a legal
analyst for ABC News. While on business in New York, she ran into
Jennings, who invited her to join a group of network executives and
broadcasters that night at the Committee to Protect Journalists'
annual dinner.
</P>
<P>
During the course of the essentially ceremonial evening with its
introductions and speeches, Leslie noticed Jennings repeatedly
reaching into an inside coat pocket for a small, bound notebook in
which he made notations.
</P>
<P>
``Are you taking notes on this?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
``No,'' Jennings replied. ``I write down thoughts as they occur to
me. You never know when you're going to need a good idea.''
</P>

<P>
Relentless and inquisitive preparation was one thing that
distinguished Jennings' journalism, but so did a perspective that
actually was quite singular. The cool, engaged-but-somewhat-apart
persona that Jennings brought to his on-screen work was as much as
matter of intellect as temperament. Jennings the journalist was
quintessentially a man of the middle distance.
</P>
<P>
Some of that may have been attributable to his Canadian origins.
U.S. attitudes toward the rest of the world tend to oscillate between
hysterical triumphalism and lacerating self-loathing. Around both
poles, what tends to be lost is the fact that there are other people
in the world, who live their own lives and act for reasons of their
own. As a physically vast nation with a tiny population, most of which
lives hard up against the United States, Canadians tend to approach
other people and countries with a wry combination of self-deprecation
and self-assertion. Those qualities were one of the things that made
Jennings a superb foreign correspondent.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 9/11, Jennings became a naturalized American, though
he retained his Canadian citizenship. In an interview with the
Canadian Press at the time, he explained his decision: ``I am a
Canadian. My mother, like many of her generation, always found a
reason to resent the United States and defined herself as a Canadian
by being not American.'' In the wake of the attacks on the World Trade
Center and Pentagon, however, Jennings experienced his connection to
other Americans in an urgent new way. ``I felt more attached to them
than I perhaps had anticipated in emotional terms,'' he said. ``This
is my home.''
</P>
<P>
As television news increasingly trades on attitude and
entertainment rather than reporting and analysis, one of the things
that will be missed most about Jennings and his work is the respect he
showed for American viewers. Without intending to, he once summed that
quality up in an interview with the Toronto Star:
</P>
<P>
``There are a lot of people in this business who believe that part
of our job is to reassure the public every night,'' Jennings said. ``I
subscribe to leaving people with essentially a rough draft of history.
Some days it is reassuring. Some days, it is absolutely destructive.''
</P>
<P>
One of the tragedies of our time is that the corporate time-servers
who now direct the course of broadcast journalism do not share Peter
Jennings' faith that American viewers are entitled to that respect.
