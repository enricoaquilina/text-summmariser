Jennings' Death Leaves Sorrow, Big Shoes to Fill at ABC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anchor Peter Jennings' death was met Monday with a cascade of
sorrowful appreciations from national leaders, colleagues and viewers
around the country as anguished ABC employees struggled to absorb the
impact of his loss on the network.
</P>
<P>
Jennings -- who died at home in New York on Sunday night four
months after he was diagnosed with lung cancer -- was hailed as a
fiercely determined newsman who infused his broadcasts with a
sophisticated sensibility honed by years as a foreign correspondent.
Often demanding, he occasionally frustrated co-workers with his
relentless probing, an approach many credit with raising the standards
of ABC News.
</P>
<P>
He was lauded by everyone from President Bush -- who called him ``a
part of the life of a lot of our fellow citizens'' -- to more than
25,000 viewers who posted messages on the ABC News Web site expressing
their grief at his death.
</P>
<P>
``One word describes Peter Jennings on air: Class,'' wrote one.
``He shall be missed.''
</P>
<P>
With his death, retired NBC anchor Tom Brokaw said that he felt
``as if I've lost a member of my family,'' while former CBS anchor Dan
Rather praised Jennings as ``one of the most talented, caring and
successful electronic journalists of all time.''
</P>
<P>
The debonair Jennings anchored ``World News Tonight'' for the last
22 years, half of his four decades-long career at ABC. As managing
editor of the evening broadcast, he oversaw each story that went on
the air, personally editing nearly every story script.
</P>
<P>
``In many respects, Peter is the news division,'' said Paul Slavin,
senior vice president of worldwide newsgathering for ABC News. ``There
was never a decision that was made without considering what Peter
thought about it. ... He was, in a way, the persistent conscience.''
</P>
<P>
Jennings' death forces ABC to confront a similar challenge that NBC
and CBS have faced in the last year: settling on a successor for an
established anchor. Brokaw's handoff of the ``NBC Nightly News'' to
Brian Williams in December was long-planned and widely praised as a
seamless transition. CBS has tapped veteran Washington correspondent
Bob Schieffer to temporarily replace Rather, who left the anchor desk
in March, while the network mulls over a new format for its broadcast.
</P>
<P>
ABC executives said Monday that no decisions have yet been made
about who will take over for Jennings. For now, ``Good Morning
America'' co-host Charles Gibson and ``20/20'' co-anchor Elizabeth
Vargas will continue to anchor ``World News Tonight'' on a temporary
basis.
</P>
<P>
Network officials had hoped that the changes at the other networks
this year would give Jennings a chance to regain the title of the
top-rated evening newscast, a position he held from the mid-1980s to
mid-1990s. But after the anchor, a longtime smoker, learned he was
fighting lung cancer in April, he immediately began chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
``He has left us with a phenomenal foundation, and it is a
foundation that we will move forward with,'' Slavin said. ``The
corporeal part of Peter may not be here, but his thoughts and his
ideas, his demands for excellence and his heart will stay here.''
</P>
<P>
As an exacting editor, Jennings pushed himself and those around him
relentlessly, often asking correspondents to repeatedly rewrite their
story scripts.
</P>
<P>
``He drove everyone very hard, including and perhaps especially,
himself,'' said congressional correspondent Linda Douglass. ``He
involved himself in every detail of our news coverage, from deciding
which stories were covered to how they were covered to how the stories
were written. At ABC News, it felt as though he was in our
bloodstream.''
</P>
<P>
Paul Friedman, a longtime executive producer of ``World News
Tonight,'' said Jennings had an ``insatiable curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
``He was a perfectionist, which made him terrific to work with in
the sense that it was challenging all the time, and occasionally
difficult,'' Friedman said.

Jennings' drive was rooted partly in his embarrassment that he
never completed high school or college, according to friends and
former colleagues. Wherever he traveled for stories -- which was often
-- the anchor brought with him a suitcase full of books to read.
</P>
<P>
``He felt he had to prove himself,'' said CNN Washington bureau
chief David Bohrman, who worked with Jennings for more than a decade
as a senior producer at ABC. ``You always got the impression that he
felt he was going to be exposed as a fraud any minute because he
didn't finish school. He just couldn't rest. He never realized how
good he was.''

Colleagues said Jennings also brought a sentimental, compassionate
approach to stories that he rarely let viewers see. Slavin said the
anchor would push producers to home in on the emotional core of the
news, such as a mother's loss of her son in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
``He is one of the most sensitive, emotional anchors in the
business,'' said Slavin, repeatedly referring to Jennings in the
present tense.
</P>
<P>
Up until his final days, Jennings believed he could win his battle
with lung cancer, friends said.
</P>
<P>
``Frankly, I thought he would as well, because I knew what a brave,
fierce competitor he was,'' Rather said. ``But the odds were too
long.''
