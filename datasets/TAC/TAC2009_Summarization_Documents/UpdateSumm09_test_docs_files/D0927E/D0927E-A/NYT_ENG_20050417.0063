AT ABC, PIECING A NEW TEAM TOGETHER
</HEADLINE>

The news that Peter Jennings will be absent from "World News
Tonight" for an indeterminate period while he is being treated
for lung cancer has, at least from a business perspective,
had its most profound impact on Jennings' ultimate boss, David
Westin, the president of ABC News.
</P>
<P>
In the short run, the absence of Jennings threatens to undermine
one of the chief goals Westin has set for his
news division this year: to overtake its main rival, "NBC
Nightly News," at a moment of potential vulnerability for NBC
-- just as Brian Williams has lost some of the
audience he inherited in December from Tom Brokaw.
</P>
<P>
Westin faces a far bigger dilemma in the long run. With
estimated annual advertising revenue of more than $100 million, "World
News Tonight" is big business for ABC. If Westin continues
to simply patch together a lineup of substitute anchors while
waiting for Jennings to recover his health, the network could
squander the momentum it has already generated. But if ABC
News makes any long-term strategic or personnel moves, including grooming
a successor for the anchor chair, it could appear to
be preparing for a future without Jennings, who, at 66,
maybe the news network's biggest star.
</P>
<P>
Even as he began treatment last week as an outpatient, Jennings
remained a presence on "World News Tonight," albeit backstage. He
was in regular e-mail contact with Westin; Jonathan Banner, the
program's executive producer; and others, going so far as to
comment on scripts for upcoming shows. One morning last week,
he even participated via conference call in the program's 9
a.m. editorial meeting, his voice hoarse but strong.
</P>
<P>
Jennings has also been encouraged by Westin and Banner to come
in and reclaim the anchor chair on any night he
feels up to it, with as little as 45 minutes'
notice. "He's e-mailing; he's suggesting stories," Banner said. "Quite frankly,
I think some of my colleagues might be surprised at
how he's getting involved in scripts."
</P>
<P>
On March 31, less than a week before Jennings disclosed his
cancer, Westin announced that Ted Koppel would be leaving "Nightline"
and the network in December.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very dynamic time at ABC News," said Paul Slavin,
a senior vice president in the division. "There is a
constant stream of big decisions coming down the road."
