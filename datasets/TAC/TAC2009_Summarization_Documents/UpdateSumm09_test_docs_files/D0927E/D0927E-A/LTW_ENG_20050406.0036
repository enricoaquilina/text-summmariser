ABC News Anchor Has Lung Cancer

<P>
Peter Jennings, the last of the three long-dominant
network anchors still on the job, said Tuesday he has been diagnosed
with lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
Jennings, 66, plans to begin chemotherapy and to continue to anchor
ABC's ``World News Tonight'' when he can, but specialists said the
decision to forgo surgery suggests a more advanced form of cancer for
which long-term survival rates are relatively low.
</P>
<P>
Jennings had planned to anchor Tuesday night's newscast, but
decided an hour before airtime that his voice was too weak. In a
videotaped message, he disclosed the diagnosis in a raspy voice,
saying, ``Yes, I was a smoker until about 20 years ago, and I was weak
and smoked over 9/11. But whatever the reason, the news does slow you
down a bit. ... The National Cancer Institute says that we are
survivors from the moment of diagnosis. I will continue to do the
broadcast; on good days my voice will not always be like this.''
</P>
<P>
After a four-month period in which Tom Brokaw retired at NBC, Dan
Rather relinquished the anchor chair at CBS and Ted Koppel said he was
leaving ABC, Jennings's illness underscored the generational shift
underway at the broadcast networks. They have been losing audience
share for two decades but still reach 30 million people with their
evening newscasts.
</P>
<P>
Jennings has been the face of ABC News for much of his 40-year
career there, first as anchor from 1965 to 1968, in what he has
described as an unsuccessful tenure, then as part of a three-man
anchor team in 1978 before becoming solo anchor again in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Since Brokaw's departure in December, Jennings has brought his
newscast close to the top-rated ``NBC Nightly News'' in the Nielsens.
ABC anticipated Brokaw's resignation by kicking off a promotional
campaign for Jennings with the tag line: ``Trust is earned.''
</P>
<P>
ABC News President David Westin said in a note to the staff that
``Peter's been given a tough assignment. He's already bringing to this
new challenge the courage and strength we've seen so often in his
reporting from the field and in anchoring ABC News.'' Westin said
Charlie Gibson, Elizabeth Vargas and others would fill in for Jennings
when necessary. Vargas got the last-minute call Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
ABC executives refused to provide medical details of the type or
state of Jennings's cancer. Nine in 10 lung cancer cases are related
to smoking, and a diminishing risk continues even after someone quits.
</P>
<P>
Norman Edelman, chief medical officer of the American Lung
Association, said a decision by patients not to seek surgery for lung
cancer ``suggests they believe it's already spread to a point where
surgery does not offer a cure.'' This is either because the cancer is
at too advanced a stage or because it is a form called small-cell
cancer -- which occurs in about a quarter of such cases -- and has
already spread to other parts of the body, he said. Still,
``chemotherapy can absolutely prolong life,'' said Edelman, who
teaches at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
Michael Thun, vice president of epidemiology for the American
Cancer Society, said that ``the most effective treatment for localized
lung cancer is surgical removal. If it's already spread, then surgery
is not an option.'' Although the five-year survival rate for men with
operable lung cancer is 45 percent, he said, it is under 14 percent
for more advanced cancer that cannot be removed.
</P>
<P>
Jennings, who had not been feeling well for months, got the
diagnosis Monday afternoon and told his staff that night. Some in the
industry had been sniping at him for not going to Asia to cover the
tsunami and not anchoring coverage of the pope's final hours Friday
and Saturday or heading off to Rome.
</P>
<P>
``Peter has always been healthy as a horse and shows up for
everything,'' said an ABC staffer who requested anonymity because
network employees have been asked not to comment. ``For Peter not to
be there for the pope truly did leave everyone saying there must be
something terribly wrong.'' But, the staffer added, ``this is a man
who will have no time and no patience for pity.''
</P>
<P>
In a note to his staff, Jennings wrote, ``Almost 10 million
Americans are living with cancer. I am sure I will learn from them how
to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated.'' He
added: ``There will be good days and bad, which means that some days I
may be cranky and some days really cranky!''
</P>
<P>
Jennings added a similarly light note on Tuesday night's broadcast,
smiling several times and noting that he was ``a little surprised at
the kindness today from so many people. ... I wonder if other men and
women ask their doctors right away, `OK, Doc, when does the hair
go?'''
</P>
<P>
Jennings, Rather and Brokaw once dominated the media landscape, to
a degree unimaginable today, because beginning in the early 1980s they
reached about half the television audience, unchallenged by cable news
-- then in its infancy -- or talk radio or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
By the time newer and faster technological rivals, including
bloggers who often criticized them, came on the scene, the Big Three
anchors were well-established figures from having chronicled so many
national and global stories, from war to impeachment to terrorism. A
younger generation of anchors mostly lacks that depth of experience --
Jennings as a Middle East-based correspondent for seven years, Rather
as a White House correspondent and ``60 Minutes'' contributor, Brokaw
as a White House reporter and ``Today'' host.
</P>
<P>
NBC planned best for the inevitable succession, anointing Brian
Williams, 45, who has held onto the ratings lead, 21/2 years before he
took over in December. CBS had no replacement ready when Rather, under
pressure from his botching of the story about President Bush's
military service, stepped down last month, although Bob Schieffer, 68,
has won praise as interim anchor for his more conversational style.
</P>
<P>
ABC, despite a stable of high-priced stars like Koppel and Barbara
Walters, never groomed an obvious young successor to Jennings. And the
evening news franchise itself, less lucrative than the popular morning
shows, is often derided as an anachronism with an aging core of loyal
viewers. ``Good Morning America'' co-host Diane Sawyer, as well as
Gibson, would be part of any shortlist, but both seem happy with their
current situations. Vargas is viewed as a rising star within the
network. Koppel, who plans to leave ABC in December over plans to make
``Nightline'' a live, hour-long broadcast, has filled in for Jennings
but never expressed interest in being a permanent evening anchor.
</P>
<P>
The son of a Canadian broadcaster, Jennings got dual U.S.
citizenship after the 2001 terrorist attacks. He was the courtliest of
the Big Three anchors, the most frequently married -- four times -- and
the least self-promotional. He often described himself as a terrible
interview.
</P>
<P>
Alex Jones, director of Harvard's Shorenstein media center, said
that when he interviewed Jennings two decades ago, ``he was
embarrassed that he had not finished high school and worked all the
harder to be a superb journalist. This was always a man who had a more
graceful humor and air of sophistication, which came from his days as
a foreign correspondent when he looked like something from a 1940s
movie, handsome and dashing.'' Because of his limited education, Jones
said, ``he took that spot as anchor with some trepidation.''
</P>
<P>
Such was Jennings' longevity that he was in Germany when the Berlin
Wall went up and when it came down. Jennings was the first to
establish a television bureau in the Middle East and one of three
western journalists to witness Saddam Hussein's first appearance in an
Iraqi court last year. The winner of 14 Emmy Awards, he has reported
from all 50 states and hosted specials such as ``Peter Jennings
Reporting,'' ``The Search for Jesus,'' ``The Kennedy Assassination --
Beyond Conspiracy'' and, more recently, one on UFOs. He also anchored
the New Year's Eve broadcast at the turn of the millennium that won a
Peabody Award.
</P>
<P>
``Peter is part of the DNA of ABC News,'' said spokesman Jeffrey
Schneider. ``He's very strong and he's a fighter. Obviously this is an
emotional day here. Everyone's first, second and third thoughts are
for Peter's speedy recovery.''
