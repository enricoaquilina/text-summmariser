JENNINGS HAS LUNG CANCER, PLANS TO KEEP ANCHOR POST
</HEADLINE>

Peter Jennings, the last of the three major anchors of his
era who is still working on a nightly newscast, revealed
Tuesday that he has lung cancer and that he will
begin chemotherapy next week.
</P>
<P>
E-mail messages released Tuesday by Jennings and ABC News president David
Westin stressed that Jennings, who is 66 and who has
anchored ABC's "World News Tonight" since 1983, will continue to
work during treatment, provided he feels well enough. Jennings decided
late Tuesday not to anchor Tuesday night's program and was
replaced by "20/20" coanchor Elizabeth Vargas.

The dramatic news - which comes on the heels of last
week's announcement that "Nightline" host Ted Koppel will leave at
year's end and which follows the recent departures of CBS
and NBC anchors Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw - reinforces
the idea that a chapter in television journalism is coming
to an end.
</P>
<P>
"Your initial reaction is you wish Peter Jennings well," said J.
Max Robins, editor in chief at Broadcasting &amp; Cable magazine.
"You really wonder, if given this kind of narrowcasting environment,
we'll ever see people of this iconic stature again in
the news business."
</P>
<P>
The health of Jennings, a former smoker, surfaced as an issue
late last year, when he was unable to travel abroad
for coverage of the devastating tsunami in southern and Southeast
Asia. At the time, ABC insiders thought he was battling
a lingering flu or a similar ailment. The announcement Tuesday
seemed to stun the network.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously this is a very emotional day at ABC News," said
a spokesman, Jeffrey Schneider. "Everybody is rallying around Peter, and
we are here to help him get through this and
beat this."
</P>
<P>
He added: "We expect him to be the anchor for many
years to come."
</P>
<P>
NBC completed a lengthy and smoothly choreographed transition in December when
Brian Williams succeeded Brokaw in the anchor chair. At CBS,
Rather's announcement last November that he would step down, which
followed a furor over the flawed "60 Minutes Wednesday" report
on President Bush's military record, left that network scrambling for
a successor. Veteran correspondent Bob Schieffer was picked to fill
the slot on an interim basis when Rather departed last
month.
</P>
<P>
ABC's "World News Tonight" is currently in second place in the
nightly news wars, but it has been breathing down the
neck of the ratings leader, "NBC Nightly News." (For the
week that ended April 1, ABC's newscast averaged almost 9.5
million viewers, compared with 10 million for NBC.) Until now,
there has not been much public discussion about an eventual
successor to Jennings, who has worked at ABC News since
1964. Schneider said the diagnosis has not caused the network
to focus more intently on the Jennings succession.
</P>
<P>
In his e-mail to the staff, Westin said that when Jennings
is unable to work, Vargas and "Good Morning America" cohost
Charles Gibson would be among the substitutes. Others likely to
fill in include chief White House correspondent Terry Moran and
network correspondent Bob Woodruff.
</P>
<P>
While making Jennings's condition public, the network did not provide details
about the diagnosis or prognosis. Westin wrote that the anchor
would undergo outpatient treatment in New York and that "we
should also expect him to be off the broadcast from
time to time."
</P>
<P>
In his own e-mail to his colleagues, Jennings said: "There will
be good days and bad, which means that some days
I may be cranky and some days really cranky!
</P>
<P>
"Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer. I am sure
I will learn from them how to cope with the
facts of life that none of us anticipated."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Scott Swanson, a thoracic surgeon at New York's Mount Sinai
Medical Center who specializes in lung cancer, said of Jennings:
"He seems pretty healthy now. In terms of the chemotherapy
stopping him, most people do work through chemotherapy."
</P>
<P>
"Lung cancer in general is aggressive," Swanson added. "Overall, we're still
having a hard time with it, mainly because we're not
finding it in an early phase."
