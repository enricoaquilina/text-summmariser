Jennings' Illness Hits Viewers on Personal Level

The first message was posted just six minutes after the
news broke April 5 that ABC anchor Peter Jennings had been diagnosed
with lung cancer. By the end of the week, more than 3,400 e-mails
offering him prayers and good wishes had filled the network's online
message board -- many of them expressing an intensely personal sense
of grief.
</P>
<P>
``Our old and trusted friend, you have looked out for all of us for
so long, and comforted us in our time of need,'' wrote Peggi and Ron
Barratt. ``Please take the time to now look out for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
While the announcement of Jennings' illness hit the already
unsettled world of network news with even more turbulence, it also
jolted television viewers, stripping them -- at least for a time -- of
the last of the three familiar faces that had anchored the evening
news for the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Jennings still hopes to lead the newscast throughout his
chemotherapy. But he was unable to deliver the news last week because
of a hoarse voice, and it remains unclear how frequently he will be on
the air.
</P>
<P>
Viewer reaction to his illness underscored the challenge facing the
networks as they usher in a new generation of evening news anchors:
replicating the strong bonds that have developed between audiences and
the iconic faces of ABC, NBC and CBS.
</P>
<P>
``The illusion that television has created is that we experience
events, and the people that bring us through, that are our guides, are
the network anchors,'' said Gary Edgerton, a professor at Old Dominion
University in Norfolk, Va., and co-editor of the Journal of Popular
Film and Television. ``We have these really intense, interpersonal
connections with these stars.''
</P>
<P>
NBC eased the transition from Tom Brokaw to Brian Williams in
December by announcing the move two years ahead of time and giving
viewers ample opportunities to watch Williams as a substitute anchor.
CBS tapped a veteran newsman, Bob Schieffer, to temporarily replace
Dan Rather when he left the newscast last month.
</P>
<P>
Jennings' diagnosis forces ABC executives to begin contemplating
the question of succession, too -- a matter most had assumed would be
at least several years off.
</P>
<P>
``It signals the transition that ABC inevitably is going to have to
make,'' said Charles Bierbauer, a former CNN and ABC correspondent who
serves as dean of the University of South Carolina's College of Mass
Communications and Information Studies. ``The simple fact is that the
generation is changing.''
</P>
<P>
But transferring viewer affection to new anchors is not a simple
matter, media experts said.
</P>
<P>
``These are the type of interactions that have to be developed over
time,'' said Jeffrey McCall, a professor of communications at Depauw
University in Greencastle, Ind., who noted that competitive pressures
from all-news cable channels, the Internet and other news sources
limit the amount of time new anchors have to bond with their
audiences.
</P>
<P>
``Network news is in a big pickle,'' he said. ``They can't afford
to let whoever takes over the time to grow into the role.''
</P>
<P>
Some executives actually view the turnover as an opportunity to
radically remake the broadcasts in hopes of appealing to a younger
demographic.
</P>
<P>
CBS Chairman and Chief Executive Leslie Moonves has called the
traditional ``voice of God'' anchor an antiquated concept and
suggested that his network may roll out a more irreverent,
multi-anchor format.
</P>
<P>
``Those days are over where you have that guy sitting behind the
desk that everybody believes to the nth degree,'' he told reporters in
January.
</P>
<P>
But TV news correspondent and anchor Morton Dean dismissed the idea
that audiences no longer seek that kind of relationship. ``I think
it's a mistake for anybody to think anchors are no longer as important
as they once were, because when there's a crisis in America, or
affecting America, people turn to someone they trust,'' said Dean, who
worked at CBS and ABC. The audience for the three major evening
newscasts has shrunk considerably amid growing competition, yet they
still combine to attract upward of 26 million people each weeknight.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there was ample evidence last week that viewers greatly
value the intimacy and confidence they have felt with Jennings, who
has anchored ``World News Tonight'' for 22 years. ABC's Web site was
flooded with emotional testimonials from people about his effect on
their lives, many referring to him as a member of the family.
</P>
<P>
An Ohio mother said she and her children say, ``Good night, Peter''
every night after the newscast. A college student wrote that she never
misses his broadcasts and that she used to watch it nightly with her
father.
</P>
<P>
Viewer after viewer cited Jennings' handling of coverage of the
Sept. 11 attacks as a welcome balm during a horrific day. A
second-grade teacher from Wilmington, N. C., said Jennings' demeanor
``gave your viewers a sense of peace, that everything would eventually
be better than it was at that moment'' and helped ``explain the
unexplainable to our children.'' A Cincinnati viewer wrote that ``when
the nation circles its wagons, you are the wagon master that provides
us with a sense of calm.''
</P>
<P>
``Life won't be the same till you're back in the living rooms of
America every night,'' wrote a woman identified as Marilyn L.
</P>
<P>
Stuart Fischoff, a professor emeritus of media psychology at
California State University, Los Angeles, said he is not surprised by
the emotional responses to Jennings' absence from the newscast last
week.
</P>
<P>
``There is research that shows when you remove pivotal people on
television from a person's daily life, they feel like they've had a
death in the family,'' he said. ``They feel rootless.''
</P>
<P>
ABC executives stress that Jennings is still the anchor of ``World
News Tonight'' and will do the broadcast whenever he feels up to it.
When he can't, he still plans to exert a strong force in shaping the
newscast.
</P>
<P>
``We are enormously grateful for the loyalty of our audience, and
we expect they will continue to get their news from Peter Jennings,''
ABC News spokesman Jeffrey Schneider said. ``Nights when they don't
see him physically on the air, they know his steady hand is on the
tiller.''
</P>
<P>
Schneider insisted that ABC executives are focused on Jennings'
recovery. But TV news veterans said the network must consider who will
take over if Jennings is unable to continue.
</P>
<P>
Charles Gibson, co-host of ``Good Morning America,'' and ``20/20''
co-anchor Elizabeth Vargas, who are filling in for Jennings
temporarily, are considered possible permanent replacements for the
longtime anchor, along with ``World News Tonight Saturday'' anchor Bob
Woodruff and chief White House correspondent Terry Moran.
</P>
<P>
But Robert Zelnick, chairman of Boston University's Department of
Journalism and a former ABC News correspondent, said it would be hard
to find an adequate replacement. ``This is a body blow to ABC and to
aficionados of evening news,'' he said. ``I've been walking around for
days feeling a lump of sadness. He's been such a big part of our
lives.''
