ABC News anchor Peter Jennings has been diagnosed with
lung cancer, the network announced Tuesday, and will immediately begin
a round of outpatient chemotherapy that is expected to keep him from
the anchor desk at times in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old newsman, who smoked when he was younger, had been
feeling ill during the last several days and was diagnosed Monday
afternoon. He broke the news to his senior staff at ``World News
Tonight'' in an e-mail Tuesday morning, saying he hoped to continue to
anchor throughout his treatment.
</P>
<P>
``There will be good days and bad, which means that some days I may
be cranky and some days really cranky!'' he wrote. ``Almost 10 million
Americans are living with cancer. I am sure I will learn from them how
to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
Jennings' announcement provoked sadness and dismay among his
colleagues at ABC, where the anchor plays a central role in leading
the news division. His illness may sideline, at least temporarily, one
of the last remaining lions of network news, coming on the heels of
the departures of NBC anchor Tom Brokaw and CBS anchor Dan Rather from
their evening newscasts. Another television veteran, Ted Koppel,
announced last week that he was leaving ABC and ``Nightline'' at the
end of the year. Jennings, who has anchored ``World News Tonight''
since 1983, led the newscast Friday and is expected to do so again
tonight. He begins treatment in New York next week. A network
spokeswoman declined to identify the location, citing his privacy.

<P>
ABC News President David Westin told the network's staff that he
and Jennings expect the anchor to continue the newscast during his
treatment ``to the extent he can do so comfortably.''
</P>
<P>
``But we should also expect him to be off the broadcast from time
to time, depending on how he feels,'' Westin wrote in an e-mail to the
entire staff, adding that Charlie Gibson and Elizabeth Vargas, among
others, would substitute for Jennings.
</P>
<P>
``Peter's been given a tough assignment,'' Westin added. ``He's
already bringing to this new challenge the courage and strength we've
seen so often in his reporting from the field and in anchoring ABC
News. I know that all of us will give him every bit of support that he
needs and asks for. Peter will once again lead the way, but we will
stand with him at every turn.''
</P>
<P>
Jennings called the diagnosis ``quite a surprise'' and expressed
gratitude for his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
``In all the years I have worked here I have had the most
outstanding support from this news division,'' he wrote. ``Hundreds of
you have been like family. It feels good to have such a family right
now.''
</P>
<P>
Jennings did not go to Rome to cover Pope John Paul II's death. And
he stayed back from Asia after the disastrous tsunami in December. At
the time, ABC said Jennings had a severe upper respiratory infection,
and the network sent Diane Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
Jennings joined ABC News in 1964. Jennings has won 14 national
Emmys, several Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University awards, several
Overseas Press Club awards and a George Foster Peabody award.
