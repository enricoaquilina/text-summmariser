ABC'S JENNINGS DISCLOSES THAT HE HAS LUNG CANCER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Jennings, the sole anchor of the ABC evening newscast for
the past 22 years, announced Tuesday that he was suffering
from lung cancer and had begun treatment.
</P>
<P>
ABC said Jennings, 66, would work as often as he could
during his course of treatment. But the network, which has
seen the recent replacement of anchors at NBC and CBS
as an opportunity for Jennings to vault into the ratings
leadership, is planning to use substitute anchors, including Charles Gibson
and Elizabeth Vargas, in his absence.
</P>
<P>
Jennings was unable to anchor the ABC newscast on Tuesday night,
though he had originally planned to. He did tape a
brief commentary to close the newscast, speaking in a hoarse
and strained voice.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The National Cancer Institute says that we are survivors
from the moment of diagnosis. I will continue to do
the broadcast. On good days, my voice will not always
be like this. Certainly, it's been a long time. And
I hope it goes without saying that a journalist who
doesn't value -- deeply -- the audience's loyalty should be
in another line of work."
</P>
<P>
ABC News emphasized that Jennings would remain its evening news anchor.
In an e-mail message to his staff on Tuesday, David
Westin, the president of ABC News, praised Jennings for his
leadership of the news division over the years and expressed
the division's support as he encountered this challenge. "Peter will
once again lead the way but we will stand with
him at every turn," Westin said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Jennings would undergo outpatient treatment in New York
and would continue to work on the newscast "to the
extent he can do so comfortably."
</P>
<P>
Jennings had been a heavy smoker until the mid- to late-1980s,
colleagues said. He quit at that time, though the colleagues
said it was an enormous struggle for him and periodically
he was known to sneak a cigarette or two. At
one point, Jennings and his executive producer then, Paul Friedman,
visited a hypnotist in Boston seeking to break their addictions
to cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
That treatment worked for a time, but as Jennings acknowledged in
his commentary on Tuesday night, he returned to regular smoking
after the terrorist attacks in 2001. He later quit again,
a colleague said.
</P>
<P>
Lung cancer is usually difficult to treat. While the prognosis depends
on the type of lung cancer, the overall cure rate
is just 16 percent. Sixty percent of lung cancer patients
die within a year of diagnosis, and nearly 75 percent
die within two years.
