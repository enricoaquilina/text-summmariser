ABC's Jennings Thanks Viewers for Support During Cancer Fight
</HEADLINE>

Peter Jennings, in a statement read Friday night on ABC's ``World
News Tonight,'' shared with viewers his feelings about his battle with
lung cancer and expressed gratitude for the support he has received
from fans and friends. The 66-year-old anchorman had announced on
April 6 that he was diagnosed with the disease and shortly thereafter
began treatment.

``Thousands of you have spoiled me rotten with your attention in
the last couple of weeks,'' Jennings said in a statement that was read
on air by Elizabeth Vargas. ``So many experiences have meant something
special. A woman in my building who is a cancer survivor showed up at
my front door so that we could see that bald really is beautiful.
She's right.''
</P>
<P>
By allowing his feelings to be expressed on air, Jennings gave
viewers an unusually personal glimpse of what it is like to have the
disease as well as offering what may be solace to cancer patients,
support group leaders said.
</P>
<P>
``What we see in Peter Jennings is a role model,'' said Suzanne
Brace, executive director of HopeWell Cancer Support in Lutherville,
Md. ``Whenever someone like that goes public, it gives others
permission to talk about their cancers. It also offers encouragement
and courage. People think, `If he can go public with his employers
about his cancer, maybe I can, too.' ''
</P>
<P>
Jennings offered a further update on his treatment Friday in a
letter posted on the abcnews.com Web site.
</P>

``Yesterday, I decided to go to the office; I live only a few
blocks away. I got as far as the bedroom door. Chemo strikes,''
Jennings wrote. ``Do I detect a knowing but sympathetic smile on many
of your faces? You knew this was coming.''
</P>
<P>
Jennings went on to describe notes and messages he had received
from Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Hamilton Jordan, former chief of
staff in the administration of President Carter.
</P>
<P>
In a note, Specter told the anchorman, ``the only way to get
through chemo is to work your way through it.''
</P>
<P>
``He's a tougher man than I am,'' Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan sent Jennings a book titled ``No Such Thing as a Bad Day.''
``He's had cancer four times. He tells me, as have many others, that
when it gets really bad, it will get better. Whew!'' Jennings added.
</P>
<P>
``I won't soon forget an encounter as I was leaving the hospital. A
middle-aged couple was going into the building and as they passed me,
I heard my name and turned. The woman stepped right in my face and
said, `Me too. Lung cancer.' Instinctively, immediately, we gave each
other a hug -- a real hug -- and went on our respective ways knowing
that we had been strengthened by the connection.''
</P>
<P>
That kind of testimony from a public figure like Jennings can make
a ``huge difference'' in peoples' lives, Brace said last night after
hearing Jennings' remarks on the newscast.
</P>
<P>
``I was thinking back to when Betty Ford first went public with her
breast cancer, and what a difference that made,'' Brace said. ``This
does give people a way to say, `Me too.' ''
</P>
<P>
Jennings has not anchored the newscast since April 1. Vargas and
Charles Gibson, co-host of ``Good Morning America,'' have substituted
for him.
