Adrift in a World Without Anchors

Anchorman: The very word suggests security and gravitas. Serious
but sympathetic, the timbre of his voice is a firm tenor or a
stentorian baritone, perhaps a bit tense in dire straits, but never
panicky. Closing out the night watch, his signature sign-off sounds
like a benediction. ``Good night and good luck,'' said Edward R.
Murrow. ``And that's the way it is,'' asserted the decisive Walter
Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
The future of the iconic American anchorman was on the minds of
many this week as the news that Peter Jennings had been diagnosed with
lung cancer raised concerns that he wouldn't be able to continue as
anchor at ABC News.
</P>
<P>
After the long goodbye of NBC's Tom Brokaw (who served from 1983
until December), and the forced retirement of CBS' besieged Dan Rather
(in harness from 1981 until March), the departure of the 66-year-old
Jennings (sole anchor since 1978) would complete a clean sweep of the
venerable troika from the erstwhile Big Three. Even more significant,
it would mark the end of a special kind of personality-driven news
experience -- the last unique legacy (reruns not included) of the
classic age of broadcast television.
</P>
<P>
The anchor's roots reach back to the birth of modern broadcast
journalism in 1938, when CBS Radio launched its ``World News Roundup''
just in time to track Hitler marauding across Europe. The declamatory
style of the town-crier announcer (familiar as the so-called Voice of
God in the Hollywood newsreels) soon gave way to a new reportorial
model in which the journalist became a commentator as well, guiding
the listener through strange doings and complex geopolitics.
</P>
<P>
Murrow, of course, was the prototype for this new breed of
broadcast journalist. When he moved from radio to TV, his visible
presence only intensified the emotional link: the movie star looks,
the patrician manner, the cigarette smoke swirling around his head
like incense. On March 9, 1954, when Murrow delivered a slashing
broadside at Sen. Joseph McCarthy, he was cashing in a lifetime of
moral capital accrued from Munich to Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
As an anchor, Murrow was a bit of a bust, but another candidate was
waiting in the wings. During the TV coverage of the 1952 presidential
conventions, CBS News President Sig Mickelson coined the term
``anchorman'' for his primary on-air reporter. The man Mickelson
picked was Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
Cronkite had to wait until 1962 before taking the reins of ``The
CBS Evening News'' away from Douglas Edwards, but 1963 was his
breakout year. That September, first CBS and then NBC expanded their
news broadcasts from 15 minutes to 30. Then, over a vertiginous four
days that November, the Kennedy assassination sent millions of
Americans to the anchor to calm their nerves and soothe their souls.
</P>
<P>
Cronkite's iconic bearing of the bad news (``From Dallas, Texas, a
flash, apparently official. ...'') has long since become audiovisual
shorthand for the moment of impact: pulling off his glasses, choking
up, stoically going forward.
</P>
<P>
Like Murrow, Cronkite spent his capital carefully, trading on his
cheerleading for NASA to cover his flanks when he turned against the
Vietnam War after the 1968 Tet offensive. The anchor was always
careful not to run too far ahead of his Nielsen demographic -- maybe a
few feet ahead of the fashion curve, but never out on the cutting
edge.
</P>
<P>
It was around this time that Cronkite earned his sobriquet as ``the
most trusted man in America,'' not as impressive as it sounds given
the competition.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the same year that Rather edged out the eminence gris, a
more significant milestone in the annals of anchordom appeared on
screen: CNN, the beginning of 24-hour news and the end of the
networks' monopoly.
</P>
<P>
By the 1990s, from the Gulf War through O.J.-TV to the massacre at
Columbine High School, a multiplicity of news options and a dizzying
cast of faces were available to bear the bad tidings.
</P>
<P>
The dinnertime newscast -- once de rigueur from coast to coast --
became a missable feast for Americans who had been munching all day on
cable and the Internet. (From their high-water mark in the late 1960s,
ratings for the network newscasts have plummeted by 60 percent.)
</P>
<P>
Tellingly, the most traumatic day in U.S. broadcasting history --
9/11 -- bequeathed no equivalent to Cronkite's JFK moment: The images
of disaster are indelible, but no face, gesture or remark from a
single newscaster stands out.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, American anchormen derived their authoritative
profile less from anything they did than from the simple fact of
prolonged exposure, repeated ceremonially for years, in a hegemonic
media environment. In this sense, it is hard to lament the transfer of
power from the great and powerful men in front of the curtain to every
munchkin with a modem. Yet it also is hard not to get a little
sentimental over the end of a tradition that well-served the news,
and, on occasion, the nation.
