ABC ANCHOR JENNINGS BATTLES CANCER

"World News Tonight" anchor Peter Jennings has lung cancer,
ABC announced Tuesday, but plans to remain on the job
throughout his treatment.
</P>
<P>
He and ABC News President David Westin sent e-mails to their
newsroom colleagues about the diagnosis, which Jennings received Monday. Westin
called the news "a tough assignment," while Jennings, 66, said
it was "quite a surprise."
</P>
<P>
A former smoker who quit some years ago, Jennings will begin
outpatient chemotherapy treatment next week in New York, but he
intends to continue broadcasting as his health permits.
</P>
<P>
In his e-mail, Westin wrote, "It's both Peter's and my expectation
that he will anchor 'World News Tonight' during the period
of treatment to the extent he can do so comfortably;
but, we should also expect him to be off the
broadcast from time to time, depending on how he feels."
</P>
<P>
Charles Gibson, Elizabeth Vargas and others will substitute for Jennings as
necessary.
</P>
<P>
Jennings wrote of his coming treatment: "There will be good days
and bad, which means that some days I may be
cranky and some days really cranky!
</P>
<P>
"Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer. I am sure
I will learn from them how to cope with the
facts of life that none of us anticipated."
</P>
<P>
The news comes at a time when Jennings remains virtually the
last of the longtime network anchors. NBC's Tom Brokaw signed
off in December. Dan Rather left his desk at CBS
a month ago. Last week, Jennings' ABC colleague Ted Koppel
announced he will leave "Nightline" this December.
</P>
<P>
Once the main source of news for TV watchers, these network
anchors have lost viewers over the past decade because of
the proliferation of alternate news resources on cable TV and
the Internet. In Rather's absence, CBS executives have discussed experimenting
with the time-honored "voice-of-God," single-anchor format.
</P>
<P>
"This will probably be a momentous year for network news," says
Michael Castengera, a lecturer at the University of Georgia's Grady
College of Journalism and an independent media consultant. "As the
struggle continues to win viewers, people at very high levels
at the networks are going to have to make some
tough decisions."
</P>
<P>
As a coach for aspiring broadcasters, Castengera has told his students
to watch Jennings' broadcasts, "because he has such a relaxed,
personable style that makes him very easy to relate to,"
he says. "Peter Jennings is one of the few anchors
that people almost invariably say, 'Yes, I could see sitting
down and having a drink with him and talking casually
about issues.' "
</P>
<P>
Jennings joined ABC News in 1964 and served as the anchor
of "ABC Evening News" from 1965 to 1968. He was
foreign desk anchor for "World News Tonight" from 1978 to
1983, the year he was named the program's anchor and
senior editor. Born in Toronto, he became a U.S. citizen
in 2003.
