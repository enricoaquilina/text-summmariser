FAMILY MATTERS: The Mother of Us All
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those of us who came of age with the feminist movement wanted to be
a Gloria Steinem kind of feminist. Not a Betty Friedan kind of
feminist.
</P>
<P>
We were not the restless suburban housewives for whom the frumpy,
doughy Friedan spoke. We were not the woman who suffered ``a nameless,
aching dissatisfaction'' with her life of chores and children.
</P>
<P>
Instead, we were young careerists like the sleek and husky-voiced
Steinem, who had the physical qualifications to make her journalistic
mark in a Playboy bunny costume.
</P>
<P>
We believed Steinem when she said, ``A woman needs a man like a
fish needs a bicycle.'' Friedan was trying to make peace with that
bicycle for the sake of the kids. We didn't think we'd ever have any.
</P>
<P>
It was that generational split -- between our mothers, for whom
Friedan spoke, and ourselves, who wanted to emulate Steinem's
androgynous independence -- that cost Friedan her rightful place at
the head of the table of the feminist movement.
</P>
<P>
Only now, at her death Saturday at 85, do we acknowledge what she
meant to all of us.
</P>
<P>
Friedan was that housewife, bored near to madness after giving up
her career -- some accounts say she was fired when she got pregnant a
second time -- to stay at home and take care of the household while
her husband worked.
</P>
<P>
But she didn't have words for the frustration she felt until she
surveyed her fellow Smith College graduates in advance of a reunion
and found that the ones at home with the kids were feeling the same
ennui. Steinem might have called that networking.
</P>
<P>
``The Feminine Mystique,'' the book that resulted from that survey
and many more confirming interviews with wives and mothers, was not
the shot heard 'round the world that legend would have us believe.
Published in 1963 in only modest numbers, it did not hit the heart of
the American home until it came out as a Dell paperback a year later.
</P>
<P>
I have this vision of stay-at-home mothers passing this dog-eared
paperback around the playground, the pool and the schoolyard until a
revolution quietly bubbled up from a million ``a-ha'' moments.
</P>
<P>
Friedan described the vague dissatisfaction of these women while
the feminists that followed radicalized the remedy. Friedan's first
cause was the unification of the help-wanted ads, which had been
separated by gender. By the time we college women got hold of the
feminist movement, we assumed we would work at any job we wanted. Men
and children, optional.
</P>
<P>
``Some people think I'm saying `Women of the world unite -- you
have nothing to lose but your men,' '' Friedan told Life magazine in
1963. ``It's not true. You have nothing to lose but your vacuum
cleaners.''
</P>
<P>
The irony, of course, is that 30 years later many of Steinem's
acolytes are the reincarnation of Friedan's mad housewife. Somewhere
along the line, we got married and we had kids and we patched together
some compromise between work and home that our husbands never had to
make. We are half-nuts, too. But this time our problem has a name. It
is called ``having it all.''
</P>
<P>
It seems like only a moment ago that we sat in
consciousness-raising groups, drafting the script for a new world
order that would have no gender boundaries. But it was a script
without a back story. We never called home to ask how our mothers had
managed. We didn't think they had anything to teach us. We just
repudiated their choices with our own.
</P>
<P>
The feminist movement would split over the issues in the kind of
degrading internecine war that diminishes all movements, and Friedan
was kicked to the curb. She resigned as the first president of the
National Organization for Women just a few years after founding it on
a cocktail napkin. Younger feminists thought she had paid too much
attention to the concerns of white, middle-class married women instead
of to those of minorities, poor women and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
It is Friedan's mixed legacy that the issues that mattered most to
her are still on the table today: paid maternity leave, affordable
child care, job training for women with children, reproductive
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The issues that the college feminists dismissed as bourgeois are
the issues that continue to matter most to women today.
</P>
<P>
It took us all these years to realize that Friedan was more than
the mother of the movement. She was the mother of us all.
