ideals betray a basic incompatibility between the two cultures? 800
words, by Sara Bjerg Moller (Times special) (k). Moved.

ALGEBRA-COMMENT -- The reasons why Johnny can't do algebra in L.A.

know his multiplication tables. 1,195 words, by Karin Klein (Times)
(k). Upcoming.

FRIEDAN-COMMENT -- The obituaries for feminist author Betty Friedan
were striking in their recognition of how much explanation is now
required about the world before the women's movement; even people in
their 40s aren't aware that such ideas as equal pay for equal work,
the right of pregnant women to keep their jobs, and many other matters
of simple justice were radical proposals in the 1960s. 840 words, by
Susan Jacoby (Times special) (k). Upcoming.

PINKERTON -- Multiculturalism can kill a nation. By James P.
