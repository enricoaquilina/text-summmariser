Discrimination Against Women? Yes, Kids, It Really Happened
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
History is a terrible thing to waste. The obituaries for Betty
Friedan, whose 1963 book, ``The Feminine Mystique,'' revived an
American feminism then thought to be extinct and unnecessary, were
striking in their recognition of how much explanation is now required
about the world before the women's movement.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers had to remind their readers that equal pay for equal
work, sex-blind help-wanted ads, the right of pregnant women to keep
their jobs, nondiscriminatory admission standards for professional
schools and many other matters of simple justice were considered not
only controversial but radical proposals in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Younger readers were doubtless as incredulous at this news as my
23-year-old and 15-year-old nieces were when I recently told them
about the essay I was required to write by The Washington Post's
personnel department as part of my application for a reporting job in
1965. The topic, singularly inappropriate for a childless 19-year-old,
was, ``How I Plan to Combine Motherhood With a Career.''
</P>
<P>
On one level, the ignorance of the young and the not-so-young --
many people in their 40s also know little about what life was like
when most forms of discrimination against women were perfectly legal
-- is a measure of how much has been accomplished. But on a deeper
level, this ignorance endangers many feminist gains because it raises
the real possibility that future generations will have to reinvent the
wheel.
</P>
<P>
It has happened before. The first wave of American feminism, which
began in 1848 with the Seneca Falls convention under the leadership of
Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was concerned with much more
than obtaining the vote for women. Economic equality, educational
equality and -- most controversial of all -- equality in religious
institutions that had long preached the divinely ordained inferiority
of women were part of the first feminist platform. As the century wore
on, though, the more radical voices were stilled and the movement
concentrated solely on suffrage.
</P>
<P>
Stanton, whose ``The Woman's Bible'' created as much of a sensation
and a scandal in 1892 as Friedan's book did 71 years later, was
written out (literally) of the women's movement because of her
unorthodox views on religion. Her name did not return to history until
the 1980s, with the research of a new generation of feminist scholars.
</P>
<P>
Friedan was the first 20th century feminist to restore the
historical and cultural context lost for most of the century and to
make the essential point that, if an entire group has a problem, the
solution can never be purely personal.
</P>
<P>
I have always been grateful that I read ``The Feminine Mystique''
shortly before I went to Washington to interview with the Post. Before
reading Friedan, I truly believed that barriers to women in journalism
would not apply to me because all of those other women must have done
something wrong to be stuck in what used to be called the ``society
section.'' Without the perspective provided by Friedan, I might have
been surprised by the personnel director's insulting demand, lost my
temper and lost the chance at a job. As it was, I bit my tongue, wrote
the essay and told myself that I would become one of the women who
would challenge the prejudices that denigrated all women.
</P>
<P>
Friedan's message about the cultural nature of women's
subordination was not well received initially. In the New York Times
Book Review in 1963, Lucy Freeman scolded Friedan for criticizing
women's magazines and asked, ``What is to stop a woman who is
interested in national and international affairs from reading
magazines that deal with those subjects? To paraphrase a famous line,
`The fault, dear Mrs. Friedan, is not in our culture, but in
ourselves.' ''
</P>
<P>
At Freidan's funeral in New York on Monday, her longtime friend,
sociologist Amitai Etzioni, noted that his department at Columbia
University did not have a single female professor in 1962. The few
Barnard female students admitted to Columbia classes, Etzioni
acknowledged honestly, knew that they were there on sufferance and
``knew that they should not be heard too often.''
</P>
<P>
This entire history is in urgent need of retelling today, at a time
when other legacies of the movement -- most notably legal abortion --
are under assault. Historical amnesia, not the fundamentalist
Christian right, is the true villain. Millions of young women and men
today simply cannot imagine what life was like before Roe vs. Wade any
more than they can imagine what it was like to be told ``No Women Need
Apply'' at the door to graduate-school classrooms.
</P>
<P>
The obligation to retell the truth belongs to my generation, young
enough to have reaped the benefits of the revolution begun by women
now in their 70s and 80s. It is our moral duty to ensure that the
history of our women's movement, unlike the history of 19th century
feminism, does not perish from the consciousness of the next
generation.
