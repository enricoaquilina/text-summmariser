ON FRIEDAN, A FEMINIST CRITIQUE
</P>
<P>
(BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In The Guardian, Germaine Greer took critical measure
of a fellow feminist, Betty Friedan, the author of "The
Feminine Mystique," who died on Feb. 4 at 85. (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
In its time, "The Feminine Mystique" was a book that spoke
to American women loud and clear. It was based on
a questionnaire Betty sent out to the women who were
at college with her in the 1950s, all "happily" married
and bringing up kids in the suburbs. Betty, who was
in the same boat, was feeling restless and dissatisfied. To
her immense relief and considerable surprise, she found that just
about all the women in the same situation who replied
to her questionnaire were feeling the same. Betty was not
one to realize that she was being lifted on an
existing wave; she thought she was the wave, that she
had actually created the Zeitgeist that was ready and hungry
for her book.

PANNING FOR TERRORISTS
</P>
<P>
(BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In "Of Wiretaps, Google Searches and Handguns," on
ABCNews.com, the mathematician John Allen Paulos took a statistical look
at government electronic surveillance, arguing that widespread wiretapping programs produce
so much information that it is essentially impossible to follow
up on the leads generated. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
Even if an accurate profile of potential terrorists is drawn, the
fact that such a vanishingly small percentage of us are
terrorists means that the vast majority of the people investigated
will be innocent. Even if the probability that the purported
terrorist profile is accurate were an astonishing 99 percent (if
someone has terrorist ties, the profile will pick him or
her out 99 percent of the time, and, for ease
of computation, if someone does not have such ties, the
profile will pick him or her out only 1 percent
of the time), most of the hits would be false
positives.
</P>
<P>
For illustration, let's further assume that one out of a million
American residents has terrorist ties -- that's approximately 300 people
-- and the profile will pick out 99 percent, or
297 of them. Great. But what of the approximately 300
million innocent Americans? The profile will also pick out 1
percent of them, "only" 3 million.

YOUR BRAIN ON SUPER BOWL ADS
</P>
<P>
(BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Edge.com has an article titled "Who Really Won
the Super Bowl?" by Dr. Marco Iacoboni, a neuroscientist at
the UCLA Ahmanson-Lovelace Brain Mapping Center. Iacoboni and his colleagues
used fast magnetic resonance imaging technology to observe brain responses
to commercials shown during the Super Bowl. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming winner among the Super Bowl ads is the Disney-NFL
"I am going to Disney" ad. The Disney ad elicited
strong responses in orbito-frontal cortex and ventral striatum, two brain
regions associated with processing of rewards. Also, the Disney ad
induced robust responses in mirror neuron areas, indicating identification and
empathy. Further, the circuit for cognitive control, encompassing anterior cingulate
cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, was highly active while watching
the Disney ad.
</P>
<P>
The three biggest flops seem to be the Burger King ad,
the FedEx ad and the GoDaddy ad. Three quite interesting
features that come out of this instant study are the
following: first, people -- when interviewed -- tend to say
what they are expected to say, but their brain seems
to say the opposite. For instance, female subjects may give
verbally very low "grades" to ads using actresses in sexy
roles, but their mirror neuron areas seem to fire up
quite a bit, suggesting some form of identification and empathy.
Second, we saw strong habituation effects, such that the second
time around the commercial induces much weaker responses. Third --
and this is probably interesting to neuroscientists -- among brain
regions associated with complex social behavior, we observed a mix
of activation and de-activation.
