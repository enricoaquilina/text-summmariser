Rereading Betty Friedan

Betty Friedan had a thing about floor care. Mopping
the linoleum, scrubbing the bathroom tile, vacuuming a mere twice
weekly -- this humdrum trope runs through ``The Feminine Mystique''
with the insistent drone of a ``new electric waxer over the spotless
kitchen floor.'' The relentless but unsatisfying demands of the
crumb-free floor encapsulated Friedan's famous ``problem that has no
name,'' the unspoken sense of dissatisfaction churning in the kitchens
of America and the minds of American women in the mid-20th century. As
Friedan summed it up, ``What kind of woman was she if she did not feel
this mysterious fulfillment waxing the kitchen floor?''
</P>
<P>
To which, on picking up ``The Feminine Mystique'' four decades
later, my initial response was: You're supposed to wax the floor?
</P>
<P>
I write this not to belittle Friedan's metaphor but rather to revel
in its obsolescence. For to reread the ``The Feminine Mystique,'' as I
did after Friedan's death last weekend, is to be reminded of the
transformation of American women -- indeed, American society -- in the
43 years since the publication of her then-shocking manifesto. There
have been remarkable advances, and not just in the technology of
no-wax floors.
</P>
<P>
This change -- the long way that women have, in fact, come -- is easy
to forget, in part because we are still picking our way unsteadily
along the path that Friedan helped cut, still enmeshed in
work-vs.-family debates that are at once stale and impassioned.
</P>
<P>
Women -- at least those with the luxury of choice -- agonize
endlessly over part-time vs. full-time vs. staying at home; whatever
option we select, we tend to second-guess the decision. We search for
the elusive holy grail of work-life balance -- off-ramps and on-ramps
and flextime and job-sharing. We alternate between acceptance and
despair at the still-inequitable allocation of family tasks. We have a
seat, more often, at the table, but are surprised, too often, to look
up and find no other women there. We choose the mommy track but lament
the glass ceiling.
</P>
<P>
All of which is to say: The role of women in the America of 2006 is
complicated and messy and not apt to be resolved anytime soon, if at
all. The more pertinent question, though, is: Compared to what? I can
argue that the glass now is half-empty or half-full, and I've done
both, depending mostly on how smoothly things are running in our
chaotic, grimy-floored household. But reentering the world of ``The
Feminine Mystique'' is an oddly comforting exercise in time travel.
</P>
<P>
In the long-gone world depicted by Friedan, the life of the
American woman is a cruelly binary one: The women she describes feel
forced to choose between work and home; their failure to be fully
contented with the latter is taken as evidence of neurosis, or worse.
</P>
<P>
``Each suburban wife struggled with it alone,'' Friedan writes in
her opening paragraph. ``As she made the beds, shopped for groceries,
matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her
children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband
at night -- she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question --
'Is this all?' '' And there is no contrary role model. ``I never knew
a woman, when I was growing up,'' Friedan writes, ``who used her mind,
played her own part in the world, and also loved, and had children.''
</P>
<P>
Friedan's diagnosis is characteristically, even offensively,
overblown: She compares housewives resigned to their suburban
imprisonment to inmates in ``their comfortable concentration camps.''
The feminine mystique, she says, ``has succeeded in burying millions
of American women alive.''
</P>
<P>
Yet her prescription for these women is remarkably un-strident,
even balanced. ``Marriage and motherhood are an essential part of
life, but not the whole of it,'' she writes. Women ``need to create a
new life plan, fitting in the love and children and home that have
defined femininity in the past with the work toward a greater purpose
that shapes the future.'' Friedan understood, as many of her more
radical successors did not, that work without family could feel as
empty as the converse.
</P>
<P>
I remember, not so long after ``The Feminine Mystique'' was
published -- and before, probably, I had even a bra to burn --
announcing definitively to my mother that I would not be having
children. My intention, I'm sure, was mostly to shock her; I suspected
even then that my preteen certitude might not last. But my declaration
derived in part from the prevailing mind-set that family was merely an
annoying impediment to anyone who wanted to do Serious Work.
</P>
<P>
Now that I am, thankfully, the mother I vowed I would never be, I
watch my children -- two daughters -- and wonder how they will manage
these tensions. And I find myself these days feeling oddly hopeful. At
dinner the other day, my fifth-grader eagerly described the bottle
rocket she was making in science class. As it happened, her group of
three was all girls; one's mother a research scientist, the other's a
partner in a major law firm. They had decorated their rocket, my
daughter said, with neon pink duct tape and named it ``Feminism.''
</P>
<P>
Somehow, I think, Betty Friedan would have been pleased.
