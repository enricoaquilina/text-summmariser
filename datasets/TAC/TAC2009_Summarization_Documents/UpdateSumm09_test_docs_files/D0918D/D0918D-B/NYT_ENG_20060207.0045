EDITORIAL: FRIEDAN EXPANDED WOMEN'S HORIZONS

Today should not pass without recalling the impact of Betty Friedan
and the profound changes triggered by her incisive appeal for
women to reject the "contented" homemaker role of the 1950s
and insist on fuller participation in American life.

Anyone younger than 45 will find it hard to believe that
scarcely a generation ago middle-class women did not aspire to
careers outside of teacher, nurse or secretary; that girls did
not play school sports; that raising kids and pleasing men
were considered to be a respectable woman's highest and only
callings.

The second wave of American feminism surely would have happened without
Friedan, who died over the weekend on her 85th birthday.
But her book "The Feminine Mystique" hit with explosive force
in 1963 and quickened the women's movement. Drawing from her
own unhappy Midwestern childhood, Friedan gave voice to "a strange
stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning that ... each
suburban wife struggled with ... alone. As she made the
beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter
sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay
beside her husband at night -- she was afraid to
ask even of herself the silent question -- 'Is this
all?' "

Within two decades, the American culture and economy had been transformed.
The entry of women into the workforce affected nearly everything
-- from fast food to freeway traffic, from marriage to
home design, from education to the deepening divides in politics
and religion over topics like abortion and "family values."
</P>

Although Friedan founded prominent women's rights organizations, led marches and was
famously cantankerous, she was a moderate in the movement, once
joking that it wasn't men that woman should reject, but
vacuum cleaners. Indeed, the mainstream values of nurture, home and
familial love were the foundation of her authority: She believed
that women should have equal rights, but not at the
expense of alienating men. Real love, she thought, could not
happen among unequals. For that she was dismissed as "bourgeois"
and pushed to the margins. In 1991 Susan Faludi accused
her of "yanking out the stitches in her own handiwork."
</P>
<P>
But perhaps because Friedan did not overreach, her appeals to justice
and common sense were more effective in transforming the lives
and prospects of American women. If you have a daughter,
you should today whisper a silent thanks for Betty Friedan's
life and work.
