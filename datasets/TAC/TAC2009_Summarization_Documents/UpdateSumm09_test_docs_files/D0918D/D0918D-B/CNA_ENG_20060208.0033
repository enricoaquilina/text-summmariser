It is still difficult for Taiwanese women to
strike a balance between their family lives and careers, the leaders
of various Taiwanese women's groups said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Paying tribute to the late pioneer of the modern U.S. feminist
movement Betty Friedan, who died Feb. 4, the leaders said Friedan's
ideals have had substantial impact on the women's movement in Taiwan,
but it is still difficult to implement Friedan's later aspiration to
have women succeed with both family lives and careers.
</P>
<P>
"Betty Friedan's most important heritage is her facilitation of
women's employment. However, the percentage of Taiwanese women in
employment is still low, even though the present 48 percent is a
record high, " PWR Foundation Chairwoman Liu Yu-hsiu said. The PWR
Foundation is Taiwan's leading women's group for promoting the
employment of women.
</P>
<P>
"But U.S. liberal feminists like Friedan completely ignored the
childcare issue, assuming childcare to be the responsibility of the
private individual. Taiwan also follows this model, and that makes it
difficult for mothers to seek employment," Liu added.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that to encourage mothers to remain in employment, it is
important that the government should provide comprehensive public and
affordable daycare service.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator-at-large Huang Sue-ying, also a leading women's
rights advocate, supported Liu's claim.
</P>
<P>
"One major hurdle for mothers seeking jobs is the childcare
issue. Whether the government provides a daycare support mechanism
for mothers at work is a decisive factor," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
"Another major hurdle is certain groups' attempts to make mothers
feel guilty about leaving their babies. They have created the
mystique that babies have to be cared for by their mothers, " she
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Huang pointed out that according to the latest Council of Labor
Affairs figures, 67 percent of children under the age of three are
cared for personally by their mothers, while over 20 percent are
raised by relatives and only about 10 percent are put into daycare
services. She said this shows the inadequacy of daycare services in
Taiwan and claimed that consequently, mothers are not confident
enough in these centers to leave their babies there.
</P>
<P>
Garden of Hope Foundation CEO Chi Hui-jung said that even in her
own organization, some female employees still choose to quit their
jobs and devote themselves completely to their children.
The foundation is Taiwan's leading women's group focusing on the
problems of adolescent girls.
</P>
<P>
"They would rather choose to spend all their time with their
children. Even if they want to work, they want something that is
part-time and close to their homes," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
"It is probably because Taiwanese couples are giving birth to
fewer children that mothers are willing to invest as much resources
and time as possible in their little ones," she added.
</P>
<P>
Chi said some other female employees may decide to take leave of
absence to look after their babies for a year or two. Although the
foundation grants the leave, it offers no guarantee that their jobs
will still be there when the employees want to return.
</P>
<P>
There are also incidences of female employees refusing promotions
for fear of work consuming too much of their family time, Chi said.
</P>
<P>
"Although women can have day jobs now, they are still not
relieved of their family duties. Wives still spend more time doing
housework than their husbands. What I see is that women often pay a
higher price than their husbands to keep their jobs, " Chi said.
