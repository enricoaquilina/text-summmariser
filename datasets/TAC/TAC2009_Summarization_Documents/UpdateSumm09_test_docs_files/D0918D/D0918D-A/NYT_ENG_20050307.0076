X'ED OUT: WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ANTIPORN FEMINISTS?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last month, Adelphia Communications became the first American cable company to
offer its subscribers triple-X-rated pornography. Adelphia's role as porn pioneer
struck some as a bit unlikely: Five years ago the
company had dropped Spice, a popular softcore pornography channel, because
the company's since-disgraced founder and CEO, John Rigas, found it
offensive. Asked about the reversal, a company spokeswoman replied succinctly,
"People want it, so we are trying to provide it.
The more Xs, the more popular."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, revenues from pay-per-view and video-on-demand adult movies have quadrupled since
the late 1990s as cable operators have started airing more
explicit erotic material. And it's not just cable television that's
embraced the truly lewd. Movies like "Boogie Nights" and the
recent documentary "Inside Deep Throat" have portrayed the adult industry
as an enclave for good-hearted, rough-edged misfits and cultural freedom
fighters. Last fall the memoir of porn superstar Jenna Jameson
spent a month and a half on the New York
Times bestseller list. And the industry itself continues to grow
at a torrid pace: Hard numbers are difficult to find,
but estimates put it at anywhere from a $3 billion
to $14 billion a year industry.
</P>
<P>
In response, a predictable political debate has emerged, with cultural conservatives
standing athwart the tide yelling "Stop!" while left-leaning civil libertarians
brandish the First Amendment. But there's a voice that's been
conspicuously absent in the current debate: anti-pornography feminists.
</P>
<P>
In "Inside Deep Throat," it is prominent feminists like Gloria Steinem
and Susan Brownmiller, as much as decency crusaders like Charles
Keating, who get credit for shutting down the nationwide porn
party that "Deep Throat" kicked off in 1972. "The worst
censors in the country," Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz says
in an onscreen interview, "were the feminists." The characterization is
of a piece with the documentary's cartoony glibness. Still, today,
as social conservatives lead the campaign to rid the airwaves
of the taint of sex, it's easy to forget that
the most powerful anti-pornography legislation ever passed in this country
was written not by cultural conservatives but radical feminists led
by legal scholar Catharine A. MacKinnon and author Andrea Dworkin.
</P>
<P>
MacKinnon and Dworkin's efforts depended on support from notorious bluenoses like
Phyllis Schlafly and former attorney general Edwin Meese. But the
two women's brief against pornography went beyond simply attacking its
lasciviousness. They argued that its aestheticized visions of female degradation
actually incited men to violence. In 1974 the writer and
activist Robin Morgan had put it most starkly: "Pornography is
the theory, rape is the practice."
</P>
<P>
MacKinnon and Dworkin's antipornography statutes-which passed in Indianapolis and Bellingham, Wash.,
and were defeated in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and Cambridge-made little
use of obscenity standards and instead reframed the issue as
one of sex discrimination. While their bills didn't ban porn
outright, they allowed women to sue pornographers for damages.
</P>
<P>
And those damages, the anti-porn feminists argued, weren't merely abstract. During
the debates over the local ordinances, and in testimony before
Edwin Meese's Commission on Pornography in 1985, MacKinnon and others
arranged for often horrifying testimony by women on the physical
and mental abuse they had suffered either in the making
of pornography or at the hands of men they claimed
had been inspired by it. Some of the most dramatic
testimony was from Linda Lovelace, star of "Deep Throat."
</P>
<P>
So what happened to those voices? Now a law professor at
the University of Michigan, MacKinnon has a new book out
this month, "Women's Lives, Men's Laws" (Belknap), which includes essays
and speeches on pornography, but in recent years she and
Dworkin seem to have lost not just the legal battle
but the cultural war. These days, "sex-positive" feminists like Laura
Kipnis or Camille Paglia tend to get the airtime. And
in the universities, women's studies scholars are more likely to
do close readings of the aesthetics and politics of pornography
than to march in favor of banning it.
</P>
<P>
Even at the time, MacKinnon and Dworkin's campaign sharply split the
feminist movement. While supported by leading figures like Steinem and
Brownmiller, the Indianapolis law in particular galvanized others in opposition.
They formed the Feminist Anti-Censorship Taskforce, or FACT. When the
law's constitutionality was being decided by a federal appeals court,
FACT submitted an amicus brief-signed by Betty Friedan, Rita Mae
Brown, Kate Millet, Adrienne Rich and others-opposing it.
</P>
<P>
Torn between the conflicting arguments, the National Organization of Women was
unable to take a position. MacKinnon's description of her opponents,
in a 1987 speech, was typical of the heated rhetoric:
"The Black movement has Uncle Toms and Oreo cookies. The
labor movement had scabs. The women's movement has FACT."
</P>
<P>
Starting in the late 1980s some feminist scholars also began to
see porn as a tool that women could appropriate to
liberate themselves from patriarchal norms of behavior and beauty. Porn
sexuality, they argued, wasn't simply about subjugation. Instead, "what pornography
is trying to do is create, using real bodies, a
fantasy of a kind of idealized and perfectly abundant pleasure,"
says Linda Williams, a film studies professor at the University
of California, Berkeley, and a leading porn theorist. What others
might see as basically a masturbatory aid was cast instead
as a genre of utopian social criticism. As for the
anti-porn crusaders, Williams adds: "Really, who are they to tell
us where our sexual imaginations should go?"
</P>
<P>
So it was a deeply divided feminist movement that faced the
failure of MacKinnon and Dworkin's laws, not only in places
like Los Angeles and Cambridge, but when they were eventually
struck down by federal courts in both Indiana and Washington.
As Joshua Cohen, an MIT political science professor who has
studied the First Amendment ramifications of the laws, puts it,
"A lot of the energy that went into the issue
during the 1980s was focused on these legal strategies." When
they failed, he says, "It became pretty clear that legal
regulations directed to stop pornography were not going to be
accepted by the courts, and that probably sapped some of
the energy from the anti-pornography movement."
</P>
<P>
Even where they did survive, the laws had unintended and often
crudely ironic consequences. In Canada, which in 1992 adopted MacKinnon
and Dworkin's definition of pornography, it was used largely to
prosecute gay and lesbian bookstores and even to seize copies
of two of Dworkin's books because they "illegally eroticized pain
and bondage."
</P>
<P>
Today, Mackinnon bristles at the old charge that anti-porn feminists were,
in effect, in bed with the political right. "I actually
know who I'm in bed with," she said in a
recent interview. "This was just something created by the pornographers
to scare liberals off, which doesn't take much."
</P>
<P>
But her language has been adopted by some on the right.
Now, according to Janet LaRue of Concerned Women for America,
"It may be that we're not hearing as much from
the traditional hardline feminist organizations, but when I write and
speak on the topic of pornography, one of the aspects
that I point out is that it certainly subjugates and
degrades women and reduces us to the sum or our
body parts."
</P>
<P>
But perhaps it's porn's very ubiquity that has most weakened the
anti-pornography case, feminist and conservative. Thanks to the growth of
home-video pornography in the 1980s and the more recent shift
to the Internet, far more people have access to X-rated
material than ever before. As Williams puts it, "In a
way I think MacKinnon and Dworkin were able to invoke
the kind of horror that they did at pornography at
a time when not as many people had seen it.
For better or for worse, now it has become part
of the vernacular of our way of talking about picturing
sex to ourselves."
</P>
<P>
MacKinnon agrees, though she sees the shift as more insidious: "The
data just show that pornography sets community standards, so the
more pornography there is, the less will be seen to
be wrong with it. It's just its own intrinsic dynamic."
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent backlash against television indecency, pornography prosecutions remain rare.
The Bush administration has picked up the pace from the
Clinton administration, creating a special anti-porn unit in the Department
of Justice and hiring Bruce Taylor, the prosecutor who went
after Larry Flynt in 1981, as its porn czar. Last
month, the Justice Department announced that it would appeal a
recent decision by a federal judge that declared federal obscenity
laws unconstitutional. And speaking earlier this week, the new attorney
general, Alberto Gonzales, listed "the aggressive prosecution of purveyors of
obscene materials" among his top priorities.
</P>
<P>
Still, Frederick Schauer, a First Amendment scholar at Harvard's Kennedy School
of Government, points out that "criminal obscenity prosecutions have come
close to disappearing, they're constitutionally permissible but almost nonexistent.... The
legal definition of obscenity remains very, very, very narrow."
</P>
<P>
As for MacKinnon, since the early 1990s she has focused on
international issues like prostitution, human trafficking, and war crimes. (In
2000, she won a war crimes conviction against the Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic for the rape of Muslim and
Croat women during the Bosnian War.) But she says pornography
is still a central issue for her.
</P>
<P>
"Until a problem is solved, it's always a good time to
solve it," she says. "Whether people want to solve it
is another question."
