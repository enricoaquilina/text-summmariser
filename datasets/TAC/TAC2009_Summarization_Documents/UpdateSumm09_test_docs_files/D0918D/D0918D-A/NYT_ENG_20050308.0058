IS HILLARY'S NOMINATION INEVITABLE?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hillary '08. The inevitability campaign now underway demonstrates everything bad about
modern American politics.
</P>
<P>
Two months into George W. Bush's second term as president, a
cadre of Hillary Clinton supporters is trying to lock up
the Democratic presidential nomination for New York's junior senator. One
supporter is her husband, former president Bill Clinton, who declares
that his wife would make an excellent president. Senator Joseph
Biden of Delaware also predicts "she is likely to be
the nominee."
</P>
<P>
So, case closed? No other Democrats need apply? That is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
For once, some political insiders are trying to put the fix
in for a woman for president. But a smoke-filled room
of political power brokers handpicking a female presidential nominee is
no more appealing than one that selects one of the
boys. And it is likely to be just as inefficient
when it comes to choosing a winner.
</P>
<P>
Democratic loyalists exerted all their influence to derail former Vermont governor
Howard Dean and make Massachusetts Senator John Kerry the party
nominee in 2004. With help from Dean and voters in
Iowa and New Hampshire, they succeeded. Then Kerry lost in
November.
</P>
<P>
Hillary Clinton has a strong case to make to Democrats and
independents. She is a celebrity politician who can raise money.
Early polls put her ahead of Kerry and other Democratic
presidential hopefuls. Results from one recent poll showed that six
in 10 voters believe that the United States is ready
for a female president, and 53 percent thought Hillary Clinton
should try for the job.
</P>
<P>
She has the next three years to build her case {ndash}
and so should other Democrats with different ideas about party
direction and agenda.
</P>
<P>
As a couple, the Clintons are skilled at political repositioning. Right
now it's all about grabbing the middle, as defined by
the 2004 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Hillary Clinton went public with the view that avoiding abortion is
the correct goal for prochoice advocates. She reached out to
religious conservatives with an endorsement of faith-based initiatives. With her
2006 reelection campaign approaching, she is wooing New York Republicans.
She backs the Bush doctrine in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As for Bill Clinton, at the request of President George W.
Bush, he is leading the US tsunami relief effort with
former President George H.W. Bush. On their tour of tsunami
damage in Southeast Asia, Clinton allowed the elder Bush to
sleep on the plane's only bed while he stretched out
on the floor, according to Newsweek. In this instance, Clinton's
dedication to the cause could be viewed as a political
two-fer: tsunami relief and Hillary '08. It projects a beautiful
photo-op to red state America. But is it beautiful enough
to make Clinton-haters forget why they hate the Clintons?
</P>
<P>
To believe that is naive. It also fails to acknowledge the
GOP's well-established path to victory. Republican campaign strategists create their
own image of the Democratic challenger; they do not accept
the image promoted by the opposition. The GOP-inspired image is
seared into voters' minds through relentless advertising, talking points, and
conservative talking heads. So far, Democrats have not come up
with a successful antidote.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, Republicans {ndash} with help from the Democratic candidate {ndash}
made sure the Democratic nominee was John Kerry, flip-flopper and
Vietnam War protester, not John Kerry, political centrist and Vietnam
War hero.
</P>
<P>
If Hillary Clinton is the Democratic presidential nominee in 2008, the
GOP will run against Hillary Clinton as defined by the
GOP, not as defined by the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
In the end, the Clintons may be resilient and resourceful enough
to beat back Republican spin doctors. They certainly have experience
doing so. But no one should be fooled into believing
that electing a woman generally and Hillary Clinton specifically will
happen easily. It will take hundreds of millions of dollars,
tremendous will, and ugly political warfare.
</P>
<P>
In remarks following a recent speech at Wellesley College, Hillary Clinton's
alma mater, feminist Betty Friedan scoffed at the notion of
a presidential face-off between two women, Clinton and Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice. "It will never happen," she said.
</P>
<P>
It might; in politics, anything can happen. But it's too early
to pick a presidential candidate and way too early to
try to dictate who should be a party's presidential nominee.
