BETTY FRIEDAN, 85, FEMINIST WRITER AND ICON
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Betty Friedan, the feminist crusader and author whose searing first book,
"The Feminine Mystique," ignited the contemporary women's movement in 1963
and in so doing permanently transformed the social fabric of
the United States and countries around the world, died Saturday,
her 85th birthday, at her home in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The cause was congestive heart failure, said Emily Bazelon, a family
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
With its impassioned yet clear-eyed analysis of the issues that affected
women's lives in the decades after World War II --
including enforced domesticity, limited career prospects and, as chronicled in
later editions, the campaign for legalized abortion -- "The Feminine
Mystique" is widely regarded as one of the most influential
nonfiction books of the 20th century. Published by W.W. Norton
&amp; Co., the book had sold more than 3 million
copies by the year 2000 and has been translated into
many foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
For decades a familiar presence on television and the lecture circuit,
Friedan, with her short stature, round figure, protuberant nose and
deeply hooded eyes, looked for much of her adult life
like a "combination of Hermione Gingold and Bette Davis," as
Judy Klemesrud wrote in The New York Times Magazine in
1970.
</P>
<P>
"The Feminine Mystique" made Friedan world famous. It also made her
one of the chief architects of the women's liberation movement
of the late 1960s and afterward, a sweeping social upheaval
that harked back to the suffrage campaigns of the turn
of the century and would be called feminism's second wave.
</P>
<P>
In 1966, Friedan helped found the National Organization for Women, serving
as its first president. In 1969, she was a founder
of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws,
now known as Naral Pro-Choice America. With Gloria Steinem and
Bella Abzug, she founded the Women's Political Caucus in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Though in later years, some feminists dismissed Friedan's work as outmoded,
a great many aspects of modern life that seem routine
today -- from unisex Help Wanted ads to women in
politics, medicine, the clergy and the military -- are the
direct result of the hard-won advances she helped women attain.
</P>
<P>
A brilliant student who had graduated summa cum laude from Smith
College in 1942, Friedan had trained as a psychologist but
had never pursued a career in the field. When she
wrote "The Feminine Mystique," she was a suburban housewife and
mother who supplemented her husband's income by writing freelance articles
for women's magazines.
</P>
<P>
Though Friedan was not generally considered a lyrical stylist, "The Feminine
Mystique," read today, is as mesmerizing as it was more
than four decades ago:
</P>
<P>
"Gradually, without seeing it clearly for quite a while, I came
to realize that something is very wrong with the way
American women are trying to lives their lives today," Friedan
wrote in the opening line of the preface. "I sensed
it first as a question mark in my own life,
as a wife and mother of three small children, half-guiltily,
and therefore half-heartedly, almost in spite of myself, using my
abilities and education in work that took me away from
home."
</P>
<P>
The words have the hypnotic pull of a fairy tale, and
for the next 400 pages, Friedan identifies, dissects and damningly
indicts one of the most pervasive folk beliefs of postwar
American life: the myth of suburban women's domestic fulfillment she
came to call the feminine mystique.
</P>
<P>
Drawing on history, psychology, sociology and economics, as well as on
interviews she conducted with women across the country, Friedan charted
the gradual metamorphosis of the American woman from the independent,
career-minded New Woman of the 1920s and '30s into the
vacant, aproned housewife of the postwar years.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The portrait she painted was chilling. For a typical woman of
the 1950s, even a college-educated one, life centered almost exclusively
on chores and children. She cooked and baked and bandaged
and chauffeured and laundered and sewed. She did the mopping
and the marketing and took her husband's gray flannel suit
to the cleaners. She was happy to keep his dinner
warm till he came wearily home from downtown.
</P>
<P>
The life she led, if educators, psychologists and the media were
to be believed, was the fulfillment of every women's most
ardent dream. Yet she was unaccountably tired, impatient with the
children, craving something that neither marital sex nor extramarital affairs
could satisfy. Her thoughts sometimes turned to suicide. She consulted
a spate doctors and psychiatrists, who prescribed charity work, bowling
and bridge. If those failed, there were always tranquilizers to
get her through her day.
</P>
<P>
A Nebraska housewife with a Ph.D. in anthropology whom Friedan interviewed
told her:
</P>
<P>
"A film made of any typical morning in my house would
look like an old Marx Brothers comedy. I wash the
dishes, rush the older children off to school, dash out
in the yard to cultivate the chrysanthemums, run back in
to make a phone call about a committee meeting, help
the youngest child build a blockhouse, spend fifteen minutes skimming
the newspapers so I can be well-informed, then scamper down
to the washing machines where my thrice-weekly laundry includes enough
clothes to keep a primitive village going for an entire
year. By noon I'm ready for a padded cell. Very
little of what I've done has been really necessary or
important. Outside pressures lash me though the day. Yet I
look upon myself as one of the more relaxed housewives
in the neighborhood."

<P>
"The Feminine Mystique" began as a survey Friedan conducted in 1957
for the 15th reunion of her graduating class at Smith.
It was intended to refute a prevailing postwar myth: that
higher education kept women from adapting to their roles as
wives and mothers. Judging from her own capable life, Friedan
expected her classmates to describe theirs as similarly well adjusted.
But what she discovered in the women's responses was something
far more complex, and more troubling -- a "nameless, aching
dissatisfaction" that she would famously call "the problem that has
no name."
</P>
<P>
When Friedan sent the same questionnaire to graduates of Radcliff and
other colleges, and later interviewed scores of women personally, the
results were the same. The women's answers gave her the
seeds of her book. They also forced her to confront
the painful limitations of her own suburban idyll.
</P>
<P>
Bettye Naomi Goldstein was born on Feb. 4, 1921, in Peoria,
Ill. Her father, Harry, was an immigrant from Russia who
parlayed a street-corner collar-button business into a prosperous downtown jewelry
store. Her gifted, imperious mother, Miriam, had been the editor
of the women's page of the local newspaper before giving
up her job for marriage and children. Only years later,
when she was writing "The Feminine Mystique," did Friedan come
to see her mother's cold, critical demeanor as masking a
deep bitterness at giving up the work she loved.
</P>
<P>
Growing up brainy, Jewish, outspoken and, by the standards of the
time, unlovely, Bettye was ostracized. She was barred from the
fashionable sororities at her Peoria high school and rarely asked
on dates. It was an experience, she would later say,
that made her identify with people on the margins of
society.
</P>
<P>
At Smith, she blossomed. For the first time, she could be
as smart as she wanted, as impassioned as she wanted
and as loud as she wanted, and for four happy
years she was all those things. Betty received her bachelor's
degree in 1942 -- by that time she had dropped
the final "e," which she considered an affectation of her
mother's -- and accepted a fellowship to the University of
California, Berkeley, for graduate work in psychology.
</P>
<P>
At Berkeley, she studied with the renowned psychologist Erik Erikson, among
others. She won a second fellowship, even more prestigious than
the first, that would allow her to continue for doctorate.
But she was dating a young physicist who felt threatened
by her success. He pressured her to turn down the
fellowship, and she did, an experience she would later recount
frequently in interviews. She also turned down the physicist, returning
home to Peoria before moving to Greenwich Village in New
York.
</P>
<P>
There, Friedan worked as an editor at The Federated Press, a
small news service that provided stories to labor newspapers nationwide.
In 1946, she took a job as a reporter with
U.E. News, the weekly publication of the United Electrical, Radio
and Machine Workers of America. In 1947, she married Carl
Friedan, a theater director who later became an advertising executive.
They started a family and moved to a rambling Victorian
house in suburban Rockland County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
Betty Friedan, whose marriage would end in divorce in 1969, is
survived by their three children, Daniel Friedan of Princeton, N.J.;
Emily Friedan of Buffalo, N.Y.; and Jonathan Friedan of Philadelphia;
a brother, Harry Goldstein, of Palm Springs, Calif., and Purchase,
N.Y.; a sister, Amy Adams, of New York City; and
nine grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
"The Feminine Mystique" had the misfortune to appear during a newspaper
printers' strike. The reviews that appeared afterward ran the gamut
from bewildered to outraged to cautiously laudatory. Some critics also
felt that Friedan had insufficiently acknowledged her debt to Simone
de Beauvoir, whose 1949 book, "The Second Sex," dealt with
many of the same issues.
</P>
<P>
Writing in The New York Times Book Review in April 1963,
Lucy Freeman called "The Feminine Mystique" a "highly readable, provocative
book," but went on to question its basic premise, writing,
of Friedan:
</P>
<P>
"Sweeping generalities, in which this book necessarily abounds, may hold a
certain amount of truth but often obscure the deeper issues.
It is superficial to blame the 'culture' and its handmaidens,
the women's magazines, as she does. What is to stop
a woman who is interested in national and international affairs
from reading magazines that deal with those subjects? To paraphrase
a famous line, 'The fault, dear Mrs. Friedan, is not
in our culture, but in ourselves."'
</P>
<P>
Among readers, however, the response to the book was so overwhelming
that Friedan realized she needed more than words to address
the condition of women's lives. After moving back to Manhattan
with her family, she was determined to start a progressive
organization that would be the equivalent, as she often said,
of an NAACP for women.
</P>
<P>
In 1966, Friedan and a group of colleagues founded the National
Organization for Women. She was its president until 1970.
</P>
<P>
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
One of NOW's most visible public actions was the Women's Strike
For Equality, held on Aug. 26, 1970, in New York
and in cities around the country. In New York, tens
of thousands of woman marched down Fifth Avenue, with Friedan
in the lead. (Before the march, she made a point
of lunching at Whyte's, a downtown restaurant formerly open to
men only.)
</P>
<P>
Carrying signs and banners ("Don't Cook Dinner -- Starve a Rat
Tonight!" "Don't Iron while the Strike Is Hot"), women of
all ages, along with a number of sympathetic men, marched
joyfully down the street to cheering crowds. The march ended
with a rally in Bryant Park, behind the New York
Public Library, with passionate speeches by Friedan, Steinem, Abzug and
Kate Millett.
</P>
<P>
Not all of Friedan's ventures were as successful. The First Women's
Bank and Trust Co., which she helped found in 1973,
is no longer in business. Nor were even her indomitable
presence and relentless energy enough to secure passage of the
Equal Rights Amendment.
</P>
<P>
Though widely respected as a modern-day heroine, Friedan was by no
means universally beloved, even -- or perhaps especially -- by
members of the women's movement. She was famously abrasive. She
could be thin-skinned and imperious, subject to screaming fits of
temperament.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s and afterward, some feminists criticized Friedan for focusing
almost exclusively on the concerns of middle-class married white women
and ignoring those of women of color, lesbians and the
poor. Some called her retrograde for insisting that women could,
and should, live in collaborative partnership with men.
</P>
<P>
Friedan's private life was also famously stormy. In her recent memoir,
"Life So Far" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000), she accused her
husband of being physically abusive during their marriage, writing that
he sometimes gave her black eyes, which she concealed with
make-up at public events and on television.
</P>
<P>
Carl Friedan has repeatedly denied the accusations. In an interview with
Time magazine in 2000, shortly after the memoir's publication, he
called Friedan's account a "complete fabrication." He added: "I am
the innocent victim of a drive-by shooting by a reckless
driver savagely aiming at the whole male gender."
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Betty Friedan's other books include "It Changed My Life: Writings on
the Women's Movement" (Random House, 1976); "The Second Stage" (Summit,
1981); and "The Fountain of Age" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993).
</P>
<P>
The recipient of many awards and honorary degrees, she was a
visiting professor at universities around the country, among them Columbia,
Temple and the University of Southern California. In recent years,
Friedan was associated with the Institute for Women and Work
at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
Despite all of her later achievements, Friedan would be forever known
as the suburban housewife who started a revolution with "The
Feminine Mystique." Rarely has a single book been responsible for
such sweeping, tumultuous and continuing social transformation.
</P>
<P>
The new society Friedan proposed, founded on the notion that men
and women were created equal, represented such a drastic upending
of the prevailing social norms that over the years to
come, she would be forced to explain her position again
and again.
</P>
<P>
"Some people think I'm saying, 'Women of the world unite --
you have nothing to lose but your men,"' she told
Life magazine in 1963. "It's not true. You have nothing
to lose but your vacuum cleaners."
