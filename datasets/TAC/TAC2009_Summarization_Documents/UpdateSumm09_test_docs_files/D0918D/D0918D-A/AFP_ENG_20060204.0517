 Betty Friedan, a founder of the 
modern feminist movement in the United States, died here Saturday of 
congestive heart failure, feminist leaders announced. She was 85. 
</P>
<P>
Friedan achieved prominence in l963 with the publication of her 
book "The Feminine Mystique," which detailed the lives of American 
women who were expected to find fulfillment through the achievements 
of their husbands and children.
</P>
<P>
The book sparked a movement for a re-evaluation of women's role 
in American society and is credited with laying the foundation of 
modern feminism.
</P>
<P>
She was a founder of the National Organization for Women and a 
leading advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment, a proposed amendment 
to the US constitution banning sex-based discrimination, women's 
rights activists said.

<P>
"The movement that Friedan's energy sparked continues to grow, 
and is bigger today than she could ever have dreamed when she helped 
launch it in the 1960s," Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist 
Majority Foundation and a former president of the National 
Organization for Women, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
She said many of the advances for women and girls that Americans 
celebrate and enjoy today "would not have been possible without her 
determination and pioneering spirit to challenge the inequities when 
others dared not speak."
