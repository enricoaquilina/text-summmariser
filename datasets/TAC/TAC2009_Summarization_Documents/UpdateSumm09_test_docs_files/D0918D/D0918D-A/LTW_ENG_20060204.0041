Betty Friedan, Voice of Feminism's 'Second Wave,' Dies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Betty Friedan, the writer, thinker and activist who almost
single-handedly revived feminism with her 1963 book ``The Feminine
Mystique,'' died of congestive heart failure Saturday, her 85th
birthday, at her home in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Her insights into what she described as the soul-draining
frustrations felt by educated, stay-at-home women in the 1950s, ``the
problem that has no name,'' startled a society that expected women to
be happy with marriage and children. Her book became an instant and
controversial bestseller, and Friedan became the leading spokeswoman
for a revitalized women's movement.
</P>
<P>
One of the most recognized names and faces of the late 20th
century, Friedan pushed for equal pay, sex-neutral help-wanted ads,
maternity leave, child-care centers for working parents, legal
abortion and many other topics considered radical in the 1960s and
1970s.
</P>
<P>
Impatient that the federal government, in implementing the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, did not appear to be taking equal pay for women
seriously enough, she helped found in 1966 the National Organization
for Women, the largest and most effective organization in the women's
movement, and served as its first president. She led the
500,000-person Women's Strike for Equality in New York in 1970, on the
50th anniversary of women winning the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
She was a founder of the National Women's Political Caucus in the
1970s and of the abortion rights organization now known as NARAL-Pro
Choice America. She was an organizer and director of the First Women's
Bank and Trust.
</P>
<P>
``Many of us think of her as one of the mothers of the modern
women's movement,'' said Kim Gandy, NOW president. ``She played a very
pivotal, very critical role in launching the second wave of the modern
women's movement.''
</P>
<P>
``She was a giant in the 20th century for women and most
significantly was a catalyst for change in the American culture,''
said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation.
``She defined the problem, and then she had the courage to do
something about it.''
</P>
<P>
Friedan's was a voice that was loud, insistent and sometimes
divisive. She split with NOW in the 1970s after she came to believe
that the organization focused too many resources on lesbian issues and
that too many feminists hated men. Her 1981 book ``The Second Stage''
prompted some feminists to denounce her as reactionary.
</P>
<P>
Her 2000 memoir, ``Life So Far,'' said that her husband, Carl, beat
her during their marriage. He strenuously objected, and Friedan
amended the declaration to say that both of them fought physically
during their marriage, which ended in divorce in 1969. He died this
December.
</P>
<P>
She turned to other issues, focusing on ageism, family issues and
economic empowerment. ``It isn't that I have stopped being a feminist,
but women as a special separate interest group are not my concern
anymore,'' she said in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Friedan's cousin, Emily Bazelon, said: ``Her feminism was an aspect
of her humanism, and she really cared about the economic well-being of
families and of all people,'' Bazelon said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bettye Goldstein was born Feb. 4, 1921, in Peoria, Ill., the Jewish
daughter of an immigrant jeweler and a mother who quit her job as an
editor of the local newspaper's women's pages to become a homemaker.
She later said she felt like an outsider from childhood. She skipped
second grade and was a high school valedictorian, then moved 1,000
miles east to attend Smith College. She edited the college newspaper
and graduated summa cum laude in 1942.
</P>
<P>
She did graduate work at the University of California at Berkeley
but turned down a prestigious fellowship in psychology, afraid of
outperforming her then boyfriend. After the romance broke up, she gave
up graduate work and moved to New York's Greenwich Village to work for
a labor newspaper. She married and had a child, but when she became
pregnant with a second child, she was fired.
</P>
<P>
Struggling as a freelance writer, she found that the editors of
women's magazines deleted references to her subjects' interests
outside the home, telling Friedan that the readers did not want to
explore those topics. She was grinding away on a survey of her Smith
College classmates upon their 15-year reunion, when she added a few
questions and said she discovered that the highly educated and
talented housewives in their mid-30s were dissatisfied and distraught,
drugged by tranquilizers, misled by psychoanalysis and ignored by
society.
</P>
<P>
No magazine would publish her article. Five years later, after
significantly more work, she published ``The Feminine Mystique'' as a
book and ``pulled the trigger on history,'' as futurist Alvin Toffler
said. She pitched it on ``The Jack Paar Show,'' she did
question-and-answer interviews in magazines and she took every
opportunity to alert the world to the crisis she perceived. The book
eventually sold more than 2 million copies in paperback and remains a
staple of college history courses.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Horowitz, a Smith College professor who wrote ``Betty
Friedan and the Making of the Feminist Mystique,'' said that although
Friedan presented herself at the time as a housewife who had an
``aha!'' moment, her ideas were partly rooted in the humanistic
psychology that she studied at Smith.
</P>
<P>
She shared a Feb. 4 birthday with Rosa Parks, and both Friedan and
Coretta Scott King were at the convention of the Progressive Party in
Philadelphia in 1948, he said.
</P>
<P>
``All three of them have their political roots in the struggles for
social justice, for African Americans, for women and for working
people in the 1940s. Friedan was deeply embedded in and engaged with
issues raised on the left in the labor union movement,'' Horowitz said
Saturday. ``In 1943, she wrote, 'Men, there's a revolution brewing in
the American kitchen.' ''
</P>
<P>
During the next several decades, the highly recognizable Friedan
was often seen in demonstrations, protest marches and news
conferences. She suffered insults, not just for her ideas, but for her
appearance, which she readily admitted was ``not pretty.''
</P>
<P>
``That great head, the hooded eyes, the broad features of a woman
the French might describe as une jolie-laide@, which refers to a
magnificent kind of ugliness that can be attractive, even beautiful,''
wrote Washington Post reporter Megan Rosenfeld in 1995. ``The head,
looking sometimes like a snapping turtle and at others like a lion
with a white mane, sits atop a surprisingly short body, out of which
comes the voice of a foghorn in heat. She is always carefully dressed
in a New Yorky, nouveau-Bohemian style, with lots of interesting
jewelry and spunky little shoes. (She loves to shop, say her
friends.)''
</P>
<P>
Never an organization person, she alienated many who worked with
her by insisting on holding the floor, claiming credit and running
roughshod over her assistants. She insisted that the women's movement
remain in the mainstream of American life, objecting to the
``bra-burning, anti-man, politics-of-orgasm school.'' Younger leaders
took over NOW, and after the publication of ``The Second Stage,''
authors as different as Susan Brownmiller and Susan Faludi accused her
of reversing the revolution.
</P>
<P>
Friedan declared herself past feminism and went to work on ageism,
publishing ``The Fountain of Age'' in 1993. But she never entirely
left the feminist field, showing up at the 1977 National Women's
Conference in Houston to second a resolution on lesbian rights,
teaching at numerous colleges, including the University of Southern
California, and serving on the White House Conference on the Family.
</P>
<P>
She lived in New York City and Washington and had a summer home in
Sag Harbor, N.Y. Bazelon said services will be held Monday at
Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York.
</P>
<P>
Survivors include three children, Daniel Friedan of Princeton,
N.J., Jonathan Friedan of Philadelphia and Emily Friedan of Buffalo,
N.Y.; a brother and sister; and nine grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
``She's leaving a legacy that's living beyond even her wildest
dreams in the '60s,'' Smeal said. ``She wanted to change the world,
and she did.''
