Visionary Feminist Betty Friedan, 85, Dies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Betty Friedan, the visionary, combative feminist who launched a
social revolution with her provocative 1963 book, ``The Feminine
Mystique,'' died Saturday, which was her 85th birthday. Friedan died
of congestive heart failure at her home in Washington, D.C., according
to Emily Bazelon, a cousin who was speaking for the family. She said
Friedan had been in failing health for some time.
</P>
<P>
Her best-selling book identified ``the problem that has no name,''
the unhappiness of post-World War II American women unfulfilled by
traditional notions of female domesticity.
</P>
<P>
Melding sociology and humanistic psychology, the book became the
cornerstone of one of the last century's most profound movements,
unleashing the first full flowering of American feminism since the
1800s.
</P>
<P>
It gave Friedan, an obscure suburban New York housewife and
freelance writer, the mantle to meet with popes and heads of state and
to lead an international movement that would shake up marriage and the
workplace, politics and education.
</P>
<P>
She founded the National Organization for Women in 1966, making it
the first new feminist organization in a half century. She also was
among the founders of the National Women's Political Caucus and the
group that became the National Abortion Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
``I never set out to write a book to change women's lives, to
change history,'' said Friedan, who always kept a sense of wonder
about her place in history as the mother of the contemporary women's
movement.
</P>
<P>
``It's like, `Who, me?' Yes, me. I did it. And I'm not that
different from other women. . . .Maybe my power and glory was that I
could speak my truth as a woman and it was the truth of every woman.''
</P>
<P>
Friedan's affinity with mainstream values was the foundation of her
authority. Her emphatic belief that women should have equal rights --
but not at the expense of alienating men -- distinguished her from
many feminist leaders who emerged later.
</P>
<P>
``She found that love between unequals can never succeed,'' Gloria
Steinem once said, ``and she has undertaken the immense job of
bringing up the status of women so love can succeed.''
</P>
<P>
Her more moderate brand of feminism, combined with her often
irascible nature, led to ruptures with other movement leaders, such as
Steinem and the late Bella Abzug. Some feminists eventually denounced
her as a reactionary.
</P>
<P>
By the 1980s, feminism had ceased being her primary focus, and she
spent her last decades focused on issues of aging, families, work and
public policy.

</P>
<P>
Friedan did not conform to conventional notions of feminine beauty
or decorum.She was loud, fast-talking, impatient and abrasive.
</P>
<P>
She remained formidable in her old age. Even as she was approaching
80 and enjoying her role as doting grandmother of nine, she could
demolish interviewers who asked what she considered inane questions.
</P>
<P>
Friedan, from Peoria, Ill., was born Bettye Goldstein on Feb. 4,
1921, the year after American women won the right to vote. She was the
oldest of three children of Harry Goldstein, a Russian Jewish jewelry
store owner, and the former Miriam Horwitz.
</P>
<P>
Betty (who later dropped the ``e'' from the end of her first name)
was precocious and skipped a year of school. In high school, she was
valedictorian but her braininess, she said, made her feel ``like a
freak.''
</P>
<P>
Anti-Semitism barred her father, a successful businessman, from
joining the country club and other elite Peoria circles, and it kept
Betty and her sister out of high school sororities.
</P>
<P>
Her mother was an unhappy housewife whose disposition and health
dramatically improved when her husband's health faltered and she took
over management of the jewelry business. In a 1976 book, ``It Changed
My Life,'' Friedan said her mother's discontent gave her an early
glimpse of the perils of the malaise she would later call the
``feminine mystique.''
</P>
<P>
Friedan did not feel at home until she arrived at Smith College in
the late 1930s. She became editor of the campus newspaper and quickly
established a reputation for brilliance. She finished summa cum laude
in psychology in 1942 and entered graduate studies at the University
of California, Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
At Berkeley, she won a prestigious science fellowship that had
never been given to a psychologist, much less a female. But she turned
the award down when it became apparent that her success threatened a
physicist she had been dating. Although she said she had little, if
any, awareness of it at the time, she was fearful of being ``brighter
than the boys'' and violating the mystique she would dissect later.
Against the advice of her professors, who included the eminent
theorist Erik Erikson, she gave up psychology all together.
</P>
<P>
Having discovered Marxism in college, Friedan decided that she
would work for the ``revolution.'' By 1943, she was immersed in
popular-front journalism, first at The Federated Press in New York and
later at UE News, the official newspaper of the United Electrical,
Radio and Machine Workers of America, then one of the nation's most
radical unions.
</P>
<P>
In 1947 she married a theatrical producer named Carl Friedman, who
later dropped the ``m'' in his last name to create the more
distinctive ``Friedan.'' In 1948 the Friedans had the first of three
children, Daniel. Four years later when she became pregnant with her
second child, Jonathan, and requested maternity leave, she was fired
from her job at the union paper, an event she later would call a
``formative experience'' in her evolution as a feminist. Her third
child, Emily, was born in 1956.
</P>
<P>
Although she was determined to be a happy housewife, she suffered
renewed attacks of her childhood asthma and resumed psychotherapy.
Urged by her therapist not to waste her education and training, Betty
Friedan began to write for women's magazines.
</P>
<P>
She had wanted to write a profile of a woman who had given up a
successful career as an advertising executive, married and become a
serious sculptor, but editors were doubtful that their
housewife-readers would be interested in such a woman. They accepted
the article but only after deleting references to the subject's
career. Within a few years, Friedan said, ``I began to lose my zest
(for writing the formulaic articles of women's magazines).''
</P>
<P>
In 1957, she was asked to conduct a survey of her Smith classmates
for their 15th reunion. She found that the women who did not conform
exactly to traditional notions of womanhood were happier than those
who did. ``Maybe it wasn't education that was the problem, keeping
American women from `adjusting to their role as women,' '' she wrote,
``but that narrow definition of `the role of women.' ''
</P>
<P>
She wrote a magazine article based on that argument, but it was
repeatedly rejected. She decided to bypass that venue and put her
ideas into a book instead.
</P>
<P>
She interviewed scores of suburban women. Another part of her
research entailed long days in the New York Public Library, looking
for shifts in the types of heroines depicted in women's magazine
fiction. The results of her study were stark: Friedan found that the
avid career woman who dominated the magazines in the 1930s had given
way by the 1950s to a less adventuresome model: the contented
homemaker.
</P>
<P>
Was the 1950s image reality, or was it a self-fulfilling fantasy
cooked up by magazine editors and advertisers? Friedan was staggered
by the dissatisfactions aired by wives and mothers, by their vague
laments about feeling empty, desperate and incomplete. A mother of
four who had bypassed college for marriage and family told Friedan:
``There's no problem you can even put a name to. But I'm desperate. I
begin to feel I have no personality. I'm a server of food and
putter-on of pants and a bed-maker, somebody who can be called on when
you want something. But who am I?''
</P>
<P>
`` . . . I came to realize,'' Friedan later wrote, ``that something
is very wrong with the way American women are trying to live their
lives today. . . .For the startling pattern that began to emerge as
one clue led me to another in far-flung fields of modern thought and
life, defied not only the conventional image but basic psychological
assumptions about women.''
</P>
<P>
She found that books on the psychology of women generally adhered
to traditional ideas of women's fulfillment in hearth and home.
Seeking a theoretical basis for her views of women's plight, Friedan
turned to the work on identity and self realization by psychologists
including Abraham Maslow and Erik Erikson. Their ideas informed what
became her central tenet: ``that the core of the problem for women
today is . . . a problem of identity -- a stunting or evasion of
growth that is perpetuated by the feminine mystique.''
</P>
<P>
Friedan finally produced a 1,000-page manuscript. It took her five
years.
</P>
<P>
Friedan's publisher, W. W. Norton, printed only a few thousand
hardcover copies in 1963. Friedan did not experience the full force of
fame until Dell issued the paperback in 1964. That year, ``The
Feminine Mystique'' became the top-selling nonfiction book in the
country. Much of the initial reaction was not favorable. Friedan was
cursed, told to seek psychiatric help and accused of posing ``more of
a threat to the United States than the Russians.'' She was shunned by
neighborhood women, her children were kicked out of car pools, and her
marriage began to crack under the weight of her growing celebrity.
</P>
<P>
To many black women more concerned with survival than
self-fulfillment, Friedan's call to women to find meaningful careers
``seemed to come from another planet,'' according to historian Paula
Giddings.
</P>
<P>
The personal narrative that gave ``Feminine Mystique'' much of its
power was misleading in another way: It omitted references to
Friedan's earlier career as a left-wing journalist, creating the
impression that the author had never been anything other than a
suburban matron.
</P>
<P>
Years later, biographer Daniel Horowitz would accuse Friedan of
obscuring her past to sell books. But Friedan insisted she was only
being politically savvy. ``It was the McCarthy era . . . and I didn't
go around parading my left-wing background because it wouldn't have
helped in organizing the women's movement,'' she told the Los Angeles
Times a few years ago. ``On the other hand, I never kept it secret.''
</P>
<P>
``The Feminine Mystique'' was so astute in its analysis that, as
futurist Alvin Toffler said, it ``pulled the trigger on history.'' The
book launched a tumultuous decade for American women, with Friedan at
the epicenter.
</P>
<P>
In June 1966, Friedan joined members of state commissions on the
status of women for a national conference in Washington, D.C. Four
months later, they reconvened and Friedan was elected president of the
nascent National Organization for Women.
</P>
<P>
Among its signature success was lobbying President Lyndon Johnson
to sign an Executive Order prohibiting sex discrimination by federal
contractors.
</P>
<P>
Today, the group is anchored in Washington, D.C., and has 500,000
members and branches in all 50 states. But in its early years, NOW's
headquarters was Friedan's New York City apartment and Friedan was
indisputably in charge.
</P>
<P>
In 1970, the largest feminist demonstration since the suffrage
movement took over Fifth Avenue when Friedan called for a national
Women's Strike for Equality. Held on the 50th anniversary of the
passage of the women's suffrage amendment, it drew 500,000 women.
</P>
<P>
But during these heady years, Friedan's marriage was crumbling. She
claimed years later to have been a battered wife, a contention that
outraged Carl Friedan, who vociferously denied the charges. Their
22-year marriage ended in divorce in 1969.
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Friedan would step down as NOW president amid growing
dissatisfaction with her vision of the movement. But not even her
critics could deny the power of the changes she had unleashed.
</P>
<P>
By this time the mother of the movement was being assaulted by its
more radical elements. In 1969 she had delivered her first public
attack on lesbianism, labeling it a ``lavender menace'' that would
tarnish the entire feminist agenda. Enraged, many lesbians quit NOW.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the 1970s, Friedan was relegated to the sidelines of
the movement she had inspired. She was dismayed not only by its
direction but what she saw as its mounting toll and the growing
political backlash. As she saw it, the movement had burdened rather
than liberated women, burning out those who were trying to juggle
motherhood and career or penetrate the corporate glass ceiling.
Moreover, she observed, women in lower-level jobs were still earning
only 59 cents to every dollar earned by men -- this after almost two
decades of renewed feminist activism.
</P>
<P>
Friedan's response was ``The Second Stage,'' published in 1981. The
movement's senior theorist always had insisted that men were not the
enemy. In her new book, startlingly, she suggested that the enemy was
the victim herself.
</P>
<P>
``I believe we have to break through our own feminist mystique,''
Friedan wrote, arguing that, ``The equality we fought for isn't
livable, isn't workable, isn't comfortable in the terms that
structured our battle.'' Feminists, she charged, had fallen into a new
trap ``which denied that core of women's personhood that is fulfilled
through love, nurture, home. . . .
</P>
<P>
Calling the feminist foremother ''hopelessly confused about whose
side she's on,`` theorist Ellen Willis wrote that Friedan ''would
destroy feminism in order to save it, and beat the Moral Majority by
joining it.`` Journalist Susan Faludi, writing in her 1991 book
''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women,`` said Friedan
was ''yanking out the stitches in her own handiwork.``
</P>
<P>
Friedan began to turn her focus to other issues. She received a
call from the head of the National Institute on Aging, asking her to
become an advocate for older Americans. She at first fought the idea,
''locked in denial`` about the encroaching reality of her own aging --
she was approaching 60 and hating it. What changed her mind was
remembering conversations she'd had with older women while researching
''The Feminine Mystique.`` The healthiest and most vital women she
interviewed had been older women -- in their 50s and 60s -- who had
careers.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 she published ''The Fountain of Age,`` a book in which she
again challenged the prevailing stereotypes and argued that an active,
engaged life was the secret to a good old age. The book earned mixed
reviews, with some critics faulting her for presenting an overly
optimistic view of the stage of life Friedan herself was experiencing.
</P>

</P>
<P>
In her last years, Friedan split her time between homes in Sag
Harbor, N.Y., and Washington, D.C. She spent more time with her
children -- Daniel, a theoretical physicist at Rutgers University who
won a MacArthur Foundation genius grant; Jonathan, an engineer in
Philadelphia; and Emily, a pediatrician in Buffalo, N.Y. -- and their
families.
</P>
<P>
Friedan wrote six books and had teaching posts at many
institutions, including Yale, Harvard, the University of California,
Los Angeles and the University of Southern California. Surgery in 1997
to replace an infected aortic valve slowed her down only a little. A
few years later, she was a distinguished visiting professor at Cornell
University, where she used a $1 million Ford Foundation grant to
conduct a three-year study on women, men, work, family and public
policy.
</P>
<P>
She continued to deplore the lack of progress on issues that
affected the quality of family life, such as flexible scheduling and
better and more affordable child care.
</P>
<P>
Yet she seemed to look back on her life with immense pleasure,
saying that the women's movement had succeeded in the United States
and other advanced countries beyond her wildest imaginings.
</P>
<P>
''I thought once,`` she said, ''about what should be put on my
gravestone: `She helped make women feel better about being women and
therefore better able to freely and fully love men.' ``
