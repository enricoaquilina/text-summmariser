TODAY, SOME FEMINISTS HATE THE WORD 'CHOICE'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout its lifetime, feminism has spawned its share of catchphrases and
epithets. Simone de Beauvoir gave us "the second sex." Betty
Friedan invented "the feminine mystique." Arlie Hochschild labeled the daily
housework that followed office work "the second shift," while Rush
Limbaugh contributed "feminazis" to the discourse.
</P>
<P>
Now another phrase -- choice feminism -- is suddenly gaining currency,
while managing to annoy people on the left, right and
just about everywhere in between.
</P>
<P>
This seemingly innocuous term, coined by a lawyer and scholar, Linda
R. Hirshman, in the December issue of The American Prospect,
refers to the popular feminist philosophy that in her words
declares "a woman could work, stay home, have 10 children
or one, marry or stay single." "It all counted as
'feminist' as long as she chose it," Hirshman wrote.
</P>
<P>
The concepts behind choice feminism took over the mainstream in the
1980s, replacing more militant agendas that derided or neglected family
life. The idea was that women should decide for themselves
how to combine children, career, romance and vacuuming. What it
didn't tell them was how to make the right decision.
Figuring out the balance between home and work turned out
to be a lot trickier than anyone thought.
</P>
<P>
Hirshman would like to help -- though not in a way
many women would welcome. In her article she denounced choice
feminism as a con. It promised liberation, she said, but
actually betrayed women by leaving traditional sex roles intact. In
short, women were still stuck with the housework and child-rearing.
The public sphere, outside the home, she argued, is the
only place where women can fully flourish. And that, she
proclaimed, is where they should be.
</P>
<P>
She issued a few simple rules: Marry someone poorer or socially
inferior; increase your tolerance of dust. And, as she puts
it: "Have a baby. Just don't have two."
</P>
<P>
On the Web and elsewhere, responses were quick, numerous and fierce.
There were a few supporters, but many more critics. Conservatives
saw her argument as another example of how feminists are
intent on destroying the family. Liberals criticized her for being
authoritarian and defining success only by money and status. Mothers
denounced her for just about everything.
</P>
<P>
What is perhaps most surprising, though, is not that feminists like
Hirshman believe homemaking is second-class drudgery, but that so many
people still get worked up over the issue. After all,
feminist thinkers have been proclaiming the need to free women
from the bondage of housework for a long time. It
is, as Hirshman freely acknowledges, precisely what Friedan argued in
"The Feminine Mystique," first published more than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The only kind of work which permits an able woman to
realize her abilities fully," Friedan wrote, "is the kind that
was forbidden by the feminine mystique, the lifelong commitment to
an art or science, to politics or profession." Not homemaking,
not motherhood.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Hirshman said that in the course of researching
a book, she began to wonder when feminism switched from
offering a clear blueprint for liberation to choosing from Column
A and Column B.
</P>
<P>
"I was curious to see when we got to the place
when they decided to sidestep the definition of the good
life by Friedan," she said, "to whatever floats your boats."
</P>
<P>
She traced the change to the late '80s, when the women's
movement decided to frame the debate over legalized abortion as
a question of a woman's choice. The language, she says,
"spilled over."
</P>
<P>
That Hirshman's views on family life now sound so radical is
a testament to how roundly the mainstream has rejected them.
While rigid doctrines may have made sense in the early
days, they don't now, when major goals have been won
and a more diverse group of women are in the
picture. Indeed, the common critique of the women's movement in
the '60s and '70s was that it was too elitist
and dogmatic, that it didn't respect women who wanted to
stay home.
</P>
<P>
Choice feminism was an adjustment to reality. But reality, of course,
is messy and confusing. It's not clear what should give
when women are still responsible for a disproportionate share of
the housework, they miss their children while they're at work
all day, good child care is expensive, and time off
or part-time work hampers a career.
</P>
<P>
In the continuing Web discussion about Hirshman's article, many women angry
with her conclusions still agreed with her complaints about the
unequal burden between men and women for home and family.
</P>
<P>
A Web site called the Half Changed World, for example, written
by a self-described mom and policy wonk, said: "I honestly
don't know what's going to break through the domestic glass
ceiling. I used to think that it just was going
to take time, that of course the younger generation would
adopt a more equitable distribution of labor. I don't see
that happening."
</P>
<P>
Choice feminism doesn't provide any formula or model for happily balancing
family, work, love, chores, play, sleep and more. Nothing does
anymore.
</P>
<P>
"We've been living through this massive transformation where those predictable pathways
have really eroded," said Kathleen Gerson, a New York University
sociologist.
</P>
<P>
That is why edicts that order women either to get out
of the house or to stay there inevitably resurface. Issuing
marching orders is simple. "Viva la revolucion!" is a lot
catchier than "Muddle Through!" It's just not helpful.
