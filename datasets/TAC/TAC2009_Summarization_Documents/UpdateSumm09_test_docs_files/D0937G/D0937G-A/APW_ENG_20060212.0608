Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot and wounded a companion during a
weekend quail hunting trip in Texas, spraying the fellow hunter in the face and
chest with shotgun pellets.
</P>
<P>
Harry Whittington, a millionaire attorney from Austin, was "alert and doing
fine" in a Corpus Christi hospital Sunday, a day after he was shot by Cheney on
a ranch in south Texas, said Katharine Armstrong, the property's
owner.
</P>
<P>
He was described as in stable condition by Yvonne Wheeler, spokeswoman for the
Christus Spohn Health System in Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong in an interview with The Associated Press said Whittington, 78, was
mostly injured on his right side, with the pellets hitting his cheek, neck and
chest during the incident which occurred late afternoon on Saturday
</P>
<P>
She said emergency personnel traveling with Cheney tended to Whittington until
the ambulance arrived.
</P>
<P>
Cheney's spokeswoman, Lea Anne McBride, said the vice president was with
Whittington and his wife at the hospital on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The shooting was first reported by the Corpus Christi Caller-Times. The vice
president's office did not disclose the accident until nearly 24 hours after it
happened.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said she was watching from a car while Cheney, Whittington and another
hunter got out of the vehicle to shoot at a covey of quail.
</P>
<P>
Whittington shot a bird and went to look for it in the tall grass, while Cheney
and the third hunter walked to another spot and discovered a second
covey.
</P>
<P>
Whittington "came up from behind the vice president and the other hunter and
didn't signal them or indicate to them or announce himself," Armstrong
said.
</P>
<P>
"The vice president didn't see him," she continued. "The covey flushed and the
vice president picked out a bird and was following it and shot. And by god,
Harry was in the line of fire and got peppered pretty good."
</P>
<P>
Whittington has been a private practice attorney in Austin since 1950 and has
long been active in Texas Republican politics. He has been appointed to several
state boards, including when then-Gov. George W. Bush named him to the Texas
Funeral Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
Whittington owns property in Travis County, which includes the state capital
Austin, worth at least $11 million, the Austin American-Statesman reported last
year, not counting a downtown block at the center of a long-running dispute with
the city over a condemnation issue.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, owner of the Armstrong Ranch where the accident occurred, said
Whittington was bleeding and Cheney was very apologetic.
</P>
<P>
"It broke the skin," she said of the shotgun pellets. "It knocked him silly. But
he was fine. He was talking. His eyes were open. It didn't get in his eyes or
anything like that."
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, the vice president has got a lot of medical people around him and
so they were right there and probably more cautious than we would have been,"
she said. "The vice president has got an ambulance on call, so the ambulance
came."
</P>
<P>
Cheney is an avid hunter who makes annual hunting trips to South Dakota to hunt
pheasants. He also travels frequently to Arkansas to hunt ducks.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said Cheney is a longtime friend who comes to the ranch to hunt about
once a year and is "a very safe sportsman." She said Whittington is a regular,
too, but she thought it was the first time the two men hunted
together.
</P>
<P>
"This is something that happens from time to time. You now, I've been peppered
pretty well myself," said Armstrong.
