WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS INFORMATION DELAY ABOUT CHENEY'S HUNTING ACCIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The White House on Monday carefully distanced itself from
Vice President Dick Cheney's delayed notification about his accidental shooting
of a hunting companion.
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary McClellan said he had privately urged Cheney's
staff to quickly disclose details about the 5:30 p.m. CST
accident on Saturday rather than wait for the Texas ranch
owner to telephone the local newspaper more than 18 hours
later, on Sunday. McClellan said he was informed late Saturday
night that there had been a hunting accident but didn't
learn that Cheney had shot the victim until 6 a.m.
EST Sunday.
</P>
<P>
McClellan said President Bush learned there had been a hunting accident
from White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card about 7:30
p.m. EST Saturday and learned that Cheney had been the
shooter shortly before 8 p.m. EST when updated by Deputy
White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove.
</P>
<P>
Cheney's staff did not publicly confirm the accidental shooting until 3:30
p.m. EST on Sunday, more than 20 hours after the
accident, when the Corpus Christi Caller-Times posted a story on
its Web site.
</P>
<P>
McClellan said spoke with Katharine Armstrong, one of the ranch owners
and an eyewitness to the accident, and she agreed to
relay word of the accident to the local newspaper on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
McClellan said he had urged speedy public disclosure following the incident
at the 50,000-acre Armstrong Ranch some 60 miles outside Corpus
Christi, Texas.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's always important to get information out as quickly
as possible," McClellan said. "Of course in a position like
mine, I was urging that that information be made available
as quickly as possible."
</P>
<P>
McClellan attributed some of the delay to Cheney's aides trying to
"get the facts together (to) provide that information to the
public" as well as making sure that Cheney's victim, 78-year-old
Texas lawyer Harry Whittington, had adequate medical attention.
</P>
<P>
But McClellan sought to deflect criticism about the slow disclosure by
suggesting that Cheney's staff was responsible.
</P>
<P>
"It was the vice president's office that took the lead on
this," he said, when asked about whether he had been
told that Cheney's staff was relying on a private citizen
to report the accident.
</P>
<P>
Whittington, an Austin lawyer, was listed Monday in "very stable" condition
at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial in Corpus Christi, Texas, where
he was undergoing treatment for multiple pellet wounds on the
right side of his lower face, neck, shoulder and chest.
Hospital administrator Peter Banko said Whittington was moved out of
intensive care on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cheney, 65, was using a .28 gauge shotgun when he accidentally
peppered Whittington with bird shot at a distance of about
30 yards while trying to shoot flushed quail. The Corpus
Christi Caller-Times reported Monday that Cheney and Whittington had been
hunting with Pam Willeford, the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland and
Liechtenstein who had served for eight years on the Texas
Higher Education Coordinating Board.
</P>
<P>
The vice president's office did not publicly report the accident until
mid-afternoon Sunday after the Corpus Christi Caller-Times had asked about
it.
</P>
<P>
McClellan contrasted the delayed notification by a private citizen with his
own quick actions last July when he notified the news
media that Bush had collided with a member of his
Scottish security detail while bicycling in Scotland during an international
summit.
</P>
<P>
McClellan immediately disclosed that Bush had suffered "mild to moderate" scrapes
on his arms and hands that required bandages by the
White House physician.
</P>
<P>
McClellan, drawing a distinction with the response by Cheney's staff, told
reporters Monday: "I think you can always look back at
these issues and look at how to do a better
job."
</P>
<P>
OPTIONAL TRIM -- STORY MAY END HERE
</P>
<P>
McClellan and the Corpus Christi Caller-Times provided the following timeline:
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Feb. 11:
</P>
<P>
5:30 p.m. CST -- Cheney accidentally shoots Whittington. He is flown
by helicopter to a hospital in Corpus Christi and admitted
to the trauma-intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
7:30 p.m. EST -- White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card
in Washington alerts Bush at the White House about an
unspecified shooting accident within Cheney's quail hunting party but does
not specify that Cheney was the shooter.
</P>
<P>
8 p.m. EST -- Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl
Rove updates Bush, telling the president that Cheney was the
shooter.
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Feb. 12:
</P>
<P>
6 a.m. EST -- McClellan is awakened at home and told
that Cheney was the shooter. He says he began urging
vice presidential staff to release details of the incident.
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning -- Katharine Armstrong, the host and an eyewitness to
the accident, says she and her mother, former U.S. Ambassador
to Britain Anne Armstrong, ask Cheney about notifying the news
media.
</P>
<P>
"The vice president spoke with (Katharine Armstrong) directly and agreed that
she should make it public and that they would provide
additional information," McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
Katharine Armstrong starts trying to telephone Jaime Powell, a reporter at
the Corpus Christi Caller Times, to describe the accident.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether it was appropriate to have a private citizen relay
information about the vice president, McClellan quipped: "That's one way
to provide information to the public."
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning -- Cheney talks by telephone with Merce Whittington, Whittington's
wife, to check on the victim's condition.
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon -- Cheney visits Whittington at the Corpus Christi hospital
before returning to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
3:30 p.m. EST -- News organizations confirm the Corpus Christi Caller-Times
account with vice president's office at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Monday morning -- Cheney arrives at the White House complex in
his motorcade, with escorting police vehicles forgoing the usual sirens.
He ducks from his limousine into the White House wearing
a black jacket with the collar raised against the early
morning chill.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong did not immediately return a telephone call seeking additional comment.
</P>
<P>
She told the Corpus Christi Caller Times that Whittington had come
up behind Cheney without alerting him that he was here.
"The reason that you stay in line is so that
you know where everybody is at all times," Armstrong told
the newspaper. "If you drop out of line, you say
you are coming up behind to indicate to other shooters
so (they) know you are there."
