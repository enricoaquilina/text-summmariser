WASHINGTON - Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot a hunting partner
Saturday in Texas, and the White House did not confirm
the shooting until nearly 20 hours later. The victim was
described as being "peppered pretty good" with birdshot and was
in stable condition Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cheney shot Harry Whittington, 78, a multimillionaire Austin lawyer, spraying his
friend and hunting partner with shotgun pellets from head to
chest. He was being treated in the intensive care unit
at a Corpus Christi hospital.
</P>
<P>
Whittington, bloodied but still conscious, tumbled to the ground after he
was hit. Cheney thought he was shooting at a covey
of quail, according to an owner of the ranch.
</P>
<P>
Cheney is a longtime hunter and delivered the keynote address in
2004 to the National Rifle Association, from which he accepted
a rifle as a gift.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened in south Texas at the famed Armstrong Ranch,
co-owned by members of a family long close to Cheney.
Tobin Armstrong was a major financial backer of the Bush-Cheney
team who died last October, with Cheney attending the funeral.
Anne Armstrong, a former counselor to President Nixon, has served
on the board of the Halliburton Corp., where Cheney was
chief executive before becoming vice president.
</P>
<P>
Whittington is a longtime friend of President Bush from their days
together in Austin when Bush was Texas governor. He was
described in an article published two weeks ago in the
Austin-American Statesman as being "very rich, very stubborn, and very
patient."
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted Katharine Armstrong, one of the ranch owners,
as saying she watched the shooting from her vantage in
a nearby car. She said that Whittington shot a quail
and went to look for it in the grass. Cheney
then went to search for more quail.
</P>
<P>
Cheney was using a 28-gauge shotgun and was about 30 yards
away from Whittington, she said. Both men were wearing orange
vests.
</P>
<P>
Whittington "came up from behind the vice president and the other
hunter and didn't signal them or indicate to them or
announce himself," Armstrong told the Associated Press. "The vice president
didn't see him. The covey flushed and the vice president
picked out a bird and was following it and shot.
And, by God, Harry was in the line of fire
and got peppered pretty good."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said Whittington was injured mostly on his right side, from
cheek to chest. Cheney was described as apologetic for shooting
Whittington. He was taken by medical helicopter to the Christus
Spohn Health System in Corpus Christi, about an hour away.
</P>
<P>
Cheney was described as apologetic for shooting Whittington. The vice president
visited Whittington in the hospital Sunday, Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
"It broke the skin," Armstrong said, referring to the birdshot. "It
knocked him silly. But he was fine. He was talking.
His eyes were open. It didn't get in his eyes
or anything like that."
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about 5:30 p.m. local time Saturday and was
first reported on the website of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times
at midday Sunday, according to a reporter at the newspaper.
The White House confirmed the shooting after being contacted by
the media.
</P>
<P>
White House spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride, asked in a telephone interview
why the shooting was not announced sooner, referred questions to
Katharine Armstrong. McBride said Armstrong talked to "her local paper
and when we were asked about the account she had
provided, [we] confirmed that."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong did not return a call seeking comment on McBride's statement.
</P>
<P>
After the hospital visit, McBride said Cheney "was pleased to see
that he was doing fine and in good spirits."
</P>
<P>
Cheney, who suffered four heart attacks before he was elected vice
president and has been hospitalized for heart problems while in
office, always travels with a medical team. His team treated
Whittington before he was taken to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who owns a ranch in Texas, and Cheney, who grew
up in Wyoming, are both enthusiastic hunters, a fact they
have frequently mentioned during political campaigns. McBride said Cheney has
a Texas hunting license.
</P>
<P>
Cheney's hunting trips have included one with Supreme Court Justice Antonin
Scalia, who went duck hunting in January 2004 with the
vice president in Louisiana, a trip criticized because Scalia participates
in decisions that affect the administration.
</P>
<P>
Tobin Armstrong was quoted by the Associated Press as saying in
2000 that he frequently went hunting on the ranch with
Cheney, who turned 65 last month.
</P>
<P>
When Armstrong died in October, his funeral was attended by Cheney
and former President George H. W. Bush. "Tobin is one
of our dearest and most respected friends," former President Bush
said. "Barbara and I loved Tobin Armstrong."
</P>
<P>
The 50,000-acre Armstrong Ranch was purchased in 1852 by Tobin Armstrong's
grandfather, John Armstrong III, who became known for capturing outlaw
John Wesley Hardin, according to a profile of the ranch
in the Caller-Times.
</P>
<P>
Whittington has long been active in Republican Party politics and was
appointed by then-Governor George W. Bush to the Texas Funeral
Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
In the final stages of the 2004 campaign, Cheney mocked the
way Democratic presidential nominee Senator John F. Kerry went on
a hunting trip.
</P>
<P>
"He wore a brand new camouflage jacket for the occasion, which
makes you wonder just how often he does really go
goose hunting," Cheney said, according to a White House transcript.
"My personal opinion was his camo jacket was an October
disguise. ... But, my fellow sportsmen, this coverup isn't going
to work because you and I know the Second Amendment
is more than just another photo opportunity."
</P>
<P>
The Houston Chronicle has reported that there were 29 hunting-related accidents
in Texas in 2004, with four fatalities.
