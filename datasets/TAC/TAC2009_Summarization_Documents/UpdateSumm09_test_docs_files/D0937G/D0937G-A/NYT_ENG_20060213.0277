The White House sought with little success on Monday
to quell an uproar over why it took the better
part of a day to disclose that Vice President Dick
Cheney had accidentally wounded a fellow hunter in Texas on
Saturday and why even President Bush initially got an incomplete
report on the shooting.
</P>
<P>
The victim, Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old lawyer, was transferred from the
intensive care unit to a private room in a Corpus
Christi hospital on Monday. His condition remained listed as stable,
with wounds to his face, neck, chest and rib cage
from the pellets sprayed at him from 30 yards away
by Cheney's shotgun.
</P>
<P>
Calls to his room were routed to the hospital's marketing department,
which said it was taking messages for him. Texas officials
said on Monday night that Cheney would be issued a
warning citation for hunting without a proper game stamp on
his license. The local sheriff said an investigation had concluded
that the episode was "no more than an accident."
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Cheney made no statement and remained out
of public view on Monday. At the end of a
meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Cheney and Bush exchanged
remarks that reporters were about to enter the room, and
the vice president left before the journalists arrived.
</P>
<P>
But Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, was battered at
his daily news briefing by journalists demanding answers to why
Cheney had not been faster to make public what happened
and why he had chosen a local newspaper in Texas
as his vehicle for doing so.
</P>
<P>
The pressure came in part from questions about whether Cheney might
have been trying to play down the incident, a suggestion
that was rejected by those who were with Cheney over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Among the people with him at the Armstrong Ranch in south
Texas was his host Katharine Armstrong, a lobbyist and longtime
friend of Cheney. Her lobbying clients include several that do
business with the federal government, though Armstrong said she did
not believe that she had ever lobbied Cheney.
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Armstrong said that it did not occur to
anyone in the hunting party to make news of the
shooting public immediately, but that no one, including Cheney, had
called for holding it back. She said Cheney participated in
discussions on Sunday morning about disclosing the incident, agreeing that
it should be made public but deferring to the Armstrong
family on how to do so.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday morning, Armstrong tipped off her local newspaper to the
story. It was later picked up by national wire services
and confirmed by Cheney's office.
</P>
<P>
The incident provided a wealth of material for Democrats, gun control
activists and critics of the Bush administration, not to mention
late night comedians.
</P>
<P>
McClellan struggled at times to explain even the most basic details
in the case, including when and how Bush was informed
about it.
</P>
<P>
In the end, White House officials said Bush learned about the
shooting accident at 7:30 p.m. Eastern time, about an hour
after it happened, in a call from Andrew H. Card
Jr., his chief of staff. But Bush did not find
out that Cheney was the shooter until about half an
hour later in a subsequent call from Karl Rove, his
senior adviser and deputy chief of staff, who had called
Armstrong to ask about the incident.
</P>
<P>
The local sheriff, Ramon Salinas 3rd, said the Secret Service called
him shortly after the shooting occurred.
</P>
<P>
Salinas said he sent his chief deputy, Gilbert Sanmiguel, to the
Armstrong ranch that night. He said Sanmiguel interviewed the Cheney
and reported that shooting was an accident.
</P>
<P>
The sheriff said Sunday that they had yet to speak to
"the victim." "But you could say it's closed," Salinas said
of the case.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a news release from the sheriff's office said that
" Whittington's interview collaborated Vice President Cheney's statement" and that
the department was "fully satisfied that this was no more
than a hunting accident."
</P>
<P>
There is no requirement to report nonfatal hunting accidents in Texas,
said Lydia Saldana, the communications director for the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Monday night, Cheney's office said a member
of his staff had asked the Parks and Wildlife Department
for all of the necessary permits for the vice president
to go quail hunting in Texas and had paid $140.
But, the statement said, the staff member was not informed
of the need for an additional stamp, costing $7, to
allow hunting of upland game birds.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Cheney has now sent a $7 check to
the department.
</P>
<P>
Cheney has often gone hunting as vice president, sometimes with other
prominent officials, including Justice Antonin Scalia. During the 2004 presidential
campaign, Cheney mocked Sen. John Kerry, the Democratic nominee, for
having worn camouflage on a duck-hunting trip, saying Kerry's "new
camo jacket is an October disguise, an effort he's making
to hide the fact that he votes against gun-owner rights
at every turn."

<P>
This past weekend brought Cheney together with a group of old
friends, friends of friends and political supporters in the kind
of private setting he relishes. The guests included Pamela Pitzer
Willeford, a Texan who was appointed ambassador to Switzerland and
Liechtenstein in 2003. She was with Cheney at the time
of the shooting, as was Armstrong, whose mother, Anne, is
a prominent Republican supporter and whose family ranch is a
familiar destination for Republican politicians.
</P>
<P>
According to public documents, Armstrong registered in 2004 as a lobbyist
for Parsons, an engineering and construction firm that has done
extensive work in Iraq, and listed the size of the
contract at more than $100,000, according to lobbying records from
the Texas Ethics Commission provided by Texans for Public Justice,
a watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong's business partner, Karen Johnson, spent several years lobbying for Parsons,
doing work on "business development" before the State Department, the
Department of Transportation and the U.S. Agency for International Development,
according to PoliticalMoneyLine, which tracks federal lobbying. Johnson also lobbies
for major corporations, including Lockheed Martin, and has been one
of Bush's leading fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong has a relatively limited list of lobbying clients in Texas
and in Washington. Public records show that she has worked
for Baker Botts, the law firm; Prionics AG, a biotechnology
company; Trajen, a firm that performs aviation technical support for
the U.S. military; and the King ranch, the property next
to her family's ranch.
</P>
<P>
Records in Texas indicate that she has lobbied at the state
level for three companies: Avex Group, the Dannenbaum Engineering Corporation
and Ecocreto USA.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong played down her role as a lobbyist and suggested that
she had not brought up business during Cheney's visit. She
was appointed to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission in
1999 by Bush, who was then the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
"You need to understand that the Cheneys are our friends maybe
for a couple of decades, maybe 30 years," Armstrong said,
adding that she did not personally represent Parsons. "I represent
a couple of Texas companies, not a large lobbying practice,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said she does more public relations and consulting work than
lobbying, but she declined to disclose her clients. She none
were involved in Iraq "that I know of."
</P>
<P>
Asked if she was concerned that Cheney's visit could create the
appearance of impropriety during the lobbying investigation involving Jack Abramoff,
which has brought to light the often close personal and
professional ties between lobbyists and public officials, she said: "Oh
my God, he's a friend. I don't believe I've ever
lobbied the vice president, nor would I be comfortable doing
so."
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
According to Armstrong and Willeford, the accident was largely the fault
of Whittington, who reappeared alongside two of his hunting companions
without giving proper warning. Cheney, who was carrying a 28-gauge
shotgun, had already begun to fire and sprayed Whittington.
</P>
<P>
"He got peppered pretty good," Armstrong said. "He fell with his
head toward me." She said she ran over to Whittington,
who had fallen to the ground, but stayed out of
the way while Secret Service agents tended to him.
</P>
<P>
"There was some bleeding, but it wasn't horrible," she said. "He
was more bruised."
</P>
<P>
Willeford, whose husband was also at the ranch, said in an
interview that Whittington accepted responsibility for the accident.
</P>
<P>
"He understands that he could have handled it better," Willeford said.
"Harry should have let us know he was back there."
</P>
<P>
Willeford and her husband are substantial Republican donors; they gave more
than $11,000 to Republican causes, including the Bush campaign and
the Republican National Committee, in the 2004 election cycle.
