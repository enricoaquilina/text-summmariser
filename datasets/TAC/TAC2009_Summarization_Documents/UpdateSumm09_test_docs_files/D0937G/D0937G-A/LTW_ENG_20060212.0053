<P>
Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally sprayed a
companion with birdshot while hunting quail on a private Texas ranch,
injuring the man in the face, neck and chest, the vice president's
office confirmed yesterday after a Texas newspaper reported the
incident.

The shooting occurred late Saturday afternoon while Cheney was
hunting with Harry Whittington, 78, a prominent Austin lawyer, on the
Armstrong Ranch in south Texas. Hearing a covey of birds, Cheney shot
at one, not realizing that Whittington had startled the quail and that
he was in the line of fire.

Whittington was treated on the scene by Cheney's traveling medical
detail before being taken by helicopter to a Corpus Christi hospital.
He was in the intensive care unit at Christus Spohn Health System and
listed in stable condition yesterday evening.

<P>
Katharine Armstrong, the ranch's owner, saw what happened Saturday
and told reporters Sunday that Cheney was using a 28-gauge shotgun,
which shoots fewer pellets and has a smaller shot pattern than a
12-gauge shotgun, making hitting the target more challenging.
Whittington was about 30 yards away when he was hit in the cheek, neck
and chest, she said.
