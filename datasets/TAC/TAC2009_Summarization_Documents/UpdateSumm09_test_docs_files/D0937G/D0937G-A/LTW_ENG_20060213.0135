Cheney Lacked Proper Hunting Credentials

CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas

<P>
Although he broke no laws, Vice President
Dick Cheney did not have proper hunting credentials when he
accidentally shot a fellow hunter at a private ranch last weekend,
authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cheney, an experienced outdoorsman who had a valid out-of-state
hunting license, will receive a warning citation for failing to
purchase the required $7 stamp for bird hunting, the Texas Department
of Parks and Wildlife said in a statement. The stamp is a new
requirement, and the department has issued verbal warnings to many
hunters who were unaware they needed it.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Monday night, Cheney's office said his staffers had
not known about the stamp requirement and that Cheney had sent a $7
check to Texas to cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred Saturday when the vice president wheeled to
shoot at a covey of quail and accidentally sprayed his hunting
partner, 78-year-old attorney Harry Whittington, with bird shot,
authorities said. Whittington was moved out of the intensive care unit
at a hospital here Monday and reported to be in good spirits.
</P>
<P>
``This was a hunting accident,'' said Gilbert San Miguel, chief
deputy of the Kenedy County Sheriff's office. ``There was no alcohol
or misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
But the incident has reverberated worldwide: ``Cheney bags a
lawyer,'' was the headline in the Glasgow, Scotland-based Herald.
</P>
<P>
And it has forced a White House already under fire for secrecy to
explain why it made no mention of the shooting until the ranch owner
disclosed it to a local newspaper, 18 hours after the incident.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Scott McClellan said Monday that the
``first priority was making sure that Harry Whittington ... was
getting the medical care that he needed. And I think that's where
everybody's attention should have been focused, and was focused, when
the hunting accident took place.''
</P>
<P>
Still, McClellan blamed Whittington for the accident, noting that
the attorney left the hunt line to retrieve a downed quail and was
approaching Cheney from behind. ``The protocol was not followed by Mr.
Whittington when it came to notifying the others that he was there,''
McClellan said. ``And so, you know, unfortunately these type of
hunting accidents happen from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
But hunting experts said that, although Whittington should have
made his location clear, the vice president is also to blame for not
keeping track of his companions.
</P>
<P>
``You're hunting together -- you need to know where everyone is,''
said Larry Keane, general counsel of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Said Jeff Hart, an Austin lawyer who hunts for quail in Texas: ``If
you pull the trigger, you're responsible for it, no matter what. ...
In hunting, the shooter is responsible for knowing where the shot is
going. That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
Cheney, well-known for having testy relations with the media, on
Monday came under criticism from Democrats and Republicans who said
the White House should have disclosed the incident immediately.
</P>
<P>
``It's news, and it reflects an attitude in this White House of
holding back information, of being too clever by half and being
secretive,'' conservative columnist Robert Novak said on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
``On the face of it, this looks like something the administration
felt the public had no right to know,'' Joe Lockhart, who was
President Clinton's press secretary, said in an interview. ``I don't
think there's going to be a bunch of people sitting around saying: `I
wonder why they waited to tell us.' But what they will be saying is:
`I wonder what else they're not telling us.' ''
</P>
<P>
Whittington -- a prominent Austin attorney -- and the vice
president arrived for a weekend hunting trip Friday night at the
50,000-acre Armstrong ranch, a well-known retreat for wealthy Texas
Republicans 95 miles south of Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
The party of 11 hunters set out in two trucks Saturday morning,
driving around the mesquite-dotted property and shooting quail until
about 12:30 p.m., said Anne Armstrong, co-owner of the ranch. Then
they broke for a lunch of antelope, jicama salad and camp bread,
washed down with Dr Pepper.
</P>
<P>
After lunch, the group split up. Cheney, Whittington and Pamela
Willeford, a former Texas energy executive who is now the U.S.
ambassador to Switzerland, went with two of Armstrong's daughters and
pursued quail for several more hours. It was at dusk that Whittington
shot his bird and went to retrieve it, taking him behind the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
The medical team that travels with Cheney immediately began
ministering to Whittington, who was bleeding profusely from pellets in
his face, neck and chest, according to witnesses. They packed the
wounded attorney into Cheney's ambulance and drove him to a nearby
hospital.
</P>
<P>
It was evident that the injuries were not life-threatening,
Armstrong said, because the ambulance paused on the road for several
minutes to allow Whittington's wife to join them.
</P>
<P>
After being stabilized at the hospital in Kingsville, Whittington
was evacuated by helicopter to a larger facility in Corpus Christi --
where he was placed in the intensive care unit. The Secret Service
reported the shooting to the Kenedy County sheriff's office, although
no one from that agency interviewed Cheney until Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the Secret Service had prevented him from
talking to the vice president right after the shooting, San Miguel
said: ``I'd rather not say.''
</P>
<P>
Anne Armstrong said that on Saturday evening, Cheney spoke with her
about disclosing the incident to the public. ``We knew word would get
out,'' she said. The vice president urged her to tell friends and
family first, before word leaked out to the media.
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday morning, her daughter, Katharine Armstrong, called a
reporter from the Corpus Christi Caller, which then reported the
shooting on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
Peter Binko, administrator of Christos Spohn hospital in Corpus
Christi where Whittington was recuperating, said the injured hunter
was cracking jokes -- and was baffled by all the publicity. ``He's a
true Southern gentleman,'' Binko said of Whittington at a Monday news
conference. ``He's really amazed, I think, at all the hoopla over
this.''
</P>
<P>
Whittington is a fixture in Texas politics, having worked in
Republican campaigns dating back to John Tower's senatorial run in the
1960s. He's best known nowadays for a decades-long battle to prevent
the city of Austin from building a parking lot over a downtown block
that he owns. The dispute is still being litigated.
