<P>
US Vice President Dick Cheney 
did not have a legal permit to hunt quail when he accidentally shot 
a 78-year old hunting partner over the weekend, the White House said 
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department informed Cheney that he 
lacked a stamp for hunting "upland game birds" in the state when the 
shooting incident occurred, the vice president's office said in a 
statement.
</P>
<P>
Texas authorities said they would issue a warning citation to 
Cheney but impose no penalty or fine for failing to have the 
seven-dollar stamp.
</P>
<P>
The revelation was sure to aggravate a public relations headache 
for the White House, already under criticism for waiting a day to 
disclose the shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
Cheney shot prominent lawyer Harry Whittington in the neck and 
chest with birdshot on Saturday as the two were out quail hunting on 
a Texas ranch.
</P>
<P>
Whittington's condition was improving and described as "stable" 
by doctors at Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial, where he was treated 
for wounds to his shoulder, upper body, chest and neck.
</P>
<P>
News of the shooting was first revealed not by the White House 
but by the owner of the south-Texas ranch, Katharine Armstrong, 
where the incident took place. Armstrong spoke to the local 
newspaper, the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, which had called her 
after getting a tip.
</P>
<P>
President George W. Bush's spokesman Scott McClellan as well as 
Cheney spokeswoman Lea Anne McBride insisted that the delay between 
the incident and its confirmation by the White House was due to a 
focus on securing Whittington medical care.
</P>
<P>
McClellan also said that details about the shooting were 
trickling in throughout the night and that the White House needed 
"to get the facts together."
</P>
<P>
"It was an accident. Unfortunately, these types of hunting 
accidents do happen from time to time," the spokesman told a 
frequently contentious briefing with reporters.
</P>
<P>
Asked why getting Whittington medical attention was incompatible 
with releasing details of the incident, McClellan said that the vice 
president's office had "worked to get that information out."
</P>
<P>
But the Caller-Times reported Monday that McBride, after 
confirming the incident around noon (1800 GMT) on Sunday, had 
refused to say whether the vice president's office would have 
disclosed the incident if the daily had not contacted her after 
getting a tip from an unnamed Armstrong family member.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to speculate," the daily quoted her as saying.
</P>
<P>
Confirming Armstrong's account, local police and state game 
officials said the vice president had spun around to target a bird 
and shot his fellow hunter instead.
</P>
<P>
"The investigation reveals that there was no alcohol, or 
misconduct involved in the incident," the Kenedy County sheriff's 
office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
An interview with Whittington had confirmed Cheney's account, 
the sheriff's office said.
</P>
<P>
The Caller-Times also reported Monday that the US ambassador to 
Switzerland and Liechtenstein, Pamela Willeford, was part of the 
hunting party.
</P>
<P>
An incident report by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 
said that Whittington had gone to retrieve a downed bird when Cheney 
wheeled around with his 28-gauge Perazzi shotgun and shot him by 
accident.
</P>
<P>
The weather was sunny and "clear" when the accident occurred and 
both men were wearing blaze orange hats and vests, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Morning News reported that Whittington also lacked 
the proper stamp for hunting quail. 
</P>
<P>
Gaming officials said they had been issuing oral warnings 
instead of fines to hunters who had failed to update their licenses 
under the new rule.
</P>
<P>
Cheney's staff members had asked state authorities for all 
necessary permits beforehand and were never informed about the need 
for a seven-dollar stamp for quail hunting, his office said in its 
statement.
</P>
<P>
While awaiting a warning from game wardens, "the Vice President 
has sent a 7 dollar check to the Texas Parks and Wildlife 
Department, which is the cost of an upland game bird stamp," it 
said.
</P>
<P>
The incident made the front pages of The Washington Post, The 
New York Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal, most of which 
noted soberly that Cheney's office had not gone public with the 
information when it happened.
</P>
<P>
Late-night talk show hosts, who typically mine such incidents 
for laughs, were not broadcasting over the weekend, making Monday 
night the first time they will be able to train their sights on the 
mishap.
