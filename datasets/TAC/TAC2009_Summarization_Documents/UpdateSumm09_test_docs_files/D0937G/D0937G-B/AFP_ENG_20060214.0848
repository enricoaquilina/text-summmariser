 Democrats in Congress on 
Tuesday accused Vice President Dick Cheney of a pattern of secrecy, 
and demanded that he "level" with the public, after keeping mum 
about accidentally shooting an associate over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Cheney has been criticized for waiting a day before disclosing a 
hunting mishap Saturday in which he shot his 78-year-old hunting 
companion, Harry Whittington, in the neck, chest, and face.
</P>
<P>
Asked at a press conference for her reaction about how the White 
House has handled the incident, US Senator Hillary Clinton called 
the Bush administration's failure to be more forthcoming 
"troubling."
</P>
<P>
"A tendency of this administration -- from the top all the way 
to the bottom -- is to withhold information ... to refuse to be 
forthcoming about information that is of significance and relevance 
to the jobs that all of you do, and the interests of the American 
people," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"Putting it all together, going back years now, there's a 
pattern and it's a pattern that should be troubling," she said at a 
press conference calling for a more robust federal response to the 
Hurricane Katrina disaster.
</P>
<P>
The former first lady continued: "The refusal of this 
administration to level with the American people on matters large 
and small is very disturbing, because it goes counter to the way our 
constitutional democracy ... is supposed to work."
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid at a press conference Tuesday 
said the secretive tendency goes beyond Cheney, pervading the entire 
Bush the White House.
</P>
<P>
"I think the reason it took the vice president a day to talk 
about this is part of the secretive nature of this administration," 
the top Senate Democrat said. "They keep things pretty close to the 
chest."
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time the American people heard from the vice 
president, in a real meeting just like we're having here," said 
Reid, who called the George W. Bush presidency "the most secretive 
administration in modern history."
</P>
<P>
"In the last many, many decades, there's no administration more 
secretive than this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cheney has not commented publicly about the accident, which took 
place on the 50,000-acre Armstrong Ranch in Texas on Saturday, 
although he issued a statement Tuesday saying that his "thoughts and 
prayers" were with his friend, and that he stood ready to help 
Whittington in any way.
</P>
<P>
"The vice president said that his thoughts and prayers are with 
Mr. Whittington and his family," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations that he is obsessively secretive have dogged Cheney 
since the early days of the Bush presidency, including his refusal 
during the administration's first term to reveal the participants on 
energy task force he led.
</P>
<P>
The vice president also has been criticized for a possible role 
in helping craft the administration's controversial secret domestic 
wiretapping policy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his chief of staff, Scooter Libby, has been 
implicated in secretly leaking the name of a CIA officer to 
discredit her husband -- an action some recent news accounts suggest 
may have been sanctioned by Cheney.
</P>
<P>
Senator Chuck Schumer said Tuesday the time has come for the 
vice president to hold a press conference -- which Schumer said 
would be Cheney's first in some four years -- to clear the air.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the recent shooting accident and all the questions 
surrounding his role in the leaking of classified national security 
information through his Chief of Staff Lewis Libby, there are many 
questions that Americans have for VP Cheney," Schumer said in a 
press release.
