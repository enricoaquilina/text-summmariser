Lawyer in Hunting Accident Suffers Mild Heart Attack
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harry M. Whittington, the 78-year-old hunter
accidentally shot by Vice President Dick Cheney, was back in intensive
care Tuesday after suffering a mild heart attack, as questions
continued to swirl around the White House's handling of the incident.
</P>
<P>
Doctors treating Whittington said a shotgun pellet that lodged in
his chest had triggered what they described as a ``silent heart
attack.'' He was reported in stable condition at the Corpus Christi,
Texas, hospital where he has been treated since the shooting on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cheney, who has yet to comment publicly on the shooting, was quoted
in a statement from his office as saying that he had spoken with
Whittington after learning of his condition and that ``his thoughts
and prayers are with'' the Austin, Texas, attorney.
</P>
<P>
Doctors who briefed reporters at an afternoon news conference
outside Christus Spohn Hospital Corpus Christi-Memorial said that
Whittington did not experience chest pains or other classic symptoms
of a heart attack. They said the pellet, which they decided to leave
in place, had caused inflammation of the heart muscle that caused a
temporary blockage of blood flow.
</P>
<P>
David Blanchard, chief of emergency medicine at the hospital, said
doctors were ``very, very optimistic'' that Whittington would make a
full recovery.
</P>
<P>
Still, the heart attack revealed that Cheney's misfire, first
regarded as more embarrassing than life-threatening, had potentially
put his victim's health in greater danger, after doctors and White
House officials initially had described Whittington as on the mend
from minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
It also derailed a concerted White House effort to move past the
hunting episode, which has tarnished Cheney's image and highlighted
his penchant for secrecy, while thrusting Bush's top aides, including
press secretary Scott McClellan, into a tug-of-war with the media.
</P>
<P>
Cheney's office -- under blistering attack for failing to make a
public announcement about the shooting -- reversed course and issued a
detailed statement about his concern for Whittington.
</P>
<P>
It recounted a phone call Cheney made to Whittington after learning
of his condition, in which the vice president wished him well ``and
asked if there was anything he needed,'' the statement said. Cheney
``said that he stood ready to assist,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said Whittington was expected to remain at the hospital for
a week for treatment and observation.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Washington, whom Blanchard described as White House
physicians, have been consulting with cardiologists at Christus Spohn
on Whittington's care, Blanchard said. He said they had agreed that it
would be in the elderly patient's best interests to treat him with
``medical therapy,'' rather than surgery.
</P>
<P>
The vice president learned of the change in Whittington's condition
Tuesday morning, and watched part of the televised hospital news
conference, the statement from his office said. After that briefing,
the release added, Cheney placed a call to Whittington.
</P>
<P>
Even as the White House struggled for a second straight day to
defend its handling of the shooting, McClellan continued to withhold
certain details. He was informed of Whittington's heart troubles
before his televised briefing and before the Corpus Christi news
conference in which they were disclosed, but he did not mention the
developments during the 27-minute exchange, which was dominated by
questions about the hunting accident.
</P>
<P>
``You're welcome to continue to focus on these issues,'' McClellan
told reporters. ``I'm moving on.''
</P>
<P>
McClellan later said he did not reveal the change in Whittington's
condition because ``it's not appropriate for me to'' do so. ``I'm not
his doctor; that's for his doctor to talk about.'' He also said there
were ``privacy issues'' preventing him from commenting on the matter.
</P>
<P>
As the focus turned to Whittington's health, new details continued
to emerge about what took place on the 50,000-acre southeast Texas
ranch where the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
Katherine Armstrong, a lobbyist whose family owns the ranch,
indicated in interviews that she and other members of her family, not
Cheney, had decided it was necessary to inform the public about the
incident.
</P>
<P>
After making that decision over breakfast Sunday morning, she and
her mother, Anne Armstrong, a former top Republican official, ``ran it
by'' Cheney, Katherine Armstrong told The Dallas Morning News. She
added that Cheney ``said something along the lines of, `You all do
whatever you are comfortable with.' ''
</P>
<P>
Katherine Armstrong has lobbied the Bush administration on
agriculture issues and lobbied the White House last year on South
Korean policy on behalf of South Korean clients, according to federal
records.
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's office in KenedyCounty, where the Armstrong Ranch is
located, issued a news release about Saturday's incident saying
``there was no alcohol, or misconduct involved,'' and that ``this
department is fully satisfied that this was no more than a hunting
accident.''
</P>
<P>
Carlos Valdez, the district attorney who prosecutes criminal cases
in Kenedy County, said he had yet to speak with the sheriff's
officials but is satisfied with what he knows of their investigation.
</P>
<P>
In Corpus Christi, doctors said they had performed a cardiac
catheterization on Whittington, a procedure used to discover whether
arteries around the heart are blocked and there has been damage to
heart function.
</P>
<P>
Johns Hopkins University cardiologist Rick Lang said the patient
likely had a good prognosis. This kind of problem usually resolves on
its own within one or two weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors were unsure of precisely where the birdshot near
Whittington's heart had lodged, Blanchard said.
</P>
<P>
Mandeep Mehra, chief of cardiology at the University of Maryland
School of Medicine, said the pellet might have ended up in the
pericardium, the heart's protective covering. If so, it could have
inflamed this covering; this inflammation can also spread to the
heart's chambers.
