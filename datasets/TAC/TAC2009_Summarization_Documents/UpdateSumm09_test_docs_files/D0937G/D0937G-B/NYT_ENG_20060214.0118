LAWYER SHOT BY CHENEY SUFFERS HEART ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON - An Austin lawyer accidentally shot by Vice President Cheney
suffered a minor heart attack Tuesday as a result of
birdshot in his heart, complicating a White House effort to
steer attention away from the weekend hunting accident.
</P>
<P>
One of the shotgun pellets that wounded Harry Whittington during a
Saturday hunt at a South Texas ranch moved into his
heart and caused the attack, said Dr. David Blanchard of
Christus Spohn Hospital Corpus Christi-Memorial, where Whittington is being treated.
</P>
<P>
Blanchard said Whittington is still expected to fully recover from being
peppered with more than 100 birdshot pellets.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Press Secretary Scott McClellan, who patiently fielded
more than 60 questions about the shooting on Monday, adopted
a new tone on Tuesday as reporters pressed for answers.
</P>
<P>
"We've got important work to do for the American people, and
that's where we're going to keep our focus. You're welcome
to continue to focus on these issues. I'm moving on,"
said McClellan, who learned about Whittington's heart attack shortly before
the noon briefing but made no mention of it.
</P>
<P>
Whittington's heart problem turned up during a routine evaluation of the
78-year-old patient. The heart attack resulted from an irregular heartbeat
triggered by a single piece of birdshot that had moved
into his heart.
</P>
<P>
Blanchard said Whittington had no other symptoms or pain.
</P>
<P>
"When birdshot is in your body there is always a risk
it can move," he said. "His arteries are clear and
he has the heart of a much younger individual."
</P>
<P>
Doctors did a cardiac catheterization and moved Whittington back into intensive
care. The procedure allows doctors to insert dye into the
heart to map the blood supply and monitor for blockage.
Blanchard said the birdshot is lodged in position and does
not pose additional danger.
</P>
<P>
"It was just a terrible, terrible accident," Peggy Puckett, one of
Whittington's four daughters, said Tuesday. "No one was at fault.
He feels bad for the vice president."
</P>
<P>
Asked if Whittington agreed with eyewitness accounts that said he was
at fault for approaching Cheney while he was shooting, Puckett
said her father "hasn't said anything like that."
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Cheney's office issued a statement on behalf
of the vice president, who has yet to make a
public comment about the shooting. In it, Cheney aides said
he was told Tuesday morning about Whittington's cardiac problem.
</P>
<P>
Cheney watched part of the Corpus Christi news conference concerning Whittington's
condition. He then called Whittington and "wished (him) well and
asked if there was anything he needed."
</P>
<P>
"The vice president said that he stood ready to assist," the
statement said. "Mr. Whittington's spirits were good, but obviously his
situation deserves the careful monitoring that his doctors are providing.
The vice president said that his thoughts and prayers are
with Mr. Whittington and his family."
</P>

<P>
McClellan's effort to divert attention from the shooting persisted throughout the
Tuesday briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We're moving on to the priorities of the American people. That's
where our focus is," McClellan said. Those priorities, he added,
include "talking about how to make health care more affordable
and accessible," a topic Bush is to address Wednesday in
Dublin, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
McClellan fielded several more questions about the shooting, but added no
new information - including no mention of the heart attack
- and referred questions to Cheney's office.
</P>
<P>
One of the questions referred to a shooting-related joke McClellan had
told at an earlier briefing on Tuesday. Before he was
aware of Whittington's updated condition, he made a humorous reference
to the fact that University of Texas football fans -
at the White House for an event honoring UT's national
champion football team - would be clad in school colors.
</P>
<P>
"The orange they're wearing is not because they are concerned that
the vice president may be there," McClellan said, a reference
to the high-visibility orange worn by hunters as a safety
precaution.
</P>
<P>
By the noon briefing, aware of Whittington's heart attack, McClellan had
a dour answer to a question about whether "there is
a certain degree of relief that Mr. Whittington seems to
be fine."
</P>
<P>
"Well, I think Mr. Whittington remains in our thoughts and prayers,"
McClellan said. "We all want to make sure that he's
OK and that he gets home and he recovers fully,
and that's where our focus is and that's where it
will continue to be."
