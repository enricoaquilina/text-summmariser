<P>
US Vice President Dick Cheney 
continued to keep a low profile Wednesday as his shooting of a 
hunting partner over the weekend and the White House's handling of 
the incident mushroomed into a political controversy.
</P>
<P>
Cheney -- who has yet to express regret publicly for wounding 
78-year-old Texas lawyer Harry Whittington in the neck, chest and 
face -- called him in his hospital room Tuesday to offer help and 
best wishes, the vice president's office said.
</P>
<P>
Doctors blamed birdshot that shifted to Whittington's heart for 
a mild heart attack he suffered Tuesday, and said that while his 
life was not in immediate danger, and no surgery was needed to 
remove the lodged metal, he would have to stay in hospital another 
week.
</P>
<P>
Whittington has developed an irregular heartbeat called atrial 
fibrillation, which can lead to the formation of blood clots that 
can cause a stroke if they move to the brain. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney managed to duck a battalion of reporters staking out a 
meeting he had with lawmakers Tuesday, and White House aides said he 
had no plans to come forward with his account of the incident.
</P>
<P>
Amid criticism of the White House for waiting to announce the 
shooting accident for nearly 21 hours, two former Republican 
presidential press secretaries said Cheney should have reported the 
incident to the public without delay.
</P>
<P>
"It could have and should have been handled differently," Ari 
Fleischer, President George W. Bush's first spokesman from 2001 to 
2003, told the magazine Editor and Publisher.
</P>
<P>
Marlin Fitzwater, who served as press secretary to Bush's father 
and to late former president Ronald Reagan, told the same 
publication he was "appalled" at how the administration had handled 
the incident.
</P>
<P>
The vice president's office said that his first public event 
would be on Friday, in Cheyenne, Wyoming -- but that he was not 
likely to explain how a quail hunt on the Texas ranch of Katharine 
Armstrong on Saturday nearly turned tragic.
</P>
<P>
Cheney's office has refused to provide an official account of 
the hunting incident, pointing reporters to Armstrong -- a private 
citizen with no formal ties to the White House.
</P>
<P>
President Bush's current chief spokesman, Scott McClellan, 
served notice that there would be no official, formal White House 
account of how the incident occurred, even as he signalled 
impatience with questions about it.
</P>
<P>
"You all can spend your time on it. We're going to keep focusing 
on the pressing priorities of the American people, like talking 
about how to make health care more affordable and accessible," said 
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
McClellan, who learned of Whittington's heart attack just before 
his main daily briefing, declined to be drawn by questions about the 
nearly 21-hour gap between the incident and when it was made public, 
or why the news came from the ranch owner rather than official 
channels.
</P>
<P>
"What happened has been explained," he insisted.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton called Cheney's handling of 
the situation "troubling" and said "a tendency of this 
administration, from the top all the way to the bottom, is to 
withhold information."
</P>
<P>
While Cheney's Republican allies accused the US media of 
overreacting, the mood grew somber after doctors at Christus Spohn 
Hospital Memorial in Corpus Christi, Texas, reported the heart 
attack.
</P>
<P>
Hospital spokesman Peter Banko said Whittington would have to 
stay in their care for seven more days "to make sure no more 
birdshot moves into vital organs, as well as that piece of birdshot 
doesn't move anywhere else in the heart."
</P>
<P>
Dozens of pieces of birdshot -- tiny pellets about 5 millimeters 
in diameter -- remain lodged in Whittington's body.
</P>
<P>
Cheney, who visited Whittington in the hospital on Sunday, 
telephoned him Tuesday afternoon to offer his help and tell him that 
"his thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Whittington and his family," 
the vice president's office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Whittington's spirits were good, but obviously his 
situation deserves the careful monitoring that his doctors are 
providing," it said.
