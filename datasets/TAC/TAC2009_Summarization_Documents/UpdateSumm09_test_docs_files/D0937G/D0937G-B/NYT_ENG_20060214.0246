The 78-year-old lawyer shot by Vice President Dick Cheney
in a hunting accident over the weekend suffered a minor
heart attack early Tuesday from birdshot lodged in his heart,
hospital officials in Texas said.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer, Harry Whittington, was moved back into the intensive care
unit at Christus Spohn Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas, to
be monitored for up to a week in case the
birdshot shifted or additional pellets in his body moved into
other organs, the officials said at a televised news conference.
Dr. David Blanchard, the emergency room chief, estimated that Whittington
had more than five but "probably less than 150 to
200" pellets lodged in his body.
</P>
<P>
Blanchard said that the hospital's cardiologists were optimistic that the pellet
in Whittington's heart would not travel farther and that he
would be able to function normally. They said they did
not consider the other pellets in his body problematic.
</P>
<P>
Cheney's office, in its first official announcement about the incident, released
a statement shortly after 2:30 p.m. Eastern time saying that
the vice president's "thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Whittington
and his family" and that Cheney had spoken by telephone
to Whittington an hour earlier.
</P>
<P>
"The vice president wished Mr. Whittington well and asked if there
was anything he needed," the statement said. "The vice president
said that he stood ready to assist."
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Whittington's spirits were "good," but "obviously his
situation deserves the careful monitoring that his doctors are providing."
</P>
<P>
The downturn in Whittington's health significantly changed the tone of the
White House reaction to the hunting accident. In Texas, Carlos
Valdez, the district attorney in Kleberg County, said a fatality
would immediately spur a new report from the local sheriff
and, most likely, a grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
Cheney's aides said he first learned of the change in Whittington's
condition when he arrived at his West Wing office about
7:40 a.m. on Tuesday, shortly after doctors in Corpus Christi
said that they had picked up an irregular heartbeat from
Whittington during their morning rounds.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said that the pellet, which they had known since the
accident was near Whittington's heart, had evidently moved into the
heart muscle, causing "some quivering" called atrial fibrillation. Whittington, who
had been shot by Cheney on Saturday and moved out
of intensive care on Monday, was immediately put back into
intensive care.
