ACCOUNT OF DOCTORS RAISES QUESTIONS ON HEART INJURY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The account given Tuesday by doctors caring for the Texas lawyer
accidentally shot by Vice President Dick Cheney last weekend raises
serious questions about how and when a pellet entered his
heart and what tests were done to establish where the
pellet was lodged, doctors not connected with his case said.
</P>
<P>
Although the public was told for the first time on Tuesday
that a shotgun pellet from a hunting accident had lodged
in the lawyer's heart, one of his doctors said that
"we knew that he had some birdshot very close to
the heart from the get-go," but not its precise location.
</P>
<P>
Such evidence would have come from standard chest X-rays and a
CT scan if one was performed shortly after his admission
to a hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas.
</P>
<P>
Earlier accounts described as minor the pellet wounds that the lawyer,
Harry M. Whittington, suffered in the face, neck, chest and
ribs.
</P>
<P>
Cheney sprayed Whittington, 78, with six to 200 pieces of birdshot,
the doctors said Tuesday. One pellet apparently moved to damage
his heart, causing two problems: an abnormal heart rhythm, atrial
fibrillation, and a minor heart attack that were detected early
Tuesday morning, the doctors said in a news conference at
Christus Spohn Hospital in Corpus Christi.
</P>
<P>
Their account left open the source of the birdshot that migrated
to the heart and how it got there.
</P>
<P>
Dr. O. Wayne Isom, the chairman of heart and chest surgery
at Weill Cornell Medical College, said it was unlikely that
a pellet would migrate to the heart through the bloodstream,
as some have assumed from the account of the Texas
doctors.
</P>
<P>
The reason, Isom said, is that the pellet would have to
enter a vein, travel to and through the lung vessels
that go to the heart, and then lodge in heart
tissue, not in one of its chambers. The pellets were
approximately 5 millimeters, about the size of a BB, and
larger than most blood vessels, said Dr. David Blanchard, director
of emergency services at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
A more likely explanation, Isom said, is that the pellet lodged
in or touched the heart when Whittington was shot.
</P>
<P>
Doctors use different X-ray techniques to determine the position of a
pellet in the heart. But the account of the Texas
doctors was unclear regarding which ones they performed and when.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter Banko, the Texas hospital's emergency department medical director, said
doctors there did an ultrasound, a CT scan and a
cardiac catheterization, which provide two-dimensional images. Banko said the hospital
had a 64-slice CT scan that could provide three-dimensional images,
but he did not say that the doctors performed the
more sophisticated one on Whittington, or if so, when.
</P>
<P>
Doctors try to synchronize such CT X-rays with the heartbeat to
avoid blurring from motion, said Dr. Jeffrey P. Goldman, a
specialist in heart CT scans at Manhattan Diagnostic Radiology. But,
Goldman said, doctors cannot synchronize a CT scan in patients
with atrial fibrillation.
</P>
<P>
Metal in a pellet can cause a different kind of blurring
in CT scans. But the Texas doctors did not say
that they performed a 64-slice CT scan after they learned
Whittington had a pellet near his heart and before he
developed the abnormal heart rhythm.
</P>
<P>
Goldman said that "until you do the test you don't know
how much blurring there is."
</P>
<P>
Isom said patients could develop atrial fibrillation two to three days
after stitches were placed in a heart or it was
injured.
</P>
<P>
The Texas doctors did not say how they determined that Whittington
had had a heart attack. Two standard tests are from
electrocardiograms and measuring enzymes. But injuries to the heart can
cause a rise in enzymes that may not necessarily represent
a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
The Texas doctors and the White House doctors with whom they
discussed Whittington's case did not respond to a request for
interviews.
