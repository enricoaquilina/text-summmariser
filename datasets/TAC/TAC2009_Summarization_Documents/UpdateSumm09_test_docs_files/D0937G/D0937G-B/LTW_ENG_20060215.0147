Cheney Accepts Blame for Accidental Shooting

<P>
Vice President Dick Cheney said in a broadcast
interview Wednesday that he accepts full blame for mistakenly shooting
a hunting partner last weekend, abandoning his tight-lipped stance on
an accident that has drawn sharp criticism and proved damaging to the
Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
In his first public comments on the incident, Cheney called the day
of the shooting ``one of the worst days of my life,'' appearing somber
and shaken as he described having shot Harry M. Whittington, a
78-year-old Austin, Texas, lawyer last Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But Cheney was unrepentant during the 27-minute interview with Brit
Hume of Fox News Channel about his decision not to tell the news media
about the accident until the next day. Cheney acknowledged waiting
until after he knew ``that Harry was probably going to be OK'' before
allowing it to be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
At that point, Cheney said, leaving it to the owner of the Texas
ranch where the shooting occurred to contact one local reporter ``was
the right call.''
</P>
<P>
The vice president's decision to discuss the incident came after
three days of intense criticism and was an unusual move for Cheney,
who rarely grants interviews and then largely to conservative TV and
radio commentators whose audience regards him as a hero.
</P>
<P>
In this case, said Jennifer Mayfield, a spokeswoman, Cheney ``just
wanted to talk to the American people, and we thought an interview
would be the best way to do so.''
</P>
<P>
Cheney used the opportunity to show a more human side to an
accident that has made him the butt of jokes and scathing criticism,
and become a liability for a White House struggling to improve its
image in an election year.
</P>
<P>
Since Sunday, the incident has distracted attention from President
Bush's activities, such as his visit Wednesday to Ohio to promote his
health care proposals. It has also served to underscore criticism of
Cheney and the administration as secretive and raised new questions
about their credibility.
</P>
<P>
Cheney said he is still haunted by the shooting.
</P>
<P>
``The image of him falling is something I'll never ever be able to
get out of my mind. I fired, and there's Harry falling. It was, I'd
have to say, one of the worst days of my life at that moment,'' said
Cheney, who was interviewed in his ceremonial office in the old
Executive Office Building next door to the White House.
</P>
<P>
The vice president broke with allies who had suggested that
Whittington was at fault for wandering unannounced into Cheney's line
of fire.
</P>
<P>
``I'm the guy who pulled the trigger that fired the round that hit
Harry. You can talk about all of the other conditions that exist at
the time but that's the bottom line, and it was not Harry's fault,''
Cheney said. ``You can't blame anybody else. I'm the guy who pulled
the trigger and shot my friend.''
</P>
<P>
Whittington was in stable condition at a hospital in Corpus
Christi, Texas, officials there said. He is under observation after
one of the pellets Cheney shot Saturday moved to his heart, causing
inflammation and restricting blood flow in what doctors described as a
minor heart attack early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cheney's hastily scheduled interview was a change in course by the
vice president, whose office shared few details about the accident. It
came as prominent Republicans and public relations specialists were
criticizing the White House for its handling of the story.
</P>
<P>
Marlin Fitzwater, who served as White House press secretary for
Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush, faulted Cheney for the
approach in an interview with Editor &amp; Publisher, saying he ``ignored
his responsibility to the American people.'' Fitzwater told the
magazine's Web site that he was ``appalled by the whole handling of
this.''
</P>
<P>
Cheney defended his decision to stay silent about the accident
until the next day, acknowledging that senior White House aides had
``urged us to get the story out.'' He argued that, for the sake of
accuracy, he wanted to wait until Whittington's condition was clear
before contacting reporters.

<P>
Trevor Parry-Giles, a political communication specialist at the
University of Maryland, said in choosing to speak to Fox, a network
seen as more sympathetic to the administration than other news
outlets, Cheney had chosen ``a perfect venue'' for him.
</P>
<P>
But Parry-Giles added that the interview ``will only fuel the
suspicions that people already have about him, that he is unwilling to
open himself to criticism.''
</P>
<P>
``I don't know that it will help him in terms of the public
perception,'' Parry-Giles said.

<P>
Democrats and liberal groups criticized Cheney for limiting his
remarks on the matter to one session with a network they called biased
in his favor.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, noted that Cheney has
not had a news conference to field questions from reporters in three
and a half years.
</P>
<P>
``He ought to have one to clear the air not only on this issue, but
more importantly on the many other issues that have been shrouded by a
veil of secrecy,'' Schumer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Republicans rallied to Cheney's defense.
</P>
<P>
``The constant second-guessing of what the vice president should
have said and when he should have said it is an unnecessary diversion
from the many issues facing our nation,'' said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham,
R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would go hunting again in the future, Cheney, an
avid outdoorsman, said, ``I'll have to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
``The season is ending,'' he added. ``I'm going to let some time
pass over it and think about the future.''
