HANDLING OF ACCIDENT CAUSING TENSION BETWEEN WHITE HOUSE STAFFS

<P>
When the White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, entered
the press room Tuesday morning and suggested he was wearing
an orange tie to avoid a stray shot from Vice
President Dick Cheney, it seemed to signal an effort to
defuse the accidental-shooting story with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
But by midday, it was clear that the staffs of the
president and the vice president had failed to communicate. Just
after arriving at work around 7:45 a.m., Cheney learned that
the man he shot, Harry Whittington, was about to undergo
a heart procedure because his injuries were more serious than
earlier believed, Cheney's spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
No one in Cheney's office passed the word to McClellan, senior
officials at the White House said, adding that the press
secretary never would have joked about the shooting accident if
he had known about the turn of events involving Whittington.
It was the latest example of the degree to which
Cheney's habit of living in his own world in the
Bush White House -- surrounded by his own staff, relying
on his own instincts, saying as little as possible --
had backfired since the accident in Texas on Saturday. Cheney's
staff members have kept their comments to chronological details and
to repeating Cheney's written statements.
</P>
<P>
The tension between President Bush's staff and Cheney's has been palpable,
with White House officials whispering to reporters about how they
tried to handle the news of the shooting differently.
</P>
<P>
McClellan, while being careful not to cross Cheney or his aides
directly, has made a point of reminding reporters of how
he dealt with Bush's bicycle accident last summer, when the
president collided with a policeman at the G-8 summit. "I
immediately briefed the press on how the accident had happened,
and the condition of the police officer," who was taken
to the hospital with minor injuries, McClellan said. His message
was clear: There was a procedure for conveying this kind
of news, and it was not followed in this case.
</P>
<P>
Several White House officials said no one among the White House
staff, including the chief of staff, Andrew H. Card, felt
empowered to dictate how news of the shooting accident would
be handled. Presumably the Bush himself could have declared how
the news would be disseminated, something he does often on
policy matters.
</P>
<P>
Until this week, the periodic disconnect between Cheney's office and the
rest of the White House has been the source of
grumbling, but rarely open tension.
