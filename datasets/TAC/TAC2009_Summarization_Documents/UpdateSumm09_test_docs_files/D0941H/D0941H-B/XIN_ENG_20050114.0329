The European built space probe 
Huygens has sent back the first 350 pictures of the Saturn's moon 
Titan, the European Space Agency (ESA) announced on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The first picture was taken from the height of about 16 km, as 
Huygens descended before landing on the surface of Titan, the 
largest satellite of Saturn, and it showed a possibly rocky 
surface with "drainage channels" for liquids.
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely a raw picture, but it has wonderful clarity,
" said Marty Tomasko, an Arizona University imaging specialist, 
pointing to what looks like "drainage channels, canyons, also 
maybe a shoreline."
</P>
<P>
After an interplanetary trip of over seven years, the probe 
Huygens landed earlier Friday on the Titan surface. Huygens' 
descent, on a moon about 1.5 billion km from the Earth, is the 
most distant ever attempted in the solar system.
</P>
<P>
The saucer-shaped probe then registered data and transmitted 
them home via the mother spacecraft Cassini, marking the success 
of the Cassini-Huygens mission worth a total of 3.2 billion US 
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The mission, a joint project of NASA, ESA and the Italian Space
Agency, was launched on Oct. 15, 1997 from Cape Canaveral, in 
Florida to study Saturn, its rings and moons.
</P>
<P>
Huygens was separated from its mother ship Cassini on Dec. 25 
after a seven-year journey to begin its free-fall toward Titan.
</P>
<P>
Named after Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, the probe's 
final descent toward Titan started at 1013 GMT on Friday. During 
the descending process of two hours and a half, it began to film 
Titan's surface, measure wind speed and pressure and analyze the 
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Titan was chosen for the mission since it is the only moon in 
the Solar System that has a substantial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe the organic chemical reactions taking place 
on Titan resemble the processes that gave rise to life on the 
Earth 4 billion years ago.
