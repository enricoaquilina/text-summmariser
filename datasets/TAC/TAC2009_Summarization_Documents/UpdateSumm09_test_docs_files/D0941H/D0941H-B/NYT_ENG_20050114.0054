EUROPEAN CRAFT MAKES SOFT LANDING ON SATURN MOON

<P>
A European spacecraft landed safely Friday on the
surface of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, scientists here said, and
began transmitting data back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
Mission controllers said they were confident the Huygens craft made a
soft landing by parachute because it was still transmitting signals
long after its scheduled touchdown at about 1:30 p.m. (8:30
a.m. Eastern time).
</P>
<P>
"We know it has landed based on the laws of gravity,"
the European Space Agency's science director, David Southwood, said.
</P>
<P>
"It simply cannot still be flying. It's got to be on
a solid surface, and it must be soft."
</P>
<P>
It is the first landing of a spacecraft on the moon
of another planet. And Titan is no ordinary moon, but
a body larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto, and
almost the size of Mars.
</P>
<P>
The first data from Huygens came before noon Eastern time, and
pictures are expected later.
</P>
<P>
Even on Titan's surface, the craft's batteries will be running low
-- time enough for no more than 30 minutes to
two hours of observations and picture-taking.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday Dr. Jean-Pierre Lebreton, the mission manager at the European
Space Operations Center here, said, "I'm quite confident we will
have something special."
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing Thursday, Dr. Martin G. Tomasko of the
University of Arizona, a Huygens scientist, said the craft's camera
and science instruments were expected to provide "a spectacularly new
view of Titan and an understanding of this mysterious world."
</P>
<P>
Scientists were hoping to get their first peek inside one of
the most intriguing atmospheres in the solar system.
</P>
<P>
Its dense hydrocarbon smog suggests complex chemical processes like those that
led to life on Earth. Tomasko said previous observations indicated
that the atmosphere would appear green at higher altitudes and
then turn orange closer to the surface.
</P>
<P>
This atmosphere has also been frustrating. The perpetual smoggy veil has
limited any view of Titan's surface to little more than
a vague patchwork of light and dark regions, with only
some hints of rugged topography.
</P>
<P>
The mission by the 700-pound Huygens, built and operated by the
European Space Agency, is part of a $3.2 billion undertaking
by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, ESA and the
Italian Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
Huygens (named for the 17th-century Dutch astronomer) rode piggyback on NASA's
six-ton Cassini spacecraft for the seven-year journey to the wide-ranging
orbit of Saturn. On the night of Dec. 24-25, Cassini
released its fellow traveler for its solo cruise on course
for Titan and is now in a position to relay
all the data sent from Huygens during the descent and
landing.
</P>
<P>
The possibility remains that a design flaw in Cassini's radio receiver
system will hopelessly scramble the data. Engineers anticipated that signals
from the wind-tossed Huygens would vary widely in frequency and
strength, and thus compensated for it in the receiver's design.
But they had failed to take into account frequency shifts
that would also throw off the timing of the encoded
data, leaving it a garbled mess.
</P>
<P>
In early 2000, an ESA engineer recognized the problem. Finally, ESA
and NASA engineers found a way to reduce the frequency
shifts to acceptable levels by altering the trajectory and orientation
of Cassini during the critical maneuvers.
