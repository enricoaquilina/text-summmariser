Touchdown!

After a seven-year-trip through outer space, the Huygens space
probe successfully completed the last leg of its epic voyage to Titan
on Friday, releasing initial black and white images that brought tears
to the eyes of the mission's scientists.
</P>
<P>
Taken from 10 miles above Saturn's mysterious moon, one picture
shows what appear to be short drainage channels heading to a
coastline, perhaps carved by liquids such as methane. Another image,
from five miles above Titan, portrays what researchers said might be
flooded plains and shorelines. A third depicts a surface strewn with
blocks of frozen liquid.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said they were ``astonished'' by the images. Hundreds
more are expected.
</P>
<P>
``My initial reaction on seeing these pictures was `Wow! Look at
that, it worked,' '' said NASA's Robert Mitchell, program manager for
the international Cassini program that delivered the probe to Titan.
</P>
<P>
The scientific feat, 25 years in the making, represents the
farthest from Earth that a spacecraft has ever landed, about 890
million miles away. Researchers believe Saturn's hazy moon may mirror
conditions of an early Earth ``in deep freeze,'' with some scientists
speculating on the existence of everything from icy methane lakes and
an organic compound-rich smog to ``continents'' of rock and ice and
fierce lightning and thunderstorms. A slew of photo and sensor data
sent back to Earth may now begin answering those questions.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after detaching from NASA's Cassini spacecraft and
hurtling toward the gargantuan moon, Huygens completed its journey
through Titan's thick atmosphere in slightly less than 2 1/2 hours,
said the agency's researchers. In comments to the media, Mitchell said
all of the probe's precious photo and sensor data had been relayed to
Cassini within minutes of its landing.
</P>
<P>
Crowded into the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt,
Germany, scientists joined journalists in peering at banks of computer
monitors throughout the day. With confirmation that the first data had
arrived from the probe via Cassini, the control room burst into
cheers, with researchers hugging one another and smiling broadly.
</P>
<P>
``So we are the very first visitors of Titan and that scientific
data that we are collecting now shall unveil the secrets of this new
world,'' declared a jubilant Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's director
general, in a briefing broadcast live on NASA TV. The Cassini-Huygens
mission, jointly sponsored by ESA, NASA, and the Italian Space Agency,
will live on through the Cassini mothership, slated to explore
Saturn's planetary system for four more years.
</P>
<P>
The first sighs of relief arrived when the Robert C. Byrd Green
Bank Telescope of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green
Bank, W.Va., detected a faint signal coming from the probe during its
descent. This ``carrier'' signal, similar to the dial tone of a
telephone, indicated the heat shield covering the back of Huygens had
been ejected, the main parachute had been deployed, the batteries had
switched on, and the probe had begun transmitting data.
</P>
<P>
The 705-pound probe, elated researchers said, was ``alive.''
</P>
<P>
His voice choked with emotion, NASA Associate Administrator of
Science Alphonso Diaz saluted the ``tremendous success'' of the
cooperative effort. ``There will only be one first successful landing
on Titan and this was it,'' said the 20-year project veteran.
</P>
<P>
David Southwood, director of ESA's scientific program, said he
doubted whether a repeat landing on Titan would occur within the
lifetime of anyone at the briefing. ``So this is the data,'' he said.
``It's for posterity and it's for mankind.''
</P>
<P>
It is also, he concluded, only the beginning.
