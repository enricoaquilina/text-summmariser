Punching through haze and history, a European space probe
landed on Saturn's major moon Friday and revealed a frigid
realm of apparent rivers and lakes that seemed both familiar
and fascinating to astronomers.
</P>
<P>
The first look at Titan from the European Space Agency's Huygens
probe also showed icy boulders on rugged terrain and ignited
celebratory glee among scientists at the Germany-based control center and
in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
"You can almost imagine yourself standing on the surface, looking out
and surveying the scene," said University of Arizona planetary scientist
Martin Tomasko, the chief of the probe's camera team. "I
was struck by how similar the landscape looks to what
we might see on the Earth, what we have seen
on Mars, what we have seen on a variety of
planets."
</P>
<P>
The Huygens probe's parachute descent through Titan's thick smoggy atmosphere delivered
a drama-filled conclusion to a more than seven-year journey that
began when NASA launched the $3.4 billion Cassini mission to
Saturn.
</P>
<P>
The saucer-shaped spacecraft represented a $500 million contribution to the 19-nation
mission from the European Space Agency, which orchestrated the landing
from Darmstadt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
In a continuing search for what Titan and Earth have in
common, mission experts will sift through more images for several
days from a moon that is slightly smaller than Mars
and 750 million miles from Earth. Studies of the imagery
and environmental readings gathered by Huygens will likely continue for
years.
</P>
<P>
But just as the first images last year from the Mars
rovers kept NASA scientists busy for months, Friday's first snapshots
amounted to a sneak preview. The black and white images
suggested a lunar surface with bright elevated land masses, grooved
by sloping drainage channels and seemingly surrounded by dark, still
pools of oily liquid.
</P>
<P>
Scientists speculated that torrents of grimy methane or ethane rain shoved
the boulders down to the spacecraft's equatorial landing site.
</P>
<P>
Huygens is named for the Dutch scientist who discovered Titan in
1655. But the moon had evaded close scrutiny until the
first of NASA's Voyager probes cruised by in 1980. The
flyby revealed a thick atmosphere of nitrogen that scientists believed
could harbor environmental conditions similar to those on Earth before
life emerged.
</P>
<P>
Cassini began orbiting Saturn in late June as part of a
four-year mission to study the distant planet's ring system and
more than 30 moons.
</P>
<P>
A vexing petroleum haze of methane, ethane and traces of other
carbon-rich gases obscured the true nature of Titan even from
Cassini's cameras and cloud-piercing radar.
</P>
<P>
Huygens, which separated from Cassini last month, offered a 20-fold improvement
in detail as it drifted nearly 2 1/2 hours before
touching down. Even on the surface, Huygens kept taking pictures
until its batteries died.
</P>
<P>
"This is really, really astonishing," said Jean-Pierre Lebreton, the Huygens mission
chief scientist and one of the first researchers to suggest
that methane and ethane would be stable as liquids even
at the 300-degree-below temperatures on the moon's surface.
</P>
<P>
"I just love the idea of there being liquid down there,"
said David Southwood, the European Space Agency's chief scientist. "If
there is liquid down there, it is going to evaporate,
it's going to rain, do all those things we know
and love on the Earth."
</P>
<P>
Friday's landing marked the pinnacle of achievement in space for the
European Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Just incredible," said an emotional Al Diaz, NASA's associate administrator for
space science. "There will be only one first landing on
Titan. This was it, and the European Space Agency deserves
a tremendous amount of credit."
