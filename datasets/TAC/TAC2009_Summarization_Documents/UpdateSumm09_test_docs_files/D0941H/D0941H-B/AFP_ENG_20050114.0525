<P>
A European robot lab 
parachuted to the surface of the Saturn moon Titan on Friday, 
successfully climaxing a venture to explore one of the most 
beguiling phenomena in the Solar System, mission leaders here said.
</P>
<P>
Operating in the dark and friendless chill of deep space, the 
unmanned probe Huygens glided to Titan's surface, relaying its 
findings to its American mothership Cassini, which then sent the 
data home to NASA's waiting radio sentinels.
</P>
<P>
Joy erupted at mission control as the precious data poured in.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and space chiefs have bet more than three billion 
dollars on the Cassini-Huygens project and some have spent a 
quarter-century of their lives planning it and carrying it out.
</P>
<P>
Huygens is "a scientific success ... and a fantastic success as 
well for international cooperation," the director-general of the 
European Space Agency (ESA), Jean-Jacques Dordain, declared.
</P>
<P>
The probe headed to Titan's surface carrying half a dozen 
instruments within a clam-like shell to film and measure the moon's 
weather system and methane-rich atmosphere during a 
two-and-a-half-hour descent.
</P>
<P>
Its sensors were designed to continue working for just three 
minutes after it landed on the bone-freezing Titan surface.
</P>
<P>
But delighted scientists said the instruments probably continued 
to function for at least half an hour after touchdown, possibly 
providing vital clues as to whether Titan is covered by rock, 
methane ice or an ocean of chemicals.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure we have at least 30 minutes of surface science," said 
Jean-Pierre Lebreton, head of the Huygens mission at ESA.
</P>
<P>
Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn, was chosen for the 
3.2-billion-dollar (2.46-billion-euro) transatlantic venture as, 
intriguingly, it is the only moon in the Solar System that has a 
substantial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Its thick mix of nitrogen and methane is suspected to be 
undergoing chemical reactions similar to those that unfolded on 
Earth billions of years ago. That process eventually provided the 
conditions for life on our planet.
</P>
<P>
"Titan is a time machine. It will especially provide us with the 
opportunity to know about the conditions on our early Earth," 
Alphonso Diaz, NASA Science assistant administrator, said.
</P>
<P>
Huygen's descent, on a moon 1.5 billion kilometers (940 million 
miles) from home,  was the farthest landing from Earth ever 
attempted.
</P>
<P>
The operation was fraught with potential hitches, including the 
risk of a crash or catastrophic malfunction when the 319-kilo 
(702-pound) craft entered Titan's roiling atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Cassini had given Huygens a piggyback ride to Saturn and its 
moon system.
</P>
<P>
Their epic seven-year trip, covering 2.1 billion kilometers (1.3 
billion miles), culminated last July.
</P>
<P>
Dordain described Friday's outcome as "a fantastic success for 
Europe, first of all for European industry which delivered a very 
complex machine. It worked beautifully with six scientific 
instruments, in a very harsh environment in order to break the 
secret of Titan."
</P>
<P>
But it was also "a fantastic success as well for international 
cooperation," said Dordain. "We should learn lessons from this 
success. Lessons don't come only from failure."
</P>
<P>
German Research Minister Edelgard Buhlman was equally overjoyed, 
hailing the mission as "one of the greatest events in space science 
and technology."
</P>
<P>
The chemical processes believed to be unfolding on `Titan may 
give clues as to how life took root on Earth.
</P>
<P>
But life -- or at least life as we understand it -- is unlikely 
to exist on Titan itself, given that it is so far from Sun, 
receiving negligible solar heat and light. The moon's surface 
temperature is estimated to be -180 Celsius (-292 Fahrenheit).
</P>
<P>
After Friday's drama, Cassini will pursue its four-year mission 
map Saturn, the second largest planet of the Solar System, and its 
leading satellites. 
</P>
<P>
Huygens is named after the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, 
who discovered Titan in 1655. Cassini's name comes from the Italian 
Jean-Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), who discovered the Saturnian 
satellites Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys and Dione.
</P>
<P>
In 1675, he discovered what is called the "Cassini Division," 
the gap between Saturn's rings.
