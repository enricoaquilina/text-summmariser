EUROPEAN SPACECRAFT LANDS ON TITAN AND SENDS PHOTOS

A European spacecraft plunged through the murky atmosphere
of Saturn's moon Titan on Friday and successfully came to
rest on a bizarre landscape never before explored.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers expressed joy at achieving the first landing on another planet's
moon, particularly Titan, the only moon in the solar system
to have a substantial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
"We clearly have a success," said Dr. Jean-Jacques Dordain, director general
of the European Space Agency. "This is a fantastic success
for Europe."
</P>
<P>
The first pictures from the spacecraft, Huygens, did nothing to undermine
the reputation of Titan as a strange place. One showed
terrain of what appeared to be deep channels leading to
the shoreline of a dark, flat surface, possibly a lake
of liquid methane.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly there is liquid matter flowing on the surface of Titan,"
said Dr. Martin G. Tomasko of the University of Arizona,
an imaging specialist for the mission. That possibility has tantalized
scientists, who say Titan may resemble Earth early in its
development and could give clues to the origin of life
here.
</P>
<P>
The black and white pictures, taken as Huygens descended, were a
foretaste of more highly processed color pictures that are expected
to be made public on Saturday, Tomasko said.
</P>
<P>
At 5:13 p.m. local time (11:13 a.m. ET), cheers went up
here at the European Space Operations Center as the engineering
and scientific data arrived, a seal of mission success.
</P>
<P>
Although the Huygens spacecraft was part of the $3.2 billion Cassini
mission to Saturn in partnership with the United States, the
Europeans saw it as a particularly challenging engineering endeavor that
could elevate their reputation as major players in space technology.
The American-built Cassini spacecraft may have delivered Huygens to the
threshold of its achievement, but a spacecraft built in Europe
and directed here became the first to land on the
moon of another planet.
</P>
<P>
It is a feat that, as Dr. David Southwood, the space
agency's director of science programs, said, is "not likely to
be repeated in the lifetime of anyone alive today --
so this is a really historic event."
</P>
<P>
And so, the Huygens team put scientific interpretation aside and enjoyed
a triumph that was a long time coming.
</P>
<P>
"You can probably detect a certain relief on my face," Southwood
said, and he was not alone in the control rooms
at Darmstadt.
