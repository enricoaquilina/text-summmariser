SPACECRAFT MAY UNLOCK SECRETS OF SATURN'S MOON TITAN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Scientists have long thought thick clouds over Saturn's moon Titan
rained methane through smoggy skies. Some believed the liquid pooled
on the planet's surface, perhaps forming lakes or seas reminiscent of
Earth's.
</P>
<P>
Recent images of the moon -- about half the size of Earth -- show
dark regions next to a light one. Researchers, however, haven't been
able to figure out which is higher in elevation, let alone what
they're made of.
</P>
<P>
Space scientists hope to finally get some answers in three weeks when
they send a space probe spinning down through the thick atmosphere of
a world more distant than any visited before.
</P>
<P>
Friday holds a pivotal moment for Cassini, partly built in and partly
controlled from Colorado and estimated to cost the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and the European Space Agency
$3.3 billion. Launched in 1997 and expected to collect pictures and
data until at least 2008, the spacecraft will fly 45 times by Titan,
the only moon in the solar system with a significant atmosphere. Many
scientists suspect the moon has its own weather, as well as chemical
cycles similar to those on Earth, and can even help researchers
understand how life originated here.
</P>
<P>
From what scientists can tell, the chemical composition of Titan's
atmosphere reflects what was on Earth several billion years ago, when
life was just getting started, said Carolyn Porco, Cassini imaging
leader and a researcher with the Space Science Institute in Boulder,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
"(Titan) doesn't have liquid water, because it's too cold ... but
chemical processes that are happening slowly there might be similar
to what happened on Earth," Porco said.
</P>
<P>
"This will be like a Jules Verne adventure," she said. "Maybe we'll
see cliffs and cracks, maybe we'll see meandering streams and
valleys. Or maybe we won't."
</P>
<P>
Sometime after 8 p.m. Friday, Cassini researchers scattered around
the world will watch as the landing probe Huygens separates from the
spacecraft and heads toward the moon.
</P>
<P>
If separation is successful, Huygens will spend three more weeks
sinking slowly toward Titan. On Jan. 14, it will float through the
atmosphere on parachutes, shooting pictures for 2 1/2 hours before it
hits the surface.
</P>
<P>
Larry Esposito, a University of Colorado planetary scientist, said
he's "just burning with curiosity" to see what's captured by the
probe's cameras, which were built by Lockheed Martin engineers in
Jefferson County.
</P>
<P>
"I'm guessing it'll look a little like a bad day of skiing at Vail,
when all the snow is dirty and hummocked, it's slushy and muddy, ...
(and) maybe there's water underneath," Esposito said.
</P>
<P>
Huygens, which can float, is designed to hit the planet's surface at
less than 20 mph, he said, and it may be able to send pictures for a
half hour from the ground, a lake or whatever else it encounters.
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Martin engineer Chuck Rasbach helped design one of the
Huygens cameras, which he called "rugged, robust and compact."
</P>
<P>
The camera has been tested every six months on the seven-year journey
to Saturn, he said, and appears to be functioning well.
</P>
<P>
Rasbach said he's proud to be part of the Cassini team, although the
mission isn't likely to have practical outcomes.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't mind designing telephones, because it's practical, you
use a telephone every day," he said. "With space, well, ... it moves
humanity forward."
