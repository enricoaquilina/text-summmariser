European space probe heads for Titan after separating from US craft

The European-made space probe Huygens headed Saturday for a historic
up-close encounter with Titan, the only celestial body of the Solar
system with an atmosphere resembling that of Earth, after successfully
separating from the US spacecraft Cassini.
</P>
<P>
The mission may help prove, or disprove, a long-held hypothesis that
Titan may even have rain as well as lakes and rivers, albeit
containing not water by unknown muddy substances.
</P>
<P>
"The probe successfully detached from the Cassini orbiter," Rosemary
Sullivant, a spokeswoman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, California, told AFP in a brief telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
"They received the signal, I think, at 7:24 (0324 GMT Saturday) this
evening Pacific time," she said. "All systems performed as expected,
and no problems were reported."
</P>
<P>
It will take Huygens 20 days to reach Titan. The European probe is
scheduled to arrive at its destination on January 14.
</P>
<P>
At separation time, specially designed springs gently pushed Huygens
away from Cassini onto a ballistic four-million-kilometer (about
2.5-million-mile) path toward Titan, officials said.
</P>
<P>
And then, it was on its way.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to congratulate our European partners as their journey
begins and wish them well on their descent to Titan," Robert
Mitchell, NASA's Cassini program manager, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We are very excited to see the probe off and to have accomplished
this part of our job."
</P>
<P>
David Southwood, director for science at the European Space Agency,
thanked his American colleagues for their assistance in the project
and expressed confidence in continued fruitful cooperation between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"Now all our hopes and expectations are focused on getting the first
in-situ data from a new world we've been dreaming of exploring for
decades," Southwood said.
</P>
<P>
The European probe will remain dormant until the on-board timer wakes
it up shortly before it reaches Titan's upper atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Then it will begin a dramatic plunge through Titan's murky
atmosphere, tasting the chemical makeup and composition as it
descends, with the help of parachutes, to touch down on the moon's
surface.
</P>
<P>
The data gathered during this descent, which is expected to take two
and a half hours, will be transmitted from the probe to the Cassini
orbiter.
</P>
<P>
Cassini, in turn, is scheduled to perform Monday a deflection
maneuver to keep it from following Huygens into Titan's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The move will also help establish the required geometry between the
probe and the orbiter for radio communications during the European
probe's descent.
</P>
<P>
Then the US orbiter will point its antenna to Earth and relay the
data through the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration to
the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Huygens  yet to be determined nature.
