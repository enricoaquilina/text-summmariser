Cassini launches European probe on course to Saturn moon Titan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The international Cassini spacecraft launched a probe on a three-week
free-fall toward Saturn's mysterious moon Titan, where it will plunge
into the hazy atmosphere and descend by parachute while its science
instruments and cameras make observations.
</P>
<P>
The European Space Agency's Huygens probe is equipped with
instruments to sample the chemistry of the planet-size moon's thick
atmosphere, and may reveal whether it actually has lakes or seas of
liquid methane and ethane that have been theorized by scientists.
</P>
<P>
A signal confirming release of the probe was received at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory at 7:24 p.m. PST (0324 GMT Saturday). The
actual event occurred earlier, but it took more than an hour for
radio signals to cross the hundreds of millions of miles between
Saturn and Earth.
</P>
<P>
Smiles broke out in the JPL control room where many members of the
mission staff wore red and white Santa hats.
</P>
<P>
The aim had to be good because Huygens has no maneuvering system to
adjust its own course, and it was designed to remain dormant until
just before hitting Titan's atmosphere Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
"This was a big one partly because we had to do this right or no
mission at all," said David Southwood, the ESA science program
director. "But there's still a lot to come. We've got a hell of a
long way to go."
</P>
<P>
A detailed analysis of data from the release was under way, but there
were no indications of any problems, said Earl Maize, the Cassini
deputy program manager at JPL.
</P>
<P>
"We are quite confident we had a very clean release," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cassini was equipped with springs to gently push the 705-pound
(320-kilogram) probe away at a rate of one foot per second and impart
a stabilizing spin of seven revolutions per minute. Next week Cassini
will make a course change to avoid following Huygens into Titan's
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Huygens was designed for only a brief mission. After entering the
atmosphere it will deploy a huge parachute that will allow it to make
a 2 1/2-hour descent while radioing findings back to Cassini.
</P>
<P>
After touching down at 15 mph (24 kph), it may continue sending data
for up to 30 minutes, when either its battery fails or Cassini
vanishes over Titan's horizon.
</P>
<P>
Cassini will later turn its antenna toward Earth and send the data
back to NASA's Deep Space Network and on to an ESA operations center
in Darmstadt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Titan is a key target of Cassini's $3.3 billion (euro2.4 billion)
mission to study the Saturn system, which includes its spectacular
rings and numerous moons. Scientists believe Titan may have organic _
meaning carbon-based _ compounds similar those that existed on the
early Earth.
</P>
<P>
Bigger than the planets Mercury and Pluto, Titan is the only moon in
the solar system known to have a significant atmosphere. Rich with
nitrogen and containing about 6 percent methane, the atmosphere is 1
1/2 times thicker than Earth's.
</P>
<P>
With the Saturn system averaging about 890 million miles (1.4 billion
kilometers) from the sun, Titan has a surface temperature of minus
290 degrees Fahrenheit (143 Celsius).
</P>
<P>
That surface continues to puzzle scientists despite close flybys in
which Cassini's cameras have tried to peer through Titan's smog-like
haze.
</P>
<P>
Imaging scientists have discerned distinct dark and light-colored
areas, sometimes toying with such words as "islands" to describe
features, but conceding they have yet to find a specific type of
reflection that would indicate areas of liquid.
</P>
<P>
The Cassini mission is a joint project of NASA, ESA and the Italian
space agency. Cassini was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on
Oct. 15, 1997, and arrived at Saturn in June.
