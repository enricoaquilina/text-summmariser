Huygens Probe Takes Plunge
</HEADLINE>

The Frisbee-shaped Huygens probe successfully separated from the
Cassini spacecraft Friday and began a risky 2.5-million-mile journey
to the surface of Saturn's bizarre, smog-choked moon Titan.
</P>
<P>
Applause burst out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory shortly after
7:24 p.m. PST, when scientists received word from NASA's Deep Space
Network tracking stations in Spain and Goldstone, Calif., that the
Huygens probe had cast off after a seven-year piggyback ride on the
Cassini spacecraft. All systems were said to have performed flawlessly
in the separation.
</P>
<P>
``Today's release was another successful milestone in the
Cassini-Huygens odyssey,'' said David Southwood of the European Space
Agency, which built the Huygens probe. ``Now all of our hopes and
expectations are focused on getting the first (close-up) data from a
new world we've been dreaming of exploring for decades.''
</P>
<P>
That data won't come for another three weeks, during which time the
9-foot-diameter Huygens probe will chase down Titan and then, if
everything goes as planned, hurl itself through the thick,
nitrogen-methane atmosphere before crashing into a surface that could
consist of anything from a sticky chemical sludge to poison oceans.
</P>
<P>
Titan has beguiled scientists for years because it is unlike any
other place in the solar system. The only moon with an atmosphere,
Titan is also of interest because it is thought to resemble the early
Earth, before plant life formed and began pumping oxygen into the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Too frigid at minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit to grow life itself,
Titan is a kind of frozen museum piece of what an early, Earth-like
planet might look like.
</P>
<P>
The $3.2-billion Cassini mission is a cooperative venture between
NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The
largest and most ambitious interplanetary probe ever launched, the
6-ton spacecraft lifted off Oct. 15, 1997. The mission involved 260
scientists from 17 nations.
</P>
<P>
Cassini reached Saturn in July, the first part of a two-part
scientific exploration. Cassini first used its array of imaging
devices to take detailed pictures as it flew through the planet's
spectacular rings and swung past chilled and broken moons.
</P>
<P>
In late October, Cassini passed within 745 miles of the surface of
Titan. Though the spacecraft's cameras were able to penetrate the haze
in places, the images beamed back to earth only whetted scientists'
appetites for the second part of the mission, Huygens' dramatic
plunge.
</P>
<P>
``Have we seen some craters? Perhaps. Some kind of flow on the
surface? Perhaps. Vulcanism? Perhaps,'' said Jean-Pierre Lebreton, the
Huygens project manager for the European Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
Answering those questions is the job of Huygens, a 700-pound
collection of scientific instruments designed to sniff and measure the
atmosphere of Titan as it streaks to the surface. Although they are
intrigued by images Cassini took in October of what looks to be an
irregular land mass dubbed Xanadu, scientists said Friday that they
had no fixed idea where the probe would land. Titan's strong winds
could blow it hundreds of miles across the surface.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are hoping the probe survives its landing long enough to
send back information about the surface of the moon.
