CASSINI PROBE HEADED FOR SATURN MOON
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An instrumented space-faring emissary called Huygens will separate
Friday night from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn and begin a
three-week descent of nearly 2 million miles to the planet's weird
moon Titan to sample its atmosphere and its puzzling surface.
</P>
<P>
The risky mission, a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency
and the Italian Space Agency, will mark the space era's first attempt
to explore any planetary moon in the solar system since the six
historic Apollo landings on Earth's own satellite more than 30 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Giant Titan, 3,200 miles in diameter, is the only moon in the solar
system with an atmosphere all its own -- a dense one that has
intrigued earthbound astronomers for decades.
</P>
<P>
Mission engineers have programmed the adventure to begin precisely at
7:08 PST Friday night, when three tiny pyrotechnic explosives on
Cassini's exterior must sever three tiny bolts simultaneously and
release three tightly compressed springs in order to propel the
705-pound, wok-shaped Huygens probe away from its mother ship and
send it on its long free fall through empty space to the mystery
moon.
</P>
<P>
The springs are designed to give Huygens (pronounced HOY-ginz) "a
good spin" -- seven revolutions per minute -- and thrust it into the
void, first at less than 1 mph, but then quickly to a speed relative
to orbiting Cassini of about 13,500 mph, according to deputy mission
operations manager Earl Maize at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
"We tested and tested the system again and again long ago because
releasing those springs simultaneously is critically important, and
we're confident it's ready," Maize said. "We don't think there's any
chance that Huygens will miss Titan, and we've factored in everything
we know of the winds that might deflect the probe on its way through
Titan's atmosphere. It looks as though it will land within a few tens
of meters of its planned landing site."
</P>
<P>
If the engineers have aimed correctly, Huygens will first reach the
giant moon's dense nitrogen-methane atmosphere and then its surface
on Jan. 14 -- to radio back what its six instruments find there,
hopefully for as long as two hours.
</P>
<P>
Just what the probe will encounter -- a landing site marked by
hard-frozen ice, lakes of liquid tar, ancient craters drowned in
oozing chemical slush, or volcanoes spouting organic ices -- remains
unknown to astronomers waiting all over the world.
</P>
<P>
At least as intriguing as the nature of the moon's surface is the
precise composition of Titan's smoggy, 12-layered atmosphere, which
many believe may closely resemble the mix of gases that early Earth
possessed -- rich in the organic chemicals essential for life to
emerge and evolve.
</P>
<P>
With Cassini moving on its regular programmed orbit around Saturn
this week, engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory signaled the
spacecraft Tuesday to perform its eighth and final "orbit deflection
maneuver," altering its flight path slightly and putting it on a
direct collision course for Titan.
</P>
<P>
The mission controllers also started timers on Cassini to set the
precise moment at which the Huygens probe will be released from the
orbiter and sent on its own ballistic trajectory -- with no ability
to steer itself -- toward the planned landing site.
</P>
<P>
The location is marked by what Cassini's cameras have seen as
interlocking light and dark areas, which may be plateaus next to
mountain spires or low-lying solids or even liquids.
</P>
<P>
"It all looks good, and we've a green light to proceed," said
Jean-Pierre Lebreton, the Huygens probe's chief scientist and mission
manager in an interview during the recent San Francisco meeting of
the American Geophysical Union.
</P>
<P>
Despite the mission's unprecedented audacity and technical
complexity, the teams of scientists and engineers are confident that
Huygens will reach its target and perform its tasks of analyzing the
atmosphere and the surface at its landing site.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, Cassini will signal within seconds of its
programmed release sequence that the launch of Huygens has been
successful. But that message -- traveling at the speed of light --
will take one hour, seven minutes and 39 seconds to reach the eager
scientists and engineers at JPL and the European Space Agency's
control center in Darmstadt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Then, as the Huygens probe falls toward the top of Titan's
perceptible atmosphere, 789 miles above the surface, its two
transmitters, each with its own antenna, will signal its progress to
Cassini, and the orbiter will record the messages for later
transmission to Earth.
</P>
<P>
After Huygens has arrived at its target, mission engineers will alter
Cassini's course once again so it is no longer on its collision
course toward Titan and return it to its regular orbit around Saturn
and its schedule of 45 more sweeping observation flights past the
intriguing moon over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Cassini, with the Huygens probe riding piggy-back, was launched from
Cape Canaveral aboard a Titan 4-B rocket on Oct. 15, 1997. It flew
twice past Venus, once past Earth and once past Jupiter and traveled
a total of 2.2 billion miles before passing through Saturn's rings
and swinging into its first orbit around the planet on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The European Space Agency built and managed the development of
Huygens and directs the probe's operations. The Italian Space Agency
provided Cassini's high-gain antenna, much of its radio system and
crucial parts for several of Cassini's science instruments.
</P>
<P>
The probe was named after Christiaan Huygens, the 17th century Dutch
mathematician and physicist who discovered Titan in 1655 and examined
Saturn's rings in great detail.
</P>
<P>
The planned cost of the entire joint mission is $3.2 billion. That
includes the roughly $500 million cost of the Huygens probe, which is
being borne by many of the European Space Agency's members.
