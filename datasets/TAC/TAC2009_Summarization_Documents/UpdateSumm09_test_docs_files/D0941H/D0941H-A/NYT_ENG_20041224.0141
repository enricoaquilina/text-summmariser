ON COLLISION COURSE WITH TITAN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a seven-year journey, a saucer-shaped probe prepared Friday
night to detach itself from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn to
dive toward one of the most mysterious bodies in the solar system:
the giant moon Titan.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the Huygens probe will be the first spacecraft to
visit Titan, whose dense atmosphere and apparent soup of organic
chemicals have led scientists to compare it to conditions on a young
Earth, just before life began.
</P>
<P>
Though astronomers have spent decades examining Titan from Earth and
space, even basic facts about the moon remain unknown. It is the only
moon in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere, but
scientists can only guess what kind of surface will greet Huygens --
a sea of liquid methane, ice, or a strange hydrocarbon.
</P>
<P>
"It is bizarre, with so much scrutiny for so much time, Titan is
almost (more) mysterious now than when we started this project," said
John Zarnecki, a lead investigator for the Huygens mission of The
Open University in England. "The whole thing is pretty crazy."
</P>
<P>
Huygens's suicide plunge is the most dramatic moment planned for the
four years the spacecraft Cassini will spend circling the planet and
its 31 known moons. Cassini, which arrived in Saturn's orbit earlier
this year, has already discovered several moons and has sent back
some of the most detailed pictures of Saturn's elaborate rings.
</P>
<P>
After it detaches from Cassini, the 9-foot Huygens probe will fall
toward Titan and, if all goes as planned, enter the moon's opaque
atmosphere Jan. 14. The sturdy probe will have to endure temperatures
of about 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit from atmospheric friction during
its entry. Three parachutes will deploy, allowing the probe, which is
designed primarily to study the atmosphere, to spend 2 1/2 hours
measuring temperature, wind speed, pressure, and atmospheric
composition, all while snapping more than 1,100 pictures. Its time in
the spotlight will be short-lived, however -- when and if it lands,
Huygens will have at most only two more hours on the surface before
Cassini moves out of contact and Huygens loses touch with Earth.
</P>
<P>
These are tense times for NASA and the 16 European nations involved
in the $3.27 billion Cassini-Huygens project, named for two
17th-century astronomers. Some scientists, such as Zarnecki, have
been working on the project for more than 15 years -- and are
unlikely to have another chance for a direct visit to such a distant
body.
</P>
<P>
The mission follows a tumultuous two years at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, during which occurred the
Columbia shuttle tragedy, a successful robotic landing on Mars, and,
more recently, a largely failed attempt to bring back solar particles
from space.
</P>
<P>
The elaborate and expensive Cassini-Huygens project, launched in
1997, is a dramatic departure from NASA's recent mantra of "faster,
better, cheaper," and, if successful, will probably serve as a model
for more ambitious exploration projects.
</P>
<P>
Cassini's findings from Saturn itself may help scientists better
understand the origin of the solar system, but it is on Titan where
they hope to find more specific clues to the origin of life. Previous
observations have suggested that the moon has a hazy atmosphere of
organic matter and a possibly rich top layer filled with carbon-based
compounds of the kind that were on Earth at the time when life is
thought to have arisen. Earth's biological and geological processes
have erased the evidence from those early years, so scientists' best
hope is to analyze similar conditions on another planetary body, such
as Titan. The moon's frigid temperatures -- estimated to be around
minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit -- make Titan an inhospitable
environment for life, but may have helped preserve concentrations of
organic matter similar to those on Earth before life began.
</P>
<P>
One of the great mysteries of the Huygens visit will be what kind of
landscape greets the probe. Some scientists have speculated that
organic material in Titan's atmosphere drifts to the surface and then
returns to the air, much as oceans send water vapor into the Earth's
atmosphere. Zarnecki, who designed the probe's surface scientific
instruments, says he hopes to find a deep sea of liquid methane and
ethane.
</P>
<P>
"It could be the first time we've done oceanography somewhere else,"
said Zarnecki.
</P>
<P>
If there is wind, some astronomers say, Titan's relatively weak
gravity could mean waves could reach hundreds of feet high, slowly
moving across its surface. Scientists have not seen any meteorite
craters on the surface but suspect they could exist, buried under a
lake or a gooey mixture of organic matter.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know yet," said Jonathan Lunine of the University of
Arizona, a planetary scientist working on the mission. Recent
pictures of Titan taken by the Cassini orbiter seem to suggest
Huygens may land on a solid surface, but scientists say they will not
know until they get there. In addition to climate history, Lunine
says he wants to study "simple nonbiological chemistry" there in
hopes of understanding how nonliving compounds could make the
transition to life.
</P>
<P>
Zarnecki and other scientists have equipped the 700-pound stationary
probe well: Huygens can measure its tilt to figure out if it lands on
solid or liquid. The probe could probably float on a methane lake and
has sonar that may be able to measure depth if it lands on liquid, or
even the distance to nearby rocks to measure the terrain if it lands
on solid ground.
</P>
<P>
Whatever it does will have to happen quickly: If Huygens lands
successfully, probably somewhere near Titan's equator, it will have
no more than two hours to study the moon's surface before its only
link to Earth -- Cassini -- disappears over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
By the time the orbiter comes around again weeks later, Huygens's
batteries will be frozen solid. Beth Daley can be reached by e-mail
