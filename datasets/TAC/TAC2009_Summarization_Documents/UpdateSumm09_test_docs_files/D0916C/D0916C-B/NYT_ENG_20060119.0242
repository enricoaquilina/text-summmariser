JILL CARROLL'S BRAVERY BOSTON GLOBE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
JILL CARROLL'S BRAVERY TO A WORLD increasingly suffused with media, the
kidnapping of Jill Carroll in Baghdad is a reminder of
the dangers that journalists face in the most dangerous war
zone on earth and of the importance of foreign correspondents
in explaining distant places to Americans. Iraqi gangs, which seize
foreigners because they are easy targets, harm their country by
restricting the flow of information to the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
By all accounts Carroll, a freelance writer on assignment for The
Christian Science Monitor, has felt a deep sympathy for Iraqis.
She was learning Arabic, liked the food, and moved about
with minimal protection. She was visiting a dangerous neighborhood in
Baghdad on Jan. 7 to interview an Iraqi politician when
her translator was killed and she was kidnapped. Somebody with
her sensibilities, willing to take risks, is just the kind
of reporter that is needed to explain the turbulence in
Iraq to Americans.

It is no surprise that the abduction has been denounced by
many Iraqis. Even some among the Sunni community, where opposition
to the US invasion is highest, have come out against
the kidnapping. "We condemn the abduction of journalists, who are
means to conveying the truth to people," Muthana Harith al-Dhari,
a spokesman for the Association of Muslim Scholars, said. Accurate
information about Iraq is of vital importance to Americans as
they consider how long US troops should stay there. The
Iraqi perspective is best obtained from reporters with a toe
in both cultures.
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the US invasion in 2003, 60 journalists have been
killed in Iraq, making it by far the most dangerous
place on earth to be a reporter. One of them
was Elizabeth Neuffer, foreign correspondent for the Globe, who died
in an auto accident in the early stages of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The danger has worsened as journalists have become targets by design
instead of happenstance. The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that
most of the dead are Iraqi, doing their best to
find the news in a society riven with violence. The
latest casualties reported on the committee website were Mohammed Haroon,
a journalist once affiliated with the Saddam Hussein regime, and
Firas Maadidi and Hind Ismail, reporters for a prodemocracy newspaper.
These journalists, had they lived, would have provided information and
shaped opinions that could have promoted peaceful change in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The men who abducted Carroll apparently have a different purpose -
to sow fear among news people. Doing journalism in Iraq
is a tough, exhausting, and dangerous craft. Not to do
it, however, would leave communication about the struggle of its
people to the gunmen and suicide bombers.
