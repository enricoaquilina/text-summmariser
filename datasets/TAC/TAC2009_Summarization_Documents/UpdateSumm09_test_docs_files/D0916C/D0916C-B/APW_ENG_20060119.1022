Muslim leaders and her pleading mother appealed Thursday for the release of
kidnapped American journalist Jill Carroll as Iraqi officials said six detained
Iraqi women were due for release by the U.S. military, a condition set by the
hostage-takers who are threatening to kill their captive.
</P>
<P>
But the White House said no prisoner release appeared imminent and a major Sunni
Arab clerical group said it could do little to help win Carroll's freedom
because it did not know who was holding her.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers of 28-year-old Carroll, identified as the previously unknown
"Revenge Brigade," have given until Friday evening for all Iraqi female
detainees to be freed or they would execute her. However, Iraqi kidnap groups
often set such deadlines only to ignore them and continue holding
captives.
</P>
<P>
New images showing Carroll surrounded by three armed and masked gunmen were
aired Thursday by the Arab TV station Al-Jazeera. The 20 seconds of silent
footage were from a tape of which excerpts were broadcast Tuesday with the
72-hour deadline.
</P>
<P>
Carroll's mother said the video images gave her hope that her daughter is alive
but also have "shaken us about her fate."
</P>
<P>
"I, her father and her sister are appealing directly to her captors to release
this young woman who has worked so hard to show the sufferings of Iraqis to the
world," Mary Beth Carroll told CNN's "American Morning."
</P>
<P>
Iraq's deputy justice minister, Busho Ibrahim Ali, said six of the eight Iraqi
women in custody are expected to be released next week, but he stressed that any
release would "not be part of any swap with any kidnappers."
</P>
<P>
"I insisted that the Americans should bring (the women's) files and release them
and they will be freed next week along with other detainees," Ali told
Associated Press Television News. He did not elaborate on who the other
detainees were, but said the recommendation to free the women was made
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speculation that the Iraqi women may soon be freed raised hopes for the release
of Carroll, a freelance journalist who was working for the Christian Science
Monitor when she was seized Jan. 7 in western Baghdad. Her translator was
killed.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military officials repeatedly refused Thursday to confirm whether any
release was imminent. In Washington, White House press secretary Scott McClellan
said the Bush administration was working hard to secure Carroll's freedom but
said no Iraqi detainees were expected to be released soon, citing information
from the U.S. Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
"Any time you have an American held hostage, wherever they are, they are a
priority for the administration," McClellan said Thursday. "And we want to see
her safe return. As I indicated yesterday, too, I don't think it's really
helpful to go beyond that at this point."
</P>
<P>
Carroll grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and received an journalism undergraduate
degree in 1999 from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. She worked as a
reporting assistant for The Wall Street Journal before moving to Jordan and
launching her freelance career in 2002, learning Arabic on the
way.
</P>
<P>
Her newspaper's Washington bureau chief, David Cook, also urged the captors to
contact them to discuss her release. Cook would not say specifically if the
newspaper would pay ransom.
</P>
<P>
"I think our policy would be that we would welcome contact from the captors,"
Cook told NBC. "Either the family or the Monitor would be eager to talk to the
captors."
</P>
<P>
Calls for Carroll's freedom were also made by Muslim leaders in Iraq plus a team
of U.S.-based Islamic advocates traveling to the Middle East to seek her
release.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations flew to the Jordanian
capital, Amman, on Thursday and was planning to hold a news conference Friday in
Baghdad. The group said it hopes to reach Arab television audiences and persuade
Carroll's captors to release her.
</P>
<P>
The Bloomfield Hills-based Islamic Shura Council of Michigan, which represents
about 20 Muslim groups in the state, told the Detroit Free Press that Carroll's
kidnapping would not help the Iraqi cause.
</P>
<P>
In Iraq, leaders of three prominent Sunni Muslim groups demanded Carroll's
release. Iraq's insurgency draws the bulk of its support from Iraq's once
dominant Sunni Arab community, which fell from grace once its Sunni benefactor,
Saddam, was toppled.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn the abduction of journalists who are a means to convey the truth to
the people," said Muthana Harith al-Dhari, spokesman for the Association of
Muslim Scholars, which is believed to have ties to some Sunni insurgent
groups.
</P>
<P>
However, al-Dhari, who is considered a hard-liner in the association, said there
was little that his group could do because it did not know who was holding her.
French journalist and former hostage Florence Aubenas, who was released in June
after being held hostage in Iraq for 157 days, also called on Carroll's
hostage-takers to release her.
</P>
<P>
"She came to this country to do her job as a journalist and not anything else,"
Aubenas told Al-Jazeera.
</P>
<P>
Carroll's mother said her daughter even discussed with her family the
possibility of being kidnapped in Iraq, a country where more than 240 foreigners
have been kidnapped and at least 39 killed since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that
toppled Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
"Those things have been said. And she knows that we love her and support her,"
Mary Beth Carroll said on CNN. "She knows that we can be strong for
her."
