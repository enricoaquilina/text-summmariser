Six Iraqi women detainees are to 
be freed soon following a review of their case, a justice ministry 
official said Wednesday, as the captors of a US woman journalist 
demanded all female prisoners be freed.
</P>
<P>
"The decision has been taken and these detainees will be 
released in the coming days," according to the official who declined 
to be named.
</P>
<P>
US forces had earlier said they were holding a total of eight 
Iraqi women detainees because they presented "an imperative threat 
to the security of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"All detainees have their cases reviewed on a regular basis to 
determine whether conditions still warrant their internment as 
security threats," the military added.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Al-Jazeera television showed a videotape of Jill 
Carroll taken by her kidnappers, who issued an execution ultimatum 
saying the US reporter would be executed within 72 hours if Iraqi 
women detainees were not set free.
</P>
<P>
The justice minister had asked in the past for the commission 
reviewing the cases of detainees to speed up its work on the women, 
the ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
"We asked that they either be charged or freed, and no proof has 
been found to implicate them in acts of violence," the official 
said.
</P>
<P>
The commission is comprised of representatives of the justice, 
interior and human rights ministries, and members of the US-led 
military coalition.
</P>
<P>
Carroll, 28, who works for the Boston-based Christian Science 
Monitor newspaper, was seized on a Baghdad street on January 7 by 
gunmen who shot dead her interpretor.
</P>
<P>
More than 12,000 Iraqis are currently detained by coalition 
forces.
