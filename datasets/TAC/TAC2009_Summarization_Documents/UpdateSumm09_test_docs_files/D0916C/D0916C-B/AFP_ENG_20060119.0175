Iraq's main Sunni Arab party 
called Thursday for the release of US journalist Jill Carroll after 
her captors had threatened to kill her if Iraqi women prisoners are 
not freed.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the kidnappers to release the reporter as quickly as 
possible," the Islamic Party said in a statement which also 
condemned "the abduction of innocent people".
</P>
<P>
Carroll, a 28-year-old reporter working for the Boston-based 
Christian Science Monitor, was snatched from a Baghdad street on 
January 7 by gunmen who shot dead her interpreter.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Qatar-based Arabic television station Al-Jazeera 
showed a videotape of Carroll taken by her kidnappers, who issued an 
ultimatum saying they would execute their hostage unless the United 
States freed all Iraqi female detainees within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's justice ministry said Wednesday that six of eight women 
detainees held by US forces would be released within days, but it 
denied there was any link with the kidnappers' demands.
