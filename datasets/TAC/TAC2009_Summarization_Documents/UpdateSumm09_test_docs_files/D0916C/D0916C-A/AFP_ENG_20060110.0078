 Sunni Arab Muslims protested 
Tuesday a raid by US forces on a Baghdad mosque reportedly linked to 
the kidnapping of a US reporter.
</P>
<P>
About 700 people rallied in the gardens of the Umm al-Qura 
mosque in the west of the capital to denounce the raid carried out 
Saturday night by US and Iraqi forces.
</P>
<P>
"This raid was conducted as a direct result of a tip by an Iraqi 
civilian that activities related to the kidnapping were being 
carried out inside the mosque," said Lieutenant-Colonel Barry 
Johnson, speaking of the abduction Saturday of Christian Science 
Monitor reporter Jill Carroll.
</P>
<P>
Her interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was shot dead and his body 
abandoned nearby by the kidnappers, while her driver got away.
</P>
<P>
"Both Iraqi and coalition Forces raided the mosque in the early 
morning hours in order to minimize the impact on worshippers and the 
surrounding neighborhood," the military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Six people were detained for questioning, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Sunni Committee of Muslim Scholars, which is based at the 
mosque, confirmed that one of its members, Yunis Aikali, and five 
mosque guards were arrested in the raid.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the committee also accused US soldiers of 
desecrating the mosque and carrying away files containing the names 
of members.
</P>
<P>
"The attack on the Umm al-Qura mosque is an attack on Muslims 
and Islam," said banners held up by protesters at Tuesday's rally 
which followed morning prayers.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the occupiers to withdraw from Iraq because they are 
the reason for every crime and the death of every innocent in Iraq," 
Harith al-Aubaidi, a member of the scholars' committee, said in his 
sermon at the prayer meeting.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no stability as long as Iraq is occupied," he 
added.
</P>
<P>
The UN special representative in Iraq, Ashraf Qazi, also 
deplored the raid.
</P>
<P>
"This again underlines the importance of all parties respecting 
the sanctity of holy sites and places of worship," he said in a 
statement.
</P>
<P>
Carroll, 28, a freelance reporter working for the Christian 
Science Monitor, was seized by gunmen on Saturday after calling by 
the office of a prominent Sunni politician in the neighbourhood.
</P>
<P>
"We are urgently seeking information about Ms Carroll and are 
pursuing every avenue to secure her release," said Monitor editor 
Richard Bergenheim.
</P>
<P>
Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's 
website, said gunmen jumped in front of the car, pulled him from it, 
and drove off with their two captives all within 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by 
insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two 
Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.
</P>
<P>
Carroll was the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq 
since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group 
Reporters without Borders.
