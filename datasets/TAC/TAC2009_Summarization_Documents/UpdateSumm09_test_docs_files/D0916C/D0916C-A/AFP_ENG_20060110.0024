<P>
 Iraqi and US investigators were 
hunting Tuesday for a US journalist kidnapped in Baghdad as a French 
hostage who escaped after five weeks of captivity in Iraq arrived 
back in France.
</P>
<P>
Jill Carroll, 28, a freelance reporter working for the Christian 
Science Monitor, was seized by gunmen on Saturday after calling by 
the office of a prominent Sunni politician, the US newspaper 
confirmed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Her interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was shot dead and his body 
abandoned nearby by the kidnappers, while her driver got away.
</P>
<P>
The incident was reported by AFP on Saturday, but the agency, in 
common with other foreign and US news outlets, did not identify 
Carroll in line with a Monitor request as efforts were launched to 
find her.
</P>
<P>
"We are urgently seeking information about Ms Carroll and are 
pursuing every avenue to secure her release," said Monitor editor 
Richard Bergenheim.
</P>
<P>
Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's 
website, said gunmen jumped in front of the car, pulled him from it, 
and drove off with their two captives all within 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by 
insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two 
Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.
</P>
<P>
Carroll was the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq 
since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group 
Reporters without Borders.
</P>
<P>
Five of the kidnap victims -- four Iraqis and Enzo Baldoni of 
Italy -- were killed by their abductors. The others were released.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Bernard Planche, a 52-year-old engineer, managed to 
evade his captors on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He landed at late Monday at a military base in France where he 
was met by his daugher and niece, along with Foreign Minister 
Philippe Douste-Blazy.
</P>
<P>
Blanche, who escaped from a farmhouse west of the capital, said 
he was "delighted to return to civilisation and to French soil."
</P>
<P>
The hostage developments followed a twin suicide bombing against 
the Iraqi interior ministry that killed at least 28 policemen.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi branch of Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the 
attack in an Internet message, saying it was to avenge the "torture" 
of Sunni Muslims in interior ministry facilities.
</P>
<P>
Abuse scandals came to the fore in November and December when US 
and Iraqi forces discovered two overcrowded interior ministry 
detention centres. Some inmates had reportedly been tortured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Washington, the White House Monday denied that the 
US government has been negotiating with insurgents and Saddam 
Hussein loyalists in Iraq, but acknowledged that it was reaching out 
to those who until now have rejected the political process.
</P>
<P>
"Part of our strategy, a critical element of our strategy, is to 
broaden participation in the political process," White House 
spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters. "We have been reaching out 
to the rejectionists."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was reacting to a New York Times report Saturday 
that said the United States has stepped up contact with some Iraqi 
insurgent groups in a bid to exploit tensions between home-grown 
rebels and foreign militant groups such as Al-Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
Washington wants to encourage the Sunni Arab minority to join in 
a government of national unity in a bid to undermine Sunni support 
for insurgents and allow for the start of withdrawal of US-led 
coalition forces.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the human cost of the war, with 2,209 US 
servicemen killed and over 16,000 wounded, the Iraq war will likely 
cost the United States anywhere between one and two trillion 
dollars, according to a new study co-authored by a Nobel Prize 
winning economist.
</P>
<P>
The research made public Monday by Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia 
University, a 2001 Nobel Prize laureate and former chief economist 
at the World Bank, and economy professor Linda Bilmes of Harvard 
University, argued that current official assessments of the war cost 
fail to consider key expenses likely to dog the US budget for years 
to come.
