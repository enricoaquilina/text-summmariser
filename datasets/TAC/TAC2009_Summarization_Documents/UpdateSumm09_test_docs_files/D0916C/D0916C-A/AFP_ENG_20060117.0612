 Arabic television Al-Jazeera said 
Tuesday the kidnappers of a US woman journalist abducted in Baghdad 
had threatened to kill her if female prisoners in Iraq were not 
freed within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
The station broadcast a brief videotape of the journalist Jill 
Carroll, 28, a freelance reporter working for the Christian Science 
Monitor who was seized by gunmen in Baghdad on January 7.
</P>
<P>
Carroll, wearing a grey sweatshirt with her long brown hair 
loose, was shown alone in the video and speaking but there was no 
sound. It was the first time she has been since since her 
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
The Qatar-based station said the kidnappers identified 
themselves as members of a previously unknown armed group calling 
itself the "Brigades of Vengeance".
</P>
<P>
"Al-Jazeera reiterates its rejection and condemnation of all 
forms of violence targeting journalists, and demands the release of 
the US journalist Jill Carroll," the station said.
</P>
<P>
Carroll's interpreter, Allan Enwiyah, 32, was shot dead and his 
body abandoned nearby by the kidnappers during the abduction, while 
her driver got away.
</P>
<P>
US forces have been hunting for the woman, and one day last week 
raided a mosque in the west of the capital after a tip that 
"activities related to the kidnapping were being carried out 
inside," triggering angry protests from Sunni Muslim clerics.
</P>
<P>
"We are urgently seeking information about Ms Carroll and are 
pursuing every avenue to secure her release," Monitor editor Richard 
Bergenheim said last week.
</P>
<P>
Carroll's driver, quoted in a story posted on the Monitor's 
website, said gunmen jumped in front of the car, pulled him from it, 
and drove off with their two captives all within 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Several Westerners are currently being held hostage by 
insurgents in Iraq, including an American, a Briton and two 
Canadians who are members of a Christian peace group.
</P>
<P>
Carroll was the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq 
since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group 
Reporters without Borders.
</P>
<P>
Five of the kidnap victims -- four Iraqis and Enzo Baldoni of 
Italy -- were killed by their abductors. The others were released.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Bernard Planche, a 52-year-old engineer, managed to 
evade his captors on the very day Carroll was abducted.
