An Arab television network ran a video showing
kidnapped journalist Jill Carroll Tuesday with an accompanying message
from her unnamed captors that she would be killed unless the United
States freed all female prisoners in Iraq within 72 hours.

The group holding Carroll captive was not identified in the tape
that was broadcast over Al-Jazeera. Although the 28-year-old Christian
Science Monitor reporter appeared to be talking on the tape, her words
were not audible. Carroll was kidnapped Jan. 7 while on assignment and
her captors had made no public comment or demand until the tape was
shown Tuesday. Her translator was shot dead but her driver was set
free.

Her family issued a statement Tuesday afternoon pleading for ``the
speedy and safe return of our beloved daughter and sister.''
</P>
<P>
``Jill is an innocent journalist and we respectfully ask that you
please show her mercy and allow her to return home to her mother,
sister and family,'' read the letter signed by her parents Jim and
Mary Beth Carroll and her sister Katie. ``Jill is a friend and sister
to many Iraqis and has been dedicated to bringing the truth of the
Iraq war to the world.''

<P>
News organizations withheld details of her abduction for several
days to allow time for her newspaper and family to seek her release.
David Cook, her newspaper's Washington bureau chief and spokesman,
said that the paper has had no contact with the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
In the 20-second tape, Carroll was shown against a white background
and appeared reasonably healthy, although tired. An Al-Jazeera news
reader said that the network has appealed for Carroll's release. U.S.
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the Bush administration
was continuing ``to make every effort'' to free Carroll.
