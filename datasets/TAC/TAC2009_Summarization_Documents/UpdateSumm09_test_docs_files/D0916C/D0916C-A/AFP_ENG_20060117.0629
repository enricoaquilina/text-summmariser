 The family of Jill 
Carroll, a US woman journalist abducted in Iraq, issued an emotional 
appeal Monday for her release after her captors threatened her with 
execution.
</P>
<P>
"Jill is an innocent journalist and we respectfully ask that you 
please show her mercy and allow her to return home to her mother, 
sister and family," Carroll's family said in a statement.

Earlier, the Qatar-based Arabic television station Al-Jazeera 
showed a videotape of Carroll taken by her kidnappers, who said they 
would kill her if female prisoners in Iraq were not freed within 72 
hours.

<P>
Carroll, 28, a freelance reporter working for the Christian 
Science Monitor, was seized by gunmen in Baghdad on January 7. Her 
interpreter was shot dead during the abduction, while her driver got 
away.

<P>
"Jill is a kind person whose love for Iraq and the Iraqi people 
are evident in her articles," the family statement said.
</P>
<P>
"She has been welcomed into the homes of many Iraqis and shown 
every courtesy. From that experience, she understands the hardships 
and suffering that the Iraqi people face every day," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Jill is a friend and sister to many Iraqis and has been 
dedicated to bringing the truth of the Iraq war to the world."
</P>
<P>
Carroll was the 31st media worker to have been kidnapped in Iraq 
since the start of the war in 2003, according to watchdog group 
Reporters without Borders.
