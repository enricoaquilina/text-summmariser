The family of an electrical contractor believed killed by a militant group in
Iraq is convinced he is dead, and is preparing a memorial service.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Army of Iraq claimed that it killed Ronald Schulz last month, and a
video on a Web site, purportedly posted by the group, showed a blindfolded man
being shot in the back of the head. His face was not shown and it was impossible
to verify his identity. The video also showed Schulz's identity
card.
</P>
<P>
While U.S. officials have not confirmed Shulz's death, his sister, Julie Schulz,
said Tuesday night that the family identified him from two videos reportedly
posted by the group.
</P>
<P>
"Although his face was not visible, there are enough consistencies between the
two videos and enough evidence that my family, in our hearts, believe that Ron
is dead," Schulz said. "We had hoped his body would be found so that we could
bring him home. But this has not happened."
</P>
<P>
The family is planning a memorial service on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
Shulz, 40, was working as an electrical contractor when he was
kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
Insurgents have kidnapped more than 250 foreigners in the past two years, aiming
to force U.S.-led troops to leave Iraq or prevent Arab nations from
strengthening their ties with the Baghdad government.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Jill Carroll, an American freelance reporter, was kidnapped in
Baghdad shortly after she was leading office of a leading Sunni
politician.
</P>
<P>
No claim of responsibility has so far been issued in Carroll's
case.
