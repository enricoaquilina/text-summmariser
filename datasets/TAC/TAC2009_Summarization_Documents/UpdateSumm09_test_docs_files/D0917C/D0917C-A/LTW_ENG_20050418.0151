Speculation Swirls Around Opus Dei's Role in New Papacy

<P>
When Pope John Paul II arrived at Opus Dei headquarters one
March day 11 years ago, even members of the conservative lay religious
movement long accustomed to Vatican favor saw the visit as a singular
moment in the group's ascendancy within the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
The pope had come to pay his respects to Bishop Alvaro del
Portillo, the prelate of Opus Dei, who had died that day.
</P>
<P>
``He came over to pray before the body of Don Alvaro, which is a
very unusual thing to have a pope come over to your house to pray,''
said the Rev. John Wauck, a professor at the Pontifical University of
the Holy Cross, an Opus Dei institution in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Now with its papal benefactor gone, Opus Dei's influence under the
next pope -- and its role in choosing the new pontiff -- have become
hot topics in a city awash in speculation as the world's cardinals
meet behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel to elect John
Paul's successor.
</P>
<P>
Opus Dei, or ``Work of God,'' was founded in Spain in 1928. It is
based on the idea that Catholics, male and female, can live a
sanctified life without being priests or nuns. Many of its 85,000
worldwide members work in legal, medical, financial and media
professions and profess unquestioned fidelity to the church's
teachings and loyalty to the pope. But critics have called the group
elitist, and it is depicted as a villainous secret society in Dan
Brown's best-selling novel, ``The Da Vinci Code.''
</P>
<P>
Officially, Opus Dei has stressed that it is above the fray. Its
prelate, Bishop Javier Echevarria, has called for prayer, not
politicking. He has pledged the group's loyalty to whomever the
cardinals elect.
</P>
<P>
``We already love with our whole soul the successor of John Paul
II, whoever he may be,'' Echevarria wrote to the organization's
members. ``Let us renew our desire to serve the pope, for it was only
to serve the church that God wanted Opus Dei.''
</P>
<P>
Others note that, for the first time, two of the 115 voting
cardinals -- Julian Herranz of Spain and Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne of
Lima, Peru, -- are members of Opus Dei, giving the group the ability
to work inside the conclave.
</P>
<P>
``They have a chance to lobby the other cardinals from an inside
position,'' said an official with a lay organization with close ties
to the Vatican. ``Opus Dei has international connections, they know
many cardinals, are appreciated by some. They are entitled to talk to
cardinals, to invite them to dinner, all with authority.''
</P>
<P>
Several European cardinals are known to be sympathetic to Opus Dei,
among them Cardinal Camillo Ruini, the Italian prelate who runs the
Diocese of Rome on behalf of the pope, and a contender to succeed John
Paul. It was Ruini who last year opened proceedings to declare Opus
Dei's del Portillo a saint.
</P>
<P>
But recently, several Italian newspapers breathlessly reported that
the two Opus Dei cardinals were throwing their support behind the
candidacy of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, a German-born traditionalist
who has served as chief enforcer of church doctrine for two decades.
</P>
<P>
Opus Dei flourished during John Paul's pontificate. In 1982, he
took the unprecedented step of making Opus Dei a personal prelature of
the church, answerable not to local bishops in the dioceses where it
operated, but to the pope alone through the Sacred Congregation of
Bishops at the Holy See.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of the group's influence, the pope placed Opus
Dei's founder, the Spanish priest Josemaria Escriva de Balaguer on the
fast track to sainthood in 1992, leapfrogging over Pope John XXIII. In
2002, Escriva was canonized before a crowd of 300,000 in St. Peter's
Square, becoming Saint Josemaria a mere 27 years after he died.
</P>
<P>
The Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit and associate editor of his
religious order's magazine, America, said it was undeniable that Opus
Dei had a stake in the election of the new pope.
</P>
<P>
``They would not have grown so quickly and have gained the
influence they have were it not for John Paul,'' he said. ``Given that
they're ... responsible only to the pope, that is a sword that cuts
both ways. If you have a pope who is favorable to you, that's
terrific. If you have a pope who does not see things the way Opus Dei
does, that's more problematic.''
</P>
<P>
Opus Dei officials have greeted the speculation about its role in
choosing a new pope with a mixture of political realism and amusement.
</P>
<P>
``Opus Dei has no candidate,'' Wauck said. He said he thought the
interest was due in no small part to ``The Da Vinci Code,'' whose
depiction of Opus Dei is disputed by the group as inaccurate and
misleading.
</P>
<P>
In an interview before the pope's death, Herranz, one of the Opus
Dei cardinals, was asked whether an Opus Dei member could become pope,
given that its reputation is negative in some quarters. Herranz said
the organization had been subjected to negative publicity, but that
such attacks were attacks on Christianity as a whole, not just Opus
Dei.
</P>
<P>
``Opus Dei has become a victim of Christian-phobia,'' Herranz said.
But, he said, ``more people today love Opus Dei than don't. And we
have a saint now, our founder Escriva, so more people understand the
good works and spiritual doctrine of Opus Dei.''
</P>
<P>
Critics of Opus Dei have said the church's decision to make Escriva
a saint was disturbing in view of his friendship with Spain's late
fascist dictator, Francisco Franco. Opus Dei spokesman Brian Finnerty
said that, during those decades, Opus Dei included both backers and
opponents of Franco.
</P>
<P>
Escriva hewed to the theologically conservative stances shared by
John Paul, including strict adherence to the church's teaching on
sexual and moral issues. He also spoke out against ``godless''
communism.
</P>
<P>
As for the future, Opus Dei officials say they are not worried.
Their status in the church as a personal prelature is cast in canon
law and is not subject to a particular pope's goodwill. To alter Opus
Dei's status, a new pope would have to change the canon law, and not
even liberals in the church expect that to happen.
</P>
<P>
``From the pope's vantage point, what's not to like?'' Martin, the
Jesuit priest, asked. ``First, you have all these dedicated lay
Catholics. Secondly, you have Opus Dei's affluent members donating
money to the Vatican. And you have Opus Dei members adhering to the
magisterium (official church teachings) as strictly as possible.''
