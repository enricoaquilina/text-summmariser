Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church convene in the
Sistine Chapel this afternoon for a session that could produce
the first ballot for a successor to Pope John Paul
II, although such swift resolution seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
The last conclave in 1978 took eight ballots over three days
to choose John Paul. And the cardinals have much to
ponder after the third-longest papacy in history.
</P>
<P>
This conclave feels the full weight of the church's modern challenges,
including the influence of Islam, competition from evangelical Christians, the
fallout from priest sex scandals, the roles of women and
the need to reconcile Vatican teachings that ban condom use
with worries about AIDS. The cardinals also must seek a
global pastor with enough charisma to flourish in an image-driven
age.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, credible papal contenders come from at least
three distinct regions: Europe, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
On a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon, the red-robed princes of the
church made their way into the Vatican compound where they
will stay until they elect a new pope. Some drove
themselves; others were chauffeured.
</P>
<P>
A Mass at 10 a.m. today will be their last official
public appearance until they have a new leader.
</P>
<P>
The cardinals drew lots last week for rooms in the $20
million "Domus Sanctae Marthae" (St. Martha's House), a hotel built
by John Paul II and operated by the Daughters of
Charity of St. Vincent DePaul. From there, they will go
to the Sistine Chapel twice daily -- unless the first
ballot provides a two-thirds majority for a candidate.
</P>
<P>
For the first time ever, cardinals will be allowed to move
about Vatican City freely once the voting starts, though they
are forbidden to talk to anyone who hasn't been sworn
to secrecy. The penalty is severe -- excommunication.
</P>
<P>
According to rules put in place by John Paul II in
1996, the 115 cardinals eligible to vote may have one
ballot on the first day of the conclave, as the
sequestered gatherings are known.
</P>
<P>
Cardinals traditionally have used their first vote to honor mentors and
admired leaders, according to John Allen, author of "Conclave," a
book about the process of electing a pope.
</P>
<P>
The elaborately detailed rules for election of a supreme pontiff for
the 1.1- billion member church are based on rituals going
back centuries.
</P>
<P>
"Behind every single word in the constitution for election of a
pope, you'll find historical reasons we do it that way,"
said Charles Burns, retired Vatican archivist.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Vatican officials allowed a pool of reporters to enter
the Sistine Chapel, now set up for the election.
</P>
<P>
Cardinals will sit in plain wooden chairs at six long tables
in a room decorated with some of the world's most
famous artwork including Michelangelo's ceiling. The "scrutineers," three randomly selected
cardinals who will count the votes, face Michelangelo's monumental "Last
Judgment."
</P>
<P>
For the next few days, the world's attention will be focused
on the chapel roof, watching for the white smoke that
indicates a successful election. This year, bells also will ring
when a pope is elected.
</P>
<P>
Black smoke from burning ballots with wet straw will appear once
each morning and afternoon if no one is selected.
</P>
<P>
If no cardinal wins a two-thirds majority, 77 votes, after the
third day, the cardinals will pause for a day for
prayer and discussion, as John Paul ordered. Voting resumes for
seven ballots, followed by another pause; then seven more and
another pause; then seven more. If there is still no
pope, John Paul said, the cardinals may resort to a
simple majority, or 58. Such a turn would come around
May 1.
</P>
<P>
If the conclaves of the last century are any guide, a
pope should be elected by the end of the week.
The longest conclave took 14 ballots, lasted five days and
produced Pope Pius XI in 1922.
</P>
<P>
The shortest -- a day -- elected Pius XII in 1939
(three ballots) and John Paul I in 1978 (three or
four ballots).
</P>
<P>
The idea of a conclave, which literally means "with key," was
started by church people as a means of inconveniencing the
cardinals to make them speed up the process. Today it
also provides a means of preserving secrecy in an age
of new technology.
</P>
<P>
John Paul II's 1996 rules require that two "trustworthy technicians" make
sure that no audiovisual equipment is installed.
</P>
<P>
Cardinals are prohibited from written correspondence or telephone conversations with anyone
besides one another and workers who have taken an oath
of secrecy. They also are forbidden from watching television, listening
to radio or reading newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
The cardinals have been under a self-imposed ban on interviews with
the news media, but Italian newspapers have regularly reported how
possible papal candidates are faring, what factions are forming and
even, from the Turin newspaper "La Stampa," what the cardinals
were packing in their suitcases. (Some packed CDs and earphones,
others put in snacks, according to the report.)
</P>
<P>
Speculation continues to focus on German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger who, as
dean of the college of cardinals, will lead today's Mass.
But at least a dozen other names are regularly mentioned.
</P>
<P>
Ratzinger, a respected theologian known as a polarizing church figure while
head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the
Faith, is 78.
</P>
<P>
Cardinals could select him as a "caretaker pope" who would presumably
serve a shorter reign than the 26 years John Paul
served.
</P>
<P>
Other presumed front-runners include a slew of Italian cardinals, including Dionigi
Tettamanzi, Angelo Sodano and Carlo Martini; Latin Americans Jorge Mario
Bergoglio of Argentina, Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras and Claudio
Hummes of Brazil; a Nigerian, Francis Arinze; and an Indian,
Ivan Dias.
</P>
<P>
Yet papal elections have been famously unpredictable, with unexpected winners and
presumed front-runners often facing surprising fates. Indeed, John Paul II
was a surprise choice to many when he was elected
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
He was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years, and many
analysts say the Italians are desperate to reclaim the papacy.
</P>
<P>
Italy has the biggest national group, but the bloc of 20
cardinals is not big enough for them to pick a
pope on their own.
</P>
<P>
Latin America has 20 voting cardinals -- and nearly half the
church's followers. Some analysts believe that to recognize the importance
of its Latin American flock, the church will need to
name the first pope from the other side of the
Atlantic.
