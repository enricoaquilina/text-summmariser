Cardinals from around the globe began their secret
conclave to elect a new pope Monday and later cast their first
ballots, failing to reach agreement on a successor to Pope John Paul
II.

Shortly after 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. EDT), black smoke emerged
from a metal chimney atop the tile roof of the Sistine Chapel -- the
traditional signal that the cardinals have voted but that no new pope
has been elected. The smoke momentarily appeared white -- the sign that
a pope has been chosen -- and a crowd in St. Peter's Square burst into
applause. The smoke then turned unmistakably black, indicating that,
as expected, more than one ballot would be needed before the conclave
finished its work.

The first vote came more than two hours after the cardinals had
locked themselves inside the Sistine Chapel following a solemn
oath-taking in which they pledged to maintain the conclave's
traditional secrecy. Earlier, the putative front-runner to succeed
John Paul, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, inveighed against ideological
fashions and urged his fellow cardinals to hold fast to church
doctrine.
