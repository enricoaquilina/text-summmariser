Historic conclave to elect a new pope for a church in disarray

In a historic gathering steeped in intrigue, cardinals from six continents on
Monday open their first conclave of the new millennium to elect a pope who will
inherit John Paul II's mantle and guide the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholics
into a new era.
</P>
<P>
Representing 52 countries, the 115 crimson-robed "princes" of a church stung by
priest sex-abuse scandals and an exodus of the faithful were to celebrate a
midmorning Mass at St. Peter's Basilica before sequestering themselves in the
Sistine Chapel at 4:30 p.m. (1430 GMT).
</P>
<P>
There, seated atop a false floor hiding electronic jamming devices designed to
thwart eavesdroppers, they were to take an oath of secrecy, hear a meditation
from a senior cardinal and decide whether to take a first vote or wait until
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The new pope has already been chosen by the Lord. We just have to pray to
understand who he is," Florence Cardinal Ennio Antonelli, considered by some to
be a dark-horse candidate, told believers who gathered for Sunday Mass at his
titular church in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of pilgrims and tourists were expected to converge on St. Peter's
Square to watch the chapel chimney for the white smoke that ultimately will tell
the world that the church's 265th pontiff has been elected. The famous stove in
the chapel also will bellow black smoke to signal any inconclusive round of
voting.
</P>
<P>
Although the conclave could last for days, a pope could be chosen as early as
Monday afternoon if the red-capped prelates opt to begin casting ballots after
their solemn procession from the Vatican's Apostolic Palace to the
chapel.
</P>
<P>
If they decide to hold off a day, they will hold four rounds of voting _ two in
the morning, two in the afternoon _ on Tuesday and every day until a candidate
gets two-thirds support: 77 votes. If they remain deadlocked late in the second
week of voting, they can vote to change the rules so a winner can be elected
with a simple majority: 58 votes.
</P>
<P>
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said smoke from burned ballot papers
enhanced by special chemicals likely could be seen at around noon (1000 GMT) and
around 7 p.m. (1700 GMT) on each day of voting by the cardinal electors, all of
whom are under age 80. At some point soon after the new pope is chosen, the
Vatican also will ring bells.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the cardinals moved into the super-secure Domus Sanctae Marthae, a
euro26 million (US$20 million) hotel that John Paul had constructed inside
Vatican City so they could rest in comfort in private rooms between voting
sessions. Swiss Guards, their gaily colored uniforms covered by dark rain gear,
saluted the prelates as they were whisked to the residence in
limousines.
</P>
<P>
The daily La Stampa said cardinals gearing up for a stressful stretch of days
had packed CD players and headphones in their bags along with prayer books and
snacks to nibble on in their rooms.
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously missing from their quarters were cell phones, newspapers, radios,
TVs and Internet connections _ all banned in new rules laid down by John Paul II
to minimize the chances of news influencing their secret deliberations and to
prevent leaks to the outside world. The Vatican's security squad swept the
chapel for listening devices, and cooks, maids, elevator operators and drivers
were sworn to secrecy, with excommunication the punishment for any
indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
No conclave in the past century has lasted more than five days, and the election
that made John Paul II pope in October 1978 took eight ballots over three days.
He died April 2 at 84 after a pontificate that lasted more than 26 years,
history's third-longest papacy.
</P>
<P>
Cardinals faced a choice that boiled down to two options: an older, skilled
administrator who could serve as a "transitional" pope while the church absorbs
John Paul's legacy, or a younger dynamic pastor and communicator _ perhaps from
Latin America or elsewhere in the developing world where the church is growing _
who could build on the late pontiff's popularity over a quarter-century of
globe-trotting.
</P>
<P>
The prelates agreed after John Paul's funeral not to talk publicly about the
process, but the world's news media have been rife with speculation centering on
about two dozen candidates considered "papabile," Italian for pope material. The
name with the biggest buzz was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, a powerful Vatican
official from Germany who was to recite an opening prayer in Latin that the
voters be guided "in our hearts in love and in patience."
</P>
<P>
Among the issues sure to figure prominently in the conclave: containing the
priest sex-abuse scandals that have cost the church millions in settlements in
the United States; coping with a chronic shortage of priests and nuns in the
West; halting the stream of people leaving a church whose teachings they no
longer find relevant; and improving dialogue with the Islamic
world.
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Salvatore Pappalardo, an Italian who at 86 is too old to vote, told
Italian state radio Sunday he was confident the conclave would be guided to the
right man.
</P>
<P>
"Providence sends a pope for every era," he said.
