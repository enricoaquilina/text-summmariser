Text of the oath taken by the 115 cardinals voting in the conclave to elect a
new pope. The dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, read
the following in Latin:
</P>
<P>
"We, the cardinal electors present in this election of the Supreme Pontiff
promise, pledge and swear, as individuals and as a group, to observe faithfully
and scrupulously the prescriptions contained in the Apostolic Constitution of
the Supreme Pontiff John Paul II, Universi Dominici Gregis, published on 22
February 1996. We likewise promise, pledge and swear that whichever of us by
divine disposition is elected Roman Pontiff will commit himself faithfully to
carrying out the munus Petrinum of Pastor of the Universal Church and will not
fail to affirm and defend strenuously the spiritual and temporal rights and the
liberty of the Holy See. In a particular way, we promise and swear to observe
with the greatest fidelity and with all persons, clerical or lay, secrecy
regarding everything that in any way relates to the election of the Roman
Pontiff and regarding what occurs in the place of the election, directly or
indirectly related to the results of the voting; we promise and swear not to
break this secret in any way, either during or after the election of the new
Pontiff, unless explicit authorization is granted by the same Pontiff; and never
to lend support or favour to any interference, opposition or any other form of
intervention, whereby secular authorities of whatever order and degree or any
group of people or individuals might wish to intervene in the election of the
Roman Pontiff."
</P>
<P>
Each of the cardinal electors, according to the order of precedence, then took
the oath:
</P>
<P>
"And I, (NAME), do so promise, pledge and swear."
</P>
<P>
Placing his hand on the book of the Gospels, each cardinal added:
</P>
<P>
"So help me God and these Holy Gospels which I touch with my
hand."
