Jubilation gives way to resignation as tens of thousands wait for new pope

Tens of thousands of faithful had been standing on the cobblestones for hours
Monday, all eyes fixed on the narrow stovepipe jutting from the Sistine Chapel,
when a curl of smoke whisped into the chilly evening air.
</P>
<P>
A gasp of disbelief spread quickly through the crowd. "Is it black?" asked an
American priest. "It's white!" cried a Roman clerk. A Colombian priest grabbed
two strangers in a bear hug, screaming, "It's a pope!"
</P>
<P>
But within seconds, jubilation gave way to resignation when the chimney began
belching decidedly black smoke.
</P>
<P>
Paz Angelica Casillas, a honeymooner from Mexico, stopped jumping up and down
and released her new husband from an embrace.
</P>
<P>
"I feel like crying," said Casillas, 25, from the town of Tepatitlan. "We wanted
so much for it to be white."
</P>
<P>
But the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholics were to spend another night without
an earthly leader. The black smoke signaled that no man had received two-thirds
of the vote from the 115 cardinals sequestered in the chapel. White smoke would
have meant the world had a new pope.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of pilgrims began their stakeout in St. Peter's Square early Monday,
and as the sun sank in the sky the square began to fill. By 8 p.m. (1800 GMT)
there was a lopsided crowd of tens of thousands, grouped on the south side of
the square from which the chimney is visible.
</P>
<P>
Lines of television cameras were all pointed at the same angle. Pilgrims trained
their cell phone cameras at the chapel roof. Nuns sat in circles, praying and
thumbing through rosaries.
</P>
<P>
"This is history," said Hernan Aracena, 19, wrapped in a Venezuelan flag. "As
time goes by, this will be one of those moments where you say, `I was
there.'"
</P>
<P>
Firefighter Lance Smaw dialed home to Mesa, Arizona, to tell his wife Colleen
that he was in place.
</P>
<P>
"We're sitting in the square, waiting for the smoke to come from the chimney,"
he reported. "Words cannot describe this place."
</P>
<P>
Smaw, 35, flew into Rome with three friends Monday morning, leaving Colleen to
take care of the kids. "She's taking one for the team," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a part of history and a part of a new tomorrow, a new start," he
said. "Not many people have the chance to do something like this."
</P>
<P>
At the edge of the large column-lined square, people paused at a newsstand
selling the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, which on Monday featured a
four-page spread with photos of each of the 115 voting cardinals _ one of whom
almost certainly will be the new pontiff. Although the conclave can elect any
baptized Catholic male as pope, that has rarely been done.
</P>
<P>
Many of those in the square said they were praying for God to help the cardinals
choose their new leader.
</P>
<P>
"Now what we are all hoping for is that the Lord illuminates the cardinals ...
that the Lord through them makes the decision," said Rev. Luis Serrano, a
28-year-old priest from Isla Margarita, Venezuela, who is studying theology in
Rome. "It is a very strong burden, choosing the pope who will guide the
church."
</P>
<P>
Sister Monica, a 27-year-old Carmelite nun from Ragusa, Italy, said she was
confident they would make a wise choice.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly believe that the Holy Spirit will be the 116th (elector), and the
most important one," she said. "It will be He who will decide it
all."
</P>
<P>
Before the cardinals entered the Sistine Chapel and declared "extra omnes" _
Latin for "all out" _ they held a final Mass, which was broadcast on four giant
screens in the square. Thousands of people turned out, many weeping as they
absorbed the solemnity of the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan nuns in blue habits, Filipino monks in gray robes and tourists in
T-shirts mixed together, shaking hands and hugging in the sign of peace. Tears
streamed down the faces of Leila Mota and Mariana Dias as they embraced
tightly.
</P>
<P>
"For the rest of my life, I'll keep this moment in my heart," said Dias, a
27-year-old architect from Natal, Brazil. "The emotion is so strong, the faith
is so great."
</P>
<P>
Sobbing, she said she could feel John Paul's presence.
</P>
<P>
"I've seen Masses here on television, but I never imagined when I got here I'd
feel him so close to me," she said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the pilgrims said they would come to the square every day until a
cardinal cries from a Vatican balcony "Habemus papam" _ "We have a pope" _
however long it takes.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first conclave of the new millennium," said Sister Jolanta, a
29-year-old Polish nun. "This election involves not only the church, but all of
humanity."
