ANTICIPATION BUILDS AS CARDINALS GATHER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VATICAN CITY - On the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica,
where the next pope will be introduced to the world,
a red curtain now hangs open, as if waiting for
a cardinal to arrive and pronounce the news in Latin:
"Habemus Papam."
</P>
<P>
Tourists and journalists Sunday trained their eyes and their cameras on
the T-shaped chimney above the Sistine Chapel, where, sooner or
later, white smoke will signal the election of a pope.
</P>
<P>
And the 115 cardinal-electors - those under age 80 - Sunday
left apartments and hotels and seminaries around Rome and moved
into the Domus Sanctae Marthae, the $20 million residence where
they will stay while participating in the conclave that begins
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The cardinals, who stopped granting on-the-record interviews more than a week
ago, have offered few indications as to whom they will
choose to replace John Paul II, who died April 2
after a 26-year papacy.
</P>
<P>
Representing 52 countries, the most diverse group in history, the cardinals
say they believe the choice will be informed by the
Holy Spirit. They plan to gather at 10 a.m. (4
a.m. EDT) Monday in St. Peter's Basilica for a "Mass
for the election of the Supreme Pontiff."
</P>
<P>
Then, at 4:30 p.m. (10:30 a.m. EDT), the cardinals are scheduled
to gather in the Vatican palace and process into the
Sistine Chapel, where they are to swear an oath, pledging
secrecy, and to hear a meditation delivered by a retired
cardinal, Tomas Spidlik.
</P>
<P>
And then, the election begins. The cardinals will choose whether or
not to cast a first ballot Monday afternoon; after Monday,
they are scheduled to vote twice each morning and twice
each afternoon until they elect a pope.
</P>
<P>
Many Vatican watchers believe there is no cardinal who currently enjoys
the support of 77 cardinals, the two-thirds' majority traditionally required
for the election of a pope. But attention in Vatican
City is focused on one cardinal who is sure to
influence the selection, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Germany, as well
as about two dozen others who are considered "papabile," or
qualified to become the 265th leader of the Catholic Church,
which has 1 billion members.
</P>
<P>
"This is a hard decision and a very heavy decision," said
Sister Mary Ann Walsh, a spokeswoman for the US Conference
of Catholic Bishops. "They have to make the choice based
on the needs of the church and the needs of
the wider society."
</P>
<P>
Ratzinger and several Italian cardinals are among the potential kingmakers at
the conclave, viewed by many analysts as able to influence
the selection of the next pope, even if they themselves
are not likely to be elected. Among them are Cardinal
Carlo Maria Martini, the former archbishop of Milan, who is
highly regarded by moderates but is considered unlikely to become
pope because he is 78 and has Parkinson's disease, and
Cardinal Camillo Ruini, the vicar general for Rome and the
longtime president of the Italian bishops' conference.
</P>
<P>
Several Italian cardinals are also among the most discussed candidates for
the papacy. Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi of Milan has emerged as
a favorite of moderates, despite his ties to the conservative
group Opus Dei, because of his interest in social justice,
while Cardinal Angelo Scola of Venice, the son of a
truck driver who became an accomplished theologian, is liked by
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
But many Vatican watchers are focused on the possibility of a
Latin American pope, because about half of the world's Catholics
live in that region. Cardinal Claudio Hummes of Sao Paolo
demonstrated his concern for labor by offering shelter to striking
metalworkers; Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires is a Jesuit
priest who prefers to travel by bus and refused to
live in the local archbishop's mansion; and Cardinal Oscar Andres
Rodriguez Maradiaga of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, is an advocate for the
poor who drew critical attention when he blasted US newspapers,
including The Boston Globe, for their coverage of the clergy
sexual-abuse crisis. He called the coverage "a persecution of the
church" and said it was characterized by "a fury which
reminds me of the times of Diocletian and Nero and,
more recently, Stalin and Hitler."
</P>
<P>
Among the long-shot possibilities are Cardinal Ivan Dias of Bombay, a
longtime Vatican diplomat; Cardinal Marc Ouellet of Quebec, a crusader
against same-sex marriage in Canada; and Cardinal Ennio Antonelli, the
archbishop of Florence, who Sunday said in a homily: "The
new pope has already been chosen by the Lord. We
just have to pray to understand who he is."
</P>
<P>
Ratzinger, who was the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine
of the Faith during the John Paul II papacy, is
admired by many for his defense of orthodoxy, but is
also controversial for approving the disciplining of numerous theologians. Ratzinger
recently approved a teaching ban against the Rev. Roger Haight,
formerly of the Weston Jesuit School of Theology in Cambridge,
because Ratzinger deemed a book Haight wrote as containing "serious
doctrinal errors" about the role of Jesus in the salvation
for non-Christians.
</P>
<P>
Ratzinger has enjoyed a boomlet in support in part because many
people thought he did a good job delivering the homily
at John Paul II's funeral, and in part because he
was a close adviser to the pontiff.
</P>
<P>
"His performance at the funeral certainly solidified his reputation, and if
he's not elected himself, I don't think anyone can be
elected over his objections," said John-Peter Pham, a professor at
James Madison University.
</P>
<P>
But Ratzinger turned 78 Saturday, which Vatican analysts say could be
a concern because, even though Ratzinger appears healthy, the cardinals
might want to avoid the prospect of another frail, ailing
pope in the short-term.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to be a fairly challenging conclave -
there's never been a leading candidate, and the reason is
that there are a whole number of opinions, and so
much depends on what the cardinals find to be the
major issue facing the church," said the Rev. Keith Pecklers,
professor of theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Sunday, crowds of tourists milled about a rainy St. Peter's Square,
visiting the basilica, taking pictures of the chimney, and talking
expectantly about the week ahead.
</P>
<P>
"I would like them to choose someone who will continue where
the old man has left off - not to favor
any continent, but to be a universal person," said Stan
Alfwani, a 34-year-old seminarian from Nairobi. Alfwani said he hopes
the next pope will pay particular attention to "inculturation," making
sure that the church is assimilated into different cultures, including
those of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Yasuhiko Masuoka, 67, of Tokyo said he, too, is hoping for
a pope who will carry on John Paul II's policies.
But Masuoka also said he would like the cardinals to
make another bold geographic choice, as they did with John
Paul II, who, as a Pole, was the first non-Italian
pope in 455 years.
</P>
<P>
"This time they should choose a pope from Latin America, because
it will show a more cosmopolitan image to the world,"
Masuoka said.
</P>
<P>
Even non-Catholic visitors said they are paying close attention to the
goings-on.
</P>
<P>
"John Paul II was very good for all religions, and we
hope that whoever will replace him will do the same,"
said Mohammed Salem, 49, of Mauritania, a Muslim tourist who
praised John Paul II's outreach to Islam.
