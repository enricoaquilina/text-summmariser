Cardinals Begin Conclave to Select New Pope

Cardinals from around the globe began their secret
conclave to elect a new pope Monday, filing into the Sistine Chapel in
a solemn procession hours after the putative front-runner to succeed
Pope John Paul II, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, inveighed against
ideological fashions and urged his fellow cardinals to hold fast to
church doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Wearing crimson robes and caps, the leaders of the Roman Catholic
Church swore collective and individual oaths of secrecy before taking
their places to begin the conclave in the chapel beneath the renowned
frescoes of Michelangelo. As they entered the chapel, they filed past
the Vatican's Swiss Guards in ceremonial uniforms.
</P>
<P>
Led by Ratzinger, the cardinals pledged ``secrecy regarding
everything that in any way relates to the election of the Roman
Pontiff and regarding what occurs in the place of the election....''
They swore ``not to break this secret in any way, either during or
after the election of the new Pontiff, unless explicit authorization
is granted by the same Pontiff,'' and they promised to resist any
intervention by ``secular authorities'' or anyone else in the election
of the pope.
</P>
<P>
After the oath-taking, television camera operators who were
recording the scene live and all others were ordered out of the
chapel, and its wooden doors were closed.
</P>
<P>
Hours before the conclave, Ratzinger delivered a blunt sermon at
St. Peter's Basilica. His homily at the traditional Mass for the
election of a pope amounted to a campaign speech for orthodoxy,
continuity with John Paul's papacy and staunch resistance to cultural
pressure for change in the 1.1 billion-member Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
The German cardinal, who turned 78 on Saturday, described the
church as a ``little boat of Christian thought'' buffeted by waves of
Marxism, liberalism, libertinism, collectivism, radical individualism,
atheism, agnosticism and syncretism. ``How many winds of doctrine have
we known?'' he asked. ``How many ideological currents, how many
fashions of thought?''
</P>
<P>
``To have a clear faith according to the church's creed is often
labeled fundamentalism, while relativism -- letting ourselves be
carried away by any wind of doctrine -- is made to appear the only
attitude acceptable in today's times,'' he said. ``A dictatorship of
relativism is established that recognizes nothing as definitive and
that leaves as the final standard only one's own ego and desires.''
</P>
<P>
Italian newspapers, without naming any sources in the College of
Cardinals, have speculated that Ratzinger will enter the conclave
Monday afternoon with about 50 votes. A total of 117 cardinals under
age 80 are eligible to vote, but two are ill, bringing the expected
number of electors to 115. Two-thirds, or 77 votes, are needed for
election in the early rounds of voting.
</P>
<P>
``I thought it was Ratzinger saying, in effect, what you see is
what you get,'' the Rev. Richard John Neuhaus, editor of the journal
First Things, said of the German cardinal's homily. ``It was vintage
Ratzinger -- calm, deliberate, precise, incisive.''
</P>
<P>
The cardinals in red robes and white miters formed a crescent in
front of the altar, which rests atop the tomb of St. Peter and under a
huge bronze canopy, or baldachin.
</P>
<P>
``Obviously they're all sitting there thinking, what would this man
be like as pope?'' Neuhaus said.
</P>
<P>
The cardinal described by some as the most likely alternative to
Ratzinger in the initial voting is Carlo Maria Martini, also 78, the
retired archbishop of Milan. If neither can reach the two-thirds
threshold, the field could open to numerous possible candidates. Among
the most frequently mentioned are Cardinals Dionigi Tettamanzi of
Milan, Angelo Scola of Venice, Camillo Ruini of Rome, Francis Arinze
of Nigeria, Ivan Dias of India, Christoph Schoenborn of Austria,
Claudio Hummes of Brazil, Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina and Oscar
Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
The cardinals arrived by foot and by car Sunday at the Domus
Sanctae Marthae, the Vatican guesthouse where they will sleep and eat
during the conclave. All were dressed in their traditional red-trimmed
black cassocks, their waists wrapped in scarlet sashes and their heads
bobbing beneath scarlet skullcaps.
</P>
<P>
Already forbidden to speak to reporters, they were to take a vow of
complete secrecy upon entering the Sistine Chapel on Monday. There,
under Michelangelo's depiction of a stern Christ delivering the Last
Judgment, they will mark their ballots at long tables covered with
golden cloths.
</P>
<P>
Most conclaves in the past century have lasted only three or four
days. But if the cardinals remain deadlocked for more than 12 days,
they can change the rules and elect the pontiff by a simple majority --
an innovation introduced by John Paul that has never been tried
before. The ballots are burned in an old stove, and when someone wins,
a chemical will be added to turn the smoke white.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, some of the cardinals celebrated Mass at churches they
are nominally assigned to in Rome. None was tipping his hand. During a
sermon at the church of San Giovanni della Pigna, Arinze told the
congregation that the next pope ``should be a preacher'' and ``a
shepherd who sacrifices himself for the people of God.''
</P>
<P>
At the church of San Andrea delle Fratte, Cardinal Ennio Antonelli,
the archbishop of Florence, said: ``The new pope has already been
chosen by the Lord. We just have to pray to understand who he is.''
