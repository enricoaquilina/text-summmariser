BLACK SMOKE EMERGES, SIGNALING NO NEW POPE MONDAY

<P>
Black smoke rose from the chimney of the Sistine
Chapel Monday evening as cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church
signaled that they had voted inconclusively in their first attempt
to elect a successor to Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
For a few moments, the first wisps of smoke looked white
to the many spectators drawn to St. Peter's Square in
the Vatican and hopes rose that a pope had already
been chosen. Soon, however, the smoke turned decisively black as
it wafted from a stovepipe chimney, blowing in the winds
at dusk.
</P>
<P>
The cardinals are to vote again at their conclave on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the cardinals retreated behind the heavy wooden doors of
the Sistine Chapel and began the tradition-laden and secret ceremonies
to elect one of their number the 265th pope.
</P>
<P>
In solemn procession, walking slowly in pairs, they proceeded into the
chapel as a choir chanted the Litany of Saints, passing
between a pair of Swiss guards in full regalia. After
taking their seats behind long tables, the cardinals were read
an oath of secrecy and obedience by their dean, Cardinal
Joseph Ratzinger. Their birettas, red hats that symbolize the power
of their offices, sat on the tables in front of
them.
</P>
<P>
Then they lined up and one by one put their hand
on the Gospel and swore to obey. The entire pageant
was televised live, a first in conclave history and in
keeping with the tradition of John Paul II, who used
television throughout his papacy to promote the faith. Even in
death, his image was broadcast as he lay in state
inside St. Peter's Basilica.
</P>
<P>
"Extra omnes!" cried Piero Marini, the master of papal liturgical ceremonies
-- or "Everyone out!" He and a theologian chosen to
deliver an inspirational message remained. The rules called for them
to leave after the address. At that point, the cardinals
were to decide whether to hold a first round of
voting Monday night or not.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, they heard another message. Ratzinger, who will
be a powerful force in the conclave, took the occasion
of a morning Mass dedicated to the election to denounce
anyone who would stray from traditional Catholic doctrine.
</P>
<P>
The 114 other cardinals sat in quarter-circles in front of him.
It was the last public rite before the conclave.
</P>
<P>
"A dictatorship of relativism is being built that recognizes nothing as
definite," Ratzinger said, "and which leaves as the ultimate measure
only one's ego and desires."
</P>
<P>
For 25 years, Ratzinger served as John Paul's theological right hand
-- and watchdog -- as prefect of the Congregation for
the Doctrine of the Faith.
</P>
<P>
In his writings and public statements, Ratzinger has often sought to
uphold the primacy of Catholicism, saying no other religion offered
a path to salvation. "Relativism," he has said, implies --
wrongly -- that other faiths are equally valid. The idea
was strongly expressed in a document the congregation issued in
2000, Dominus Iesus, which provoked angry responses from other religious
leaders.
</P>
<P>
In his homily Monday, Ratzinger said that Christians were tossed on
the waves of Marxism, liberalism and even "libertinism;" of radical
individualism, atheism and vague mysticism. He also decried the creation
of "sects" and how people are seduced into them, using
a term church leaders often employ to refer to Protestant
evangelical movements.
</P>
<P>
"Having a clear faith, according to the Credo of the Church,
is often labeled as fundamentalism," he said. "Yet relativism, that
is, letting oneself being carried 'here and there by any
wind of doctrine,' appears as the sole attitude good enough
for modern times."
</P>
<P>
Many of the cardinals, draped in bright-red vestments and wearing white
mitres, watched intently as Ratzinger spoke on a platform below
Bernini's bronze baldacchino. Several others among them -- two thirds
of the cardinals voting for pope are septuagenarians -- appeared
to doze.
</P>
<P>
Ratzinger, 78, spoke Italian in heavily accented German, his voice creaky
at times and interrupted by coughs. Several church officials said
he had been suffering from a cold.
</P>
<P>
The cardinal has emerged as a front-runner in the election for
the next pope, or at least the reference point for
a bloc of support generally oriented toward a more conservative
position. He has been a major force among the cardinals
since John Paul's death on April 2, celebrating the funeral
Mass and leading the cardinals' regular daily meetings.
</P>
<P>
Commentators agreed that while the cardinal had been saying similar things
for decades, hearing them expressed, and so sharply at that,
just before the conclave was unexpected. But there were different
interpretations of his intent.
</P>
<P>
At the funeral, the cardinal showed his pastoral side, said John-Peter
Pham, a former Vatican diplomat and author of a book
about papal succession.
</P>
<P>
At the Mass Monday, "he's giving evidence that he also has,
if you will, the 'vision thing,' that he has definite
ideas of where the natural progression of John Paul's theological
legacy is," Pham said. "Whether that's a campaign statement or
requirement of what the next guy must have -- that
remains to be seen."
</P>
<P>
The message is that John Paul's goals must be maintained, he
said. "Either as a candidate or a grand elector, he's
definitely in a very strong position, and he wouldn't have
made this statement if he was standing alone," Pham said.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Monticone, a professor of modern history at Lumsa Catholic University
in Rome, called the comments "a very clear indication of
what in his view the attitude of the next pope
should be -- an attitude of struggle against these evils
of the world."
</P>
<P>
It was likely that most of the cardinals were well familiar
with Ratzinger's thinking, and his belief that the church's first
priority should be to shore up the doctrinal walls.
</P>
<P>
"It's very honest," said the Rev. Gerald O'Collins, a theologian at
the Gregorian Pontifical University in Rome. "That's what he thinks."
</P>
<P>
"Some of the cardinals would not agree with his summation," he
said. "Other things like war and peace and hunger are
high on the agenda of other cardinals."
</P>
<P>
After attending the Mass, the Rev. Raymond J. de Souza, chaplain
at Newman House at Queens University in Kingston, Ontario, said
that Ratzinger's homily was an "exhortation" to the cardinals to
go into the conclave keeping in mind that the primary
responsibility of a pope is to preserve the faith passed
on from the apostles and not to dilute or experiment
with it.
</P>
<P>
"If the faith is strong, then the church can take on
these other issues," said de Souza, who writes a syndicated
column.
</P>
<P>
Professor Hans Kueng, a theologian at the University of Tubingen, who
has tangled with Ratzinger, said he heard similar views many
years ago from him. "His ideology is a medieval, anti-Reformation,
anti-modern paradigm of the church and the papacy," he said.
