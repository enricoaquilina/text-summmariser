<P>
Cardinals from six continents made their solemn procession to the Sistine Chapel
on Monday to convene the new millennium's first conclave _ a secret and sacred
gathering to elect a pope who will guide the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholics
into a new era.
</P>
<P>
Clad in crimson vestments and caps, the 115 voting "princes" of a church stung
by priest sex-abuse scandals and an exodus of the faithful walked slowly from
the Apostolic Palace to sequester themselves inside the chapel decorated with
frescoes by Michelangelo.
</P>
<P>
They were to take an oath of secrecy and hear a meditation before deciding
whether to take their first vote or wait until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger _ a powerful Vatican official from Germany who often
has been mentioned as a leading candidate for pope _ recited a prayer at the
palace before the cardinals chanted the Litany of the Saints as they made the
short walk to the chapel.
</P>
<P>
The cardinals were led by altar servers carrying two long, lit white candles and
a metal crucifix.
