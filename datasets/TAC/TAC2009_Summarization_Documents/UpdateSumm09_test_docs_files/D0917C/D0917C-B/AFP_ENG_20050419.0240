VATICAN CITY, April 19
</DATELINE>

<P>
Cardinals were deadlocked Tuesday 
in their search for a new leader of the Roman Catholic Church, as 
black smoke emerging from a Vatican chimney signalled they had 
failed in two new votes to elect a pope.
</P>
<P>
To the disappointment of the thousands of people gathered on 
Saint Peter's Square, the smoke puffing out of the copper chimney 
above the Sistine Chapel was emphatically not the white they had 
been hoping for to signal a new pope.
</P>
<P>
For a brief moment there was heart-stopping confusion as the 
smoke appeared white, and the crowd surged forward toward the 
Vatican balcony already decked out in purple curtains for the new 
pope's first public appearance.
</P>
<P>
Again, as after the first ballot late Monday, the plumes turned 
black and the crowd subsided.
</P>
<P>
"We really thought we had it," said Brother Eldi, a monk from 
Brazil after rushing forward toward the basilica.
</P>
<P>
But less than 15 minutes later more smoke emerged from the 
chimney, sowing confusion until it too turned black. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican television said it was likely the inconclusive ballots 
were burned in two batches, one for each unsuccessful round.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's signals mean that the 115 cardinals sequestered in the 
splendour of the Sistine have now failed in three votes to agree on 
a successor to John Paul II as the 265th leader of the world's 1.1 
billion Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
Under a Vatican timetable, the prelates are to convene twice a 
day, in the morning and the afternoon, and vote twice in each 
session.
</P>
<P>
In theory, the white smoke signalling a successful election 
could occur at any time during those hours.
</P>
<P>
The cardinals had earlier trooped back into the Sistine Chapel 
from their secluded Santa Marta residence. Once inside, they prayed 
before resuming their deliberations.
</P>
<P>
After the mourning and public emotion over the death of John 
Paul II, when millions of pilgrims packed into Rome and hundreds of 
state leaders attended his funeral, the election of his successor is 
once again keeping the world in suspense.
</P>
<P>
Vatican watchers, rebuffed by the hi-tech secrecy surrounding 
the debate, were reduced to speculating Tuesday on the course 
ahead.
</P>
<P>
"Black smoke, time to negotiate," headlined the daily Corriere 
della Sera, citing the only outward indication so far available.
</P>
<P>
"The conclave is looking for agreement after the 
Martini-Ratzinger duel," the paper said, referring to the leaders of 
opposing camps apparently led by moderate Italian Carlo Maria 
Martini and the arch-conservative German Joseph Ratzinger.
</P>
<P>
If they cancel each other out as many expect, other possible 
popes include Dionigi Tettamanzi, the archbishop of Milan who is 
seen as less conservative than Ratzinger.
</P>
<P>
Bookies have also listed the likes of Nigeria's Francis Arinze, 
Jean-Marie Lustiger of France, Claudio Hummes of Brazil and the 
Honduran, Oscar Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga as possible compromise 
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Predicting an outcome as early as Tuesday, the Corriere della 
Sera said the cardinals were likely to have broken out into groups, 
possibly determined by common languages, with "delegates" from the 
two camps as well as a third Latin American current.
</P>
<P>
Whoever is elected pope will take the Church into a new era at a 
time when Roman Catholicism faces stern doctrinal and moral 
dilemmas, with conservatives keen to uphold the late pope's strict 
stance on abortion, contraception, the celibacy of priests and the 
ordination of women.
</P>
<P>
But many in the Church are pressing for a relaxation of certain 
strictures, notably to allow condoms in the fight against AIDS but 
also on issues such as allowing clerics to marry to encourage more 
to join the dwindling priesthood.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the utmost secrecy during the voting process, the 
Sistine Chapel -- normally packed with tourists admiring the 
magnificent frescoes including Michelangelo's Last Judgment -- has 
been swept for bugs and a special system installed to scramble any 
mobile telephone communications.
</P>
<P>
Even the Santa Marta residence has been stripped of televisions, 
radio and newspapers, and extra precautions have been taken to 
ensure the cardinals do not cross paths with any Vatican official or 
member of the public.
