VATICAN CITY
</DATELINE>

<P>
As white smoke streamed from the slender chimney on
the roof of the Sistine Chapel where the cardinals met to elect a new
pope, the crowd of tens of thousands filling St. Peter's Square surged
forward.
</P>
<P>
They shouted with excitement: ``Avemos Papa'' (We have a pope.)
</P>
<P>
Some cheered, some sang. Many whipped out cell phones and typed in
the words ``white smoke.''
</P>
<P>
But when Chilean Cardinal Jorge Arturo Medina Estevez announced
that the new leader of the world's billion Catholics was Josef
Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, electricity seemed to give way to
matter-of-factness.
</P>
<P>
``We don't know much about him, except that he's quite closely
linked with John Paul II,'' said Ursula Kelly of Ireland's County
Derry who was in Rome with her husband for their 15th wedding
anniversary. ``But we're just so glad to see it.''
</P>
<P>
Some groups applauded, some cheered, but the overwhelming sentiment
was that a larger figure still loomed over the scene -- Pope John Paul
II, who died earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
``It's a hard act to follow. He is the only pope I've known,'' said
Paul Anderson, 25, a resident adviser in Loyola University of
Chicago's semester-abroad program in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Ratzinger seemed to sense the shadow as well. When he emerged onto
the marble balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square, the first sentence
he uttered as Benedict XVI was an acknowledgment of his predecessor's
power.
</P>
<P>
``After the great Pope John Paul II, the cardinals elected me, a
simple, humble worker in the vineyards of the Lord,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He raised his arms, turning from side to side, clasped his hands
together and blew a kiss to the crowd, which filled the vast square
and spilled into adjoining streets. The new pope appeared stiff and
reserved.
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Justin Francis Rigali of Philadelphia, who was looking
down at the same crowd from one of the adjacent balconies at the
Vatican, described a scene of majesty as he looked out over St.
Peter's Square. ``I was on the balcony to the right, and what a view
it was! All these tens of thousands of people and the wonderful
welcome they gave the new pope. You heard them chant `Benedicto,
Benedicto.' So it started off well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Silvana Dal Mas, an elderly sister of the Little Daughters of the
Heart of Jesus, who had come to Rome for the conclave and elbowed her
way to the front of the crowd, had said she would prefer a Latin
American pope, but when Ratzinger was named she quickly adjusted her
sights.
</P>
<P>
``I am happy,'' she said, looking up at the balconies filled with
cardinals. ``People think the Germans are hard, but I come from near
the border with Austria, and when the Germans love, it's sincere. This
pope will...,'' she paused. ``He will work very well.''
</P>
<P>
Mario Marazziti, spokesman and a founding member of the Saint
Egidio Community -- a Catholic social movement that works with the
poor and refugees -- raced to St. Peter's Square when he heard news of
the white smoke. He found himself surprised by the new pope's
demeanor.
</P>
<P>
The usually stern Ratzinger seemed awestruck, even timid as he
stood on the balcony of the basilica, looking out at the crowd that
had assembled to greet him.
</P>
<P>
``I think he was uncertain, he was intimidated tonight,'' Marazitti
said Tuesday. ``He used minimalist words. And all of us today are the
children of John Paul II who regard this strong and timid man ... I
was moved, I found it tender.''
</P>
<P>
Most excited about his election were groups of young people who had
been devoted to John Paul and were eager to transfer their affections
to a new spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
Bree Dail, 23, who attends Christendom College in Front Royal, Va.,
snagged a seat in the front row on both Monday and Tuesday along with
a handful of her fellow students so that she could watch the new pope
from close up. For much of the day, she had prayed the rosary with her
friends, hoping that the cardinals would make their choice.
</P>
<P>
When she heard Ratzinger's name, she leapt up, shouting and
cheering -- although she, like so many others, could not help but
connect him to the previous pope. ``They gave us the best, he
(Ratzinger) has the heart of the holy father,'' she said. ``We are
happy, we are ecstatic, it's like we have a father.''
</P>
<P>
The day was overcast and chilly. Dark clouds scudded across the
sky, making it hard to tell whether the initial curl of smoke rising
at dusk from the Sistine Chapel was gray tending to black or gray
tending to white.
</P>
<P>
As the crowd called out ``Bianco, bianco'' a priest, his cell phone
glued to one ear, came out on one of the terraces that sit atop the
majestic colonnade surrounding St. Peter's Square and gestured
frantically at the bell tower.
</P>
<P>
John Paul had decreed that in addition to sending up white smoke,
the Vatican should ring the bells to announce a papal election.
</P>
<P>
The piazza that had only scattered groups of people earlier in the
day appeared suddenly to have filled to bursting. A group of Spanish
nuns leapt onto chairs and began to chant ``we have a pope.''
</P>
<P>
An older nun reproved them. ``You don't know for certain yet,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
So when the great bell finally began to sound, its ring was
overwhelmed by the roar of the crowd, relieved and excited that the
election of a new pope was real. Some waved papal flags, others flags
from their home countries -- Germany and Honduras, Mexico and the
United States. As people waited, there were lulls in the cheers and
some began to sing Italian hymns or chant prayers in Latin.
</P>
<P>
Vatican staff -- priests, nuns and lay workers -- came out on the
roof of the buildings surrounding St. Peter's to watch the ceremony.
News and television photographers staged themselves between the
statues that crown the colonnade.
</P>
<P>
As the cardinals prepared to introduce the new pope, acolytes
unfurled a velvet banner with the seal of John Paul and hung it in
front of the balcony. Then, the grand glass doors behind the papal
balcony were opened and a long, deep-red curtain let fall, making more
dramatic the new pope's entrance as it was pushed aside to make way
for him.
</P>
<P>
The voting cardinals gathered on adjoining balconies, their scarlet
cassocks and skullcaps contrasting sharply with the white marble,
creating a vivid tableaux, but also a moment of sober ceremony as they
watched one of their own move into the most elite realm in
Christendom.
</P>
<P>
After a greeting and a few words, Ratzinger said: ``I entrust
myself to your prayers,'' as the crowd chanted his new papal name.
</P>
<P>
With the dusk deepening and a damp wind rising, he ducked back
inside the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
With the new pope's departure, the crowd began to drift off. A
group known as ``Papa Boys,'' an informal youth group that sprang up
during John Paul's jubilee year, rallied a large circle of young
Catholics to sing. Many said they were hoping the new pope would
reappear.
</P>
<P>
Many who stood on the periphery of the swaying crowd of teenagers
and twentysomethings had more questions than answers. ``We'll see if
he has enough charisma to face this crisis of faith that we have in
the church with people drifting away,'' said Elena Fonte, 35, a
lawyer. ``I still think of John Paul II as pope; not of Ratzinger as
pope.''
