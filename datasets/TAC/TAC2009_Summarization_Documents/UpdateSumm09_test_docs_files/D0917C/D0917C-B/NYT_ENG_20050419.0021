VATICAN CONCLAVE UNDERWAY -- FIRST VOTE YIELDS NO POPE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rome -- Cardinals from 52 nations, signaling their first vote with
a puff of black smoke, began Monday night the process
of selecting the 265th leader of the world's oldest dynasty
-- the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
The stream of black smoke from the chimney over the Sistine
Chapel meant the 115 voting red-robed "princes" of the church
had not reached any conclusion in their search for a
successor to Pope John Paul II and would return to
the chapel this morning for more balloting. White smoke would
have meant a new pontiff.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of faithful watched from St. Peter's Square --
millions more on television -- as smoke poured from the
chapel's chimney.
</P>
<P>
"It seems white. ... No, no, it's black!" reported Vatican Radio
as the first pale wisps slipped out from the narrow
metal pipe and then quickly darkened.
</P>
<P>
Few expected a hasty decision. The cardinals have a staggering range
of issues to juggle, from bioethical and medical issues to
the church's relations with Islam, Judaism and other Christian churches.
</P>
<P>
The conclave began as the cardinals filed into the Sistine Chapel,
the magnificent chamber adorned by Michelangelo in the 16th century
and swept last week for electronic listening devices.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in more than a quarter of
a century that church leaders have gathered to elect a
supreme pontiff. And, for the first time ever, television cameras
broadcast the opening ceremonies and the cardinals' procession into the
chapel live into St. Peter's Square, and around the world.
</P>
<P>
After their procession into the chapel, the cardinals walked up to
a small wooden table and placed their right hands on
a large Bible, swearing to uphold the rules of the
conclave and to keep its proceedings secret.
</P>
<P>
There is no clear front-runner among the 115 cardinals as to
who will replace John Paul to become the next pope
and lead the 1.1 billion-member church in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The day of solemn ritual began in the morning in St.
Peter's Basilica with a special Mass for the Election of
the Roman Pontiff, attended by thousands of faithful and all
of the 115 cardinals.
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the dean of the College of Cardinals, played
a major role in the pre-conclave Mass--just as he did
during the late pope's funeral Mass 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
In a stern homily delivered to a packed church, Ratzinger said
"being an adult means having a faith which does not
follow the waves of today's fashions or latest novelties."
</P>
<P>
It was classic Ratzinger. He, along with John Paul, has spent
more than two decades reining in the purported liberal excesses
of the Second Vatican Council, the sweeping church reforms in
the 1960s that brought the Roman church into the modern
world.
</P>
<P>
"Having a clear faith, based on the creed of the church,
is often labeled today as a fundamentalism," Ratzinger said in
his homily.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas relativism, which is letting oneself be tossed and swept along
by every wind of teaching, looks like the only attitude
acceptable to today's standards," he said. "We are moving toward
a dictatorship of relativism which does not recognize anything as
for certain and which has as its highest goal one's
own ego and one's own desires."
</P>
<P>
Ratzinger's sermon was greeted with a spattering of applause, including polite
acknowledgment from a dozen of the assembled cardinals.
</P>
<P>
But there was sustained applause at the end of the two-hour
Mass as the cardinals -- some of them smiling --
filed past Michelangelo's Pieta, the famous sculpture of Mary holding
the body of Jesus Christ. It was the last public
event before the cardinals were sequestered into the conclave.
</P>
<P>
On the steps of the basilica, John and Bonnie Glossinger of
Mill Valley paused to reflect on the morning's historic events.
</P>
<P>
"It was very impressive," said John Glossinger, was who on a
business trip to Munich and just happened to be in
Rome this week with his wife.
</P>
<P>
"All of us just stood there in awe," Bonnie Glossinger added.
</P>
<P>
The smoke from the Sistine Chapel in the last moments of
twilight Monday indicated there was a first-ballot vote that resulted
in no one receiving the two-thirds' majority required to become
pope. Voting is conducted under a strict veil of secrecy.
The ballots are burned -- with chemical additives -- creating
black or white smoke.
</P>
<P>
In recent conclaves, the single evening vote on the first day
of the gathering has been a largely ceremonial affair.
</P>
<P>
Ratzinger, 78, a conservative German cardinal and the chief enforcer of
Catholic orthodoxy during John Paul's reign, was thought to be
in line for a sizable number of those votes. Vatican
insiders also predicted that Cardinal Carlo Martini, the archbishop of
Milan and a comparatively liberal church leader, would receive a
block of votes of his own from those opposed to
Ratzinger.
</P>
<P>
Martini, who turned 78 in February, is not seen as a
serious papal contender, partly because of his relatively liberal views
and partly because he suffers from Parkinson's disease, the same
ailment that led to John Paul II's demise.
</P>
<P>
Serious balloting is to start today, with two votes in the
morning and two in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Monsignor Charles Burns, an Irish priest and archivist for the past
35 years at the Vatican Secret Archives, said the tradition
of locking up the cardinals dates back to the 13th
century. The cardinals, he said, were taking months to elect
the new pope -- spending more time hunting and feasting
than in serious deliberation.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't to keep people out," he said. "It was to
keep the cardinals in."
</P>
<P>
It took the conclave nearly three years to elect Pope Gregory
X in 1271. The election came only after a mob
tore the roof off the building where the cardinals met,
exposing them to the elements, and put them on a
diet of bread and water to force a decision.
</P>
<P>
This year's conclave is not expected to last that long, even
though Pope John Paul built a new hotel, Santa Marta,
for the cardinals on Vatican grounds, giving them more comfortable
accommodations.
</P>
<P>
Many "Vaticanistas," those on the permanent papal press corps, predict it
will take two to three days to elect a new
pope.
