He Is Expected to Be a Pope on a Mission
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VATICAN CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pope Benedict XVI may travel less than his
globetrotting predecessor, but few expect him to act like a caretaker
pope.
</P>
<P>
Rather, the 78-year-old pontiff is expected to pursue an activist
agenda, topped by a mission to revitalize the Catholic faith and
identity where it is threatened by secularism, particularly in Europe.
</P>
<P>
But after persuading two-thirds of the College of Cardinals to
elect him, the new pontiff must now lead a 1 billion-member flock that
is deeply divided over the church's direction and his own promise to
stay the course. How he will persuade Catholics that he is pastor to
them all is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
The mixed reaction to the election of Cardinal Joseph Ratzlinger
reflects his familiar role as a lightning rod for the harshest
criticism leveled at John Paul's 26-year reign.
</P>
<P>
It was Ratzinger whose Vatican doctrinal office silenced or
reprimanded more than 100 Catholic theologians, according to some
estimates. He epitomized a centralization of authority in the Vatican
under John Paul, at the expense of local bishops, while enforcing
church doctrine against married priests, women in the priesthood,
remarriage for divorced Catholics, and homosexual liaisons.
</P>
<P>
Catholics around the world welcomed Ratzinger's election as an act
inspired by God. Many others said they were in shock.
</P>
<P>
``This is a disaster,'' said Rea Howarth, co-director of the
Quixote Center, a Catholic lay organization based in Brentwood, Md.,
that is involved in human rights work in Latin America. ``The church
has lost so much credibility. Now I'm afraid that more Catholics will
just turn their backs and walk away.''
</P>
<P>
``Ratzinger is a polarizing figure, who seems to prefer
combativeness to compromise and compassion,'' said Mary Grant, a
spokeswoman for Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.
</P>
<P>
But some prominent critics of Ratzinger said they were hoping for
something different in Pope Benedict.
</P>
<P>
The new pontiff held out what some saw as an olive branch in the
way he explained the inspiration for his name: Pope Benedict XV, who
ran the church during World War I, had given himself to ``peacemaking,
reconciliation and harmony,'' the new pope said.
</P>
<P>
That explanation, said Cardinal Gottfried Danneels of Belgium,
``gives me some hope'' that Ratzinger will listen to demands from
bishops for more ``collegiality,'' or democracy, in church governance.
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Hans Kung of Germany, who was stripped of his authority by
Ratzinger to teach at Catholic universities for questioning church
teachings, called Ratzinger's election ``an enormous disappointment''
but added: ``The papacy is such a challenge that it can change anyone.
... Let us therefore give him a chance.''
</P>
<P>
Kung noted that Pope John XXIII, who reigned from 1958-63, had
started as a conservative but turned more progressive.
</P>
<P>
Still, the overriding message of Ratzinger's election, on the
second day of secret voting in the Sistine Chapel, was continuity with
John Paul.
</P>
<P>
``Of all the men in that room, Cardinal Ratzinger was certainly the
smartest and the one who most represented John Paul II's theology and
view of the world,'' said Father Thomas Reese, editor of the New
York-based Jesuit magazine America. ``They picked the man who would
carry on with that legacy.''
</P>
<P>
In an editorial last week, Reese warned the cardinals that ``a
church that cannot openly discuss issues is a church retreating into
an intellectual ghetto.'' He said the next pope must be open to a
priesthood that admits women and married men.
</P>
<P>
After Ratzinger's election, Reese said it was clear that such
issues ``will simply remain off the table.''
</P>
<P>
``He sees his first task as protecting the traditional identity of
Catholics in the world against an infinite sea of threats,'' said John
Allen, who wrote a biography of Cardinal Ratzinger. Opening the
priesthood, for example, ``might create a slippery slope down which
the church risks losing its identity,'' the author said.
</P>
<P>
``Obviously, the keystone of the Ratzinger pontificate will be one
of preserving traditional teachings rather than tinkering with them,''
Allen added.
</P>
<P>
The new pope is expected to stress ``culture of life'' issues,
doing battle against gay marriage, euthanasia and stem cell research.
He would ensure that theological speculation is contained within
narrow limits. His governing metaphor for the church of the future is
the mustard seed; it might have to be smaller to be faithful -- what
he calls a ``creative minority.''
</P>
<P>
His focus on Europe is a reaction, in part, to setbacks the Vatican
suffered last year when the European Union refused to mention the
continent's Christian roots in its new constitution, a decision both
John Paul and Ratzinger publicly criticized.
</P>
<P>
Ratzinger's papacy could differ from John Paul's in some important
ways.
</P>
<P>
He is likely to spend more time at the Vatican, whipping the Curia,
or Vatican bureaucracy, into line with his goals of a more rigorously
indoctrinated clergy, an improvement of the liturgy and a renewal of
missionary work. Like most conservatives, he is averse to big
government and might streamline the church's central apparatus.
</P>
<P>
And while the late pope championed outreach to leaders of other
faiths, Ratzinger has said it is of utmost importance to maintain
Catholicism as a superior religion.
</P>
<P>
In the 2000 document ``Dominus Iesus'' (Lord Jesus), Ratzinger
asserted Catholic primacy and branded other faiths, including
Christian denominations, as deficient. The document incurred the wrath
of Protestants, Anglicans, Jews and others. Ratzinger dismissed the
protests as insignificant, further angering his critics.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ratzinger said Turkey should not be allowed to join the
European Union because, as a predominantly Muslim country, it was ``in
permanent conflict'' with Europe.
</P>
<P>
The debate has washed over the church, with many struggling over
whether fundamental differences between the two religions -- whose
believers are in conflict in parts of the world -- can be bridged for
the sake of dialogue and on the basis of shared moral values.
</P>
<P>
Many cardinals from Asia and Africa, where Catholicism is a
minority religion, admired Ratzinger's assertive promotion of the
faith. Although voting was secret, several Vatican watchers speculated
that significant numbers of cardinals from those continents joined
with their conservative peers in Europe to give Ratzinger the majority
he needed.
</P>
<P>
George Weigel, an American biographer of the late pope, said
Ratzinger had won enough support among Third World cardinals to
isolate a progressive bloc from Europe and the United States that had
opposed his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
``Popes don't invent Catholicism anew,'' Weigel said, dismissing
the idea liberal American Catholics inspired by church reforms of the
1960s could sway the new pontiff. ``The Catholic Church isn't going to
alter fundamental points of doctrine and moral teaching. If people
want to keep fighting the battles of 40 years ago, that's their
choice, but the church is moving on.''
