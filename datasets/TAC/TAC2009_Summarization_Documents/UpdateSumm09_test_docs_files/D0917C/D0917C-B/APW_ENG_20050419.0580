Using smoke to announce new pope dates at least to 19th century; confusion came later
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cardinals sequestered in the Sistine Chapel to elect a pope use an iron stove
and its narrow metal chimney to announce their decision. Black smoke means they
have failed; white smoke means they have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
It's unclear when the tradition began, but smoke signals have been used
continuously since at least 1878.
</P>
<P>
There is little record of color confusion until the 1958 conclave, when the damp
straw that the cardinals had added to their burning ballots apparently failed to
catch, and the initial smoke was white.
</P>
<P>
There was some confusion Monday when the first wisps of smoke appeared white to
some observers. But it quickly became clear that it was black.
</P>
<P>
The Vatican said after Pope John Paul II's death that special chemicals would be
added to help avoid confusion.
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Piero Marini, master of ceremonies for liturgical celebrations, also
has said when a new pope is chosen, the Vatican will ring the bells of St.
Peter's Basilica, in addition to burning the ballots, "to make the election of
the pope clearer."
</P>
<P>
But when the bells rang Tuesday and black smoke poured from the chimney, people
in St. Peter's Square were further confused. It soon became clear that the bells
were simply tolling because it was noon.
</P>
<P>
In past centuries, conclaves were often held in the town where the last pope
died, leaving the cardinals to come up with a means of communication on the
spot. They sometimes rang bells to signal a successful election.
</P>
<P>
Smoke was a logical choice because church tradition calls for the cardinals to
burn their ballots after each vote to maintain secrecy about the
conclave.
