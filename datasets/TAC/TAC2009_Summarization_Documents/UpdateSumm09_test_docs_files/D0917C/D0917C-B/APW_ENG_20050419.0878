What happens after cardinals elect a new pope?

<TEXT>
Once cardinals choose a leader for the church, the new pope is swept into a
tradition-steeped ritual _ formally accepting his mission, donning white papal
vestments and greeting the crowds from a balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square.
The chain of traditional events:
   ___
   THE ACCEPTANCE
   _ After the vote, cardinals burst into applause for the new pope. As dean of the
College of Cardinals, Germany's Joseph Ratzinger was designated to ask if the
man chosen accepts, but since the cardinal chosen was Ratzinger, it was not
immediately clear who posed the question. A decree by John Paul II urged the
winner not to refuse the office "for fear of its weight.") The pontiff then
responds "accepto" _ Latin for "I accept."
   ___
   THE NAMING
   _The pope is asked to announce a papal name. He is free to pick from any of his
264 predecessors, use his own first name or come up with something new.
Ratzinger's choice of Benedict XVI will be closely scrutinized for clues about
the future tone of his papacy. At some point, cardinals kneel before the pope to
honor him.
   ___
   THE DONNING OF PAPAL VESTMENTS
   _The pontiff is led out of the Sistine Chapel to a dressing chamber nicknamed
the "Room of Tears," because some popes have been overcome by emotion there. He
is offered a choice of vestments _ small, medium and large _ that have been
hand-sewed by Rome tailors. Vatican nuns will make possible adjustments.

   THE ANNOUNCEMENT
   _When the pope was ready, the protodeacon _ Chilean Cardinal Jorge Arturo Medina
Estevez _ stepped onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica overlooking
St. Peter's Square and proclaims, "Habemus papam!" _ "We have a pope!" Medina
then announced the pope's name, reading his first name out in Latin and his
family name in its normal form. The new pontiff stepped out on the balcony and
raised his hands, clasped together. Afterward, the pope might ask the cardinals
to return to the conclave and share a meal. John Paul II did, and even passed
around glasses of champagne.
