Cardinals Elect Ratzinger as Pope

<DATELINE>
VATICAN CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph Ratzinger, a renowned theologian and
provocative hard-line enforcer of Catholic Church doctrine for the
past two decades, was chosen Tuesday to succeed his friend and close
ally Pope John Paul II. Ratzinger, 78, became Pope Benedict XVI, the
265th leader of the world's largest and most powerful Christian
institution.
</P>
<P>
The swift election of the German-born Ratzinger was a vote for
continuity of John Paul's policies, signaling an endorsement of the
church's most conservative teachings.
</P>
<P>
The new pope will lead a church in crisis, strongly divided after
John Paul's 26-year reign and in sore need of healing. Despite John
Paul's personal magnetism, many of the church's 1 billion members are
disaffected. The faith is losing ground in many parts of the world to
other religions and is under threat from radical Islam and secularism.
</P>
<P>
Minutes after his name was read out to crowds in St. Peter's
Square, Ratzinger stepped onto a balcony overlooking the multitude and
described himself as ``a simple, humble worker in the vineyard of the
Lord.''
</P>
<P>
``The fact that the Lord can work and act even with insufficient
means consoles me,'' said the new pope, dressed in flowing white robes
and the scarlet papal cape and golden stole, ``and above all I entrust
myself to your prayers.''
</P>
<P>
Meeting secretly for less than 24 hours, Roman Catholic cardinals
locked inside the Sistine Chapel elected Ratzinger on the fourth
ballot, then burned the papers on which each had disguised his
handwriting and penned a name.
</P>
<P>
White smoke puffed from a chimney on top of the chapel, signaling
to the world that one man had received at least 77 votes, the required
two-thirds majority for victory.
</P>
<P>
Details were emerging on how the cardinals made their decision.
While many observers had suggested Ratzinger was too polarizing a
figure at this critical juncture in church history, several cardinals
appeared to have fallen into line behind the image of a strong leader
who represented unambiguous moral authority.
</P>
<P>
On the morning of his election, Ratzinger had breakfast with four
cardinals from Asia and Africa. He knew them all by name and spoke to
them in shared languages, according to Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los
Angeles, who was present.
</P>
<P>
Ratzinger's tough-minded advocacy of Christian identity and the
primacy of Catholicism might have appealed to cardinals in parts of
the developing world where holders of the faith are under attack and
at war with militant Islam or totalitarian regimes.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Ratzinger has silenced dissent within the church
and labeled other faiths ``deficient.'' At the same time, Ratzinger,
who grew up in Hitler's Germany, often is described by admirers as
humble and kind. Everyone agrees on his acute intellectual prowess.
</P>
<P>
George Weigel, one of John Paul's biographers, praised the
decision.
</P>
<P>
``The cardinals chose the best known and most respected of their
number, a man they each know as a great listener and a sympathetic
listener,'' Weigel said. ``This was not only a tremendous affirmation
of the past (26 and a half) years; it was a vote of confidence in
Joseph Ratzinger as the man best fitted to give an evangelical thrust
to this papacy, a new dynamism in the first decade of the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
A subdued Belgian Cardinal Gottfried Danneels, possibly the most
progressive member of the college, said he hoped Ratzinger's taking of
the name Benedict signaled a shift in the German prelate's focus.
</P>
<P>
``Cardinal Ratzinger remains and will continue to remain the same
person,'' he told a group of reporters Tuesday night. ``But for the
moment he is universal pastor of the church. He is not anymore the
head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. ... When you
are a pope, you have to be the pastor of everyone and everything which
happens in the church.''
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the election of the oldest pope in two centuries was
mixed, both in a St. Peter's Square packed with people eager to hear
the news and around the world.
</P>
<P>
``It is obvious that in today's world with its multitude of
opinions, not everyone, even in our own church, could and wanted to
follow him,'' acknowledged Cardinal Karl Lehmann, also of Germany.
``But his theological work was always respected, even by people with
differing opinions.''
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Since John Paul died April 2 at age 84, Catholics everywhere had
waited expectantly to learn who would assume the throne of St. Peter.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the new pope was dramatic. White smoke,
indicating a successful election, puffed from a skinny chimney atop
the Sistine Chapel at 5:50 p.m., and many onlookers started to cheer.
But the great bell of St. Peter's, which the Vatican had said would
ring to coincide with the white smoke, remained still.
</P>
<P>
Finally, after about five minutes of suspense, the bell began to
toll. Applause and chants of ``Viva il Papa'' rang out. People from
across Rome converged on St. Peter's Square, running through streets
and bridges over the Tiber River to join the swelling crowd.
</P>
<P>
After about half an hour, Chilean Cardinal Jorge Arturo Medina
Estevez, the senior deacon, emerged from behind crimson velvet
draperies onto the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
In five languages, he greeted ``brothers and sisters'' and then
announced in Latin: ``Habemus papum.'' ``We have a pope.''
</P>
<P>
With a flourish he announced the first name, in Latin, Josephum,
followed by a pause for dramatic effect. And then: Sanctae Romanae
Ecclesiae Cardinalem Ratzinger.
</P>
<P>
The new pope appeared on the balcony, dressed in the papal
vestments.
