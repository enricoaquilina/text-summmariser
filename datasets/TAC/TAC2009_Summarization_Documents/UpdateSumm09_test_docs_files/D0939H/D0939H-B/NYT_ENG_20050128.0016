SUSPECT IN TRAIN CRASH NOT DERANGED, D.A. SAYS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles -- The man suspected of causing the deadliest U.S.
train wreck in six years was charged with murder Thursday
as the district attorney contradicted police and suggested the crash
may have been a calculated act, not the work of
someone insane or suicidal.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old suspect, Juan Manuel Alvarez, was expected to be arraigned
today on 11 counts of murder with special circumstances, meaning
he would be eligible for the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez has been in custody since Wednesday morning after, according to
police, he drove his Jeep Cherokee SUV onto railroad tracks
in Glendale shortly before 6 a.m. and then ran from
the vehicle as a Metrolink commuter train bore down in
the early-morning darkness.
</P>
<P>
The impact caused a chain of collisions and derailments involving a
freight locomotive and another Metrolink train traveling in the opposite
direction, killing 11 people and injuring nearly 200 others.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney, Steve Cooley, said Thursday that
he had deep doubts about comments by some law enforcement
officials that Alvarez was deranged or insane. He criticized the
police statements and suggested that Alvarez may have calculated his
actions to send a message, perhaps to his estranged wife.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing about the facts leads us to this conclusion to suggest
insanity, in spite of some people using those terms," Cooley
said. "They're using the terms in a very loose way.
They're probably uninformed about all the details of this case."
</P>
<P>
Details will emerge soon, Cooley said, "that will shed more light
on what was going on in his head, as to
what his intentions were."
</P>
<P>
Cooley said that a " few things are under investigation that
don't suggest" Alvarez was acting in an insane manner and
that his acts might have had a design, which Cooley
declined to describe in detail.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams called Alvarez suicidal and
"deranged," saying that he had slashed his wrists and chest,
then parked on the tracks. Adams said Alvarez apparently lost
his nerve and fled his vehicle shortly before it was
rammed by the train. He was detained shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors filed 10 counts of murder against Alvarez on Thursday and
then said they would add an additional charge to account
for an eleventh body discovered later in the wreckage. The
charges allege special circumstances, which means that Alvarez would be
eligible for the death penalty or life in prison without
parole if convicted. It could be months before prosecutors decide
what sentence to seek, Cooley said.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Eric Chase, a criminal lawyer who has commented on high-profile
cases such as the Scott Peterson murder trial for television
shows and newspapers, said Thursday he would represent Alvarez. He
declined further comment other than to say his client would
probably appear in court today.
</P>
<P>
Because of his medical condition, Alvarez was not able to attend
an arraignment that had been scheduled for Thursday afternoon, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Tom Lorenz, a spokesman for the Glendale Police Department, said
that it now appeared that Alvarez, who was in stable
condition in a hospital jail ward, had not slashed his
wrists, as originally reported by investigators. He has non-life-threatening stab
wounds to his upper torso, Lorenz said, and it is
not certain the wounds were self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
"That is still under investigation," Lorenz said.
</P>
<P>
As the questions emerged over what motivated Alvarez, new details were
disclosed about his troubled personal life.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez' estranged wife, Carmelita Alvarez, obtained a restraining order against him
in December after filing court papers saying her husband had
a serious drug problem, was hallucinating and claiming falsely that
she had lovers.
</P>
<P>
She also alleged that he had threatened to abduct their 31/2-year-
old son, Isaac. And she said he had threatened to
kill her brother, Ruben Ochoa, who Alvarez claimed had introduced
her to a lover.
</P>
<P>
Her assertions were not contested by her husband, so his own
side the story was not provided in the 31 pages
of documents, and her descriptions of the problems were terse.
</P>
<P>
Carmelita Alvarez, who said her husband was unemployed, alleged that at
one point the talked of buying a gun. She described
herself as emotionally traumatized, although she said he had caused
no physical injuries and that she had not called the
police despite a string of traumatizing encounters.
</P>
<P>
The wreck was the worst U.S. rail tragedy since March 15,
1999 when an Amtrak train hit a truck and derailed,
also killing 11.
