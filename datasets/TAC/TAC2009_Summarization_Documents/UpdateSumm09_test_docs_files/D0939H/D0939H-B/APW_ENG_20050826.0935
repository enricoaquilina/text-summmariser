<P>
Prosecutors have decided to seek the death penalty against the man accused of
causing a collision of two commuter trains, a crash that killed 11 people and
injured nearly 200.
</P>
<P>
Juan Manuel Alvarez, 26, allegedly parked his Jeep on tracks in suburban
Glendale on Jan. 26, then abandoned the vehicle as a Metrolink train approached.
The train crashed into the Jeep and derailed, slamming into an oncoming
train.
</P>
<P>
Glendale police have said that while it initially appeared Alvarez was trying to
commit suicide, the discovery of other evidence, including gasoline doused on
the sport utility vehicle, showed he was trying to cause the
crash.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez has pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of murder and one count of
arson.
</P>
<P>
Eleven members of the Los Angeles County district attorney's capital case
committee agreed this week to use a rarely used "train wrecking" statute as one
of the special circumstance allegations against Alvarez, spokeswoman Jane
Robison said Friday.
</P>
<P>
She declined to discuss what led the committee to seek the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
"We don't comment on any proceedings at the committee meetings," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez's defense attorney, Eric Chase, did not immediately return a telephone
message requesting comments.
