Intentions Key to Train Case

GLENDALE, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It had not been a perfect marriage, but at times
it had been a good one. Juan Manuel Alvarez met Carmelita Ochoa when
they were teen-agers, when they were members of a community dance
group. She was pregnant with another man's child. He said he didn't
care. He loved her and her daughter -- their daughter, he called her --
anyway.
</P>
<P>
They dated for two years before Carmelita asked him to marry her.
Their wedding in 2000 was held Nov. 2, Dia de los Muertos -- the day of
the dead, a traditional Mexican holiday. They had a son of their own
and moved to a small, tidy house owned by Carmelita's parents on a
quiet street in Compton. Alvarez worked construction jobs to support
his family. ``He was very good to me,'' his wife remembers.
</P>
<P>
But a year ago, something in Juan began to change. He'd hurt his
left arm on a job and couldn't work. He stayed home with the children
while Carmelita worked as a waitress. He was depressed, Carmelita
thought. He began to slip away, she said, taking drugs, talking crazy.
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, his behavior became so erratic and threatening
that she threw him out of their house. She got a restraining order
that prevented him from seeing his 6-year-old stepdaughter and
3-year-old son. As she told a court in her oft-misspelled petition,
``Juan Alvarez has been using drugs for a very long time, and has
started halusinating. He accusses me of being with other people, or
recording us or him in our bedroom with hidden cameras. He also
accusses me of doing porn videos with different people. He has
treatened me and says that my family members have introdused me to a
boyfriend, wich is made up by him. He has treatened to kill this
person that dosn't exist, and to my family members that he thinks has
introduced me. He has treatened to do anything if I don't let him see
our kids.''
</P>
<P>
Was Juan Alvarez delusional, or diabolical? Did he intend to kill
only himself or many others? In the aftermath of an enormous tragedy,
justice will hinge on the answers.
</P>
<P>
Waiting on the Tracks
</P>
<P>
A light rain fell in the predawn dark on the morning of Jan. 26 as
Juan Alvarez drove his green Jeep Cherokee through Atwater Village, a
neighborhood straddling the Los Angeles-Glendale line near Griffith
Park. At the railroad crossing on Chevy Chase Drive, police say, he
turned sharply and drove along the tracks, stopping parallel to a
giant Costco store. At that point, he allegedly turned the vehicle so
that its engine block was positioned across the tracks. Then, police
say, he waited.
</P>
<P>
From the north, a commuter train filled with people on their way to
work downtown bore down on the Jeep.
</P>
<P>
Pushed from the rear by a locomotive, the train's lead car smashed
into Alvarez's vehicle and drove it down the track. First came the
boom of the collision, then a scraping, groaning, metallic rumble as
the first of the passenger cars derailed, turned on its side and slid
along the gravel. Then came a second collision, this one as the front
car plowed into a Union Pacific freight car parked on a siding. The
impact knocked the 50-ton Union Pacific car on its side.
</P>
<P>
The commuter train, Metrolink No. 100, came to rest in a ragged,
jackknifed position, its cars splayed across two sets of tracks. The
metal exterior of the first car had been sheared open like a can
hacked with a claw hammer.
</P>
<P>
Now a second commuter train entered the chaos. In a freakish bit of
timing, Metrolink No. 901 came chugging toward the scene from the
south just as the first chain-reaction collisions began. The
jackknifed section of No. 100 clipped No. 901's second car as it
rolled past. This impact derailed 901's rear two cars. Inside 901's
second car, John Phipps, who had been dozing, was thrown violently
forward. He hit something hard, which tore a gash in his head and
slammed him into unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
For a few moments, an eerie silence settled over the scene. The
mist fell on the crumpled cars and the people trapped and hurting
within.
</P>
<P>
Then the cries of pain and shouts for help began.
</P>
<P>
The chain-reaction crash of the Metrolink trains killed 11 people
and injured 180. It was the worst train wreck of any kind in America
in six years, and one of the deadliest ever intentionally caused.
</P>
<P>
The dead included office workers, government administrators, a
stock clerk and a cop. Julia Bennett, 44, was a clerk-typist with the
Los Angeles Fire Department whose father and grandfather had been
firefighters. Manuel D. Alcala, who was 51, was a maintenance worker
at the county jail. A conductor on No. 100, Thomas M. Ormiston, was
58, two years away from retirement after a career with Southern
Pacific, Amtrak and Metrolink.
</P>
<P>
Scott McKeown, 42, a telecommunications manager for the city of
Pasadena, was a train buff who belonged to a local model-railroad club
and collected train whistles. According to news accounts of the crash,
one of the victims profusely thanked the people, including workers
from the Costco store, who rushed to the scene to pull him from the
train. Police later identified that victim as McKeown.
</P>
<P>
For law enforcement officials, the crash was both horrifying and
personal. Among those killed was James Tutino, a 47-year-old Los
Angeles County sheriff's deputy and father of four who was on his way
to work at the Men's Central Jail.
</P>
<P>
For a while, as he lay pinned in the wreckage, Phipps thought he
would die, too. And so, in pain and isolation, he wrote one brief
thought with the only instrument handy: the blood of his wounds. ``I
(heart) my kids,'' he scrawled on the back of a seat. ``I (heart)
Leslie,'' his wife's name.
</P>
<P>
Juan Alvarez almost certainly would have died in the crash, too,
had he stayed in the Jeep. But he did not. Moments before the train
struck, according to Glendale police investigators, Alvarez scrambled
out of the front seat and walked back to Chevy Chase Drive. From
there, he allegedly watched the ghastly scene unfold.
</P>
<P>
At some point, perhaps before the crash, possibly after, Alvarez
found a pair of scissors and slashed his arms and chest. He walked
back to his apartment a few blocks away, covered in blood. Alarmed by
his injuries, his landlady called paramedics, who grew suspicious and
summoned police. Alvarez was arrested as he was being treated.The
first reports said Alvarez wanted to end his life on the tracks that
morning but thought better of it and fled. Glendale Police Chief Randy
Adams called Alvarez ``deranged (and) suicidal'' at a news conference
after the crash. Authorities placed Alvarez on round-the-clock watch
in his cell.
</P>
<P>
And that is the version of the wreck that Juan Alvarez's family
still believes.
</P>
<P>
``He was there, and out of nowhere he basically saw a light,'' says
Carmelita Alvarez, who has visited her husband in jail. ``Not the
light from the train. He said he felt like there was a presence from
God telling him to get away.''
</P>
<P>
Sitting next to her, Beto Alvarez, Juan's cousin, adds, ``It was
telling him to get out. ... He felt like somebody physically pulled
him away.''
</P>
<P>
Carmelita: ``He tried to move the car. But his car had a lot of
mechanical problems. It got caught and wouldn't move.''
</P>
<P>
But investigators now think differently.
</P>
<P>
Days after the crash, forensic tests revealed a dramatic new piece
of evidence: the presence of gasoline on the inside and outside of
Alvarez's crushed Jeep Cherokee. Glendale police, who are leading the
investigation, say they have witnesses who saw Alvarez douse the car
with gas. They also say they have statements from Alvarez admitting as
much.
</P>
<P>
This sheds a new light on the original suicide theory. Alvarez
wasn't trying to kill himself, says Sgt. Tom Lorenz, a police
spokesman. ``He may have thought about committing suicide, but his
actions are not consistent with that,'' he said. ``When you're
contemplating suicide, would you light yourself on fire? How many
people kill themselves that way? Why not lie down on the tracks? Why
would you walk away and watch the train hit your car?''
</P>
<P>
The self-inflicted wounds on Alvarez's arms and chest, he said,
``weren't life-threatening.''
</P>
<P>
Police now think Alvarez's intention was to derail the train in the
most spectacular fashion possible. The motive wasn't necessarily
murder, says Lorenz, but mayhem.
</P>
<P>
And to what possible end?
</P>
<P>
Lorenz has a ready answer: ``He was trying to gain the attention of
his wife. He wanted her back.''
</P>
<P>
Suicide Attempt
</P>
<P>
Looking back on it now, Juan Alvarez's relatives say they could see
early signs of his clouded mind.
