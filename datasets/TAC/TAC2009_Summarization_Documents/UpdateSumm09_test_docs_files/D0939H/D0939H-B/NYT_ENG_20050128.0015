CRITICS LINK PUSHED TRAIN TO CRASH CASUALTIES
</HEADLINE>

Wednesday's deadly train derailment in Glendale has renewed concerns of train
engineers and safety experts that it is unsafe for locomotives
to push rather than pull train cars along a track,
leaving passengers in lighter-weight "cab cars" most exposed in the
event of a crash.
</P>
<P>
That was the case Wednesday when a Metrolink train smashed into
a Jeep Cherokee, with the train being led by a
57-ton cab car and powered from behind by a locomotive
more than twice as heavy.
</P>
<P>
"If a locomotive had hit that Jeep Cherokee, it wouldn't have
derailed and hit another train, and you wouldn't have 11
people dead," said Bob Tucker, a railroad industry consultant in
Amarillo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
Tim Smith, California state chairman of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers
and Trainmen, said the union has been complaining about the
practice for years.
</P>
<P>
"We feel our engineers (in cab cars) are very vulnerable to
injury and death, and so are the passengers who sit
right behind them. Cab cars tend to run into things
and over things and derail, where locomotives tend to shove
things off the track," said Smith, who said the union's
warnings have gone unheeded.
</P>
<P>
That's because regulators and passenger rail lines, including Amtrak and Caltrain
in the Bay Area, believe the practice is safe.
</P>
<P>
"There's no strong or clear evidence that indicates one method of
operation is less safe than another," said Steve Kulm, spokesman
for the Federal Railroad Administration, which issued passenger rail safety
standards in 1999. The cab cars in the Metrolink crash
were manufactured in 1993, before the regulations took effect.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Railroad Administration does not keep statistics comparing injuries and
deaths in collisions in trains led by cab-cars versus those
led by locomotives.
</P>
<P>
But a 1996 administration study looking at the impact of a
head-on crash between a locomotive and cab car found that
above 35 mph, occupants in the cab car likely would
suffer severe injury or fatality.
</P>
<P>
The study also noted the concern that "occupants of the relatively
exposed cab car, including the engineer, are vulnerable to serious
injury or fatality in the event of a collision with
either a road vehicle at a grade crossing or with
another train."
</P>
<P>
Still, the configuration is commonplace for commuter rail lines, and has
been in use since the 1950s because it allows trains
to zip back and forth between destinations without using the
time and space it takes to turn the locomotive around
or the expense of running a locomotive at both the
front and back of the train.
</P>
<P>
With the locomotive in back, the engineer controls the train from
the cab car, a modified passenger car.
</P>
<P>
Caltrain spokeswoman Jayme Maltbie Kunz said the railroad has not had
problems with the cab-forward, or "push-pull," configuration.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen no reduction in safety to our passengers operating
in a push-pull configuration," said Maltbie Kunz.
</P>
<P>
She said cab cars struck a Coca Cola truck in 1999
and the vehicle of a suicidal man in October and
neither collision caused a derailment or serious injury to passengers
or engineers. In the case of the soda truck, bottles
and cans flew through the windows of the cab car
and pelted passengers.
</P>
<P>
George Elsmore, head of railroad operations and safety for the California
Public Utilities Commission, agreed that the train's configuration makes little
difference.
</P>
<P>
"The relative safety between the two modes is practically identical on
a crash-worthiness basis," Elsmore said in a Wednesday interview. He
said both cab cars and locomotives have similar federally mandated
crash protection standards and devices mounted on the front to
deflect objects.
</P>
<P>
But that's not enough to assuage the fears of Berkeley resident
Peter Hinckley, an Amtrak engineer for 30 years who conducts
trains from Oakland to Bakersfield and Sacramento. He began operating
in push-pull mode about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised it hasn't happened years ago," he said of a
crash like the one in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
"I have hit heavy equipment, locomotive first," he said. In a
cab car, he said, "we would have been all over
the landscape."
</P>
<P>
Hinckley said Amtrak is aware of the danger but will not
make changes.
</P>
<P>
Amtrak spokeswoman Sarah Swain declined to respond, beyond saying the cab-forward
configuration is "common practice on passenger railroads in general."
