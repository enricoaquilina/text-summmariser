Juan Manuel Alvarez, the suicidal man accused of
killing 11 people and injuring more than 180 when he parked his Jeep
Grand Cherokee in front of a speeding Metrolink train, appeared
bandaged and shackled in court Friday as his lawyer argued that he was
the victim of a ``lynch mob mentality.''
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, 25, who could face the death penalty, has remained heavily
sedated and under suicide watch at County-USC Medical Center since the
accident, according to defense lawyer Eric Chase.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he stood with a bowed head and muttered a quick ``yes
sir'' to court officials when asked if he agreed to postpone his
arraignment until medical and psychological tests could be performed
on him.
</P>
<P>
While Glendale, Calif.'s Police chief has described him as being
``deranged'' and Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley
said his despondence is no excuse of leniency, Chase suggested to
reporters that the severity of the charges against him were being
driven by emotion.
</P>
<P>
``I'm sensing a mentality out there that I almost want to call a
lynch mob mentality. But I'm hoping that that calms down,'' Chase
said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charged that Alvarez intended to commit suicide but
chickened out as a southbound Metrolink train bore down on him. He
tried to drive away, but the vehicle was stuck, and he leapt to safety
seconds before the train struck. The train derailed, and hit another
Metrolink train and an idle freight train. The charges include special
circumstance accusations of train wrecking and multiple murder, which
could bring the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, railroad crews worked throughout the rainy day and night
Friday, removing mangled train cars and pounding temporary rails into
place at the sight of the derailment. .
</P>
<P>
``We want to have it up and running Saturday morning for freight
service and Monday morning for regular service,'' said Mike McGinley,
Metrolink's director of engineering.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen of the njured passengersremained hospitalized, four in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
At Glendale Adventist Hospital, Louis McAleer, 39, was recovering
from knee and ankle injuries. An electrical supervisor for the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the 39-year-old McAleer said he
was in the lead car of the train that struck the SUV abandoned on the
tracks. McAleer was hurled about the car as it slewed off the tracks
and struck two other trains.
</P>
<P>
He said he often had imagined what it would be like if his train
derailed, but his imagination never came close to the reality.
</P>
<P>
``It was so much worse,'' McAleer said. ``The abruptness, the
sounds, the smells the quick impact. I'm lucky to be alive.''
</P>
<P>
McAleer said he has strong feelings about Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
``He should have just stayed on the tracks without his truck,''
McAleer said. ``That would have fixed everything. I have no remorse
for him. What he did is just wrong. Leaving a car on the tracks so
that it derails a passenger train is just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
On Thursday and Friday, two dozen Metrolink employees and about 60
contractors removed debris from twisted and damaged railway tracks and
hoisted derailed train cars onto the tracks for removal. One of the
cars was hauled away by flatbed truck and stored as evidence for the
Glendale Police Department.
</P>
<P>
Crews also were working to tear up damaged rails and replace them
with temporary ones. About 400 feet of rail will be replaced and
packed into place with gravel. Until longer, permanent rails are
re-installed a month from now, trains will have to slow to 35 mph at
the site. With permanent rails, trains can travel up to 70 mph.
Workers also must repair a signal bridge.
</P>
<P>
While the tracks are owned by the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority and maintained by Metrolink, Union Pacific uses them as
well.
</P>
<P>
``The Union Pacific runs a fair amount of trains on this line, and
there is not an alternate route,'' Pederson said.
