SUSPECT IN LOS ANGELES TRAIN WRECK WASN'T SUICIDAL, POLICE SAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The authorities now believe that the man who
parked his truck on a rail line last month intended
to cause the deadly train wreck that resulted and was
not suicidal, as they had initially surmised.
</P>
<P>
The police in Glendale, the Los Angeles suburb where the wreck
occurred on Jan. 26, said this week that the man,
Juan M. Alvarez believed he would get his estranged wife's
attention by causing a catastrophic accident.
</P>
<P>
Eleven people died and 180 were injured after Alvarez, 25, abandoned
his Jeep Cherokee on railroad tracks during the morning rush
hour. The vehicle was hit by a Metrolink commuter train
headed for downtown Los Angeles. The train derailed and sideswiped
another train.
</P>
<P>
The authorities said at the time that Alvarez, despondent over familial
discord, had been planning to commit suicide, but that he
had lost his nerve and ran from his Jeep as
he saw the train approach.
</P>
<P>
After investigating the case further, however, the Glendale police chief, Randy
Adams, said that Alvarez fully intended to cause a major
accident, and that taking his own life was not part
of the plan.
</P>
<P>
"Although first impressions led us to believe Mr. Alvarez was attempting
to commit suicide, the investigation has revealed that his actions
are not consistent with that of an individual who is
attempting to follow through with that act," Adams said.
</P>
<P>
"Although Mr. Alvarez may have contemplated suicide, his actions were deliberate
with the intent of causing a horrific tragedy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Adams said Alvarez had poured gasoline on the Cherokee, apparently with
the intention of seeing it go up in a ball
of fire.
</P>
<P>
The lead detective on the case, Lt. Jon Perkins, told reporters
that Alvarez had been asked what he thought would occur
when a train collided with a vehicle in that situation.
</P>
<P>
"He basically stated that he thought there would be an explosion,"
Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that Alvarez sought to gain notice from his wife,
Carmelita, who had obtained a restraining order against him.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the accident, Alvarez described her husband as an insecure
man who believed himself incapable of providing for his family.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez's lawyer, Eric A. Chase, said in an interview Friday that
the Glendale police were "trying to poison the jury pool"
by accusing Alvarez of deliberately causing the wreck.
</P>
<P>
Chase, who insisted that his client was suicidal, also disputed the
police chief's assertion that Alvarez poured gasoline on the Jeep.
</P>
<P>
"He poured the gasoline on himself," Chase said. "The police found
gasoline-soaked clothing at his home."
</P>
<P>
Chase said his client expected "that the train would blow through
the car," and had no idea that the train --
which was being pushed by a locomotive engine, not pulled
-- would leave the tracks.
</P>
<P>
"How was he supposed to know that the train was in
this funky configuration?" Chase asked.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office, Chase said that the
statements by the Glendale police were "not only vicious and
callous but are a reckless distortion of the facts."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Alvarez, who is being held without bail, pleaded
not guilty to 11 counts of murder. His next court
appearance will be at preliminary hearing on March 16, when
a judge will consider if there is enough evidence to
send him to trial.
