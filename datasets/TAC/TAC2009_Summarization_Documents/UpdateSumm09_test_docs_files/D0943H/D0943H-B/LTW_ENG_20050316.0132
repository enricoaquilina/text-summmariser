Canadaian Judge Acquits Pair in Air India Bombing

<P>
A judge here acquitted two Canadian Sikhs on
Wednesday of engineering a plan to put bombs on Air India flights 20
years ago, leaving unanswered who was responsible for Canada's worst
mass killing and the largest act of air terrorism before Sept. 11,
2001.
</P>
<P>
Ending a four-year case, the judge found that the assortment of
former girlfriends, paid informers and fallen-out business partners
central to the prosecution were not credible enough to convict a
millionaire Vancouver businessman and a Sikh activist of murder. His
finding shocked family members of the victims.
</P>
<P>
``We are devastated that the true perpetrators of this crime are
free today,'' said Ed Madon, who was 8 when his father died aboard the
Air India plane brought down in 1985 over the Atlantic Ocean. ``The
Canadian justice system has failed us.''
</P>
<P>
The verdict was a blow to government efforts to counter allegations
that imported political passions simmering within the country's many
immigrant communities could be a source of terrorism. Prosecutors
asserted that angry Sikhs in British Columbia planted the bombs to
retaliate against the Indian government's attack on a Sikh temple in
Punjab in 1984.
</P>
<P>
One bomb brought down an Air India Boeing 747, killing all 329
aboard as it neared the coast of Ireland on June 23, 1985. The second
exploded luggage being transferred to an Air India flight at Tokyo's
airport, killing two baggage handlers. In both cases, the bags were
loaded onto flights out of Canada that connected to Air India flights.
</P>
<P>
After years of what victims' families called official neglect,
authorities belatedly mounted the most complex and costly
investigation in the country's history. But it failed to crack the
secrecy among the immigrant community. Provincial court Justice Ian
Bruce Josephson upheld much of the government's theory of the crimes
but ruled that investigators had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt
who carried them out.
</P>
<P>
``We are very disappointed today,'' said Sgt. John Ward of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police. But he said, ``We are still
investigating this matter. We will not stop.''
</P>
<P>
Family members said that because of the inconclusive verdict, a
public inquiry is now needed as to who carried out the terrorist acts
and how the fledgling Canadian Security Intelligence Service failed to
pursue the case 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
``Only a public inquiry can investigate the failures of the
system,'' said Susheel Gupta, who was 12 when his mother was killed.
``This was murder, pure and simple. If the murder of 329 people
doesn't deserve a public inquiry, what does?''
</P>
<P>
Investigators had a prime suspect under surveillance before the
bombings. But reports that came out 19 years later showed that they
often lost track of the suspect, ended surveillance hours before the
bombs were placed, and erased wiretapped conversations that could have
led to earlier arrests.
</P>
<P>
``This sends the message that someone can come into Canada, set
bombs on planes and kill people, and get away with it,'' said Dave
Hayer, a provincial legislator. His father, a Canadian Sikh journalist
who condemned the bombings, was assassinated in 1998, reportedly by
Sikh radicals.
</P>
<P>
The bombings were a chilling harbinger of the terrorist attacks on
the World Trade Center and Pentagon. In Canada, they provoked similar
surprise that foreign conflicts could bring violence to distant,
relatively secure countries, and similar postmortem findings that
investigators had missed warnings and clues before the attacks.
</P>
<P>
``It should have been a wake-up call,'' said Reg Whitaker, a
political scientist at the University of Victoria. The Air India
bombings were among the first to feature the kinds of threats from
small, shadowy radical groups that now face the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
``In the 1980s, the world was still in the Cold War. We were still
looking for Russian networks,'' he said. ``Terrorism was not
identified as it is now, in terms of an attack on the homeland that
could reach into the lives of everyday people.''
</P>
<P>
The case against the two accused, a millionaire businessman named
Ripudaman Singh Malik and a preacher and sawmill worker, Ajaib Singh
Bagri, took years to build. In part this was because of official
fumbling that the Toronto Globe and Mail newspaper later called
``staggering.''
</P>
<P>
The two men were associates of Talwinder Singh Parmar, a Sikh who
authorities said led a militant group from his home in Burnaby, B.C.
After India's raid on the Sikhs' holy Golden Temple, the Canadian
Security Intelligence Service suspected that Parmar had been involved
in a plot to kill Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. They put Parmar
under surveillance but repeatedly lost him.
</P>
<P>
``Anyone in the back seat of a car wearing a beard and turban looks
like the next guy,'' a CSIS agent said in a report that was made
public last year. Agents tailed the wrong cars, and residents called
police to complain about not-so-secret spies loitering near Parmar's
house. As agents argued with one neighbor, their suspect drove away
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
Family members said Wednesday that those lapses must now be
investigated.
</P>
<P>
``The Canadian justice system has mocked all of us,'' said John
Chatlani, whose mother died in the bombing over the Atlantic.
``Someone needs to be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
Parmar, who Josephson said was the probable mastermind of the plot,
returned to India and was killed in 1992 in what police there said was
a confrontation with authorities. The charges against Malik and Bagri
were largely based on comments they allegedly made in the years after
the bombings.
</P>
<P>
A third man, Inderjit Singh Reyat, was sentenced to 10 years in
1991 for buying materials for the Tokyo bomb and five years in 2003
for his role in the bombmaking that brought down Air India Flight 182
off the coast of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Gaul, a prosecution spokesman, said government lawyers
would see whether there were grounds to appeal Josephson's ruling.
