<P>
The verdict in the Air India bombing 
trial in Canada, is unfair but has come too late to matter, some 
relatives in India of victims of the 1985 bombing said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It's been 20 years now and the world had forgotten the 
bombing," said Muktaben Bhat, 70-year-old mother of Bombay 
businessman and theatre actor Parag Bhat who was killed in the blast 
along with his wife Chand and six-month-old son Siddhant.
</P>
<P>
"The verdict has come too late, but I am shocked as it is 
unfair," she told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Bhat, who had attended some of the hearings of the trial in 
Vancouver in 2003, said she was convinced the two accused were 
guilty of the crime and the "not guilty" verdict had stunned her.
</P>
<P>
Her daughter Manjiri was in the court when the verdict was 
delivered Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There were small instances and a chain of events that linked 
the two accused to the crime. I am shocked and hurt as to how they 
can be let off," said Bhat.
</P>
<P>
"The trial was conducted in a bullet-proof court room and so 
much money was spent on it by the Canadian government. We all knew 
that the two were guilty. Anyway what can we say as a lot of time 
has passed now."
</P>
<P>
Parag was Bhat's only son and his body was not found. 
</P>
<P>
"My son, his wife and their son had gone for a vacation to 
Canada. They never came back. I have no one to succeed my family as 
Parag was the only son I had," said Bhat who lost her husband a few 
years ago after a long illness and now stays alone in suburban 
Bombay.
</P>
<P>
The widow of S.S. Binder, co-pilot of the ill-fated Air India 
Flight 182, also felt the verdict had come too late.
</P>
<P>
"Too much time has passed since the crash," Amarjit Bhinder told 
the Indian Express newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Indian-born Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik saw 
charges against them dismissed after a judge in Vancouver ruled the 
prosecution in a near two-year trial had not proven its case against 
them beyond reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
The pair were cleared of eight charges each of murder and 
conspiracy in the bombing of the plane and a blast less than an hour 
earlier in Tokyo which killed two baggage handlers.
</P>
<P>
The June 23, 1985 attack in which 329 people died represented 
the world's worst aviation terror strike prior to September 11, 
2001.
</P>
<P>
Loud gasps rippled through the courtroom packed with about 70 
relatives and friends of bombing victims as Justice Ian Bruce 
Josephson acquitted first Malik and then Bagri.
</P>
<P>
Sobbing uncontrollably, one woman fled outside, while most of 
the other relatives sat dazed and broke into tears.
</P>
<P>
They had waited nearly 20 years for the verdict, and many had 
travelled to the western Canadian city from India, the United States 
and throughout Canada hoping for convictions.
