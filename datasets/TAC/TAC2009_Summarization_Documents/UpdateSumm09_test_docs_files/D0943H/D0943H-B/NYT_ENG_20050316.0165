CANADIAN COURT ACQUITS TWO IN '85 AIR INDIA BOMBING THAT KILLED 329
</HEADLINE>

VANCOUVER, British Columbia

<P>
Twenty years after a bomb on an
airliner en route from Toronto to New Delhi blew up
off the Irish coast, killing 329 people, a judge on
Wednesday acquitted the two Indian-born Canadian Sikhs charged in the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected end after 19 months of testimony trial leaves the
worst case of mass murder in Canadian history and the
bloodiest attack on civilian air aviation before Sept. 11, 2001,
an unsettled mystery.
</P>
<P>
The decision by a British Columbia Supreme Court judge that the
government had not made a conclusive case after two decades
of investigations costing more than $80 million represented a rebuke
to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canada's federal intelligence
agency.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the physical evidence was lost 7,000 feet below the
ocean. The most credible potential witnesses were either murdered, died
of natural causes, or were apparently intimidated from testifying or
lied on the stand.
</P>
<P>
The few important prosecution witnesses, who testified that they had heard
the defendants confess, were deemed unreliable and biased by Justice
Ian Bruce Josephson.
</P>
<P>
The judge declared that justice would not be achieved "if persons
are convicted on anything less than the requisite standard of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt."
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors left open the possibility of an appeal and the police
said that they stood by their investigation but that the
case remained open. The only person convicted of any role
in the June 23, 1985, explosions has refused to cooperate
and several other people suspected in the plot have never
been charged.
</P>
<P>
The two defendants, Ripudaman Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri, were
proponents of a separate Sikh state, but they denied involvement
in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
All 329 people on board Air India Flight 182, most of
them Canadian Hindus, died in the explosion. Eighty victims were
under 12 years old. Another bomb, in luggage being transferred
between other planes, exploded less than an hour earlier, killing
two baggage handlers at Narita Airport in Tokyo. Josephson said
in his verdict that he was convinced both bombs originated
from flights that had left Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the bombings were part of terrorist actions in retaliation
for the Indian army's 1984 storming of the Golden Temple
in Amritsar, Sikhism's holiest shrine in an effort to capture
armed Sikh separatists inside.
</P>
<P>
The suspected mastermind in the bombings, Talwinder Singh Parmar, was killed
in 1992 while in Indian police custody. Another suspect, Hardial
Singh Johal, was arrested but died of natural causes in
2002.
</P>
<P>
The only person punished for the crimes so far is Inderjit
Singh Reyat, who was convicted in 1991 of making the
Tokyo bomb who was convicted in 2003 for involvement in
the other bombing. His refusal to cooperate with prosecutors was
a setback for them.
</P>
<P>
The trial had a Rip Van Winkle feel to it. Over
the past two years, 115 witnesses described scenes and events
that tested their memories and recalled a time when airline
security was remarkably lax.
