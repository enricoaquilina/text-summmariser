</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 20 years after their loved ones died in the worst terror
strike prior to the September 11 attacks, relatives of 329 people
killed in an Air India jet bombing are at last in sight of justice.
</P>
<P>
Two orthodox Sikhs will learn in March whether they will be found
guilty of the 1985 outrage. Their trial ended Friday after sapping
millions of dollars from Canadian coffers.
</P>
<P>
Justice Ian Bruce Josephson, who heard the case without a jury, will
rule on March 16.
</P>
<P>
That will be nearly two decades after suitcase bombs, which allegedly
originated in western Canada, killed two baggage handlers in Japan
and 329 passengers on Air India Flight 182 off the Irish coast.
</P>
<P>
Even before the verdict is pronounced, relatives of the 331 victims
are calling for a public inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier calls for an official probe were stymied by the criminal
investigation, and eventual trial of Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripudaman
Singh Malik. The two accused, immigrants from Punjab, were each
charged with eight charges of murder and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
The massive case was the largest and most complex in Canadian
history, with 18 months of pre-trial hearings, numerous related court
hearings and a 19-month trial involving 113 witnesses and millions of
documents.
</P>
<P>
The trial itself took place behind bullet-resistant glass in a
specially-built underground bunker of a courtroom in this west coast
city.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Bagri and Malik were religious Sikh fundamentalists
who used violence to achieve their political goals.
</P>
<P>
Their motive in the bombings, said prosecution spokesman Geoffrey
Gaul, was to avenge India's 1984 attack on the Golden Temple in
Amritsar, and fight for an independent Sikh homeland to be called
Khalistan.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say two suitcase bombs were checked onto planes leaving
Vancouver, connecting with Air India flights to London and Bangkok
and New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
On June 23, 1985, the first bomb killed two baggage handlers at
Japan's Narita airport, as they transferred it to Air India Flight
201. The second exploded 54 minutes later aboard Air India Flight
182, killing all 329 aboard.
</P>
<P>
Defence lawyers maintain their clients are innocent and prosecution
witnesses were either lying or delusional.
</P>
<P>
"The witnesses weren't credible," said Malik's lawyer David Crossin.
"Their case collapsed."
</P>
<P>
So far, only Inderjit Singh Reyat, an immigrant to Canada, has been
punished for the 1985 terrorism. He was convicted in 1991 for
providing materials for the bomb at Tokyo's Narita airport.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, he also pled guilty to manslaughter in the Flight 182
bombing. He is serving two sentences totalling 15 years. The alleged
mastermind of the plot, Tarwinder Singh Parma, died in a 1992 police
shootout in India.
</P>
<P>
With the trial of Bagri and Malik now over, it's past time for an
inquiry into the bombings, said Perviz Madon, whose husband Sam, a
college professor, died aboard Air India on June 23, 1985.
</P>
<P>
"I am so tired, but we need the answers," said Madon.
</P>
<P>
Relatives believe that if the details of the Air India bombings had
emerged immediately, global airline practices would have changed
before the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, in which 270 people died.
</P>
<P>
In both disasters, critics blamed lax airport and airline security.
</P>
<P>
A public inquiry would also investigate how police and intelligence
agents handled the Air India case, which was plagued by infighting
between agencies and the erasure of evidence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two potential witnesses were assassinated even before
charges were laid. Fear of intimidation in Canada's immigrant Sikh
community has led to police protection for several prosecution
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Some observers believe that even though the trial is over, more
details of the case are lurking unseen.
</P>
<P>
"There are more people involved than the two people who are charged,"
said Dave Hayer, an British Columbia provincial legislator.
</P>
<P>
Hayers father, Tara Singh Hayer, publisher of a local Sikh newspaper,
was assassinated in 1998 before he could give evidence involving
Bagri. No one has been charged with the murder.
</P>
<P>
"Many people are not willing to talk, theyre still afraid," Hayer
said.
