Prosecution begins final arguments to conclude Air India bombing
trial in Canada
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prosecution began final arguments Monday in the case of an Air
India jumbo jet bombing that killing 329 people almost 20 years ago,
saying the two men accused in the Canadian trial were guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver millionaire Ripudaman Singh Malik, 57, and Kamloops,
British Columbia mill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, are charged with
multiple counts of conspiracy and first-degree murder in the world's
worst airline terrorism act prior to the September 11, 2001, attacks
on the United States.
</P>
<P>
Air India flight 182, a Boeing 747 named The Emperor Kanishka for the
Indian ruler at the time of Christ, blew up off the Irish coast on
June 23, 1985, killing all aboard. The plane was traveling from
Toronto to India via London.
</P>
<P>
Malik and Bagri, who have been in custody since their arrest in late
2000, are also charged in connection with a blast on the same June
day that killed two baggage handlers at Tokyo's Narita Airport.
</P>
<P>
More than 32 lawyers are working on the case believed to have cost
more than US$80 million (euro64 million) since hearings began in
April 2003. It is being heard in a US$5 million (euro3.9 million)
British Columbia Supreme Court room specifically built for security
precautions.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors believe Malik and Bagri were part of a conspiracy by
British Columbia-based Sikh extremists to take revenge against the
Indian government, which owns Air India planes, for attacking a Sikh
temple in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Prosecution lawyer Robert Wright on Monday opened final arguments
expected to last two weeks, saying the guilt of Bagri and Malik "has
been proven beyond a reasonable doubt."
</P>
<P>
"This is, in our submission, a politically motivated and terrorist
event ... consistent only with a political and religious zealotry,"
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has noted that Bagri reportedly told The World Sikh
Organization in 1984 at Madison Square Garden in New York City:
"Until we kill 50,000 Hindus we will not rest."
</P>
<P>
He proposed the creation of a Sikh homeland called Khalistan and
"spoke of the need for Sikhs to wage a war of independence to exact
revenge against the Indian government", according to documents
released by the court.
</P>
<P>
Bagri has also been accused of inciting people at Sikh temples in
British Columbia and Ontario, and for calling for the death of then
Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi. She was assassinated in 1984.
</P>
<P>
"Who would do something so terrible to kill so many innocent people?
There is no doubt these people were murdered," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's case is largely based on the testimony of three
witnesses who said the defendants had confessed the crimes to them.
</P>
<P>
"These admissions are the ultimate piece of evidence against the
accused," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
The defense has attacked the credibility of these witnesses and
asserted that Malik lacked a motive because he was not interested in
Indian politics.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer David Crossin argued two weeks ago that one witness
was a former disgruntled employee, another was paid $US365,000
(euro285,000) by the government to testify and the third denied
evidence on the stand she had given to investigators years ago.
</P>
<P>
Much of the case, however, hinges on the position of the bomb on
flight 182, which originated in Vancouver. Prosecutors have argued
the bomb was in luggage originating in Vancouver. But Bagri's lawyers
contend the luggage containing the bomb joined the flight in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
"There was a murder plot in which two planes were supposed to explode
simultaneously. The two bombs originated here in the city of
Vancouver," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malik booked and paid for the tickets while Bagri arranged
for bags containing the bombs to be delivered to the airport.
</P>
<P>
Expert prosecution witnesses who testified also worked on the
investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 which blew up
over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
At a secret Vancouver warehouse, salvaged parts of the plane have
been reassembled with other parts fabricated using film footage of
pieces still on the ocean floor.
