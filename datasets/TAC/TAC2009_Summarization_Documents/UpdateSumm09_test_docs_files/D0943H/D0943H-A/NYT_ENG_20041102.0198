BOTCHED TERROR TRIAL CONCLUDES IN CANADA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VANCOUVER, British Columbia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 20 years after an Air India Boeing 747 from Canada exploded in
the air and plunged into waters off the Irish coast, killing all 329
people on board, the trial to finally resolve what happened entered
its climactic phase this week.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 witnesses have testified during nearly two years of
proceedings in the most serious terrorism trial in Canadian history.
A special high-security courtroom was built for the case, at a cost
of $6 million, complete with a prisoner dock encased in bulletproof
glass. Aging relatives of the victims came from as far away as Sri
Lanka to watch from the court gallery.
</P>
<P>
But as prosecutors began their final arguments Monday to convict two
Canadian Sikh activists accused of plotting the bombing, the outcome
of the trial is far from settled because of years of bungled police
work and the unexplained killings of an important witness and
suspect.
</P>
<P>
In addition, key witnesses offered vague and contradictory
recollections, and key evidence is circumstantial. Both defendants --
Ripudaman Singh Malik, a 57-year-old millionaire real estate
entrepreneur, and Ajaib Singh Bagri, a 56-year-old sawmill worker and
Sikh preacher -- pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder
and conspiracy in the bombing of the jet, Air India Flight 182 en
route from Toronto and Montreal to India, on June 23, 1985.
</P>
<P>
The two are also charged with conspiring in an explosion that killed
two baggage handlers at Narita airport outside Tokyo 54 minutes
before Flight 182 went down. Prosecutors said both bombs were placed
on Air India aircraft in Vancouver.

<P>
"This was a murder plot in which two planes were to explode
simultaneously," said Robert H. Wright, the chief prosecutor as he
began to sum up his case. "It is difficult to comprehend how this
would happen. Who would do something so terrible?" Answering his own
question, Wright told the court that only "political and religious
zealotry" could motivate such a crime.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Malik, who has worn a white tunic at the trial,
recruited members of the plot and gave $3,000 to a friend to pick up
tickets for the flight with the ultimate aim of planting the bomb on
Flight 182. Bagri, who wears a dark turban, is accused of taking
luggage with the explosives to the Vancouver airport.
</P>
<P>
Neither Malik nor Bagri chose to testify.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have alleged that Malik and Bagri were motivated to
revenge the 1984 Indian army storming of the Golden Temple of
Amritsar after the holy shrine was taken over by militant Sikhs. That
attack sparked a cascade of violence and revenge killings that
included the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
With no physical evidence or firsthand testimony linking the accused
to the bombing, the outcome of the trial is in doubt. The prosecution
wraps up its case in the next few weeks, and Justice Ian Bruce
Josephson is expected to reach a decision early next year.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has shown a video of Bagri giving an incendiary
speech at a New York Sikh rally in July 1984 in which he said, "We
will not take rest until we kill 50,000 Hindus."
</P>
<P>
But most of the prosecution's case is based on supposed confessions
Malik and Bagri gave to several associates that they deny making.
</P>
<P>
The government has highlighted statements made by a Canadian Security
Intelligence Service agent that a friend of Bagri said he had visited
the night before the bombing to ask to borrow her car to drop off
some bags at the airport. By court order, the woman, like other key
witnesses, cannot be identified. The agent testified that the woman
said that Bagri implied that wrongdoing would be done, but, during
the trial, she said she did not remember making such statements.
Josephson ruled that her prior testimony should be admitted as
evidence after the prosecution argued that witnesses were coming
under pressure from Sikh activists.
</P>
<P>
The key prosecution witness against Malik is a former employee at a
religious school that Malik directed. She testified that he told her
in 1996 and 1997, while they were involved in a strong personal, but
platonic relationship, that he helped organize the conspiracy and
detailed his role in arranging for the purchase and pickup of airline
tickets that were used to check in the baggage with the explosives.
</P>
<P>
The witness said she distanced herself from him after the admissions,
after which she was subjected to threats. She was eventually fired.
Malik's lawyer questioned her credibility as a disgruntled employee.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has also been hampered by the fact that the suspected
main ringleader of the plot, a former Canadian resident, Talwinder
Singh Parmar, was killed by Indian authorities when they caught him
clandestinely crossing from Pakistan in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Tara Singh Hayer, the publisher of a Sikh newspaper in Vancouver,
told police in 1995 that he had overheard Bagri admit to his role in
the attacks. But three years later, Hayer was gunned down outside his
home in a Vancouver suburb.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors were also held back by numerous errors made by
investigators. The Canadian intelligence service withdrew an agent
who had infiltrated Sikh activist ranks only days before the attacks
and erased hours of tape recordings of conversations by several of
the prime suspects intercepted before the plane bombings. They later
said they had not realized the significance of the tapes. Meanwhile,
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police failed to follow up on crucial
evidence for years, apparently because of internal politics.
</P>
<P>
"We feel a deep sense of betrayal on the part of the Canadian
government," said Lata Pada, a 56-year-old choreographer from Toronto
who lost her husband and two daughters on the flight. "Canada has
still not woken up to the reality that global terrorism is still in
our back yard."
