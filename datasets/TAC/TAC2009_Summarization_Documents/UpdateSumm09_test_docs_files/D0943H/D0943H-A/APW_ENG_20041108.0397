Canadian prosecutor says revenge drove 1985 Air India bombings that
killed 331

One of two men accused in the 1985 Air India bombings that claimed
331 lives was driven by ambition and revenge, a prosecutor told a
Canadian court in his closing arguments Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver millionaire Ripudaman Singh Malik, 57, and Kamloops,
British Columbia, mill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, are charged with
multiple counts of conspiracy and first degree murder in the world's
worst airline terrorism act prior to the September 11, 2001, attacks
on the United States.
</P>
<P>
Air India Flight 182, a Boeing 747 on its way from Toronto to India
via London, blew up off the Irish coast on June 23, 1985, killing all
aboard. A second bomb exploded at Tokyo's Narita Airport, killing two
baggage handlers.
</P>
<P>
"It has been shown (Malik) has a powerful and pervasive motive,"
prosecutor Joe Bellows said in British Columbia Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
He told Judge Ian Josephson that the Indian government's 1984 attack
on the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Sikhism's holiest shrine, was a
pivotal event in Malik's desire for revenge. Hundreds died in the
attack.
</P>
<P>
"All Sikhs . . . felt a terrible sacrilege had been committed against
their religion," Bellows said. "They ignited in Malik emotions of
both ambition and revenge," he said. "Malik and his co-conspirators
chose to destroy not one but two Air India planes. The message to be
conveyed was: If we can do this, we can do anything."
</P>
<P>
Bellows said the 1984 assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards was also part of the reaction to the
temple raid.
</P>
<P>
As Bellows spoke, Malik, dressed in traditional Sikh garb, dozed in
the prisoners' box protected by bulletproof glass.
</P>
<P>
Bellows said Malik's praise for convicted bomb-maker Inderjit Singh
Reyat and his financial support for Reyat's family while in prison is
further proof of his involvement in the plot.
</P>
<P>
Bellows said Malik wanted to teach the Indian government a lesson as
Sikhs fought for the creation of an independent Sikh homeland,
Khalistan, in India's Punjab state.
</P>
<P>
Bellows recounted the testimony of one man who said Malik had
approached him to carry an attache case containing a time bomb to
Vancouver's airport.
</P>
<P>
"If a child dies for Sikhism, so what?" Bellows recalled, quoting
from the witness' testimony of what Malik told him. "To Malik, the
death of a child means nothing, the death of 329 people means
nothing. What matters is Khalistan."
</P>
<P>
The witness, whose name is protected by a court ordered publication
ban, said Malik had been asked to approach him for the task by
Talwinder Singh Parmar, the suspected mastermind behind the plot and
a leader of the extremist Babbar Khalsa Sikh separatist group. Parmar
died in a shootout with Indian police in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Bellows showed the court a Canadian intelligence photograph of Malik
outside Parmar's home five days before the bombings.
</P>
<P>
The defense has tried to discredit Malik's alleged confession of his
involvement in the bombings to an intimate female friend whose name
is also protected by the court. She was a disgruntled former employee
motivated by revenge, defense lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
Bellows, however, said the Crown witness was highly credible and that
the case against Malik "is proven on her evidence alone."
</P>
<P>
The woman, who testified that she had a close personal relationship
with Malik, wrote in her diary that he had said: "We had Air India
crash. Nobody, nobody can do anything."
</P>
<P>
Malik and Bagri, who have been in custody since their arrest in late
2000, are also charged with the Narita blast.
</P>
<P>
Bellows was expected to continue his closing arguments on Tuesday,
and the case is likely to go to the judge for a verdict in
mid-December.
</P>
<P>
The defense concluded its case last month. Malik's legal team said
their client is innocent and accused the witnesses against him of
being motivated by a desire for revenge.
</P>
<P>
The case has stretched for 13 months since hearings began in April
2003. More than 32 lawyers are working on the case, which is believed
to have cost more than $US80 million (euro62 million).
