Prosecutor says defendant in Air India bombings that killed 331 had
history of inciting Sikhs
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two fiery speeches delivered to Sikh groups in the early 1980s show
Ajaib Singh Bagri had a motive to plant bombs on Air India jets
killing 331 people, a prosecutor said in closing arguments Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bagri, a 55-year-old mill worker in Kamloops, British Columbia, and
Vancouver millionaire Ripudaman Singh Malik, 57, are charged with
multiple counts of conspiracy and first degree murder in the world's
worst airline terrorism act before the September 11, 2001, attacks in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Air India Flight 182, a Boeing 747 on its way from Toronto to India
via London, blew up off the Irish coast on June 23, 1985, killing all
aboard. A second bomb exploded at Tokyo's Narita Airport, killing two
baggage handlers.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Richard Cairns argued that Bargris was a high-ranking
member of a terrorist group. "Revenge, revenge, revenge. That's what
he wants."
</P>
<P>
Cairns said Bagri gave two speeches calling for retribution for the
1984 raids on India's Golden Temple, Sikhisms holiest shrine. Cairns
also said Bagri made pointed references to Air India, saying the
Indian government used proceeds from the airline to purchase weapons
to use against Sikhs.
</P>
<P>
"Bagri is exhorting the crowd to take revenge on the Indian
government and Hindus," Cairns said. He said that in the speech,
Bagri "identifies his targets and he advocates revenge."
</P>
<P>
The defense has argued that Bagri's speeches amount only to fiery
oratory, and has questioned the credibility of witnesses in the case,
including that the star witness against Bagri, who was paid to
testify by Canadian authorities.
</P>
<P>
That witness, a member of a militant Sikh group whose identity is
protected by the court, said Bagri told him that he was responsible
for the bombings. Bagri allegedly made the comment following a speech
he gave at New York's Madison Square Gardens.
</P>
<P>
"'We have stuff that can blow like, like a (city) block," Cairns
said, repeating the witnesses' testimony of what Bagri told him.
</P>
<P>
The witness, who is not charged with a crime, was paid US$386,000
(euro298,000) to testify. Cairns also noted that another protected
witness testified that Bagri asked her if he could borrow her car to
take some bags to Vancouver International Airport. The bags would be
going on the plane, he would not, the woman testified.
</P>
<P>
A verdict in the trial which began in April 2003 isn't expected until
early 2005.
