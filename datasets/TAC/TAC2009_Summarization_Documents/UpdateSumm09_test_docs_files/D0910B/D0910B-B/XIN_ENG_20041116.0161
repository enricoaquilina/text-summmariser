Sri Lanka's rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) said
Tuesday that the government and all its coalition partners should
convey their unified stand and their consensus in support of the
peace process, reported the pro- rebel TamilNet.
</P>
<P>
"The Sri Lankan government's coalition partner, Janatha Vimukthi
Peramuna and others are opposing the peace process. Therefore we
cannot depend on the Sri Lankan President alone to take forward the
peace process," the LTTE's political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is what our leader conveyed to the Sri Lankan President through
the Norwegian Foreign Minister," Thamilselvan told reporters in the
rebel-held north town of Kilonochchi after holding meeting with LTTE
supporters in Parliament to discuss efforts to revive peace talks
with the government.
</P>
<P>
All 22 lawmakers from the Tamil National Alliance, which represents
the rebels in the 225-member Parliament, attended the meeting held
Tuesday in Kilinochchi.
</P>
<P>
"Our leader explained our stand on the peace process very clearly to
the Norwegians. We are prepared to start talks on the basis of the
ISGA (Interim Self-Governing Authority) unconditionally,"
Thamilselvan said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE said Thursday that it conveyed a message through Norwegian
Foreign Minister Jan Peterson to President Chandrika Kumaratunga on
how to take the country's stalled peace process forward during
Peterson's meeting with LTTE supremo Velupillai Pirapaharan in
Kilonochchi.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels had been fighting against government forces to set up
an independent Tamil homeland in the north and east since 1983 until
they entered into a Norwegian-brokered cease-fire in February 2002.
Decades of conflicts have claimed more than 60,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
The government and the LTTE held six rounds of direct negotiations
between September 2002 and April 2003 before they were deadlocked
over the rebels' central demand for interim self- rule in large areas
of the war-torn north and east that they control.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegien facalitators have been trying to revive the stalled
peace talks since May this year but their efforts have been futile so
far.
