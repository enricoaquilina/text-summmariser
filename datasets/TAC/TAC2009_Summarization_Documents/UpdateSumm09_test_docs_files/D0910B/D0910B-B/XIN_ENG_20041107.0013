A senior leader of Sri Lanka's rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) said it is ready to resume peace talks with the government if
its self-rule proposal gets a positive response, a local newspaper
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
LTTE political wing leader S.P. Thamilselvan said Saturday that it
wants a positive response from the government on its Interim
Self-Governing Authority (ISGA) proposal, said a report of The Sunday
Times.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels' position was also conveyed to Japanese peace envoy
Yasushi Akashi, the paper quoted Thamilselvan as saying.
</P>
<P>
LTTE chief negotiator Anton Balasingham will arrive in Sri Lanka on
Tuesday to assist LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in talks with
Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen, who will be here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Petersen has said that he is not coming to Sri Lanka with
"high expectations."
</P>
<P>
"Based on signals from the parties over recent weeks, I do not have
high expectation, but in difficult situations it is even more
important to keep engaging with the parties," the Norwegian Embassy
in Sri Lanka quoted Petersen as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rebels submitted their ISGA proposal to the previous government
of former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the end of October
last year but the proposal was rejected by President Chandrika
Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels insists that the ISGA proposal should serve as the
basis for the resumption of the stalled peace talks but the
government wants to talk about a final solution to the two decades of
ethnic conflict simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels had been fighting against government forces to set up
an independent Tamil homeland in the north and east since 1983 until
they entered into a Norwegian-brokered ceasefire in February 2002.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian facilitators have been trying to revive the stalled
peace talks since May this year but their efforts have been futile so
far.
