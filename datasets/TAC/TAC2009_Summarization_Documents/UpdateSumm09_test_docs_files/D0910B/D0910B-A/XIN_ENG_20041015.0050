<P>
Two more killings took place in Sri Lanka's eastern area on Thursday
night amid continuous internecine clashes between Tamil Tiger rebel
rival factions, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Two members belonging to the mainstream Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) rebels were killed in a shooting incident that happened
late Thursday night at the eastern Batticaloa district's Punkudawali
area controlled by the LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE's renegade eastern commander known as Karuna was suspected
for the killings, police said.
</P>
<P>
Two more LTTE's members were seriously injured when unknown gunmen
fired at them in another incident at Kaluwankerni in the
Muslim-dominated town of Valaichchenai in the east, police added.
</P>
<P>
Internecine clashes between rival factions of Tamil rebels have
hampered the government efforts to revive the stalled peace
negotiations on hold since April last year.
</P>
<P>
Karuna broke ranks with the mainstream rebel group in March this
year. The split has caused an escalation of violence in the east of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have accused the government of colluding with Karuna
to fight against them but the accusation was vehemently denied by the
government.
