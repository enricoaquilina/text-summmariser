SUPREME COURT TO START NEW TERM MONDAY, REVISIT DECISION ON
SENTENCING
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three months ago, the Supreme Court issued an opinion that seemed to
outlaw the way much of the nation sentences criminals. Then they went
on vacation, leaving judges, prosecutors, and thousands of defendants
confused about what to do. As the justices return to work Monday,
their first task is to belatedly explain the new rules.
</P>
<P>
The new term is dominated by criminal justice matters, with cases
involving the death penalty for juveniles, medical marijuana,
drug-sniffing police dogs during routine traffic stops, and the
continued detention of Cubans brought over during the Mariel
boat-lift who finished their prison sentences but cannot be returned
to Cuba because Fidel Castro will not take them back.
</P>
<P>
But before the court can take on the new issues, it will revisit its
5-to-4 decision last term in Blakeley v. Washington.
</P>
<P>
In that case, it struck down guidelines under which judges add time
to the normal range for a sentence based on aggravating facts not
found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury - for example, increasing
the penalty for a kidnapping conviction if the offense involved cruel
mistreatment of a victim. The majority said such a system violates
the Constitution's guarantee of a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
Because as many as 21 states and the federal government use a similar
arrangement, the ruling cast much of the criminal justice system into
doubt and had an immediate impact on thousands of open cases. But the
justices neglected to explain the implications of their decision, and
lower courts have come up with wildly different interpretations of
what it meant.
</P>
<P>
"They went off for three months on vacation, leaving a lot of people
scrambling to figure out how to make the system work," said Julie
O'Sullivan, a law professor at Georgetown University. "That struck me
as an irresponsible and arrogant thing to do. They have to decide
just how much remains of the federal sentencing system."
</P>
<P>
Seeking an opinion that will clear up the confusion, the federal
government asked for expedited review of the cases of Duncan Fanfan
and Freddie J. Booker, both convicts challenging their guideline-set
sentences. At risk is the whole system of judges examining the facts
after a basic jury verdict to come up with sentences that distinguish
between bad and worse instances of a crime. If the court strikes down
guidelines, many current defendants could receive only a minimum
sentence. But that defense victory could prove Pyrrhic: Analysts say
legislatures could respond by imposing harsher mandatory sentences.
</P>
<P>
The arguments Monday will kick off a near-record 10th term for the
court without a lineup change. Few expect the aging panel to remain
intact another four years, so the upcoming presidential election's
most long-lasting impact may be in deciding who gets to nominate
multiple replacements, thus transforming its current balance into a
controlling ideological majority.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the justices have filled half the term's calendar
and continue to review other appeals; one closely watched potential
case is a challenge to Florida's ban on gay adoptions. Rulings will
be issued by the end of the term in June.
</P>
<P>
No terrorism case is on the calendar following the court's historic
decision in that arena last term, when it sharply curtailed President
Bush's claimed wartime power to indefinitely imprison suspected
terrorists beyond the reach of judicial review. But there are several
cases dealing with the detention and deportation of noncitizens.
</P>
<P>
In Clark v. Martinez and Benitez v. Bozos, for example, the court
will decide whether the government can continue to indefinitely
imprison Cuban criminals from the 1980 Mariel boat-lift who were
never granted legal entry into the United States, but were "paroled"
into the country.
</P>
<P>
Having committed crimes and served out their sentences, they face
deportation. But Cuba refuses to accept them, so they and about 900
others are locked up in limbo. In 2001, the court ruled that
detaining legal immigrants for more than six months was
unconstitutional. This case will decide whether people who have not
legally entered the country have the same rights.
</P>
<P>
One case of local interest is Smith v. Massachusetts, which comes
from a 1996 shooting in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. The
court must decide whether defendant Melvin Smith's "double jeopardy"
protection against successive prosecution was violated when a judge
first granted a defense motion to declare him not guilty of a charge,
then withdrew that verdict and allowed the charge to go to a jury.
</P>
<P>
A Connecticut case, Kelo v. New London, will determine whether a
government can use eminent domain to clear space for private
redevelopment. The Fifth Amendment limits the power to force
unwilling owners to sell in cases where the property will be put to
"public use," usually for something like a road. Here, a neighborhood
would be razed for the "public purpose" of generating greater tax
revenue.
</P>
<P>
Roper v. Simmons presents the court with an opportunity to strike
down the death penalty for crimes committed by a juvenile. The case
arrives two years after its decision to strike down the death penalty
for mentally retarded criminals.
</P>
<P>
The court had upheld both policies in 1989. In reversing course for
criminals with diminished mental abilities, it reasoned that
society's evolving standard of decency had reached a consensus that
such criminals were less culpable than people of normal intelligence
and so executing them
</P>
<P>
is considered "cruel and unusual punishment" prohibited by the Eighth
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
Challengers to the juvenile death penalty similarly argue that the
number of death sentences for offenses committed by minors has
dwindled and there is a growing reluctance to carry out such
executions.
</P>
<P>
Because nearly the entire world has outlawed the juvenile death
penalty, court watchers are interested in whether justices will cite
foreign practices, as some did when striking down sodomy laws two
years ago. The emerging trend of looking abroad for comparative input
has drawn fire from conservatives, who say only domestic law should
be relevant.
</P>
<P>
In Illinois v. Caballes, the court will decide whether police may
search a car with a drug-sniffing dog during a routine traffic stop
without an individualized reason to be suspicious. The case hinges on
what expectation of privacy people driving in their car have.
</P>
<P>
In Ashcroft v. Reich, the court will consider whether federal agents
lack authority to interfere with medical marijuana grown by seriously
ill people who do not take it across state lines. California voters
legalized medicinal marijuana in state law eight years ago, but it
remains illegal under federal law.
</P>
<P>
The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a generally liberal
court based in San Francisco, ruled that home-grown and home-consumed
marijuana is not related to interstate commerce, and so the
Constitution does not give Congress the authority to regulate it.
</P>
<P>
That invokes the same reasoning that conservative majorities on the
Supreme Court have used to strike down federal laws against guns in
schools and violence against women. But the Supreme Court frequently
reverses the Ninth Circuit and has consistently rejected challenges
to federal drug laws.
</P>
<P>
"This represents another case in an ongoing battle between the
Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit is playing
games," said Michael Gottesman, a law professor at Georgetown. "If
you play games and the other side is the Supreme Court, you're not
going to win."
