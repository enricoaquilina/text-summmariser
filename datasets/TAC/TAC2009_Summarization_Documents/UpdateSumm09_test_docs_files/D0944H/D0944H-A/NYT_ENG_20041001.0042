HIGH COURT TO TAKE UP CASES RANGING FROM MARIJUANA USE TO GIRLS'
SPORTS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For release Sunday, Oct. 3
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- The death penalty, drugs and civil rights are before
the Supreme Court in its new term, which begins Monday with
relatively little public notice amid the presidential campaign's
final month.
</P>
<P>
While President Bush and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., pound away at each
other on the stump, the nine justices will start their session at 10
a.m. with the court's marshal saying, "God save the United States and
this honorable court."
</P>
<P>
But the calm of the courtroom is probably what the deliberative
justices would prefer this fall, just four years after a presidential
election in which they attracted global attention and essentially
cast the deciding vote.
</P>
<P>
"They (the justices) are probably perfectly happy that people are
concerned about other things," said attorney Theodore Olson, who
argued Bush's case in the 5-4 decision in Bush v. Gore that ended the
Florida recount, sealing Bush's victory. The justices, however, would
not shy away if this year's election also arrived at their doorstep,
added Olson, who served from 2001 until July as U.S. solicitor
general, President Bush's top lawyer before the high court.
</P>
<P>
The justices this year have already shown that they are not afraid to
revisit earlier rulings.
</P>
<P>
In taking the case of a man convicted of murder when he was 17, the
court will reconsider its 1989 decision in Stanford v. Kentucky that
the Constitution permits the execution of 16-year-old killers. To
raise that minimum age, the court would need to decide that a
national consensus has emerged since that year that it is cruel and
unusual to execute murderers who had not reached adulthood when they
committed their crime.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the man, Christopher Simmons, are urging the Supreme
Court to do for youngsters on death row what it did two years ago for
condemned killers who have mental retardation. In 2002, it overturned
a 1989 ruling that had permitted executing the mentally retarded,
saying that a national consensus had emerged that executing such
people violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual
punishment. It based its decision largely on the growing number of
death-penalty states to have outlawed such executions: up from two in
1989 to 16 in 2002.
</P>
<P>
But Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon says the court should hold
fast to its decision allowing the execution of minors. Some killings
are so heinous as to warrant not only charging minors as adults -- as
is often the case today -- but to hold them to the ultimate penalty
as well, he argues.
</P>
<P>
Simmons was convicted and sentenced to death in 1993, when he was 17,
for forcing Shirley Crook from her bed, tying her hands and legs
together with electric cable, covering her face with duct tape and
pushing her from a railroad trestle into a river below, where she
drowned. The Missouri Supreme Court last year upheld the conviction
but threw out the death sentence, saying that to execute someone for
crimes committed before reaching age 18 would be cruel and unusual in
light of current societal standards.
</P>
<P>
The justices will hear arguments in the Missouri case, Roper v.
Simmons, on Oct. 13 and render their decision by the summer.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add begins)
</P>
<P>
Nixon, pressing Missouri's appeal to the justices, assails that
ruling as violating the U.S. Supreme Court's still valid decision
from 1989 that executing 17 year olds is permissible. Though the
Missouri court might feel times have changed, it must continue to
rely on the justices' determination, he writes in the state's appeal.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general also disputes that a national consensus has
emerged against executing childhood offenders, saying it has become
increasingly common during the past decade for violent young
offenders to be tried and sentenced as adults.
</P>
<P>
Countering the state, Simmons' lawyers argue that the Missouri court
merely followed the justices' test for determining whether decency
standards have evolved sufficiently to warrant a change in applying
the death penalty. Death-penalty states during the past decade have
moved to abolish the punishment as applied to minors, and the number
of killers under age 18 sentenced to death has dropped from 14 in
1999 to two last year, the lawyers said, citing data from
statistician Victor Streib.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add ends)
</P>
<P>
In a case on marijuana, the justices will consider whether Congress
overstepped its authority by outlawing marijuana use for medicinal
purposes when the plant is grown in the same state where it is
prescribed.
</P>
<P>
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that the federal
Controlled Substances Act cannot be enforced against two California
residents who were prescribed marijuana to treat debilitating medical
conditions. The San Francisco-based court said Congress'
constitutional authority to regulate interstate commerce cannot be
invoked to outlaw the medicinal use of marijuana grown, prescribed
and used in the same state.
</P>
<P>
Appealing that decision to the justices, the government says Congress
can outlaw the intrastate use of dangerous drugs even if state law
allows doctors to prescribe them. It argues the use of illegal drugs
cannot be confined to one state, but rather inevitably spills over
into interstate trade, which Congress can regulate.
</P>
<P>
"Local manufacturing, possession and use of controlled substances
increase the demand for such drugs, which in turn leads to increased
supply and marketing to users," the government states in papers filed
with the high court.
</P>
<P>
The California residents counter that using marijuana on a limited,
as medically necessary basis has no significant impact on the
interstate drug trade. In addition, Congress tramples on states'
rights when it seeks to regulate the use of a drug that state law
says may be prescribed for certain medical conditions, Angel Raich
and Diane Monson state in papers filed with the justices.
</P>
<P>
Raich suffers from a variety of chronically painful medical
conditions, including scoliosis, joint dysfunction, headaches,
multiple chemical sensitivities, asthma and seizures. Monson suffers
from a degenerative spinal disease that causes chronic back pain and
painful muscle spasms. They each have been prescribed marijuana to
relieve the pain, which is permitted under California's 1996
Compassionate Use Act.
</P>
<P>
Eight other states have enacted similar "medical marijuana" laws,
including Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont
and Washington.
</P>
<P>
The case is Ashcroft v. Raich.
</P>
<P>
In a coaching case testing civil rights, Roderick Jackson claims the
Birmingham, Ala., Board of Education fired him in 2001 as a
high-school girls basketball coach after he protested to supervisors
that his team was not receiving the same funding and access to
athletic facilities as the boys' squad. Jackson sued the board,
claiming that his retaliatory firing violated Title IX of the federal
1972 Education Amendments, which requires equal treatment of boys and
girls teams in scholastic sports.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court for Northern Alabama dismissed Jackson's
lawsuit, saying Title IX has no provision allowing people to sue for
retaliatory actions by school officials. The Atlanta-based 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.
</P>
<P>
In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Jackson argues that the right to
sue for retaliation is implicit in any anti-discrimination law.
Accordingly, the U.S. Education Department has adopted regulations
that protect teachers who complain about illegal bias, Jackson states
in papers filed with the justices.
</P>
<P>
"If schools and other defendants could freely retaliate against those
who protest discriminatory treatment, they would effectively be
engaging in the discrimination prohibited by the statute," Jackson
wrote.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government supports Jackson's position in a legal brief
filed with the court.
</P>
<P>
"Just as Title IX's broad prohibition against intentional
discrimination covers other forms of intentional discrimination to
which the statute does not specifically refer (e.g. sexual
harassment), it covers intentionally discriminatory retaliation," the
government states. "Teachers and coaches are often in a much better
position to identify sex discrimination and express opposition to it
than are the students who are denied equal educational
opportunities."
</P>
<P>
The school board counters that courts should not read into Title IX a
right to sue that is not explicitly stated in the statute.
</P>
<P>
The case is Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
The court is expected to render by the summer its decisions in the
approximately 80 cases it will hear between October and April. The
coming term marks the 11th consecutive one with the same nine
justices, further extending this panel's modern record for Supreme
Court stability.
