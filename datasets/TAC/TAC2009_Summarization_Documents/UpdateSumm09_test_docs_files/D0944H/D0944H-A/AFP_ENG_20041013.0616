<TEXT>
<P>
The US Supreme Court on Wednesday heard arguments on the legality of
the death penalty for criminals aged under 18 in a case that has
received international attention.
</P>
<P>
The outcome appeared in the balance with the nine member court
divided and the result likely to be decided by the two moderate
justices.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has been asked to rule on the fate of Christopher
Simmons, who was condemned to death for the 1993 murder in Missouri
of a woman who was abducted, tied up and thrown to her death from a
bridge. He was 17 at the time.
</P>
<P>
The Missouri Supreme Court commuted Simmons' sentence to life in
prison in 2003, and the state has appealed that decision.
</P>
<P>
The US Supreme Court abolished the death sentence for those aged
under 16 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
But the United States remains one of five countries that allow the
execution of those aged 16-18 and there has been growing domestic and
international pressure to halt that as well.
</P>
<P>
Only a few states still order executions for juveniles. They include
Texas and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
The Simmons case would decide the fate of 73 people currently on
death row across the United States for crimes committed when they
were minors.
</P>
<P>
The three most conservative members of the court seemed to lean
toward allowing the practice to continue. Opinions given for previous
cases indicate that the court's four more progressive justices favor
abolishing juvenile execution.
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony Kennedy, who along with Sandra Day O'Connor are
considered the moderates, asked whether world opinion should be taken
into account.
</P>
<P>
"No," answered James Layton, representing Missouri state which wants
Simmons executed.
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it relevant?" Justice Stephen Breyer asked, adding that he was
not implying that it was up to the world to impose law on the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said, "What we do here should influence the rest of the
world."
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, who joined Kennedy in passing a 2002 decision barring the
execution of mentally ill people, appeared to agree.
</P>
<P>
Quoting President Thomas Jefferson, one of the framers of the US
Constitution, she said, "To lead the world you must show a decent
respect of mankind."
</P>
<P>
The Missouri attorney argued that "there are 17-year-olds that are
equally culpable as 18-year-olds."
</P>
<P>
But Justice Ruth Ginsburg interrupted him to highlight that in the
United States people under 18 years old cannot "buy tobacco, vote,
sit on a jury."
</P>
<P>
"Why would someone be death eligible but not eligible to be an adult
member of the community?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor compared society's evolution toward opposing the juvenile
death penalty to its position on executing the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
"There was an inexorable trend concerning mental retardation, not
here," Layton said, adding that if the number of executions of minors
has decreased in the last few years it could rise in the future.
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, only three states -- Oklahoma, Texas and
Virginia -- have executed persons who were under 18.
</P>
<P>
Only two teenagers were condemned to death in 2003, compared with 15
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said he was concerned that eliminating the death penalty for
young criminals would remove a "deterrent", notably among gang
members.
</P>
<P>
But Simmons' attorney, Seth Waxman, replied that the death penalty
was a useless deterrent against minors since "they weigh risks
differently" to adults.
