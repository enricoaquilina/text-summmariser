SUPREME COURT OPENS WITH URGENT CASE OVER SENTENCING

<P>
The Supreme Court opens its new term Monday faced with urgent
business and looming uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
The justices' most pressing task is to resolve the fate of the
federal criminal sentencing system, which the court itself threw into
limbo in June by declaring unconstitutional a similar, although not
identical, system used by the state of Washington.
</P>
<P>
In both the state and federal systems, sentencing guidelines provide
a starting point for calculating a criminal sentence, and judges then
make findings about a variety of factors to determine how much time a
defendant will actually serve. The Supreme Court ruled in Blakely v.
Washington that the state system violated the constitutional right to
trial by jury by permitting judges to make these essential findings.
</P>
<P>
Federal judges around the country quickly started ruling that they
could no longer treat the federal sentencing guidelines as binding.
Whether that judgment is correct and, if so, what should happen next
will be the subject of an unusual afternoon argument on Monday in two
cases that the justices -- in August -- granted at the Justice
Department's request and agreed to expedite for an argument.
</P>
<P>
While the sentencing cases alone -- United States v. Booker, No.
04-104, and United States v. Fanfan, No. 04-105 -- would mark this as
an unusually important term for criminal law, the justices have also
agreed to decide a significant death penalty case. The question in
Roper v. Simmons, No. 03-633, is whether executing someone convicted
of committing a capital murder at the age of 16 or 17 offends
"evolving standards of decency in a civilized society." That is the
test the court applies to decide whether a punishment is "cruel and
unusual" within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the court prohibited the execution of those whose crimes
were committed at 15 or younger, but refused the next year to extend
that decision to 16- and 17-year-olds. Although there have been few
executions for juvenile crimes in recent years, the United States is
one of only a handful of nations where such executions are still
legal, and the case has attracted worldwide attention. Seventy-three
people are currently on death row in 12 states -- one-third of them
in Texas -- for crimes committed before the age of 18.
