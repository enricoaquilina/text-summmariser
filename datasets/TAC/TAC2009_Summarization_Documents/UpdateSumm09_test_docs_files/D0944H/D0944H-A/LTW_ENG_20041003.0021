<HEADLINE>
Court to Consider Limiting Judges' Sentencing Power
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court justices, a solemn and sober lot,
will spend time this fall talking about wine, beef, marijuana and
dogs, all part of their wide-ranging duty to police the limits of the
government's power.
</P>
<P>
They will also consider whether young murderers can be put to death
for their crimes.
</P>
<P>
But when the court's term officially opens Monday, the first order
of business will be to answer a question raised at the end of the last
term: Is the federal sentencing system, which punishes 64,000
criminals a year, unconstitutional because it allows judges, acting
alone, to add to prison terms?
</P>
<P>
If so, the Supreme Court may force a profound shift in how
criminals are sentenced in America, one that will affect the state
courts in many states as well as the federal system.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the general understanding has been that prosecutors
charge defendants with a crime, juries typically decide whether they
are guilty and, if so, judges impose the punishment. In recent
rulings, however, a narrow Supreme Court majority has said the right
to a jury trial also includes the right to have a jury decide the key
facts that determine a sentence.
</P>
<P>
Other than a prior conviction, ``any fact that increases the
penalty for a crime'' must be decided by the jury or admitted by the
defendant, Justice Antonin Scalia said for a 5-4 majority in the case
of Blakeley vs. Washington.
</P>
<P>
That simple statement struck down the sentencing system in
Washington state, and it now threatens to do the same in the federal
system. In both, judges are authorized to decide the ``aggravating
factors'' that increase a prison term.
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the case of Ducan Fanfan, who last year sold a
small bag of cocaine to an informer outside a Burger King restaurant
near Portland, Maine. A jury found him guilty as charged of selling at
least 500 grams of cocaine, a crime that called for six years in
prison under U.S. sentencing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
On June 28, four days after the Blakely ruling, Fanfan came before
a federal judge for sentencing. Prosecutors said the defendant was the
leader of a drug gang who had 2.5 kilograms of cocaine in his home and
car. Based on these facts -- which the judge found to be true --
Fanfan should go to prison for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
However, imposing such a stiff sentence would be unconstitutional
under the just-announced Blakely ruling, the judge concluded. So he
sent Fanfan to prison for six years based on just the jury's verdict.
</P>
<P>
Bush administration lawyers appealed Fanfan's case directly to the
Supreme Court. They argued that it made a ``mockery'' of the law by
permitting judges to give more lenient sentences based on certain
facts but forbidding them from increasing the sentences based on other
facts.
</P>
<P>
Fanfan's is one of two cases that will be heard Monday afternoon as
the justices debate what to do with the federal sentencing system.
</P>
<P>
The outcome is likely to affect most state courts.
</P>
<P>
The future of the death penalty for young murderers also is in
doubt. Four liberal justices -- John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- have already said they
view such as executions as ``shameful'' and a ``relic of the past.''
If they are joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor or Anthony M.
Kennedy, the court would limit capital punishment to those who are age
18 or older at the time of their crime.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, only Texas, Oklahoma and Virginia have carried out
executions of young murderers. The justices will take up a Missouri
case, Roper vs. Simmons, on Oct. 13 to decide the issue.
</P>
<P>
The wine and marijuana cases will come before the court in
December.
</P>
<P>
As wine has grown in popularity, many wine drinkers have asked
whether they can order their favorite vintage from a distant vineyard
and have it shipped directly to them. The answer depends on state
laws.
</P>
<P>
About half the states forbid all direct shipments of wine across
their borders. Only licensed wholesalers are permitted to import
alcohol, and they in turn sell it to retailers. The states rely on the
21st Amendment, which repealed the prohibition on alcohol sales and
was approved in 1933, for this authority. The amendment states that
``importation into any state . . . of intoxicating liquors is hereby
prohibited.'' Although all states permit the sale of alcohol, they do
so only through their own sets of regulations.
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Heald, a wine critic from Troy, Mich., and David Lucas, the
owner of a small winery near Lodi, Calif., are challenging the bans on
wine shipments to Michigan and New York. In the case of Granholm vs.
Heald, they argue that the Constitution calls for a free flow of
commerce across state lines, including that of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
``This case will determine whether consumers or a cartel of
billion-dollar distributors will determine what wine is available to
consumers in New York or two dozen other states,'' said Clint Bolick
of the Washington-based Institute for Justice, who represents Lucas.
</P>
<P>
The case of John Ashcroft vs. Angel Raich may determine the fate of
the medical marijuana laws in nine states. Raich, who suffers from a
brain tumor, uses homegrown marijuana to relieve her pain. This is
legal under the Compassionate Use Act approved by California's voters.
</P>
<P>
However, Ashcroft, the U.S. attorney general, says federal drug
laws forbid all use of marijuana. Federal agents raided the homes of
several Californian patients who grew their own.
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the
conservative leader, has insisted on limiting federal power. For
example, he spoke for a 5-4 majority that struck down the federal
Gun-Free Schools Zone Act on the grounds that mere gun possession did
not involve interstate commerce. The liberal dissenters said the court
should uphold the broad power of Congress.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the liberal 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned the
tables. Relying on the logic of Rehnquist's opinion, it ruled the use
of homegrown marijuana was beyond the federal authority because it did
not involve interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
The court also will hear a challenge to a unique California prison
policy that segregates new inmates by race for as many as 60 days.
Prison officials say they seek to prevent gang violence while new
inmates are evaluated. Lawyers for Garrison Johnson, a black inmate,
say racial segregation is unconstitutional in all instances.The court
also will decide whether police can use drug-sniffing dogs in routine
traffic stops. Usually, officers need some evidence of a drug crime
before they search for narcotics. But prosecutors contend that when a
trained dog sniffs the air, it is not engaged in a search, and
therefore police may use dogs whenever and however they choose.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture industry will be closely watching a case about
government-sponsored ad campaigns. Cattlemen are challenging the fees
they must pay for ads such as ``Beef, It's What for Dinner.''
</P>
<P>
Dozens of similar ad campaigns are sponsored by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture as well as many states. A ruling in the case of Veneman
vs. Livestock Marketing Association could free farmers from having to
pay for them.
