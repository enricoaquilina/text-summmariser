High Court to Consider Sentencing Guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A possible revolution in the federal criminal justice
system will be on the agenda when the Supreme Court opens its new term
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a rare two-hour afternoon oral argument session, the justices
will consider whether the federal sentencing guidelines -- a manual of
400-plus pages meant to ensure that federal courts give defendants
across the country approximately equal punishments for similar crimes
-- can be reconciled with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The court is hearing the case on an expedited schedule in response
to the uproar and confusion created by a 5 to 4 ruling it issued June
24, just before leaving for summer recess.
</P>
<P>
In that case, Blakely vs. Washington, the court struck down
Washington state's sentencing guidelines, which, like the federal
guidelines, permit judges to boost sentences based on their own
post-conviction fact-finding, rather than relying only on facts
admitted by the defendant or found by a jury.
</P>
<P>
That, the court ruled, violates the right to a jury trial
guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
Though the court said in Blakely that it did not address the
federal guidelines, the similarities between Washington's system and
the federal system were such that defense lawyers across the country
immediately began bombarding courts with Blakely challenges to their
clients' sentences.
</P>
<P>
Lower courts have issued differing rulings in response, and some
federal prosecutors have felt obliged to redraft indictments to make
sure they conform to Blakely.
</P>
<P>
``It looks like a Number 10 earthquake to me,'' Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, who dissented in Blakely, told a conference of federal
judges in July.
</P>
<P>
Although determining the precise magnitude of the Blakely
aftershocks is the court's first major item of business, Blakely is by
no means the only case of potential national significance on the
court's docket.
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 13, the court will hear arguments in Roper vs. Simmons, No.
03-633, a challenge to the constitutionality of the death penalty for
persons who commit crimes while younger than 18.
</P>
<P>
The court has barred capital punishment for those younger than 16,
but it ruled in 1989 that capital punishment for 16- and 17-year-old
defendants does not constitute ``cruel and unusual punishment.''
</P>
<P>
However, the court may decide that a ``national consensus'' has now
formed against imposing the ultimate penalty against minors -- just as
it did in 2002 with respect to the death penalty for moderately
mentally retarded offenders.
</P>
<P>
It is nearly certain that the court's two swing voters, Justices
O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy, will determine the outcome. Four
members of the court -- John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer -- have already declared in a published
opinion that they believe the death penalty for juveniles should be
abolished.
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas opposed the 2002 mental retardation ruling, which
opponents of capital punishment for juveniles are relying on to make
their case.

(Optional Add End) 
</P>
<P>
If the court throws out the sentencing guidelines, the issue will
return to Congress. Early congressional reactions to Blakely suggest
that the ultimate result of scrapping the guidelines would be harsher
penalties prescribed by politicians reluctant to be seen as soft on
crime.
</P>
<P>
''(I)t may take only a couple of lenient sentences in high-profile
cases to raise enough of a stir to increase mandatory minimum
penalties,'' Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said at a July 13 hearing of
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
