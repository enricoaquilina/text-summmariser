Key Justice Skeptical About Death Penalty Ban for Juveniles
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

<P>
A plea to declare capital punishment for juvenile
offenders unconstitutional received a skeptical hearing at the Supreme
Court Wednesday, as one of two justices likely to be pivotal to the
outcome voiced repeated doubts.
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony Kennedy observed that he was ``troubled'' that a
ban might lead gang leaders to use 16- or 17-year-olds as ``hit men.''
</P>
<P>
``I'm very concerned about that,'' Kennedy told Seth Waxman, a
former solicitor general of the United States who was arguing on
behalf of Missouri death row inmate Christopher Simmons, who faces
execution for a murder he committed at 17. ``I'm talking about the
deterrent value of the existing rule.''
</P>
<P>
Waxman replied that deterrence does not work with juvenile
offenders because they ``are impulsive and subject to peer pressure.''
</P>
<P>
But Kennedy responded that many 17-year-old offenders were
``ringleaders'' in brutal, calculated murders, according to a
friend-of-the-court brief filed by a group of states that wish to
retain a death penalty for juveniles. Kennedy said the brief was
``chilling reading.''
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's vote is crucial because four justices, John Paul Stevens,
David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, have already
declared their belief that executing those who commit crimes while
under the age of 18 is ``cruel and unusual punishment.''
</P>
<P>
The records of Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin
Scalia and Clarence Thomas suggest that they think the issue should be
left up to the states.
</P>
<P>
That leaves only Kennedy and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as
possible fifth votes for a ban. O'Connor was mostly silent in
Wednesday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court upheld capital punishment for 16- and 17-year-old
offenders in 1989. It banned it for those 15 and under in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the court's position has been unaffected by its 2002
decision to ban the death penalty for the moderately mentally
retarded. In that case, Kennedy and O'Connor joined Stevens, Souter,
Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
The court found that a national consensus against the practice had
formed since 1989. The best evidence for that, the court ruled, was
that the number of states banning the death penalty for the retarded
had grown from two to 13.
</P>
<P>
Many death penalty opponents immediately recognized that a similar
argument could be applied to juveniles.
</P>
<P>
Yet in the 2002 opinion, written by Stevens, the court seemed to
warn that it was not ready for that, contrasting the strong trend
against executing the retarded with the fact that, between 1989 and
2002, only two states had raised their death penalty ages to 18.
</P>
<P>
Three times in the last two years, the court refused to hear
appeals from death-row inmates who had killed while juveniles --
despite a strongly worded dissent in one case from Stevens, Souter,
Ginsburg and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the court actually reinstated the death penalty of a
juvenile offender in Oklahoma after a federal appeals court had
blocked it. The vote was 5 to 4, with both Kennedy and O'Connor in the
majority.
</P>
<P>
The court intervened in the Simmons case only after the Missouri
Supreme Court threw out Simmons' sentence last year on the grounds
that the 1989 precedent had, indeed, been superseded by the 2002 case.
</P>
<P>
Waxman pressed a similar argument Wednesday. He told the court that
the execution of juvenile criminals conflicts with a ``robust
consensus'' reflected in the recent decisions of several states to ban
the practice and in the decreasing frequency with which juries
actually impose the death penalty on those under 18. Scientific
evidence shows that areas of the brain in charge of judgment and
impulse control are incomplete in adolescents, he said.
</P>
<P>
Death is the wrong punishment for crimes that reflect ``the
transient psychosocial characteristics that rage in adolescents,''
Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
But Kennedy noted that the American Psychological Association --
which told the court in a brief in this case that adolescents were too
immature to qualify for capital punishment -- had also said in a case
about parental notification for abortion that teen-agers were old
enough to make such a decision on their own.
</P>
<P>
``They flip-flopped,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
Waxman said there was no inconsistency, because ``what was at issue
in that case was the competency to decide,'' while the question in
this case is ``factors why adolescents are less morally culpable.''
</P>
<P>
He also urged the court to act based on a ``worldwide consensus''
against the death penalty for juveniles, noting that except for the
United States, all 110 countries that retain capital punishment do not
apply it to those under 18.
</P>
<P>
States that permit it ``are not just alone in this country, they
are alone in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
On this point, Kennedy appeared to sympathize with Waxman, asking
Missouri state solicitor James Layton, ``There seems to be a very
substantial demonstration that world opinion is against us. ... Does
that have a bearing on what's `unusual''' punishment?
</P>
<P>
Layton replied that ``what matters'' is American legislation.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's only remark also hinted at some openness to Waxman's
position.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Layton, she noted that the number of states that either
do not have capital punishment or set the age at 18 is ``about the
same'' as the number of those that banned executing the retarded in
2002, which was 30.
</P>
<P>
``There is no inexorable trend here,'' Layton replied.
</P>
<P>
The case is Roper vs. Simmons. A decision is expected by July.
