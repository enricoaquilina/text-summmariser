HIGH COURT ABOLISHES JUVENILE DEATH PENALTY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Executing murderers who were under 18 years old at the time
of their crime is unconstitutional, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled
Tuesday, limiting the scope of capital punishment nationwide for the
second time in three years.
</P>
<P>
In a 5-4 decision, the justices said a growing consensus among
the states, and a recognition that minors are not yet
fully formed intellectually or morally, led to the conclusion that
executing anyone under 18 violates the constitutional ban on cruel
and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
The ruling follows the same path as the court's 2002 decision
that banned executions of the mentally retarded. It comes less
than 16 years after the justices issued two rulings on
the same day that upheld the death penalty for 16-
and 17-year-olds and the retarded.
</P>
<P>
"The reality that juveniles still struggle to define their identity means
it is less supportable to conclude that even a heinous
crime committed by a juvenile is evidence of irretrievably depraved
character," said Justice Anthony Kennedy in Tuesday's majority opinion. Compared
to adults, he said, "a greater possibility exists that a
minor's character deficiencies will be reformed."
</P>
<P>
He noted that American society sets the boundary between childhood and
adulthood at 18 in deciding who can vote, serve on
a jury or marry without parental consent. That is also
an appropriate dividing line for those who are subject to
the law's supreme punishment, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy also said the United States, until Tuesday, was the only
remaining nation to give official endorsement to executions of juveniles.
The United States and Somalia, he said, are the only
nations that have not ratified the United Nations Convention on
the Rights of the Child, which prohibits such executions, and
of eight countries that have executed minors since 1990, all
but the United States have abolished or disavowed the practice.
</P>
<P>
His observation reignited a debate over the court's consideration of foreign
laws and legal opinions when interpreting the Constitution. The court
has noted international views in some recent rulings, including its
2002 decision on the retarded and its 2003 decision overturning
state sodomy laws. Justice Antonin Scalia, the leading critic of
the court's practice, noted caustically Tuesday that the majority has
not followed the same course in rulings on abortion, where
foreign laws are more restrictive.
</P>
<P>
"What these foreign sources 'affirm' ... is the justices' own notion
of how the world ought to be," Scalia said in
a dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's ruling overturns laws in 20 states that applied the death
penalty to minors, and commutes death sentences to life in
prison for 73 inmates in 13 of those states--2 percent
of the more than 3,400 death row inmates nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The case that led to the ruling involved a Missouri youth,
Christopher Simmons, who was 17 in 1993 when he and
a friend kidnapped Shirley Crook, bound and gagged her and
threw her off a bridge. Prosecutors said Simmons, who had
no criminal record, told his friends they could get away
with the killing because of their age.
</P>
<P>
Briefs urging the court to ban juvenile executions were filed by
major medical and mental-health organizations, the U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops, and several Nobel Peace Prize winners, including former President
Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
"With this ruling, the United States ... joins the community of
nations, which uniformly renounces this practice," Carter said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley law professor Franklin Zimring, a death penalty scholar and
opponent, said the ruling continued the court's recent trend of
narrowing capital punishment laws nationwide. The justices may impose further
restrictions by scrutinizing procedural flaws and defense lawyers' competence, but
are unlikely to decree wholesale changes in the near future,
he said.
</P>
<P>
But Mark Levin, president of the conservative Landmark Legal Foundation and
a death penalty supporter, said the ruling illustrated judicial activism
at its worst. "I suspect, down the road based on
this reasoning, the court will eventually ban the death penalty,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
In overturning its 1989 decision that allowed executions of 16-year-olds, the
court followed its late-20th century doctrine that judged cruel and
unusual punishment by "evolving standards of decency." Under that principle,
the court has condemned punishments it once tolerated--for example, the
death penalty for rape, outlawed by a 1977 ruling.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, Kennedy said, five states have prohibited the death penalty
for juveniles, no state has lowered its age for executions,
and juries have become increasingly reluctant to sentence minors to
death. Counting the 12 states without death penalty laws, he
said, 30 states now prohibit executions of murderers under 18,
the same total that banned executions of the retarded at
the time of the 2002 ruling.
</P>
<P>
Those developments contrast with the popularity of tough-on-crime legislation in general
and a crackdown on juvenile crime in particular, Kennedy said,
and "provide sufficient evidence that today our society views juveniles
... as categorically less culpable than the average criminal."
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor dissented, saying she was not persuaded that
a national consensus against juvenile executions exists or that jurors
were incapable of singling out a mature, "especially depraved" juvenile
murderer for the death penalty. Scalia, in a dissent joined
by Justice Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice William Rehnquist, derided
the majority for discarding both the court's 1989 ruling and
a punishment that was permitted when the Constitution was adopted
two centuries earlier.
</P>
<P>
"The court ... proclaims itself sole arbiter of our nation's moral
standards," Scalia said, rejecting the notion that the Constitution's meaning
"should be determined by the subjective views of five members
of this court and like-minded foreigners."
</P>
<P>
The case is Roper vs. Simmons, 03-633.
