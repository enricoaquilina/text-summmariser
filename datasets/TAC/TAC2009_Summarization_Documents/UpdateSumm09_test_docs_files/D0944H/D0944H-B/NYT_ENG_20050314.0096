SUPREME COURT WAS SWAYED BY ITS VIEW OF INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the U.S. Supreme Court decides to overturn the laws of
20 states, the
</P>
<P>
American people have every reason to expect that the judicial decision
has firm grounding in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Citizens might also hope that if the justices decide to overrule
the duly elected representatives of the people, the lawmaking process
in the states and its own precedent, that the constitutional
issues would be so crystalline as to elicit a unanimous
or near-unanimous decision.
</P>
<P>
In its recent ruling in Roper v. Simmons, five Supreme Court
justices have failed miserably to meet either of the above
standards. In determining that 16- and 17-year-old murderers cannot, under
any circumstances, face the death penalty, Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth
Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, David Souter and John Paul Stevens
have established a dangerous precedent for judicial activism.
</P>
<P>
As a resident of Texas, which leads the nation in executions,
I believe we put too many people to death. To
paraphrase a famous quote about another deeply divisive moral issue,
the death penalty should be lethal, legal and rare, sought
by prosecutors in only the most extreme cases.
</P>
<P>
It naturally follows that the death penalty for minors should be
even more rare. Under what circumstances and when murderers in
Texas face the death penalty is, however, a matter for
Texas lawmakers and courts to decide.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has arrogated this power to itself, creating for
Texas juries the legal fallacy that they may only sentence
to life imprisonment -- effectively, 40 years -- someone who
was 17 years, 364 days old at the time of
a horrendous capital crime, while an accomplice only a few
days older can face the executioner's needle.
</P>
<P>
The court had already addressed this fallacy in its 1989 Stanford
v. Kentucky decision, upholding the exceptional application of the death
penalty for capital crimes committed at age 16 and 17.
What compelled the five justices to reverse that decision in
2005?
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's majority opinion cites the necessity of referring to "the evolving
standards of decency" that lead to an emerging "national consensus"
against the death penalty for minors. Let's consider Kennedy's statistical
case.
</P>
<P>
Count the 12 states that lack capital punishment in any form
along with the 18 states that prohibit the death penalty
for minor murderers and you have a resounding consensus --
a synonym for unanimity -- of exactly three-fifths.
</P>
<P>
Here the justices wander into a judicial morass on other issues
in which states show a greater semblance of national consensus.
Take, for example, gay marriage, which one state has legalized,
while 38 states have passed laws that restrict marriage to
the union of one man and one woman.
</P>
<P>
Should or would the Supreme Court freeze the current consensus in
time and render unconstitutional the efforts of gays and lesbians
to seek marital rights in their respective states? And what
of the true consensus in 1973 of all 50 states
to restrict abortions to lesser or greater degrees?
</P>
<P>
Set aside for a moment the merits of a ruling based
on the arbitrary interpretation of national consensus. The most disturbing
aspect of the court's decision is its reliance on 'the
overwhelming weight of international opinion." That is to say, five
justices feel their power to interpret world sentiment and fabricate
a national consensus supersedes the right of juries to deliver
verdicts and assess penalties in accordance with the laws of
their states.
</P>
<P>
Where in all this, one may reasonably ask, is our nation's
Constitution?
</P>
<P>
What activist justices on the Supreme Court are effectively telling the
American people is, 'Heads we win, tails you lose." If
the legislative process advances an agenda the justices support ideologically,
they'll speed it along with a judicial decree based on
rights not found in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
If the same process advances an agenda the justices oppose, they'll
quash it on the basis of an imaginary national consensus
of five men and women and their reading of international
public opinion, irrespective of the Constitution.
