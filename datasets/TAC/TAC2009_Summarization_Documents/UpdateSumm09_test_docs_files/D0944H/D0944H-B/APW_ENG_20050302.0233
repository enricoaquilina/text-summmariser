Supreme Court's decision on death penalty cheered by young murderer who triggered review
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
JEFFERSON CITY, Missouri
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight months has made a lifetime of difference for Christopher
Simmons.
</P>
<P>
Because Simmons was that many months shy of his 18th birthday when he tossed a
woman to her death off a railroad trestle, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday
that he cannot be executed for the murder.
</P>
<P>
The ruling in Simmons' case also spared the life of 72 death row inmates across
the nation who were younger than 18 when they committed murder and bars states
from seeking to execute minors for future crimes.
</P>
<P>
For Simmons, now 28, it means a long life in prison _ for which he is eternally
grateful. Learning of the court decision from a television report, Simmons tried
unsuccessfully to call his family, then got through to one of his
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
"The first thing he said was, 'Thank you very, very much,'" said Kansas City
attorney Pat Berrigan, whose client denied an interview request.
</P>
<P>
Simmons had been praying fervently for the nation's high court to uphold a 2003
decision by the Missouri Supreme Court that banned juvenile executions, Berrigan
said.
</P>
<P>
"I think he sees some of God's work in this result," he said.
</P>
<P>
In its 5-4 ruling, the high court said the execution of juvenile offenders
violates the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual
punishment. The decision invalidated the practice of 19 states and overturned a
1989 high court precedent in another Missouri case that had allowed executions
for offenders as young as 16.
</P>
<P>
It also brought the United States in line with much of the rest of the world,
something Justice Anthony Kennedy noted while concluding that juveniles lack the
maturity and intellectual development to understand the ramifications of their
actions.
</P>
<P>
"The age of 18 is the point where society draws the line for many purposes
between childhood and adulthood. It is, we conclude, the age at which the line
for death eligibility ought to rest," Kennedy wrote for the court's
majority.
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia disputed that a "national consensus" exists
against juvenile executions and insisted those decisions should be left to
states.
</P>
<P>
The impact was immediate. In Prince William County, Virginia, officials said
Tuesday they will not prosecute a murder case against teen sniper Lee Boyd
Malvo, who already is serving life in prison in two of the 10 sniper killings
that terrorized the Washington area in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The ruling continues the court's practice of narrowing the scope of the death
penalty, which it reinstated in 1976. Executions for those 15 and younger when
they committed their crimes were outlawed in 1988. Three years ago, justices
banned executions of the mentally retarded, citing a "national consensus"
against executing a killer who may lack the intelligence to fully understand his
crime.
</P>
<P>
In finding a similar consensus against juvenile executions, the court noted that
most states bar them and those that allow them do so infrequently. Only three
states _ Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia _ have executed people who committed
crimes as juveniles in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The latest case arose from the September 1993 murder of Shirley Crook, who was
bound up during a nighttime burglary by Simmons and 15-year-old Charles
Benjamin. She was taken from her home wearing only underwear and cowboy boots
and shoved off a train trestle into the Meramec River. Prosecutors contended
Simmons planned the killing and bragged he could escape punishment because of
his age, something Simmons later denied.
</P>
<P>
Crook's relatives criticized the Supreme Court's conclusion that juveniles
aren't as culpable for their actions as adults.
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was a cold-blooded murder," said Tom Mitchell, whose wife, Pertie,
is Crook's sister. "I don't know that life in prison is ever considered a pass,
but he's not having to pay the same penalty that he caused Pertie's sister to
pay."
</P>
<P>
Jefferson County Prosecutor Bob Wilkins, who took office just months after
Simmons' trial, said he still believes it is appropriate to allow the death
penalty for some teenage murderers.
</P>
<P>
"If any case ever was deserving of the death penalty, this was it," Wilkins
said. "It was one of the most heinous offenses that any of us ever are going to
see."
</P>
<P>
Since entering prison, Simmons has embraced his Christian faith, joined several
ministry and youth programs and helped as a hospice aide caring for inmates with
AIDS, Berrigan said.
</P>
<P>
In January, Simmons was transferred to the same prison cell block as Benjamin,
who was tried separately and sentenced to life in prison. The two co-defendants
have occasionally talked about their fates, Benjamin said in a telephone
interview Tuesday from prison. Simmons wanted to live and had been anxiously
awaiting the Supreme Court decision.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin said he would have preferred to have been executed, adding that a
lifetime in prison should provide a strong deterrent to other
teens.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe one of the youngsters out there someday will look back in time and see
what happened to me and what happened to Chris and think, 'That's not really how
I want to do things,'" Benjamin said.
