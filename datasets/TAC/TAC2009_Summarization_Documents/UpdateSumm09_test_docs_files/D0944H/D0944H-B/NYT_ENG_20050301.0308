A 5-4 SUPREME COURT REJECTS JUVENILE DEATH PENALTY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<P>
The Supreme Court, concluding that both the United States
and the world have turned against the death penalty for
youthful offenders, ruled Tuesday that the Constitution categorically bars capital
punishment for crimes committed before the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
The 5-to-4 decision, which upheld a ruling by the Missouri Supreme
Court, will move 72 people off death row in 12
states. It represented an about-face for a court that only
16 years ago had rejected the argument that the execution
of those who kill at the age of 16 or
17 violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against "cruel and unusual
punishments."
</P>
<P>
Writing for the court on Tuesday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who
voted with the majority 16 years ago, said not only
did 30 states -- five more than 16 years ago
-- reject the death penalty for juveniles, but that "it
is fair to say that the United States now stands
alone in a world that has turned its face against
the juvenile death penalty."
</P>
<P>
There have been 19 such executions in the United States since
1990, most recently in 2003. Once the Supreme Court agreed
in January of last year to decide the issue, all
executions that might be affected by the eventual decision were
put on hold.
</P>
<P>
Justice Antonin Scalia, the author of the court's last ruling on
the subject, Stanford v. Kentucky, filed a dissent from the
new decision in Roper v. Simmons, No. 03-633. Joined by
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas, Scalia
disputed nearly every one of the majority's points, from how
to count the various states to whether reference to the
views of foreign legal systems has any relevance or legitimacy.
The defendant in the case, Christopher Simmons, argued that the
same standards that apply to mentally retarded killers should be
applied to juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
The Missouri Supreme Court agreed, noting that five states since 1989,
either by legislation or judicial decision, had raised the minimum
age to 18. It ordered Simmons resentenced to life in
prison without parole.
