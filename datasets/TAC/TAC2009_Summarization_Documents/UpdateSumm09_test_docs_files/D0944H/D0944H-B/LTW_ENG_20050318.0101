In striking down the death penalty for juveniles earlier this
month, the Supreme Court turned a decisive page in a debate that has
raged for years over the role of international law in interpreting the
Constitution. Since 1988, the justices have sharply disputed whether
to consider international norms in defining such concepts as ``cruel
and unusual punishments'' and due process. In Roper vs. Simmons,
however, the 5-4 majority resoundingly supported the relevance of
international law. And Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's dissent
nevertheless agreed that ``the existence of an international consensus
... can serve to confirm the reasonableness of a consonant and genuine
American consensus.''
</P>
<P>
What a contrast to the prevailing isolationism of the Bush
administration, which recently withdrew from the International Court
of Justice's jurisdiction in response to the ICJ's ruling that the
United States had violated the consular rights of Mexican nationals on
death row. Together, these events bring to the fore a dispute that is
enduringly provocative, because it pits those who stress the
uniqueness of the American constitutional system against those who
emphasize what America shares with the global community. It is a
debate that ultimately raises the question of whether America's
strength lies in its historical independence from the whims of global
society or from its leadership role therein.
</P>
<P>
Roper was simply the most recent battleground on which Justices
Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer have acted as spokesmen for the two
opposing camps. Scalia has asserted that ``modern foreign legal
materials can never be relevant to an interpretation of ... the
meaning of the U.S. Constitution.'' In this, he is supported by
Justice Clarence Thomas, who has protested the court's apparent
willingness to ``impose foreign moods, fads, or fashions on
Americans.'' Both men emphasize the singularity (and superiority) of
the American system.
</P>
<P>
Breyer and at least five other members of the court, on the other
hand, argue that international norms should inform our constitutional
analysis in a world increasingly united by globalization,
democratization and the spread of universal human rights.
</P>
<P>
The two camps have clashed over such political hot-button issues in
America's culture wars as the death penalty, abortion and gay rights.
But often overlooked in the debate is the fact that today's justices
are not the first to wrestle with the need to find the appropriate
balance between the two approaches. The question was evident almost
two centuries ago in a case arising from the War of 1812. Chief
Justice John Marshall, reflecting the Breyer view, wrote that ``In
expounding (the) Constitution, a construction ought not lightly to be
admitted which would give to a declaration of war an effect in this
country it does not possess elsewhere.'' Marshall presumed that the
Constitution would incorporate international norms. Indeed, since the
nation's founding, the court has often looked to international rules
in a broad range of contexts -- to help define state powers within our
federal system and to construe the commerce clause, the government's
power over immigrants and the meaning of involuntary servitude and due
process.
</P>
<P>
Even the current administration, while prominently flouting many of
our international obligations, has sought sweeping powers from
international rules that prove convenient. Just last term, the Justice
Department argued to the court that the president's authority to
detain U.S.-born alleged Taliban fighter Yaser Esam Hamdi derived from
the international laws of war. The court divided over the argument.
Four justices looked to international law both as supporting the
president's power to detain and as imposing limits on that power.
Justices David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg in turn objected to the
apparent contradiction in the administration's claim of powers
recognized by the laws of war while failing to provide detainees the
protections afforded by those same rules.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing disagreement over our relationship to international law
reflects fundamentally different attitudes toward America's place in
the international system. Scalia, a stark proponent of American
constitutional exceptionalism, looks back to the country's beginnings
in urging that ``if there was any thought absolutely foreign to the
founders of our country, surely it was the notion that we Americans
should be governed the way Europeans are.''
</P>
<P>
He is doubtless correct that certain aspects of U.S. constitutional
design deliberately rejected the practices of continental Europe.
These include our liberal free speech protections and the right to
jury trial in civil and criminal cases, which was unknown outside of
Great Britain at the founding. Both now separate the United States
even from British practice.
</P>
<P>
It is incorrect, however, to suggest that our entire constitutional
system sets us apart from the international community. The founders
also worked from the assumption, set forth in the Declaration of
Independence, that humanity shares a common set of inalienable rights.
</P>
<P>
The drafters of the Constitution were well versed in international
law, and they intended the United States to take its place among the
community of nations by adhering to international rules. Thomas
Jefferson considered the law of nations ``an integral part ... of the
laws of the land,'' and John Jay, one of the authors of the Federalist
Papers and the first chief justice of the United States, proclaimed
that ``the United States had, by taking a place among the nations of
the earth, become amenable to the laws of nations.'' Indeed,
compliance with international law was critical to prevent the
fledgling nation from offending powerful foreign states.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it would be surprising if the founders expected the
government's powers to be construed in isolation from international
rules. Similarly, the general concepts of individual rights such as
``liberty'' and ``cruel and unusual punishments'' that the drafters
incorporated into the Constitution reasonably invoke the fundamental
values of the international community. In short, while some
constitutional traditions may be unique to the American experience,
other aspects of our heritage invite consideration of international
rules.
</P>
<P>
This dialogue between international and constitutional values has
been largely lost to modern jurisprudence, as the use of international
law has become a political football in our charged social debates over
the death penalty and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
Each side of the Scalia/Breyer debate today contends that its
approach does the most to protect fundamental liberties. In reality,
however, international law does not point in any particular direction
in promoting individual rights. Take abortion as an example:
International law, in the form of treaties and customary international
norms, is essentially silent on the subject. The practices of foreign
nations, on the other hand, run the gamut from absolute prohibition to
liberal abortion laws. And while Scalia notes that most countries
around the world impose greater restrictions on abortion than the
United States, most advanced industrial democracies broadly protect
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
Abortion, in other words, stands in stark contrast to the juvenile
death penalty: The United States was the only country in the world
that continued to officially sanction the penalty, and the practice
placed the United States in the lonely company of such notorious human
rights violators as Yemen and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Scalia frequently criticizes the modern court for selectively
citing foreign sources that support its views while ignoring practices
abroad that contradict our constitutional norms. And history shows
that international law can be abused. In the 1857 Dred Scott case, the
chief justice of that period, Roger B. Taney, infamously invoked
foreign practices to conclude that the framers did not intend to
bestow citizenship on African descendants. But where international
rules would have supported freeing Dred Scott from slavery, Taney
rejected their relevance. The fact that international sources -- like
all interpretive sources -- may be abused, however, is an argument that
they should be used with integrity, not that they should not be used
at all.
</P>
<P>
Over a century ago, the court observed that ``The Constitution of
the United States was .... made for an undefined and expanding future,
and for a people gathered, and to be gathered, from many nations and
of many tongues; and while we take just pride in the principles and
institutions of the common law, we are not to forget that in lands
where other systems of jurisprudence prevail, the ideas and processes
of civil justice are also not unknown.''
</P>
<P>
Those who seek to differentiate the American system from the
international community fail to recognize that the United States is a
participant in the making of international law, from international
trade rules to international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
The use of international law does not mean we should follow it
blindly. But willfully ignoring those rules both brings the United
States into conflict with other nations, as with the juvenile death
penalty, and hampers our ability to invoke international rules from
which we wish to benefit. International law has been a part of our law
from the beginning, and its use in constitutional analysis is part of
the American tradition.
