<TEXT>
<P>
The US Supreme Court on Tuesday 
abolished the death penalty for those convicted of crimes they 
committed as minors.
</P>
<P>
The US high court upheld an earlier ruling by the Missouri 
Supreme Court banning the execution of those convicted of crimes 
they committed before turning 18. That ruling had found execution to 
be in violation of the constitutional protection against "cruel and 
unusual punishment."
</P>
<P>
The court had ruled in 1988 that the execution of offenders who 
were younger than 16 when they committed their crimes was 
unconstitutional, but a few US states continued to execute 
perpetrators who committed crimes at 16 or 17. The court cited 
changing cultural standards for its decision.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court was considering the case of Christopher 
Simmons, who was condemned to death for the 1993 murder in Missouri 
of a woman who was abducted, tied up and thrown to her death from a 
bridge. He was 17 at the time.
</P>
<P>
Simmons's attorney, Seth Waxman, had argued that the death 
penalty was a useless deterrent for minors, since "they weigh risks 
differently" than adults do.
