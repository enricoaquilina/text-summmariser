ONE MORE RISE IN TIDE AGAINST AMERICA'S TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somewhere William J. Brennan is smiling. Not a face-splitting
beam, you understand, because four members of his beloved Supreme
Court still believe it's just fine to execute 16- and
17-year-olds. But a pleased, reflected gleam, nonetheless, because the death
penalty is one small step closer to being removed as
the scourge of a civilized nation that should know better.
</P>
<P>
Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun are, somewhere, smiling, too. But I
focus on Brennan because it was he, who in 1989
near the end of his 34 years as an associate
justice, wrote the blistering dissent as the Supreme Court upheld
capital punishment for adolescents.
</P>
<P>
Brennan featured in his erudite opinion many of the concepts that
seemed settled in Supreme Court analysis until the wrecking crew
of William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas came along.
"Evolving standards of decency." "Contemporary attitudes." "Proportionality." Brennan also skewered
Scalia's "misplaced disdain" for scientific evidence, which in the plurality
opinion Scalia had sought to ridicule as "ethicoscientific."
</P>
<P>
Well, let's hear it for the "ethicoscientific."
</P>
<P>
Because in good measure, that, along with those pesky evolving standards,
is exactly what five justices relied on Tuesday, in Roper
v. Simmons, to rule that executing 16- and 17-year-olds violates
the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
As a leader of the American Psychiatric Association, one of several
medical groups that favored banning juvenile executions, noted Tuesday, the
decision acknowledges "that the brains of adolescents function in fundamentally
different ways than the brains of adults."
</P>
<P>
It is an especially important ruling for Texas, which is home
to more than one-third of the nation's death row population
in under-18 cases.
</P>
<P>
It is also another rebuke to the death-penalty zealotry of much
of the state's political establishment.
</P>
<P>
Their enchantment with executing juveniles put them in a very narrow
league that included, until his recent dethronement, Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
In a nice turn of history, as well as a symbol
of how close was the vote, the latest opinion was
written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, a member of Scalia's plurality
15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Sadly and inexplicably, the new majority did not include Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor, who three years ago joined five other justices
in striking down the death penalty for the mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor attempted -- and failed -- in a dissenting opinion Tuesday
to parse why the social, medical and legal analyses that
applied and were persuasive enough to her in the mental
retardation case (Atkins v. Virginia) were not met in Roper.
</P>
<P>
Oh, well, opponents of the death penalty may have to learn
to live with 5-4, assuming even that narrow count can
be maintained if President Bush, a death-penalty enthusiast, gets to
make a Supreme Court nomination.
</P>
<P>
Little by little, since it reinstated the death penalty in 1976,
the Supreme Court has whittled back the administration and application
of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
To the Scalias of the world, the idea of "evolving" standards
or, even worse to them, an "evolving" interpretation of the
Constitution, is some sort of perversion (unless, of course, it
gets them to their political ends).
</P>
<P>
But as Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in a concurring opinion
joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, if the meaning of
the Eighth Amendment "had been frozen when it was originally
drafted, it would impose no impediment on the execution of
7-year-old children."
</P>
<P>
I'd hesitate to see that proposition brought to a vote in
the Texas Legislature as currently constituted.
</P>
<P>
The Roper case is "a small tsunami," said Jeffrey Fagan, a
Columbia University professor of law and public health. "It's not
a 30-foot wall of water but a 2-foot wall. But
that still is changing the landscape."
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the death penalty must acknowledge the narrowness of the
vote that produced Tuesday's welcomed result in Roper but also
recognize the modestly advantageous lay of the land.
</P>
<P>
"Proponents of the death penalty haven't had a win in a
long time," Fagan said.
</P>
<P>
one."
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the journey is not likely to be short
or easy or without setbacks, but with each step and
at every turn it will be worthwhile.
