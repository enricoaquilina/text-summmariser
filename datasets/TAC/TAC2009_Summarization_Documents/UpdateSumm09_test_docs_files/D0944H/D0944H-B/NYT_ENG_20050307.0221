JUSTICES, REVISITING ISSUE, RULE ON JUDGES' ROLE IN SENTENCES
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court, in a decision indicating that its
re-examination of the role of judges in criminal sentencing is
far from over, on Monday overturned a 15-year mandatory sentence
that a federal appeals court had ordered imposed on a
"career criminal."
</P>
<P>
The justices said the appeals court had mistakenly ordered the trial
court to conduct too wide-ranging an investigation into whether the
defendant's previous convictions met the definition of prior offenses that
would bring about the mandatory minimum sentence under a federal
law, the Armed Career Criminal Act. The trial judge's role
should be considerably more limited, the court said in a
5-to-3 opinion by Justice David H. Souter.
</P>
<P>
The ruling strongly suggested that the sentencing debate, which earlier this
year produced a decision that effectively amended the federal sentencing
guidelines on the ground that they gave judges too much
authority, will now take aim at a different target: prior
offenses.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, when the court ruled in Apprendi v. New Jersey
that the Constitution barred judges from making factual findings that
led to increased sentences, the justices carved out one exception:
findings that related to prior offenses.
</P>
<P>
Federal statutes and those in many states impose greater, often mandatory,
sentences based on a defendant's prior record, so an interpretation
of that record can often be the most important part
of the sentencing process. Ever since the Apprendi decision, there
has been growing tension between the rule the court announced
and the one exception it maintained.
</P>
<P>
The question in the case ruled Monday was whether four burglaries
to which Reginald Shepard had earlier pleaded guilty qualified as
the kind of prior offenses that made him eligible for
the 15-year mandatory minimum sentence imposed on felons who are
convicted of possession of firearms.
</P>
<P>
Under the federal law, a burglary of a house or other
structure counted toward the minimum, while a burglary of a
car or boat did not.
</P>
<P>
Shepard had pleaded guilty to the burglaries, but the plea agreement
did not contain the necessary details about the crimes. Consequently,
the U.S. District Court in Boston refused the government's request
for the 15-year mandatory minimum on the ground that the
prosecution had not demonstrated that the burglaries were the relevant
kind. Shepard received a three-year sentence instead.
</P>
<P>
On the government's appeal, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
also in Boston, instructed the district court to look for
further evidence about the burglaries, including examining the original police
reports that formed the basis for the prosecutor's complaint. In
a subsequent decision, it ordered the district court to impose
the mandatory minimum sentence.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion overturning the appeals court's decision, Souter said the
Supreme Court's most relevant precedent, as well as more recent
developments -- a reference to the Apprendi decision -- meant
that the trial judge's inquiry should be limited to official
court records. In cases involving plea bargains, he said, that
meant the judge could look at the transcript of the
plea agreement or related findings of fact, but could not
go beyond the court files to look at police reports.
</P>
<P>
In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas said the time had
come to take up a direct challenge to the Apprendi
exception. "Innumerable criminal defendants have been unconstitutionally sentenced under the
flawed rule" that the court has maintained, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the decision,
Shepard v. United States, No. 03-9168, made "little sense" and
would "substantially frustrate Congress' scheme for punishing repeat violent offenders
who violate federal gun laws." O'Connor said that it was
a "commonsense inference" that Shepard's admitted burglaries had occurred in
buildings and that there was no reason to presume that
the state courts that accepted his guilty pleas had violated
their duty to inform themselves that his pleas had a
factual basis.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, whose opinion was joined by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and
Justice Stephen G. Breyer, noted that she had been a
dissenter from the Apprendi decision and subsequent rulings that expanded
on it. "It is a battle I have lost," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She said the court was now moving "into new territory that
Apprendi and succeeding cases had expressly and consistently disclaimed."
</P>
<P>
O'Connor added, "Today's decision reads Apprendi to cast a shadow possibly
implicating recidivism determinations, which until now had been safe from
such formalism."
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist did not take part in this
case.
</P>
<P>
There were these other developments at the court on Monday:
</P>
<P>
JUVENILE DEATH PENALTY
</P>
<P>
The court set aside death sentences for six men on death
row in four states for crimes they committed before the
age of 18. The actions, certain to be followed by
others, were necessitated by the court's ruling last week in
Roper v. Simmons that the execution of those who committed
crimes as juveniles violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel
and unusual punishments. Three of the six were from Texas,
while the others were from Virginia, Alabama and Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
PRISONERS' SUITS
</P>
<P>
The court ruled by a vote of 8-1 that state prisoners
challenging parole procedures or other procedural aspects of prison life
can use a Reconstruction-era civil rights statute to get into
federal court rather than the considerably more restrictive habeas corpus
statute. Breyer wrote the opinion in Wilkinson v. Dotson, No.
03-287, and Kennedy was the lone dissenter.
</P>
<P>
The distinction the court drew Monday, while technical, has considerable practical
importance for prisoners. The decision affirmed a ruling by the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Cincinnati, which Ohio
prison officials had appealed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
In order to file a habeas corpus petition, which challenges the
constitutionality of a conviction or sentence, a prisoner must first
exhaust any procedures the state might offer. But there is
no such requirement for going directly to federal court under
the Civil Rights Act of 1871, better known as Section
1983. Breyer said that prisoners bringing a challenge that, if
successful, would simply get them a hearing or other procedural
remedy should not be forced to use habeas corpus because
they were not seeking the relief that habeas corpus provides,
namely their freedom.
