<P>
In banning capital punishment for juvenile offenders
last week, the Supreme Court once again demonstrated its pivotal role
in domestic and, indeed, world affairs.
</P>
<P>
The 5 to 4 ruling swept aside laws in 20 states that permitted
juries to sentence 16- or 17-year-old murderers to death, thus ending
the United States' status as the last country on Earth that sanctioned
the execution of those who commit crimes when they are younger than
18.
</P>
<P>
And, to a large extent, this result was due to a remarkable
evolution by a single justice: Anthony Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
It is sometimes said that justices ``grow in office,'' producing
opinions and casting votes that confound the expectations of those who
appointed them. Kennedy, 68, a 1988 appointee of President Ronald
Reagan, has previously shown his unpredictability. He changed his mind
in the middle of a crucial 1992 case, casting a fifth vote to uphold
Roe v. Wade;@ he disappointed conservatives again with a landmark
pro-gay-rights opinion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Liberals gnashed their teeth when Kennedy flirted with permitting
the Florida recount to continue in 2000 -- before casting a fifth vote
to shut it down and propel George W. Bush into the White House.
</P>
<P>
But it isn't often that a justice reconsiders his past views on a
major issue as thoroughly as Kennedy did last week, when he supplied
the court's four-justice liberal bloc the fifth vote it needed to
abolish the death penalty for juveniles.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, during his first full term, Kennedy voted with a
five-justice majority to uphold the death penalty for juvenile
offenders. In that case, Stanford v. Kentucky,@ he joined an opinion
by fellow Reagan appointee Antonin Scalia.
</P>
<P>
Reaching the opposite result in last week's case, Roper v.
Simmons,@ Kennedy, writing for the majority, argued that times have
changed. The number of states that either have no capital punishment
or do not allow it for offenders under 18 had reached 30 -- evidence,
Kennedy wrote, of ``a national consensus'' against the juvenile death
penalty that had emerged since Stanford.
</P>
<P>
But his opinion also repudiated the legal reasoning he embraced in
Scalia's opinion 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
For example, the 1989 opinion calculated ``national consensus''
differently, excluding non-death-penalty states from the count; last
week, Kennedy wrote that Stanford was wrong about that.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Scalia, with Kennedy's support, wrote there was ``no
relevance'' to laws that set 18 or more as the legal age for adult
activities such as drinking and voting -- and that it was ``absurd'' to
consider them.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Kennedy appended to his opinion a list of state laws
setting the age for voting, jury service or marriage without parental
consent at 18 or above. ``The age of 18 is the point where society
draws the line for many purposes between childhood and adulthood,''
Kennedy wrote. ``It is, we conclude, the age at which the line for
death eligibility ought to rest.''
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Kennedy agreed with Scalia in brushing aside scientific
studies on the relative immaturity of adolescents. Such data could not
prove capital punishment fails to deter all 16- and 17-year-olds, or
that juveniles are inherently less morally blameworthy than adults;
judgments about deterrence and blameworthiness should be left up to
legislatures and juries, the Scalia-Kennedy opinion said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, though, Kennedy cited ``scientific and sociological
studies'' for the proposition that ``it would be misguided to equate
the failings of a minor with those of an adult.'' The weighing of such
factors could not be left up to juries, Kennedy wrote, because there
is ``an unacceptable likelihood'' that jurors would be
``overpower(ed)'' by the brutal details of some teen-age crimes.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy had joined Scalia in 1989 in ``emphatically rejecting'' the
suggestion that the court could apply its ``own informed judgment'' to
the question of whether death is too harsh a punishment for any
juvenile crime. Last week, he wrote that that part of Stanford had
been ``inconsistent with prior ... decisions.''
</P>
<P>
And, although he had joined Scalia in 1989 in ``rejecting the
contention ... that the sentencing practices of other countries are
relevant,'' this time Kennedy wrote that ``it is proper that we
acknowledge the overwhelming weight of international opinion against
the juvenile death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Scalia's dissent in Roper@ last week took aim at
Kennedy, though not by name.
</P>
<P>
``The votes in today's case demonstrate that the offending of
selected lawyers' moral sentiments is not a predictable basis for law
-- much less a democratic one,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
Invoking the motto that adorns the court's main entrance, Scalia,
68, added, ``What kind of Equal Justice under Law is it that -- without
so much as a 'Sorry about that' -- gives as the basis for sparing one
person from execution arguments explicitly rejected in refusing to
spare another?''
</P>
<P>
But Justice John Paul Stevens, the only member of the court's
current liberal bloc who was on the bench in 1989, and who has now
lived to see his dissent in Stanford@ become the law of the land,
fired back in defense of Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
Stevens, 84, wrote that if Scalia's view of the Bill of Rights --
that its meaning was fixed by the common-law standards of 1791 -- were
to prevail, there would be nothing unconstitutional about the
execution of a 7-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
''(T)hat our understanding of the Constitution does change from
time to time has been settled since John Marshall breathed life into
its text,'' Stevens wrote.
