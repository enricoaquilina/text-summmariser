Kyoto Treaty Powers Up U.S. Alternative Energy Companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States has not joined the Kyoto Protocol to cut
greenhouse gases, but the pact nevertheless is boosting sales for
American companies that market ``clean'' energy technologies.
</P>
<P>
The spread of renewable-energy standards -- particularly in Europe
-- propelled by the treaty, along with a surge in oil and gas prices,
havetriggered a boom in business for solar and wind energy companies.
</P>
<P>
When Solar Integrated Technologies Inc. opened an office in Germany
last spring, for example, the salespeople were allocated enough solar
roofing material to provide one megawatt of power. In six weeks, they
were sold out. Within a month, they had orders for 16 megawatts more.
</P>
<P>
``It's a no-brainer to do business in solar in Europe,'' said Jon
Slangerup, chief executive of Solar Integrated, whose 120 employees
are producing about one mile of solar roofing panels a week at a plant
in South Los Angeles. ``The only question is: How much can you
allocate and how fast can you install it?''
</P>
<P>
In Germany, the world's leading solar energy market, farmers are
replacing crops with fields of solar panels, thanks to a government
buyback program for renewable energy that spurred 150 percent growth
in solar installations in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Britain, France and Spain also have introduced aggressive plans to
reduce their production of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping
gases over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
``Every available (solar) module is going to Germany,'' said Rhone
Resch, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association in
Washington, D.C. ``It's Google-like growth.''
</P>
<P>
A world leader in renewable energy less than a decade ago, the
United States is now viewed as a laggard. At the United Nations
Climate Change Conference in Montreal this month, Canadian Prime
Minister Paul Martin accused the U.S. of lacking a ``global
conscience'' for refusing to sign the Kyoto treaty, which requires
developed countries to slash their greenhouse gas emissions below 1990
levels by 2012.
</P>
<P>
Craig Stevens, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Energy, said
the Bush administration recognized that climate change was a ``serious
long-term issue.''
</P>
<P>
But he said the best way to address that concern was by developing
cleaner, more environmentally friendly forms of fossil-fuel-generated
energy and nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
Stevens said renewable energy would be an ``important part'' of the
nation's energy mix, which was why the government was planning to
invest $391 million next year in solar, wind, hydroelectric and
geothermal energy projects.
</P>
<P>
State and local governments don't think the Bush administration is
moving fast enough. Twenty states have established standards to
guarantee that a certain portion of the energy they use comes from
renewable-energy sources.
</P>
<P>
California is already the world's third-largest market for solar
energy and the nation's leading producer of wind-generated power.
</P>
<P>
The state agreed earlier this month to spend an additional $300
million in subsidies to put solar energy panels on as many as 1
million rooftops over the next 11 years.
</P>
<P>
``California clearly has been a U.S. leader,'' said Ron Pernick,
co-founder of Clean Edge Inc., a West Coast energy consulting company
that predicts that the market for solar photovoltaics, wind power and
fuel cells will reach $15 billion a year by 2014.
</P>
<P>
Unless domestic production expands quickly, Californians hoping to
jump aboard the solar bandwagon could face lengthy delays, according
to solar experts. They said the strong demand from Europe had taken up
much of the U.S. production.
</P>
<P>
Investors are scrambling to get a piece of the renewable-energy
action, sending the stocks of California companies such as Solar
Integrated and Clipper Windpower Inc. . Both companies are listed on
the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market, where
investors have shown a strong appetite for ``green'' companies.
</P>
<P>
Slangerup, who had just returned from a European investment tour,
said governments in Europe were betting that having a strong
renewable-energy base would be a competitive advantage in the future.

Solar Integrated produces a commercial roofing material that uses
photovoltaic cells to produce about four watts of electricity per
square foot. Although it costs more to produce a kilowatt of
electricity with this method, companies can use government subsidies
to offset their capital outlays. Those include a 30 percent federal
tax credit on the cost of installation, rebates from the state and
renewable-energy credits that can be used to offset fees or fines.
</P>
<P>
``You turn a roof into a performing asset that has a guaranteed
energy stream over 20 years,'' said Slangerup, whose customers include
Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and commercial real
estate developer ProLogis. ``It becomes a real powerful selling
proposition.''
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the cost of solar systems would drop by
two-thirds over the next five years, thanks to technical improvements.

Rising natural gas prices have made wind technology another
increasingly attractive option. This year, wind power companies are
expected to spend close to $3 billion installing 2,500 megawatts of
new capacity in the U.S., a 40 percent increase over the previous
year, according to Patrick Caramante, vice president of U.S.
operations for British-based Garrad Hassan, one of the world's leading
wind energy research companies.
</P>
<P>
Jim Dehlsen, founder of Clipper Technology, said, ``The U.S. market
has come to life,'' now that wind turbines can produce a kilowatt of
electricity for 4.5 to 5 cents, compared with 9 to 9.5 cents for a new
natural gas turbine project.
</P>
<P>
(Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
Dehlsen's first entrepreneurial venture was Zond Corp., which was
sold to Enron Corp. in 1997 and eventually ended up in the hands of
General Electric Co. G.E. Energy is now the country's leading wind
power provider.
</P>
<P>
Clipper Technology recently opened an assembly plant in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, where Dehlsen expects to produce five of his high-power
Liberty wind turbines this year and 150 in 2006. Those turbines, which
are designed to operate even when wind is low, cost about $2.5 million
each and can generate enough electricity over a 30-year life span to
power 1,250 homes.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Some people complain about the visual blight and noise created by
wind turbines. But Dehlsen said wind power generation was far less
damaging to the environment than fossil fuels, which produce high
levels of greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
In addition, wind power could bring jobs to depressed farming and
industrial areas. Dehlsen said. Germany, in less than six years, has
installed enough wind projects to generate 14,000 megawatts of power
and employ 75,000 people.
</P>
<P>
``The U.S. has a huge wind energy resource,'' he said. ``There are
four states alone ... that could supply all of the electricity needs
of the country.''
</P>
<P>
Although most of his sales have been in the U.S., Dehlsen sees huge
opportunities in Europe and the developing world. He said he was
negotiating deals in Eastern Europe, Latin America and China, with an
eye on capturing 12 percent to 15 percent of the global market.
</P>
<P>
But Dehlsen and other renewable-energy advocates said the lack of
government support was threatening U.S. technological leadership,
pointing to reduced support for the National Renewable Energy Lab in
Golden, Colo., the primary provider of government research funds.
</P>
<P>
Stepped-up interest from venture capitalists and Wall Street
investors has provided seed money for entrepreneurs in the U.S. But
once they have mastered the technology, many companies are shifting
their manufacturing to countries where governments are providing
investment incentives and an assurance of long-term demand.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. share of global production of photovoltaic cells has
dropped from 45 percent in 1996 to 8 percent today, according to the
Solar Energy Industries Association.
</P>
<P>
Evergreen Solar Inc., one of the nation's leading solar companies,
developed its modules at a facility in Marlboro, Mass., where it
employs 250 people. But the company sells three-quarters of its
product in Germany and plans to invest more than $50 million in a
production plant there that will employ 400 people.
</P>
<P>
``We will eventually build a plant here in the U.S.,'' said Tim
Woodward, a board member of Evergreen and managing director of Nth
Power, a San Francisco-based venture capital company. ``But the market
demand is not great enough here for us to justify really expanding
aggressively in the U.S. market.''
