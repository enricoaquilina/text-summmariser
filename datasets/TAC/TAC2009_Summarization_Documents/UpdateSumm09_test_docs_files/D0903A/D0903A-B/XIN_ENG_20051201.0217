Company Limited and BP SunOasis (Prime) Company Limited, which 
together will manufacture, market and sell solar photovoltaic (PV)
products and systems in China.

Based in Xi'an, capital of West China's Shaanxi Province, the 
joint venture will enjoy a 25-megawatt manufacturing capacity. It 
has a total registered capital of over 10 million US dollars and 
the equity percentage split between SunOasis and BP Solar is 51 to
49, according to BP.

The joint venture represents an excellent opportunity for BP 
Solar to position itself and grow in the growing solar PV market 
by expanding its manufacturing network.

According to BP, the joint venture will focus on providing 
access to sustainable power in remote rural areas throughout China,
as well as the developing grid-connect market.

opportunity for SunOasis and BP Solar, both of which share a 
common vision for the long-term solar potential in China.
