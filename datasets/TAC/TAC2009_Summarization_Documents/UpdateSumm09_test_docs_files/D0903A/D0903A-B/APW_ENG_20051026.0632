<P>
The Portuguese government has granted an operating license for a huge solar
energy power station that its backers claim will be the world's
largest.
</P>
<P>
The Economy and Innovation Ministry said Wednesday it approved a project to
install solar panels over 114 hectares (280 acres) in southeastern Portugal, one
of Europe's sunniest spots.
</P>
<P>
The power plant, costing euro250 million (US$302 million), is to have a capacity
of 62 megawatts when it comes on line in 2007. The electricity it generates is
to be fed into the national grid.
</P>
<P>
The project was developed by Amper Central Solar, a company 90-percent owned by
the town council of Moura, where the plant is to be built. The region is one of
Europe's poorest.
</P>
<P>
BP Solar is to provide the panels and also will set up a nearby solar panel
factory employing 115 people. The factory is expected to achieve an annual
turnover of euro63 million (US$76 million).
</P>
<P>
The government is encouraging the development of renewable energy sources to
reduce the nation's dependence on imported oil.
</P>
<P>
Portugal has no oil, natural gas or coal. It imports about 86 percent of its
energy, according to government figures, and high oil prices are hindering
efforts to revive the stagnant economy.
