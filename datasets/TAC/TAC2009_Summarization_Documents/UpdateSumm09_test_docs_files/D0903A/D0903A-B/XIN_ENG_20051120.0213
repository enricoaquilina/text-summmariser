Italy will help Beijing build a 
solar energy system for the city's Olympic Village, supplying hot 
water and electricity for the Games in 2008 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
Corrado Clini, a top official from the Italian Ministry for the
Environment, said Italy will invest a total of 4 million euros 
(4.7 million US dollars) in the project, according to Monday's 
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The solar energy system will be jointly constructed by the 
Guoao Investment and Development Co. Ltd of China, and Italy's 
Merloni TermoSanitari International Trading Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The project will supply hot water and electricity to 16,000 
people during the Games. After the event, the system will supply 
2,000 apartments, housing around 6,000 people, the China Daily 
reported.

<P>
The project is one of the co-operative projects included in a 
Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Co-operation signed 
between the Italian ministry and Beijing's municipal government in
2002.
</P>
<P>
It will "help Beijing fulfill its commitment to the Green 
Olympics," said Pei Chenghu, vice-director of Beijing's 
Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
However, solar energy will not be the only energy source for 
the Olympic Village, and other energy supply systems are prepared,
Clini said.

<P>
Since 2002, Italy has invested nearly 40 million euros (47 
million US dollars) in helping Beijing improve its environment in 
17 projects, the newspaper said.
