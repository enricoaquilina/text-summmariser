TURNING SOLAR POWER INTO AN EVERYDAY AFFAIR

<P>
If solar power is going to become commonplace
in the United States, more people like Aaron Dyer are
going to have to buy it.
</P>
<P>
Dyer, 34, is a firefighter in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. He has
a truck and a motorcycle. He's a big-time snowmobiler. He's
an average guy.
</P>
<P>
The only thing unusual with Dyer is that he has installed
32 solar panels on the roof of his garage. They
generate about 500 kilowatt hours of electricity a month for
his newly built home here. He turned on the system
Sept. 16. It generates enough electricity to supply 90 percent
to 100 percent of his electricity needs, saving him roughly
$60 a month.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't wait to turn it on," Dyer said. "It was
pretty awesome really. It still is."
</P>
<P>
Dyer has had an interest in solar energy for years. So
when he started planning to build his house a few
years ago, he contacted Renewable Power Systems LLC, an Averill
Park, N.Y,, company that sells solar electricity -- or photovoltaic
-- systems.
</P>
<P>
Dyer worked with Renewable Power to make sure he oriented his
garage so that the solar panels would have southern exposure
for maximum electrical production. They also helped him design the
system so that he would be eligible for grants and
tax breaks through New York State's photovoltaic incentive program.
</P>
<P>
Dyer paid $20,000 for the system using a home equity loan.
But he estimates that the money he paid was less
than half of the true cost of the system because
he qualified for a financial assistance program through the New
York State Energy Research and Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
The program pays $4 per watt of a system, as long
as it is tied to the state electricity grid. He
also is eligible for up to $3,750 in state tax
credits over five years that the state gives to people
who buy solar power generation equipment.
</P>
<P>
Dyer is part of a new breed of solar energy user.
Many of the initial adopters of the technology are people
in their 50s and 60s who lived through the 1970s
oil crisis.
</P>
<P>
But Michael Stangl, co-owner of Renewable Power, said Dyer is part
of a new generation that is not only interested in
conservation but is also extremely savvy when it comes to
their finances and combating rising energy costs.
</P>
<P>
"Somehow they picked up on the fact that energy is an
important issue in our lives," Stangl said. "He's kind of
like the second generation."
</P>
<P>
Stangl's company is benefiting from solar energy becoming more popular with
people like Dyer. Renewable Power has sold 15 large residential
solar power systems this year costing between $25,000 and $50,000,
and it hopes to be selling two per month by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
But the market has a lot more potential. Dyer still represents
a small group of Americans who are getting their electricity
from solar power. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration,
of the 3.9 million gigawatt hours of electricity generated in
the United States last year, only 597 gigawatt hours came
from solar power. Most electricity in the U.S. is generated
by the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The key to adding more solar power to the mix is
making the technology cheaper, said Pradeep Haldar, director of the
State University of New York at Albany's Energy and Environmental
Technology Applications Center, which is part of Albany NanoTech. Haldar
said that solar energy systems cost between $8 and $10
per watt, but it would be "compelling" if the price
could go down to $3 or $4 per watt.
</P>
<P>
"It's getting better and better," said Haldar. "I think it's a
matter of time."
</P>
<P>
The center, also known as E2TAC, is working with companies like
DayStar Technologies Inc on the next generation of solar panel
technologies that could be cheaper than the current silicon technology.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons that new technologies are needed is because
of a silicon shortage that is driving up prices. According
to Paul Maycock, a nationally-recognized solar energy expert in Warrenton,
Va., demand for silicon by the semiconductor industry and explosive
growth of the solar industry, have caused silicon prices to
double for the solar cell industry to more than $40
a kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Some consumers are moving to solar gradually. Oleg Ivanov of Grafton,
N.Y., said he plans to spend a small amount --
up to $5,000 -- for a solar energy system that
will store energy in batteries. The 34-year-old information technology audit
consultant has been testing how the system works with small
solar panels he bought that are designed to charge boat
and car batteries. He envisions a system that would provide
between 300 and 500 watts of energy to supplement the
electricity he buys from his utility.
</P>
<P>
"This way I can use less from the grid," he said.
</P>
<P>
Builders may hold another key to developing the solar energy market.
Michael Eidens, a former Schenectady, N.Y., judge who is now
running for county legislator, is building a 3,000-square-foot house. The
construction firm he hired, Stewart Construction Inc., worked closely with
Renewable Power, which installed a 3.34 kilowatt solar system on
the home's roof. Stewart Construction is building the home as
an Energy Star home, a designation New York gives to
homes that meet certain energy efficiency criteria.
</P>
<P>
"To make a big impact, you've got to work with builders,"
said Stangl, of Renewable Power. "At the moment, we don't
have a lot of builders doing it."
</P>
<P>
Philip LaRocque, executive vice president of the New York State Builders
Association, said his group is extremely supportive of building energy-efficient
homes and the Energy Star program. He said builders are
more than happy to incorporate solar panels in homes if
customers want it.
</P>
<P>
"We do live and breathe it," he said.
