With well-developed wafer and
semiconductor industries, Taiwan has great promise in solar energy
development, the chief executive officer of Taiwan's leading
crystalline silicon solar cell manufacturing company said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with CNA, Motech Industries Inc.
President Leo Cheng said he urged the government to invest more in
solar energy research when his company began investing in the field
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is very suitable for solar power development because it
has the world's best wafer fabrication plants and a large number of
skilled engineers. With this precious asset, I see no other country
better equipped than Taiwan to develop solar energy," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Cheng said, more and more local companies
have got involved in solar energy development, enhancing the
possibility of forming a comprehensive industry supply chain.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we can develop a complete supply chain, the solar
energy industry will become yet another of Taiwan's star industries
like the electronics industry," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Motech Industries Inc., founded in 1981 and formerly known as
Meter International Corp., is a leading Taiwanese manufacturer
specializing in high-end test and measurement instruments. Over the
past 20 years, Motech Industries has expanded its product base to
become one of the most reputable test and measurement manufacturers
in Taiwan, with a growing international presence.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Motech received permission to set up its Solar
Electricity Division (Motech Solar) in the South Taiwan Science Park.
</P>
<P>
Motech Solar is Taiwan's first manufacturer specializing in the
production of crystalline silicon solar cells.
</P>
<P>
Its main products include multi- and mono-crystalline silicon
solar cells with dimensions of 125mm x 125mm and 156mm x 156mm.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said Motech Solar plans to further expand its production
capacity by the end of 2005.
</P>
<P>
Motech Solar has also started a pilot production line for wafer
slicing to reduce cost and increase the supply of silicon wafers,
Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cheng went on, Motech Solar plans to begin the
construction of a second factory building for future expansion in
solar wafer and cell manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
"One of our goals is to become the lowest-cost solar cell
manufacturer in the world," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
With the Kyoto Protocol taking effect and crude oil prices
skyrocketing, Cheng said there is a resurgence of interest in solar
energy. As a result, upstream solar energy materials have been in
short supply and he predicted that investment in upstream solar
energy materials production will reap certain dividends.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to invest more in solar energy research
and provide incentives to encourage private investment in the field
so that Taiwan can develop a complete solar energy supply chain soon.
Cheng further said his company is expected to rank among the world's
top five solar energy firms by 2008.
