A team from Holland, known 
more for its windmills than its sunshine, on Wednesday won a 
four-day international solar-powered car race across Australia's 
deserts, notching up their third straight victory.
</P>
<P>
High-tech cars from Australia, the United States and Japan were 
hot on its heels as the sliver-shaped, space-age Nuna 3 arrived in 
the southern city of Adelaide after the 3,000 kilometre (1,860 mile) 
race, organiser Chris Selwood told AFP.

<P>
Shunning petrol, sucking up the sun and racing at speeds up to 
120 kilometres (74 miles) an hour, 20 cars from 10 countries set out 
from Darwin in Australia's far north on Sunday in the eighth World 
Solar Challenge.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch team behind Nuna 3 appeared to have broken its own 
record of 30 hours and 54 minutes set during the last race in 2003, 
Selwood said.
</P>
<P>
The "Challenge", to design and build a car capable of crossing 
Australia on the power of daylight, was launched in 1987 and teams 
and individuals from corporations and universities throughout the 
world take part.

<P>
Australian entry Aurora 101, which came second in the last two 
races, was holding on to the same position this year while a car 
from the University of Michigan, which won the North American Solar 
Challenge in July, was in third place, Selwood said.
</P>
<P>
A team from Ashiya University in Osaka, Japan, which qualified 
fastest with its Sky Ace Tiga car, was running fourth.
</P>
<P>
Tail-enders still making their way through the vast Outback 
could reach the finish line a day later.
</P>
<P>
The teams raced from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm each day through some of 
Australia's most forbidding terrain on the main Stuart Highway from 
Darwin to Adelaide before camping each night where they were in the 
desert.
</P>
<P>
Event spokeswoman Rowena Austin said the challenge was an 
important testing ground for alternative fuel technologies.
</P>
<P>
"It's particularly relevant with the oil price where it is at 
the moment," she said.
