OIL PRICES HERALD NEW DAY IN THE SUN FOR SOLAR POWER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As prices for coal, natural gas and oil have soared, solar
power has been getting perhaps its most serious look from
investors since President Carter pulled on a cardigan and asked
Americans to damp their furnaces. The new interest means that
the handful of domestic solar stocks has been surging, too.
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, the shares of Evergreen Solar, DayStar Technologies,
Energy Conversion Devices and Spire -- all small domestic companies
that make equipment for converting solar power into electricity --
have more than doubled in price. In August, Cypress Semiconductor
said it would try to raise as much as $100
million in an initial public offering for its SunPower subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
"The solar market is projected to grow 35 percent a year
for the next three to five years," said Walter V.
Nasdeo, managing director of Ardour Capital, an investment bank in
New York that specializes in energy companies. "As these technologies
get better, we're seeing things being developed like solar panels
integrated into roofing tiles. That way, they don't look like
a science project hanging on your roof."
</P>
<P>
Back in the days of Carter's cardigan, the country was mired
in an energy crisis, with an oil embargo and long
lines at gas stations. Today, tumult in oil-producing places like
the Middle East and Venezuela is roiling markets. Strong demand
for electricity has contributed to increases in the prices of
coal and natural gas. And Hurricane Katrina, of course, has
worsened the situation. Yet these dire developments have been a
boon for companies that make devices like silicon wafers and
rooftop panels that convert solar energy.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the economics of the solar business did not tempt
many consumers or investors. Without government or utility subsidies, the
$20,000 to $25,000 that it costs to buy and install
a typical home solar-power system may be too high to
be recouped at the end of a 30-year mortgage.
</P>
<P>
But government help, combined with the recent climb in energy prices,
has made solar more appealing. Some states offer big subsidies,
helping to defray much of the initial cost of a
home system.
</P>
<P>
Some electric utilities also offer incentives. In theory, solar-energy systems free
them from having to invest in additional generating capacity. Homeowners
typically connect their systems to the power grid and buy
electricity when their panels do not produce enough power; they
sell electricity to their utility when they have a surplus.
</P>
<P>
Federal law requires utilities to buy excess power generated by consumers
using solar power, although rates vary from state to state,
said Joseph E. Schwartz, chief executive and technical editor of
Home Power magazine. And the new federal energy law, signed
by President Bush last month, includes a tax credit of
as much as $2,000 for the purchase and installation of
a residential solar-power system.
</P>
<P>
"Despite all of the concerns about imported oil and climate change,
most people make their decision to install solar based on
whether they're going to save money," said Steven C. Taub,
director of emerging power generation technologies at Cambridge Energy Research
Associates.
</P>
<P>
In states with generous subsidies, he said, solar power may be
attractive for many consumers. In New Jersey, for example, subsidies
can cover as much as 70 percent of the cost,
leaving consumers with a net cost of about $6,000 on
a typical home system.
</P>
<P>
Though the four little domestic solar-power companies stand to benefit from
new demand for power, they account for only a fraction
of the world's solar-device production. The biggest of the four,
Energy Conversion Devices, has a market capitalization of only about
$1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
Giants like BP and Royal Dutch Shell in the energy industry,
or Sharp and Kyocera in electronics, make most solar gear.
Last year, the solar industry produced 1,195 megawatts of new
electricity-generation capacity, about the equivalent of one large power plant,
Taub said. Sharp alone accounted for about 325 megawatts, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Yet solar energy conversion is a tiny part of these hefty
companies' sales, so the little independents are a purer play.
The business lines of Evergreen and DayStar are almost entirely
related to solar power (as are those of Cypress' SunPower).
Energy Conversion Devices has other products, but its largest subsidiary,
United Solar Ovonics, also known as Uni-Solar, is a solar-power
business. And Spire's solar division accounted for an average of
40 percent of the company's sales in 2003 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
Of course, investing in small-capitalization stocks can be risky. Besides being
microbes in an industry dominated by giants, none of the
four independents were profitable last year. Two have short histories
as public companies: Evergreen went public in 2002, and DayStar
did so last year. All but Spire are developing new
solar technologies, and there is no guarantee that customers will
embrace their innovations.
</P>
<P>
Understanding their plans requires a bit of knowledge about the way
solar power works. The most popular means of converting the
sun's energy into electricity -- silicon-based solar panels -- has
progressed over the last three decades but has not changed
radically. Silicon is used to make wafers, which are wired
to create solar cells. These form the building blocks for
solar panels, which look like big storm windows as they
sit atop roofs and soak up the sun.
</P>
<P>
A silicon shortage has driven up the cost of solar-grade silicon
by more than 60 percent over the last two years,
said Michael Rogol, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia.
That offers an opportunity to companies like Evergreen and SunPower
that have devised more efficient ways to use silicon, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Evergreen's wafer-making method consumes about a third less silicon than usual,
said Richard M. Feldt, its president and chief executive. Many
competitors slice blocks of silicon into wafers; that creates waste
in the same way a lumberyard spits out sawdust. Evergreen's
method, which draws out long ribbons of silicon and slices
them with lasers, produces less waste.
</P>
<P>
Executives at Cypress Semiconductor in Sunnyvale, Calif., declined to be interviewed
because of an impending stock offering. But Rogol said its
SunPower unit makes the industry's most efficient cells, yielding 210
watts of power a square meter, versus 180 for a
typical cell.
</P>
<P>
DayStar, for its part, uses no silicon, while Uni-Solar uses far
less than average. DayStar, based in Halfmoon, N.Y., applies a
thin film of several elements, including copper, to backings such
as titanium foil to create flexible solar cells.
</P>
<P>
Uni-Solar marries the thin-film method with silicon. "Our panels are typically
18 feet long with an adhesive on the back," said
Subhendu Guha, its president. "You can stick it directly onto
the roof. With the traditional product, you have to have
a support structure."
</P>
<P>
Spire, in Bedford, Mass., produces neither silicon wafers nor solar cells.
It makes machinery for building and testing solar panels. In
1999, that enabled it to work with the city of
Chicago to equip and run a panel factory there. Roger
G. Little, Spire's chairman and chief executive, says he sees
the Chicago venture as a harbinger of Spire's future; he
aims to increase panel production over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
That would return Spire to its roots. The company started in
1969; early on, it concentrated on solar-power conversion. It diversified
into biomedical equipment and electronics after the energy crisis of
the late 1970s abated and enthusiasm for solar power cooled.
"The market tanked," Little recalled. Even so, he remained confident.
</P>
<P>
"I've always believed that solar is a freight train that can't
be stopped," he said. "It started small, but the compound
annual growth rate for the last 10 years has been
20 percent. This year, there's a $10 billion worldwide market
for systems."
