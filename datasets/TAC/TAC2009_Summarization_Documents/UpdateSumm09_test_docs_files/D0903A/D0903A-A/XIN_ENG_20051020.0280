<P>
Italy has unveiled Europe's first 
solar-power train, according to Italian News Agency ANSA on 
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The solar panels on the train's roof do not drive it but 
provide energy for its air conditioning, illumination and safety 
systems.
</P>
<P>
Italian Environment Minister Altero Matteoli said the first ten
prototypes would pave the way for "significant" developments in 
the future.
</P>
<P>
The CEO of Italian train company Trenitalia, Roberto Testore, 
said it was "looking with interest to the solar power sector, with
a view to producing vehicles on an industrial scale."
</P>
<P>
Solar panels are already used to provide a portion of train 
power in Japan. A miniature railway in Wales is wholly powered by 
solar energy.
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's presentation, Testore also said Trenitalia was 
investing heavily to renew its fleet and raise safety levels.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of accidents had dropped by half in the last
eight years.
