The Solar Backpack: Is It a Bright Idea?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was an invention just waiting to be patented. With electronic
devices hitting the trails, someone had to put on the market a neat,
portable source of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Voila! The solar backpack. It sounds ungainly, but two companies
have made a go of it.
</P>
<P>
Clear Blue Hawaii offers the Blue Sun Solarpac ($260, battery not
included) and Voltaic Systems offers the Voltaic Backpack ($229,
battery included).
</P>
<P>
Both can charge your GPS unit and other gadgets while you hike,
bike or sit using an internal battery, and both can charge direct from
the solar cells in daylight. They are also the same size -- 1,850
cubic inches.
</P>
<P>
But beyond these similarities, the packs are quite different, which
can be challenging for the consumer. First, Blue Sun's solar panel,
batteries and harness can be removed and used with other Clear Blue
Hawaii products, saving $200 on a second bag. The same items in the
Voltaic are fixed.
</P>
<P>
Second, while both packs operate with an internal lithium-ion
battery, each battery option is slightly different. The Blue Sun can
accept a $50 or $150 lithium-ion battery; the $150 battery stores more
electricity and has a wider output (up to 12 volts) than the $50
battery (up to 7.2 volts). Voltaic's battery, which ranges from 3.5-
to 7.2-volts, can't match Blue Sun's $150 battery in output or output
range, nor can it match Blue Sun's $50 battery in overall output but
bests it in output range.
</P>
<P>
Blue Sun's solar panel yields twice the power of Voltaic's three
panels when tested in identical conditions. In addition, the type of
panel that Blue Sun uses is more energy-efficient than Voltaic's
monocrystalline panels.
</P>
<P>
All that said, given the fact that the Blue Sun has a better solar
panel and batteries that yield more output, I would recommend the Blue
Sun pack. With its $50 battery, you can charge most of your
hand-helds, and if you purchase the $150 battery, you will be able to
recharge a 12-volt device, such as a satellite phone. But this
recommendation assumes you've got your heart set on a solar backpack.
</P>
<P>
The truth is, the limited size of these packs makes them
impractical for anything beyond overnight outings, where you could
easily pack extra batteries to meet your electrical needs.
</P>
<P>
But on outings lasting a week or more, these packs could save users
from having to haul 10 pounds or so in batteries (even though you
couldn't use the packs because you wouldn't have enough space for the
provisions you'd need).
</P>
<P>
When Clear Blue Hawaii and Voltaic Systems produce solar packs at
least three times the size of these, they will have a product with
real appeal to backpackers. Until then, the Blue Sun and Voltaic
backpacks are little more than novelty items with the promise of
useful packs to come.
