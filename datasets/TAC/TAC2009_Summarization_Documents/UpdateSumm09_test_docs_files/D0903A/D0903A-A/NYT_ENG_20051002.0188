Soaring energy prices and bright sunny days are
giving new meaning to the gold in "Golden State." On
a day when their morning newspapers reported a projected 70
percent increase in natural gas bills, more than 160 central
San Joaquin Valley residents spent Saturday checking out the possibilities
of generating their own electricity through solar power.
</P>
<P>
As the sun pushed temperatures into the 80s and low 90s,
these conservation-minded citizens toured nine homes and two commercial locations
that are converting sunlight to electricity through photovoltaic cells. People
taking the tour said they were concerned about rising energy
bills and wanted to see how much money they could
save by going solar.
</P>
<P>
"It's about cost and future costs," said Randy Neely of Fresno,
when asked about his interest in solar energy systems. "If
the break-even point for solar systems is 12-13 years in
today's dollars, imagine what it's going to be in the
future if the price of oil keeps going up."
</P>
<P>
Neely said that with the possibility of a solar power system
paying for itself in fewer years, given the current energy
price situation, he and his wife, Nola, are seriously considering
installing photovoltaic roof panels on their next house.
</P>
<P>
"That's why the tour is so beneficial," said Nola Neely. "You
get to take a look at real homes and ask
the homeowners what is good about their systems and what
they wish they would have done differently."
</P>
<P>
Allen and Mary Jones of Fresno have long been aware of
the benefits of solar power. For years, Allen Jones has
used a solar oven for cooking.
</P>
<P>
"I've been looking at solar power systems for a long time
but so far I haven't seen the payoff," he says.
When he does, Jones says, he won't hesitate to go
solar.
</P>
<P>
With energy costs on the rise, more and more people will
be looking for ways to reduce their power bills, said
Jeff Adolph of Fresno.
</P>
<P>
Adolph, the facilities energy manager for Pacific Gas and Electric Co.,
has done all he can to reduce his home energy
bill, including taking advantage of PG&amp;E's time-of-use rates, which are
lower when electricity is not used from noon to 6
p.m. For years, Adolph's family has gone without air conditioning
during hot summer afternoons.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking into solar energy as a way to be a
little more comfortable in the summer," he says.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's self-guided solar home tour, the first of its kind in
the central San Joaquin Valley, was sponsored by the city
of Fresno, American Solar Energy Society, Northern California Solar Energy
Association and the Great Valley Center.
</P>
<P>
Interest in solar energy is increasing rapidly in California, said Mark
Stout, a clean-energy consultant from Fresno and coordinator of the
tour.
</P>
<P>
"In 2001, we were generating 10 megawatts of solar electricity in
the state," he said. "Today it's over 100 megawatts."
</P>
<P>
A megawatt is 1 million watts of electricity, or enough energy
to power 300 homes.
</P>
<P>
Stout said there are some 500 solar electricity systems in operation
in Fresno and Madera counties, up dramatically from a few
years ago when there were just a handful of installations.
</P>
<P>
Given increasing electric rates, decreasing costs of solar panels and economic
incentives available to homeowners through tax credits and rebates, Stout
expects installations of solar power systems to increase rapidly in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Using the sun to generate electricity is producing big energy savings
for OK Produce, said general manager Brady Matoian, whose massive
commercial solar power system drew several visitors Saturday. In 2002,
the company installed 35,000 square feet of photovoltaic cells on
the roof of its building in downtown Fresno. The system,
the largest of its kind in the Valley, has reduced
energy consumption by nearly half and produced an annual savings
of $65,000.
</P>
<P>
Matoian participated in the tour as a way to help get
the word out to people about the benefits of solar
power.
</P>
<P>
"Solar energy works perfectly in the Valley," he said. "We get
nine months of sunshine every year. Our agriculture is based
on the sun. What we're doing on the roof is
farming the sun. It makes perfect sense."
