A GROWING INTEREST IN SOLAR ENERGY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first Saturday in October was clear, dry and drenched in
bright sunlight -- ideal for the solar panels converting light
to electricity at Harry Kubetz and Gary Burton's home in
Northport, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
"Today is a peak power day," Burton said, looking up at
a rooftop covered with 80 solar panels. "We're probably producing
enough power to meet our demand for the day."
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to the digital meter on the side of
the house, the panels were making more electricity than the
house needed. A small black arrow pointed left, indicating that
excess electricity was being sent back to the Long Island
Power Authority.
</P>
<P>
The Northport home was one of 67 stops on a solar
energy tour across Long Island. The free tour, set up
by Renewable Energy Long Island, an alternative energy advocacy group,
was self-guided, covering residences and businesses with solar systems in
Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
</P>
<P>
Lower prices for solar equipment, higher efficiency and tax and rebate
incentives from government and utility companies have caused more Long
Islanders to look to lower their energy costs with solar
power.
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, demand "has skyrocketed" for these systems, said
Jonathan Lane, who owns Quad State Solar, the company that
installed the system for Kubetz and Burton. "Within the last
three months, there has been a huge increase in the
number of inquiries and in the number of sales," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Another sign that prices are going down and demand is increasing
is the lower rebate offered by the power authority. Kubetz
and Burton received $5 per watt for their 10 kilowatt
system -- or $50,000.
</P>
<P>
Their system cost $81,000 to install. Of that, a total of
$27,250 came out of their pockets after the rebate and
a state tax credit of $3,750, a maximum that will
rise to $5,000 in September 2006. A federal tax credit
of 30 percent of the cost of a solar system,
up to $2,000 for homes, will also apply after Jan.
1.
</P>
<P>
But today, with 560 homes and businesses powered by solar energy
on Long Island, the LIPA rebate is down to $4
per watt, and the utility expects to lower it further
to $3.75 in mid- to late 2006 if solar system
prices continue to go down, said Daniel Zaweski, the director
of energy efficiency and distributed generation programs at the power
authority.
</P>
<P>
The average 5 kilowatt residential solar system costs nearly $40,000 to
buy and install, according to Gordian Raacke, director of Renewable
Energy Long Island. The homeowner would pay about $15,000 after
a $20,000 LIPA rebate and state and federal tax credits.
</P>
<P>
Such a system can reduce electric bills by 20 to 100
percent, according to Sharon Laudisi of the Long Island Power
Authority, depending on the amount and duration of sunlight hitting
the solar panels and on electricity use in the home.
</P>
<P>
Solar energy systems, also called "PVs," short for photovoltaic cells, convert
sunlight to electricity without combustion, creating power without pollution. There
are also solar systems for heating water and pools.
</P>
<P>
Solar panels do not store energy, and they supply electricity only
when the sun is shining on them. Since most homes
have their solar systems connected to the LIPA grid, they
draw energy back from the authority at night or on
cloudy days, using the credits earned while supplying electricity during
the day.
</P>
<P>
Kubetz and Burton like the modern look that the sleek reflective
solar panels add to the back of their suburban ranch.
Besides saving about $2,000 a year on utility bills, there's
the matter of conscience.
</P>
<P>
"I could personally afford to pay a larger bill," Kubetz said,
"but I think Americans consume way too much energy."
