LAWMAKERS TEAM WITH ENVIRONMENTALISTS TO PUSH WIND, SOLAR ENERGY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Texas lawmakers are joining clean-energy advocates in an effort to dramatically
expand the use of wind and solar power and other
renewable energy sources across the state.
</P>
<P>
Texas, the nation's largest electricity consumer, has one of the best
renewable energy programs in the country, but some lawmakers and
advocates say the state has yet to fully tap those
resources.
</P>
<P>
The resulting savings could dramatically cut electricity bills and power plant
pollution.
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, has introduced a bill in
the Legislature that would require 10 percent of the state's
electricity to come from renewable energy sources by 2025.
</P>
<P>
The state now mandates that about 2.7 percent be derived from
renewable sources by 2009.
</P>
<P>
"Longterm, this is good public polcy for the state," Fraser said.
"This is a good hedge against fossil fuels and our
dependence on foreign oil."
</P>
<P>
A coalition of clean-energy advocates and environmentalists is pushing a stronger
proposal. It would require by 2020 that 20 percent of
the state's energy production be derived from renewable energy --
a whopping 17,820 megawatts, or enough electricity to power 4.9
million homes.
</P>
<P>
The 20 percent proposal does not have a legislative sponsor.
</P>
<P>
But any expansion of reewable energy will require building miles of
transmission lines to carry the electricity produced by wind turbines
to urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The state estimates that it will cost $1 billion to build
transmission lines to support an additional 5,000 megawatts of wind
power. The money to pay for those transmission lines would
probably come from fees based on electricity usage, officials say,
meaning industry would be hit hardest.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to give the impression that we're not willing
to work on the issue, but transmissionto get wind power
from West Texas and other remote areas of the state
to market can be very expensive," said Phillip Oldham, chief
counsel for the Texas Coalition for Competitive Electricity, which represents
large commercial and industrial consumers.
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that renewable energy is cost-competitive and beneficial to
the state, we have no issue with it being incorporated
and think it serves a valuable purpose," he said. "To
the extent that the infrastructre costs outweigh the benefit of
it, then we have concerns."
</P>
<P>
Renewable energy proponents agree that transmission capacity must be improved.
</P>
<P>
But Tom "Smitty" Smith, a member of the Texas Renewable Energy
Industries Association, the clean-energy group pushing the 20 percent proposal,
said the cost has been exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
Smith, also director of the Texas chapter of Public Citizen, said
the cost would be spread over decades and would add
no more than $1.06 to the average monthly residential electricity
bill.
</P>
<P>
The Union f Concerned Scientists, a 100,000-member partnership of scientists and
citizens, conducted a detailed study of both proposals at the
request of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The 34-page analysis, released this month, concluded that both proposals would
slash residential and industrial energy bills by at least $5.5
billion in the next two decades, as well as create
thousands of permanent jobs.
</P>
<P>
"But the 20 percent standard would actually provide significantly grater economic
development and environmental benefits," said Jeff Deyette, an energy analyst
with the group.
</P>
<P>
The union estimates that 38,290 jobs would be created by the
20 percent proposal. It would also slash an estimated 34,000
tons of smog-forming pollutants a year by curtailing coal-fired power
plant production, Deyette said.
</P>
<P>
Fraser said the state needs to proceed cautiously to make sure
wind power, in particular, can handle the job. For instance,
Texas' peak electricity demand occurs in Jly, August and September,
when the state's winds decline sharply.
</P>
<P>
"We need to be somewhat deliberate as we go forward in
making sure that there's a balance," Fraser said. "That balance
is more than putting in the wind turbines, it's having
the transmission to transmit it, and then having a backup
source for reliability."
</P>
<P>
Texas is already a national leader in renewable energy. In June
1999, the Legislature adopted one of the nation's first, and
at the time largest, renewable energy prorams.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fair to say that Texas was viewed as
a pioneer," said Stephen Wieland, business development manager for Vestas,
a Danish wind turbine manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
Texas set a national record in 2001 by installing more wind
power capacity in a single year than any state in
any previous year. Much of the buildup took place at
the King Mountain Ranch "wind farm" in McCamey, about 75
miles south of Midland. It is the world's largest wind
power project today.
</P>
<P>
But in the past several years, 15 states have surpassed Texa'
program. New York, California and Hawaii have enacted requirements that
at least 20 percent of energy companies' output be from
renewable sources by 2020.
