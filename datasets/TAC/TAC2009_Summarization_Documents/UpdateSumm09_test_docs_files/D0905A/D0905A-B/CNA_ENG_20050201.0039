Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen agreed
Tuesday in principle to a wind energy investment project proposed by
the Germany-based Infra Vest Group, which plans to set up 97 wind
turbines in coastal areas of the southern Taiwan county.
</P>
<P>
Chen gave the nod to the investment plan with conditions attached
after hearing a briefing by Infra Vest officials. 
</P>
<P>
The magistrate stipulated that the group must cooperate
unconditionally in future infrastructure construction and must fully
communicate with local residents and environmentalists. He also
demanded that the group come up with compensation and feed-back
measures before moving into further negotiations.
</P>
<P>
According to Infra Vest officials, the group has decided to
invest NT$16 billion (US$500 million) in setting up 97 wind turbines
in Chiayi's coastal areas after carrying out various in-depth
inspections of the area.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the Tungshih and Putai areas are extremely rich in
wind power and resources, they said the group is planning to install
six turbines there in the initial stage. Each will have the capacity
of between 12 million and 18 million watts, generating 51 million
kilowatt-hours per year, they explained.
</P>
<P>
They said the plan will cause no pollution, low noise, and no
exhaust gas or waste water, and pointed out that electricity
generated by wind energy is increasing at a fast pace of between 15
percent and 30 percent every year in advanced countries such as
Germany and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
In these strictly eco-friendly nations, wind energy has largely
replaced traditional coal, gas, nuclear power or other fossil fuel
for power generation, they said, adding that the group has made
similar investment plans in Brazil, France, mainland China, Spain,
Sweden and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Investment in wind energy should bring fourth profit. This is
necessary for a sustainable development of renewable energies, a
distinct goal of many governments, Infra Vest said at its Website.
</P>
<P>
It is our strong belief that this goal can only be achieved by
proper plans and commercially viable projects that can also create
local economic benefits, it said, calling wind energy clean,
competitive and inexhaustible that will heed public concerns over
environmental protection and conservation.
</P>
<P>
Infra Vest has already held a seminar in Putai township to
explained the investment plan to local residents. It has gained
security confirmations from the Ministry of National Defense and the
Civil Aeronautics Administration, as well as initial land use
approval from the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau.
</P>
<P>
At present, the state-run Taiwan Power Company maintains four
wind power turbines in offshore Penghu County and is considering
adding another four due to its better-than-expected capacity, in line
with the Kyoto Pact that will become effective this summer in several
parts of the world to cut emissions of greenhouse gas.
