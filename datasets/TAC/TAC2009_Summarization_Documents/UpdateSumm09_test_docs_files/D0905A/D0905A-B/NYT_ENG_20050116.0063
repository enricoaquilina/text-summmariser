BIGGER TURBINE MAY PUT WIND JOBS IN COLORADO OR NEVADA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A California wind-energy company is eyeing Colorado and Nevada as locations
to build the nation's largest wind turbines.
</P>
<P>
Clipper Windpower Inc. said the two states are finalists in the
company's plan to build a plant that would produce a
new line of wind generators soaring 435 feet into the
air.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing and assembly plant initially would employ 75 workers and
ultimately could grow to as many as 550 employees, earning
annual salaries averaging $42,000, Clipper Windpower chief executive Jim Dehlsen
said.
</P>
<P>
Clipper plans to unveil a prototype of the new turbine --
minus its 300-foot-diameter rotor -- in Denver in May at
Windpower 2005, the annual conference and exhibition of the American
Wind Energy Association.
</P>
<P>
Clipper's new turbines will generate a maximum of 2.5 megawatts, making
them two-thirds more powerful than the 1.5-megawatt units made by
GE Wind Energy that are used at the Lamar wind
farm.
</P>
<P>
One megawatt of continuous electricity serves about 650 homes. Because the
wind blows sporadically, one megawatt of wind capacity serves about
240 to 300 average homes.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said Clipper's large turbine could bring significant improvements in
the economics of wind energy.
</P>
<P>
"Larger turbines make a tremendous difference in the cost competitiveness of
wind power" compared with coal and natural gas, said Gary
Schmitz of the Golden, Colo.-based National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
While larger turbines produce far more power than smaller units, their
ground "footprints" -- the amount of surface area they occupy
-- are only slightly larger.
</P>
<P>
For example, a wind farm under development by Clipper in Maryland
will produce 100 megawatts using the company's new turbines, compared
with 70 megawatts if smaller turbines were used on the
same amount of acreage.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the rotors of the larger turbines are higher in
the air, causing fewer bird and bat deaths from collisions
with blades.
</P>
<P>
While wind power is widely embraced for its environmental benefits, some
critics dislike the noise and visual impact of wind farms
containing hundreds of turbines.
</P>
<P>
The proposed "Cape Wind" project with 130 turbines in offshore waters
south of Cape Cod, Mass., has been controversial because of
complaints that it would interfere with pristine ocean views.
</P>
<P>
Clipper Windpower's plan is to build three manufacturing plants in the
United States, one each in the West, Midwest and East.
That will help the company reduce transportation costs by placing
factories closer to wind farms.
</P>
<P>
Privately owned Clipper was founded in 2001 by Dehlsen, a wind-energy
pioneer. The Carpinteria, Calif.-based company developed the $55 million, 44-
megawatt Flying Cloud wind farm in Iowa, and did preliminary
development work on another Iowa wind project that is one
of the nation's largest.
</P>
<P>
Dehlsen's former company, Zond, developed the 1.5 megawatt turbine that has
become the industry standard. Zond was acquired by Enron in
2000, and after Enron's implosion the company's wind business was
picked up by GE Wind.
</P>
<P>
Capitalizing on the fast-developing wind-power market, GE has become one of
the world's major turbine manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
After the federal production tax credit on wind energy recently was
renewed, inducing a surge of new wind-farm proposals, GE landed
$1.3 billion in new orders for turbines.
</P>
<P>
Dehlsen now finds himself in the ironic position of competing against
the popular turbine he helped create.
</P>
<P>
Although he hasn't announced pricing for the 2.5- megawatt turbine, he
expects its cost per megawatt will be slightly less than
that of GE's 1.5-megawatt unit.
</P>
<P>
The GE turbines sell for $1.3 million to $1.6 million each,
Dehlsen said. That indicates that Clipper's larger turbine could be
priced at slightly less than $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Dehlsen said the Clipper machines will use sophisticated components that will
make the turbines more efficient than others on the market.
When the 2.5-megawatt turbine is rolled out this year, Clipper's
revenues gradually will shift from wind-project development fees to sales
of the turbine.
</P>
<P>
Clipper expects to make a decision on the location of its
western manufacturing facility by the end of this month, Dehlsen
said.
</P>
<P>
The company's big turbine is attracting plenty of attention in the
industry, said Tom Gray, executive vice president of the Washington-based
American Wind Energy Association.
</P>
<P>
With the dollar weak against foreign currencies, American wind-farm developers increasingly
are looking to domestic turbine makers instead of European giants
such as Vestas and Siemens.
</P>
<P>
"It seems likely that (the Clipper turbine) will improve the economics
of wind energy," Gray said. "Any time a new turbine
of that size from a new manufacturer comes to market,
that's a significant event."
