CAPE COD WIND-FARM PLAN SPARKS EMOTIONAL ELECTRICITY

<P>
After four formal hearings, one so packed with
passionate speakers that it had to be reconvened for a
second time on Tuesday afternoon, the public has just about
had its say on a proposal to install a giant
wind farm in offshore waters south of Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
But consensus appears to be as far away as ever, with
advocates and opponents deeply divided on the project and a
vast majority still ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the project was variously described as relying on outdated
technology or as a beautiful alternative to strip mining, the
equivalent of industrializing the Grand Canyon or a way to
lead the nation once again to independence, this time energy
independence.
</P>
<P>
"Five percent on each side are passionate," and the remaining 90
percent are unsure, Larry Rosenberg, a spokesman for the Army
Corps of Engineers, said at a public information session convened
on Saturday by the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, a state agency.
</P>
<P>
The project, put forward by Cape Wind Associates of Boston, a
private concern, involves 130 turbines to be arranged in a
grid occupying 24 square miles of Horseshoe Shoals, in Nantucket
Sound. Each tower, with its turbines and blades, would reach
420 feet above the water.
</P>
<P>
Karen Adams, who supervises the permitting process for the corps of
engineers, said it would be at least six or seven
months before the corps made a decision on the permit.
Several state and local agencies have yet to weigh in
first, Adams said, "and they all have to say yes"
for the permit to be approved.
</P>
<P>
Although the session on Tuesday was the last public hearing, the
public comment period has been extended through Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
Advocates said the turbine array would ultimately produce about three-fourths of
the electricity now used on Cape Cod, Nantucket and Martha's
Vineyard, reducing the region's reliance on fossil fuels. That, in
turn, would reduce the risk of global warming, the nation's
dependence on imported oil, pollution and pollution-related diseases like asthma,
they said. Others said they liked the idea of a
wind farm because it would bring jobs to the region,
the towers would attract fish and the wind farm might
become a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
Opponents say that the project might be a good idea, but
that Nantucket Sound is the wrong place for it. They
note that the installation would be the first of its
kind in the nation and say that it relies on
unproved technology that has run into trouble elsewhere. In particular,
they criticized the corps draft environmental impact study for the
proposal. As is routine, it was paid for by the
project applicant, Cape Wind, an arrangement that opponents said tainted
its generally upbeat assessment.
</P>
<P>
Some opponents, including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, whose family compound in
Hyannisport would have a view of the towers, said no
projects should be approved in Horseshoe Shoals, or other federal
waters, until the nation had a more coherent policy for
dealing with offshore lands generally.
</P>
<P>
Two recent reports, one by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy
and the other by the Pew Oceans Commission, made similar
recommendations, and last month the White House announced that it
would pursue the idea.
</P>
<P>
Greg Watson, a vice president at the technology collaborative, said his
group had not taken a stand on the proposal, even
though much of its mission involved the encouragement of renewable
energy like wind.
</P>
<P>
The collaborative organized the session on Saturday "as a neutral broker,"
Watson said, because it was important that the public have
confidence that the project, if it went goes forward, was
being done right. Otherwise he said, "it will set back
the cause of renewable energy."
