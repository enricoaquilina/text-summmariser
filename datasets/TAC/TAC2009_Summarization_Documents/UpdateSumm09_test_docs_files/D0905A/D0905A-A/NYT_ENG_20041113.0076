A SEASHORE FIGHT TO HARNESS THE WIND

FALMOUTH, Mass.

<P>
Nantucket Sound lies between Cape Cod, Nantucket Island and Martha's
Vineyard, some of the nation's best-known vacation spots. Now a
private company is proposing to build the world's largest offshore
wind power plant right in the middle of it. Depending on who is
talking, the results would be either a hideous blot on the landscape
or a significant step toward clean power and energy independence.
</P>
<P>
The argument over the proposal intensified last week, when the Army
Corps of Engineers issued a draft environmental impact statement
finding few flaws in the proposal. But instead of helping to settle
the question, the report fed the debate over building there and where
-- or whether -- other wind farms should be built in the nation's
coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
The 4,000-page draft gives new support to environmental groups that
praise the project as a safe, nonpolluting and desperately needed
alternative to fossil fuel power plants. But opponents challenge the
report, the process that produced it and the idea of building the
turbine array in the first place.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of its environmental impact, they say, it is just too ugly
-- an industrial development that would wreck pristine vistas in a
major tourism area. Many add that no offshore energy projects should
be considered until the government establishes a better review
process for proposals to use federal lands offshore.
</P>
<P>
The project would be the nation's first offshore wind power plant,
and it is being closely watched up and down the Eastern Seaboard. A
similar proposal is under consideration off Jones Beach, on Long
Island, and officials in New Jersey are looking into offshore wind
power.
</P>
<P>
The Corps of Engineers' draft concluded that the project, proposed by
Cape Wind Associates of Boston, would not unduly hinder ferry
operations, commercial and sport fishing, boating, aviation or other
activities at its site, a 24-square-mile area in the part of
Nantucket Sound called Horseshoe Shoals. It said the project's 130
support towers, turbines and blades, which together would rise about
420 feet above the water, would not seriously affect currents, waves,
water quality, sand movement, fishing conditions or noise levels.
</P>
<P>
Adequate steps can be taken to protect marine mammals and shellfish,
the report said. Birds will fly into the towers and die, the
statement says, but probably at a rate of only about one a day, not
enough "to cause bird population declines."
</P>
<P>
And while opponents predict that the field of towers would drive away
tourists, the corps said the project might actually attract
sightseers.
</P>
<P>
The report is preliminary, and the public will have at least until
Jan. 10 to comment on its findings, said Karen Adams, who supervises
the permit process for the Corps of Engineers. A final environmental
review may be completed as soon as a year from now, she said.
</P>
<P>
Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for Cape Wind, said the company must still
raise the capital needed to build the project. But if all goes well,
he said, the plant could be producing power as early as 2007. The
power would go into the regional grid, not precisely to Cape Cod and
the islands, he said. But on a day with average wind, it would
produce about 420 megawatts -- three-fourths of average electricity
needs for the local area.

</P>
<P>
"Many of the more hysterical fears that opponents had been speaking
of in the past three years were not supported in this analysis,"
Rodgers said of the impact statement.
</P>
<P>
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
But that is no surprise, according to the Alliance to Protect
Nantucket Sound, an organization that opposes the wind farm. As is
required, Cape Wind paid for the work that went into the report. "As
a predictable result," the alliance said in a statement, "the
document is strongly biased toward Cape Wind."
</P>
<P>
Adams and the project's supporters dismiss that criticism. The corps
requires applicants to pay for studies of their proposals, she said,
because it would not be right for taxpayers to pay for them. The
corps independently chose the experts who produced each section of
the report, she said, and Cape Wind willingly financed whatever the
work the corps requested.
</P>
<P>
She added, however, that some in the corps did not expect to find
themselves in the position of issuing federal permits for the
project. "We had to do a lot of learning real quick," she said.
</P>
<P>
But some officials -- including Gov. Mitt Romney, Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy and Rep. Bill Delahunt, whose congressional district includes
the project site, say the project should not go forward yet. They say
offshore projects of all kinds need a more systematic federal review
process. (Sen. John Kerry says he will await the final environmental
impact statement before taking a position.)
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the wind farm say establishing such a process would only
mean unnecessary delay. And several environmental organizations have
found themselves in the unaccustomed position of praising the Corps
of Engineers, which many have criticized in the past as being too
quick to approve development projects.
</P>
<P>
"At first, obviously, it was pretty frightening because of their
history," said Kert Davies, U.S. research director for Greenpeace,
which favors the project. But he added, "I think the effort was very
solid, and they were under a lot of scrutiny."
</P>
<P>
Davies also dismissed as "an elitist and local view" assertions that
the wind turbine array would spoil a pristine environment. Nantucket
Sound is far from that, he said, filled as it is with "mega boat
traffic and jet skis and fishing boats and ferries -- it is not the
Grand Canyon these guys are painting it to be."
</P>
<P>
Others say that regulatory issues aside, the aesthetics are perhaps
the biggest issue standing in the project's way. "It's a legitimate
concern," said Bruce Bailey of AWS Truewind, a research firm in
Albany, N.Y., that consulted on the Cape Wind project.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "It's based on expectations, not based on what people
have actually seen." He said photo simulations of what the wind farm
will look like from shore -- it will be 4.7 miles away at its closest
point -- assume the clearest of weather conditions. Often, he said,
the distant view from shore is obscured by haze, so the turbines
would not be so obvious.
</P>
<P>
Besides, advocates say, a diminished view is a small price to pay for
clean power. "If we are not willing to accept that tradeoff, I think
it says something pretty profound about our priorities and our
commitment to moving to cleaner sources of electricity," said Randy
Swisher, executive director of the American Wind Energy Association,
which represents developers, suppliers, consultants and others in the
wind power industry.
</P>
<P>
The corps' statement did not address in detail another criticism
opponents have voiced: that the project is economically viable only
because of tax credits or because the federal government is giving
the company free use of the site, issues that some say should be
considered in a broader federal review of development of offshore
lands.
</P>
<P>
But advocates contend that all kinds of fossil fuel energy projects
benefit from federal incentives. And Rodgers, the Cape Wind
spokesman, said that "non-extractive" users of coastal lands --
companies that run telecommunications cables and the like -- are not
required to pay for the privilege. Still, he said, should the federal
government decide to require lease payments, the company would
"absolutely" pay.
</P>
<P>
Rodgers said the site offered several important advantages. It is in
the middle of an area whose population -- and electricity demands --
are growing. And it is a short distance to Barnstable, where power
generated by the windmills can feed into the national grid.
</P>
<P>
Similar considerations are prompting interest in offshore wind power
on Long Island and in New Jersey, several experts said. "It's
difficult to site a large wind development in the Northeast," Swisher
said.
</P>
<P>
Advocates of wind power cite Denmark as an example, saying the
country generates 20 percent or more of its energy from wind, and
Davies of Greenpeace says the record there suggests that offshore
wind farms can become tourism destinations. "In Denmark, day sailors
take off and sail to these things," he said.
</P>
<P>
He and others at environmental groups said they hoped the Cape Wind
proposal would win final approval and would become the first of many
offshore wind projects. "The United States," he said, "is way behind
in the clean energy race."
