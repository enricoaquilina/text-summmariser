GREEN MOUNTAIN ENERGY MATCHES RELIANT RATES IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Green Mountain Energy is offering Texas electricity consumers an
environmentally friendly service at a rate matching that of Reliant
Energy -- a sign of a growing interest in green energy and the rising
price of traditionally produced power.
</P>
<P>
Touted as a "pollution free" plan, Green Mountain Energy gets the
power it sells from wind turbines and hydroelectric plants and will
cost about 11.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, the same price current
Reliant Energy customers are paying.
</P>
<P>
Houston-area electricity customers can pay as little as 9.6 cents per
kilowatt-hour, a rate offered by Houston-based Gexa Energy. Other
companies, like Starlight Electric and Cirro Energy, also offer rates
below the price Reliant charges.
</P>
<P>
The Green Mountain plan, a 10 percent wind- and 90 percent
water-generated mix, is about $9 per month less expensive than the
100 percent wind plan Austin-based Green Mountain currently offers,
based on the use by a typical customer.
</P>
<P>
The new offering reflects a maturing of the electricity market from
one where only early adopters would pay the extra money for green
power to a market where renewable power is attractive to a broader
range of customers, said John Savage, Green Mountain's senior vice
president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
"Some see it as a way to counter the country's dependence on foreign
oil; others see it as a way to promote good environmental
stewardship, and others see it as being consistent with their faith."
Savage said.
</P>
<P>
The power in Green Mountain's 100 percent wind plan comes from
turbines operating in Texas, but most of the hydroelectric power in
the new plan is generated in neighboring states, such as Arkansas and
Oklahoma, Savage said.
</P>
<P>
While the power that arrives at a Green Mountain customer's home in
Texas won't necessarily be from a hydroelectric plant, Green Mountain
will buy a sort of "renewable power credit" from a hydro plant that
generated the electricity and sold it to another user.
</P>
<P>
Green Mountain's plan also reflects the narrowing price gap between
renewable power and power made by more traditional methods, such as
coal and natural gas, said Tim Morstad, an analyst with Consumers
Union.
</P>
<P>
Since 2002, the price electric consumers pay to Reliant Energy, known
as the price-to-beat, has gone up 28 percent, or 2.48 cents per
kilowatt-hour. Most of that is a result of rising costs, primarily
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
"On the renewable front, it does bode well that customers can choose
more environmentally friendly power for the price most residential
customers pay," Morstad said. "But this is also a signal that the
price to beat has gotten very high."
</P>
<P>
The cost of renewable energy hasn't necessarily dropped, either.
While the cost of wind power is supposed to stay relatively stable
compared with power generated by coal and natural gas, Green Mountain
recently increased the price of its 100 percent wind product. Because
the company must buy some power on the open market to meet customer
needs, it is also subject to the fuel price increases imposed by its
suppliers, Savage said.
</P>
<P>
Reliant Energy does not offer a renewable energy plan in the Houston
area -- state electricity deregulation laws allow it to offer only
one plan here until Jan. 1, 2005 -- but it has offered a plan to
Dallas-area customers for several years.
</P>
<P>
Jim Robb, Reliant's senior vice president of retail marketing, said
the renewable plan has been priced to roughly match the cost of the
Dallas area's incumbent provider, TXU. The power comes from a
combination of wind and landfill-produced natural gas.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen major evidence of increased interest in a renewable
product," Robb said, noting that about 1,400 customers have signed on
to its plan. "We could offer such a plan in Houston next year if we
find customer demand, but we haven't gone to the expense of marketing
the plan."
</P>
<P>
There are no other renewable energy plans offered in the Houston
area. Spokesmen for Entergy and TXU note that renewable sources are
part of their mix of power generation. TXU is the fourth largest
contractor of wind power in the country, while Entergy has several
hydroelectric facilities.
</P>
<P>
Green Mountain has 600,000 customers in eight states but does not
offer a state-by-state breakdown.
