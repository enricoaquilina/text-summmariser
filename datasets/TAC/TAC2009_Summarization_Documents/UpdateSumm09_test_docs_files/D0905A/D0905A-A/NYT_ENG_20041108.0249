REPORT REFUELS DEBATE ON WIND FARM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the clock begins ticking Tuesday toward a final decision on the
proposed wind farm in Nantucket Sound, its chief opponent said the
government should allow more time for public response to a crucial
4,000-page report that appears to pave the way for its approval.
</P>
<P>
The new draft environmental impact report, prepared over three years
by the Army Corps of Engineers, will be released in full Tuesday, but
supporters and opponents responded to details that became public
Monday morning. The findings are largely favorable to the project,
suggesting that the 130 turbines proposed off Cape Cod would have
little or no negative effect on the surrounding air, sea, and animal
life.
</P>
<P>
The public has 60 days to comment on the report before the Corps
issues a final version and makes a decision on the project, which is
expected next year.
</P>
<P>
The report is by far the most important hurdle the controversial
project must overcome before construction begins. The draft gives the
first public look at the federal government's official stance on the
460-megawatt power plant.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, a group founded to block the
project, said Monday that it intends to ask the government to extend
the comment period to six months, saying that two months is too
little time for the public to digest the enormous amount of
information in the Army Corps report.
</P>
<P>
"A 60-day comment period during the holiday season on a complex and
controversial project is unfair," said Susan Nickerson, of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Army Corps officials said Monday they would consider written requests
to extend the comment period, but had already added 15 days to the
minimum required time of 45 days.
</P>
<P>
Even though few had seen the entire report by Monday afternoon,
reaction was swift from opponents and supporters after details were
published by news agencies and summaries of the report were leaked.
The two sides have begun lining up engineers and scientists to start
poring over the document.
</P>
<P>
"The struggle has just begun," said Charles Kleekamp, vice president
of Cape Clean Air, an environmental group that supports the farm.
</P>
<P>
Governor Mitt Romney, who opposes the project on aesthetic grounds,
says the report downplays a key consideration for Massachusetts
residents.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised that the wind farm isn't going to kill fish or
kill birds," said Romney. "The question is does the wind farm impinge
on the beauty of one of the great natural resources on the East
Coast, and it does."
</P>
<P>
Monday, the Army Corps of Engineers said few projects are blocked
because of aesthetic considerations, in part because it is such a
subjective matter. Supporters of wind farms have called the proposed
turbines "futuristic" and "beautiful," while opponents have called
them a blight on an uninterrupted seascape.
</P>
<P>
The Nantucket Sound wind farm, proposed by Cape Wind Associates,
would be the country's first offshore wind farm. A host of
politicians have attempted to block the project since it was proposed
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
If the Army Corps sticks to the 60-day public comment period, the
agency is likely to issue a decision next year. Construction could
begin soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
"This is great news for citizens hoping to turn decades of rhetoric
into action on renewable energy," Cape Wind president Jim Gordon
said, referring to the report's findings.
</P>
<P>
The $13 million draft environmental impact report was paid for by
Cape Wind. Some 16 agencies and groups weighed in with comments and
data about potential impacts the farm would have, and the Army Corps
received hundreds of individual comments.
</P>
<P>
Cape Wind's involvement in the report has drawn critics, including
Nickerson, who says the Army Corps was overly reliant on data
collected by consultants paid for by the developer. They also faulted
the Army Corps' hiring of TRC, a national engineering firm with an
office in Lowell, to help put the federal document together.
Nickerson said TRC would be bound to write a favorable review because
it works on wind issues, among others.
</P>
<P>
Army Corps officials said they specifically hired TRC as an
independent third party because they have an energy background and
experience with similar reports. A spokeswoman for TRC said
Nickerson's comments were untrue.
</P>
<P>
"TRC deals with all kinds of energy. The idea they would be biased to
any particular energy source is ridiculous," said spokeswoman
Samantha Guerry.
</P>
<P>
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, whose family
compound would overlook the project, issued a statement saying the
project shows the need for better rules to govern what he sees as the
bequeathing of public ocean to private interests.
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly said "We cannot allow the
federal government to give away 24 square miles of pristine waters to
a private developer. ... [W]hat is happening here is wrong."
</P>
<P>
With promises of an enormous fight brewing, both sides remained
optimistic. Marc Breslow, director of the Massachusetts Climate
Action Network, which supports the plan, said he had only seen a
brief summary of the report Monday, but if it is accurate,
"completion of a final [environmental report] should be done
expeditiously, and assuming no environmental surprises, Cape Wind
should move forward without further delay."
