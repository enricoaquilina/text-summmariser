A LIFT FOR CAPE WIND
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There is a "think globally, act locally" rightness to the fact that
the environmental report for the Cape Wind power project came on the
same day scientists laid out the dramatic effects global warming is
having on the Arctic. The report on Cape Wind's 130-turbine proposal
finds few costs to marine or bird life that might outweigh the
project's benefits to both the environment and the economy.

The 454-megawatt project would provide a source of pollution-free,
renewable power that could displace fossil fuel sources in the
region. Unless the United States and the rest of the world get
serious about global warming and sea-level increases, the Cape town
of Orleans could be "under the waves" by 2100, according to Philip
Warburg, president of the Conservation Law Foundation.

Much of that increased ocean water will come from the Arctic. It is
warming more than the rest of the planet, according to the report by
the eight-nation Arctic Council, which includes the United States. As
ice and snow at the poles melt, the loss of their reflective surfaces
leads to exposed land and water absorbing more heat. The four-year
study by 300 international researchers advances the consensus among
scientists that industrial society's increasing production of
greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, is
causing climate change.

<P>
The Bush administration has refused to take any steps to curb carbon
dioxide emissions despite a promise by President Bush in 2000 to do
so, and has indicated it has no plans to change that policy. This
leaves it up to states like Massachusetts, which requires utilities
to increase annually their use of renewable power sources, and
California, which is pioneering a requirement that motor vehicles
reduce their carbon emissions.
</P>
<P>
If Washington cannot take the lead in coping with climate change, the
least it could do is provide legislation for a better framework for
wind or other renewable energy projects that use the ocean surface.
But Congress has not made significant progress in passing a bill to
create a leasing system for sites similar to one that exists for
offshore oil and gas drilling. The lack of such a framework is no
reason to stall the Cape Wind project, which is now a step closer to
becoming a model for offshore wind power generation.
</P>
<P>
Using current technology, it is more practical to build offshore
turbines fairly close to land, which means they can be visible in
nearby communities. The environmental report, prepared by the Army
Corps of Engineers, includes a "visual impact assessment" by an
architectural historian who states that the turbines "will have an
adverse visual effect" on historic properties and locations in the
area. That may not be pleasant for some residents, but the supposed
harm to a view is more than offset by the beneficial impact of the
clean Cape Wind power.
