CATCH THE WIND, CHANGE THE WEATHER

Wind turbines have been hailed as an environmentally friendly way to
reduce the world's dependence on fossil fuels. But a wind farm with
hundreds or even thousands of large turbines removes an enormous
amount of energy from the air. So is wind power really benign?
</P>
<P>
In one of the first studies to get at that question, scientists have
modeled the impact of a hypothetical large-scale wind farm in the
Great Plains. Their conclusion, reported in The Journal of
Geophysical Research, is that thousands of turbines concentrated in
one area can affect local weather.
</P>
<P>
The impact, said the study's lead author, Dr. Somnath Baidya Roy,
comes not so much from the turbines' rotor blades slowing down the
air but from atmospheric mixing that occurs in the blades' wake. This
creates warmer, drier conditions at the surface.
</P>
<P>
"We found that it's the turbulence generated by the rotor that is
crucial when you talk about the impact on local meteorology," said
Baidya Roy, who did the research at Princeton but is now at Duke.
</P>
<P>
The simulated wind farm in the study consisted of 10,000 turbines,
with rotor blades 165 feet long, in a 60-by-60-mile grid in
north-central Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
In the Great Plains there is a nighttime stream of fast-moving air
that separates cool, moist air near the ground from drier, warmer air
above. The simulation found that the turbines catch this nocturnal
jet, and the ensuing turbulence causes vertical mixing.
</P>
<P>
The warming and drying that occur when the upper air mass reaches the
surface is a significant change, Baidya Roy said, and is similar to
the kinds of local atmospheric changes that occur with large-scale
deforestation. "You might see some kind of convective clouds or
scattered rainfall here and there," Baidya Roy said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the study was only preliminary, but that it pointed to
the need to improve rotor design to reduce turbulence.
</P>
<P>
A wind farm of the size used in the simulation is much larger than
those that have been built so far, Baidya Roy acknowledged, but it is
not out of line with what is being considered as more power from
renewable resources is sought.
</P>
<P>
"When you think of wind energy, people have a quaint idea of a lone
windmill by the river," he said. "We are quite a ways from that,
actually."
