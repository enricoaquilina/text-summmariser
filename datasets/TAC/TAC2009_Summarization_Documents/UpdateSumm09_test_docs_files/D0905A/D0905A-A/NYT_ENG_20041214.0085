CAPE WIND: TOO 'UGLY' FOR THE RICH?

Ugliness can be good for you -- especially if you are not rich,
powerful, or politically connected.

After a massive draft environmental analysis, the controversial
proposal to construct a wind farm in Nantucket Sound is coming down
to aesthetics. Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney -- a supposedly
pro-business, anti-government-regulation, cold-blooded venture
capitalist -- made that clear during recent testimony before the US
Army Corps of Engineers. "We cannot trash this extraordinary
resource," Romney said, referring to Nantucket Sound. " . . . I've
seen wind farms, and they are not pretty."
</P>
<P>
Two days later, the Romney administration announced support for
windmill projects in Florida and Monroe in western Massachusetts.
Residents there also worry about the aesthetics of 20 340-foot tall
turbines and the overall impact on streams, wetlands, and woodland.
</P>
<P>
And that raises a question: With government under pressure to develop
renewable energy, will controversial alternatives be foisted solely
on poorer, less politically influential areas?
</P>
<P>
The proposed Nantucket Sound project would be the country's first
offshore wind farm. The structures would stretch 417 feet high from
the water's surface to the tallest blade tip and would be visible 4
miles away on Cape Cod and more distantly from Martha's Vineyard and
Nantucket. Some environmental groups, including the Conservation Law
Foundation and Greenpeace believe the trade-off in terms of energy
and pollution savings is worth it. But Cape Wind Associates, the
developer behind the proposal, is fighting the wealthy and
well-connected, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy and other Kennedy
kin along with some average Cape residents.
</P>
<P>
As for Romney's loud opposition, the governor could be feeling
pressure from Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly's strong effort to
challenge the project. Or, perhaps he is feeling another type of
pressure?
</P>
<P>
Opposition to Cape Wind is organized through the Alliance to Protect
Nantucket Sound, which spent $2.4 million fighting the proposed wind
farm in 2003. On forms filed with the IRS in 2003, Christopher, Jack,
and Michael Egan are listed as directors. Jack and Michael Egan are
current board members. They are sons of Richard Egan, founder and
chairman emeritus of EMC Corp.
</P>
<P>
The Egans are major political players. Here, while they also
contribute to Democrats, they are big Romney fund-raisers. The Egan
Family Foundation was the main funding source for a $100,000 survey
done by the Beacon Hill Institute. It concluded that lower property
values, reduced tourism revenue, and a loss in year-round jobs would
result from the wind farm. The Egan Family Trust owns property in
Cotuit overlooking Nantucket Sound, and Michael Egan owns a home on
Great Island, off Yarmouth, overlooking Nantucket Sound.
</P>
<P>
Ernie Corrigan, a spokesman for the alliance, said, "This is not a
political issue at all." Opposition is "a matter of common sense."
Asked if the Egan family involvement influenced Romney's position
regarding Cape Wind, Romney aide Eric Fehrnstrom replied via e-mail:
"No, not at all." Asked to explain Romney's shifting positions,
Fehrnstrom, said, again via e-mail: "Gov. Romney supports efforts to
encourage greater reliance on renewable sources of energy. There are
several areas in the Berkshires region where wind farms have recently
been approved. And there are a number of different areas off the
coast of Massachusetts that we could also consider. They may not be
optimal for the developer from a profit-making point of view, but we
need to balance the public and private interest. Nantucket Sound is a
national treasure. The governor does not want to turn it into a wind
factory. He wouldn't recommend putting a wind farm in the middle of
the Grand Canyon, or at the foot of Mount Rushmore, either.
</P>
<P>
In the Berkshires, legal challenges are underway. Under the current
plan, "a year from now, turbine number 16 will be the third highest
point in Massachusetts," says Eleanor Tillinghast, co-founder of
Green Berkshires, Inc., a group formed to oppose wind farm power. "We
believe the aesthetics are equally as valuable here. Nantucket Sound
is a national treasure, so are the mountains of western
Massachusetts." But, she says, western Massachusetts is being left to
the mercies of the free market system, where small towns suffering
from budget cutbacks are "willing to sell their wind, because what
else do they have to sell?"

What a sorry way to run a state energy policy: Give to the have-nots
what the haves don't want. Joan Vennochi's e-mail address is
