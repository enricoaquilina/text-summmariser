An amendment to the 2005 defense authorization bill
currently before Congress could immediately halt the development of
offshore wind-power facilities in the United States, including a
controversial project planned for coastal Massachusetts, environmental
groups and developers said this week.
</P>
<P>
The amendment is being pushed by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who sits
on the House-Senate conference committee that will write the final
version of the bill. The amendment would prevent the Army Corps of
Engineers, which oversees offshore wind power, from processing permit
applications until lawmakers draw up new regulatory guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the Massachusetts project say the amendment would
stifle a burgeoning industry that they believe can make the United
States less reliant on polluting fossil fuels at a time of rising oil
prices. Warner, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said
the amendment is necessary to address shortcomings in oversight for
such projects.
</P>
<P>
``We need a more comprehensive regime, not unlike that for offshore
drilling in the oil and gas industry, to protect this very important
concept of wind energy, which I support,'' he said in a telephone
interview. He would not disclose whether the amendment will be
included in the committee's report, which could come as soon as
Friday. Once the bill is written, no changes can be made before a vote
on passage.
</P>
<P>
Although in its nascent stages in this country, wind power is
widely used in Europe -- providing Denmark, for example, with about 18
percent of its energy. The first offshore project planned for U.S.
waters is a privately financed, $800 million proposal to build 130
turbines south of Cape Cod, Mass.
</P>
<P>
Cape Wind Associates, the project's developer, says that in normal
weather conditions, 40-story high towers could generate 170 megawatts
-- 75 percent of the power used by Cape Cod and the islands of Martha's
Vineyard and Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
``This amendment would stop us dead in our tracks, putting the
breaks on offshore wind energy for years to come,'' said Mark Rogers,
communications director for Cape Wind.
</P>
<P>
The Cape Cod proposal has sparked a strong backlash from a
coalition of wealthy and well-connected opponents, including some
environmentalists. They say it will spoil the aesthetics of popular
vacation communities, disrupt commercial fishing, and harm birds and
marine wildlife.
</P>
<P>
A 4,000-page draft environmental impact study by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers was completed last month after a nearly three-year
process. It was set to be released last month, but a Pentagon official
asked to review it first.
</P>
<P>
``This project has undergone extensive environmental review, and
the public has a right to learn what the implications of it will be,''
said Philip Warburg, president of the Conservation Law Foundation.
``Clearly, there are powerful forces in Congress opposed to moving
this project forward.''
</P>
<P>
A draft of the amendment, circulated this week, calls on Congress
to outline environmental standards, establish requirements for
competitive bidding and set public compensation for the use of
waterways. Some of those issues were raised in a report last month by
the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, which called the current
regulatory framework for offshore wind power ``inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who serves on the Armed Services
Committee and whose family owns a large home on Cape Cod, has spoken
out against the project and supports establishing a national policy on
offshore development. Warner, who has two daughters with summer homes
on Cape Cod, wrote in a 2002 letter to Army Undersecretary Les
Brownlee that ``the location of such a large project on Nantucket
Sound is questionable.''
</P>
<P>
Warner said that the amendment is not related to his families ties
to Cape Cod and that he is mainly concerned with providing a framework
for wind-power developments in Virginia. A company called Winergy LLC
applied for an offshore wind farm permit from the Norfolk District of
the Army Corps of Engineers, but that application has been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) plans to build
40 wind turbines off southern Long Island as part of a state program
that requires utilities to produce 25 percent of their energy
portfolio from renewable sources by 2013. ``We would be discouraged by
any effort that would prevent us from moving forward with this
important project,'' LIPA Chairman Richard Kessel said.
