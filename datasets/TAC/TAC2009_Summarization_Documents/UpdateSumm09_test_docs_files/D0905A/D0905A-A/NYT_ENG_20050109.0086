WHERE QUIXOTE TILTED, A BATTLE RAGES OVER WINDMILLS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
CAPE TRAFALGAR, Spain
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Near this blustery headland where Admiral Nelson
won his great naval victory over the French two centuries
ago, a new battle of Trafalgar is brewing.
</P>
<P>
But the ships involved today are only small fishing boats, wanting
to protect their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Two companies plan to build large clusters of windmills in the
sea just off this stretch of Spain's southern shore, a
gritty place of sand dunes, lagoons and sharp brown reefs.
With about 400 offshore turbines, they want to capture the
power of the winds that blow almost constantly here, at
the cusp of two seas, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen respond that these phalanxes of giant towers near the coast
will make their tough jobs even more difficult. "This is
where the tuna pass and this is where we work,"
said Manuel Ponce Alva, leader of fishermen's protest movement, waving
a marine map covered with ominous red arrows.
</P>
<P>
The men from the fishing villages of Barbate, Vejer and Conil
have knocked on many official doors to argue that these
wind farms will disturb the migration of the young tuna
and, more dramatically, that their own lives may be at
stake. They say the towers, to be based some 10
miles offshore, will force their small vessels to make large
detours in the already treacherous waters near the Strait of
Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
"We talk and talk, and we ask," said Antonio Varo, another
angry fisherman. "We get no answers."
</P>
<P>
Their protests may well fall on deaf ears. The windmill projects
are part of a drive by Spain to expand its
output of native renewable energy. Spain is already one of
Europe's largest producers of wind power, second only to Germany,
and its present capacity of 8,500 megawatts can supply close
to 5 percent of the country's electricity. Indications are that
this may double by 2010.
</P>
<P>
In this country, where almost all oil, gas and coal must
be imported, the wind rush has been under way for
more than a decade. Privately owned "wind parks," encouraged by
official subsidies, first sprouted on the hills near here, behind
Trafalgar and Tarifa. The gleaming white towers then spread to
the rest of the country, to the windswept north and
the central highlands.
</P>
<P>
Like the old stone windmills that have dotted Spanish horizons for
centuries, the modern turbines are all on land. But now
Spanish entrepreneurs want to join Europe's booming new trend of
building large wind farms offshore.
</P>
<P>
The seabed off Cape Trafalgar, one of six marine sites being
studied, is a favorite. There are no important tourist resorts
nearby, although visitors often come here from Britain, where "Trafalgar"
has a special ring. Binoculars in hand, people climb to
the tip of the cape, a knobby dune with a
lighthouse on top. Here they peer out at the water
where 60 British, French and Spanish warships clashed in 1805
in the battle that established Britain's naval supremacy for the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Cesar del Campo, director of a consortium involved in the wind
park plans, said the site is difficult because of the
water depth and the speed of the currents, but that
the energy yield would be high. "You have to see
the Strait of Gibraltar like a huge fast-moving river that
changes with the tides," he said. "Some days there may
be heavy gusts from Atlantic storms, but you can count
on wind every day."
</P>
<P>
The building cost can be twice as high as on land,
though, offsetting the larger yield. It means driving piles into
the sea floor, laying cables to the shore and doing
riskier maintenance work.
</P>
<P>
But specialists say the rush is on now for offshore wind
energy, and northern Europe is leading the way. Wind farms
based at sea today still have a modest capacity of
600 megawatts, but this is expected to grow more than
tenfold by 2010, said Corin Millais, director of the European
Wind Energy Association. Companies, including utilities, have staked out tracts
in the seas off Britain, Denmark, Germany, Ireland and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The incentive is evident, Millais said, because Europe's oil and natural
gas reserves are running out and energy imports, now at
50 percent, will rise further. The European Union, moreover, has
been pushing for alternatives to fossil fuels as part of
its commitment under the Kyoto treaty to reduce greenhouse gases,
and it wants 22 percent of its electricity to come
from renewable sources by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Many projects have been delayed because officials everywhere are demanding stringent
environmental impact studies. These are still under way for the
Trafalgar wind fields, and it remains to be seen whether
they will support the fishermen's position. The area is on
the flight path of tens of thousands of eagles, ducks,
storks, swallows and many other birds crossing to winter in
Africa. Daniel Lopez Marijuan, of the association of Ecologists in
Action said, "The first studies have shown that migrating birds
do not fly very low here, unless a storm takes
them off their course."
</P>
<P>
There are other stakeholders, including two nearby NATO bases, the operators
of a gas duct that comes to Spain from North
Africa and the heavy shipping traffic in and out of
the Mediterranean, but planners say their studies show the windmills
pose no obstruction.
</P>
<P>
If that is true, the fishermen along the Trafalgar coast may
be alone in confronting the powerful lobby of wind producers.
"There is good money in wind," said Rafael Bayo, an
engineer and energy consultant. "That is why many hilltops now
have windmills. A farmer used to get nothing from his
hill, now he rents it to a utility or puts
his own windmills there."
</P>
<P>
This may continue, he believes, as long as the government pays
grid operators the difference between conventional and wind generated electricity,
on average two or three cents per kilowatt-hour. Eventually, some
experts think, wind power may become competitive as turbines get
bigger and as pollution taxes are imposed on fossil fuel
energy, as planned.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Bustos, who represents the association of wind producers, said his
group would try to convince the fishermen that they may
benefit from the offshore project. He said that in European
pilot projects, fish farms have been attached to sea-based windmills.
In another experiment, the underwater base of the mill was
used to create artificial reefs to act as fish nurseries.
At Barbate, the fishermen said they had never heard of
this.
</P>
<P>
Should the Trafalgar plans fail, then offshore parks may go elsewhere,
given the Spaniards' hunger for wind profits. "There are dozens
of projects waiting for licenses, on land and offshore," Bustos
said. "Enough to produce another 50,000 megawatts."
