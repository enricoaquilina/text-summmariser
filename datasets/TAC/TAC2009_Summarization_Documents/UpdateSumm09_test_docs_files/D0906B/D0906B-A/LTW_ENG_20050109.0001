As stormy weather continued to pound Southern
California on Saturday, about 170 people were freed from cars near Big
Bear where they had been trapped for up to 15 hours in deep snow,
several of the state's major arteries were closed and rescue workers
pulled two people from raging streams.
</P>
<P>
Serious concerns remained about how the water-logged region would
hold up with storms expected to continue at least through Sunday
evening. Although there appeared to be no major flooding or mudslides,
the day was not without drama.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers used snowplows, snowcats and snowmobiles to free
people from a 6-mile stretch of California Highway 18 in the San
Bernardino Mountains after a combination of snow, rain, sleet and fog
created a 200-vehicle logjam. Although many of those stuck along the
route spent the night in their cars, there were no major injuries.

<P>
In Rosemead, rescuers plucked a woman from a wash after water
carried her nearly a quarter of a mile. San Bernardino County
firefighters used a bulldozer to rescue a man from a swollen waterway.
Several of the state's major arteries were closed because of snow,
rock slides and weather-related accidents.
</P>
<P>
Cities along the coast received from 1 to 4 inches of rain, while
mountain regions reported as much as 8 inches.
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol reported 430 accidents as of 6 p.m.
in Southern California -- double last Saturday's total for the same
time period.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters expected rain to continue most of Sunday before
diminishing. A flood watch remained in effect for Los Angeles, Orange,
San Diego, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, and flash flood
warnings remained for San Bernardino County.
