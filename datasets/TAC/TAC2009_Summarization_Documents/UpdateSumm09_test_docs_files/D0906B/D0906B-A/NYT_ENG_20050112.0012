The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Jan.

Here we are, three weeks into winter, and the season has
delivered almost every kind of weather it has to deliver:
waterspouts off Ventura, Calif., ice storms in the central Plains,
glacial fog in the Texas Panhandle, profound depths of snow
in the Sierra Nevada, flooding in the Ohio Valley and
an all too familiar mix of ice, snow and rain
in the Northeast.

Nowhere has winter been more impressive this year than in Southern
California. Los Angeles has already had some 5 inches more
than its annual rainfall in the last two weeks, including
a record 2.6 inches on Sunday. The numbers do not
really convey the effect of all that water, combined with
powerful storm surges along the coast. Mudslides have closed freeways
and caused evacuations and some deaths. Every creek and river
-- dry streambeds for most of the year -- has
swollen to a dangerous tide of dark water. Vast stretches
of the Mojave Desert have been inundated by the unstinting
rain. In the Central Valley, water stands in the fields,
washing out the hope of some crops. In Bakersfield, which
averages less than 6 inches of rainfall a year, the
rain fell in sheets on Sunday and Monday, turning highways
into long columns of vehicle-beaten spray.

There is temporary respite coming. Good weather will hit Southern California
later this week, and the Northeast has enjoyed some mild
intervals. And this much moisture in the arid West always
promises good news, despite the chaotic way it has come.
But no matter how good the weather gets for a
few days in mid-January, the bulk of winter lies ahead.
It's hard to imagine what it may bring.
