PROSECUTORS IN TYCO CASE PRESS EX-CHIEF ON LOANS

<P>
L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of
Tyco International, parried a barrage of tough questions during cross-examination
on Thursday, at times appearing to frustrate an increasingly incensed
prosecutor by calmly and consistently agreeing with her.
</P>
<P>
"Tyco's money was not your money to spend on yourself as
you pleased, was it?" the prosecutor, Ann Donnelly, asked Kozlowski,
clearly trying to agitate him.
</P>
<P>
"That's correct," Kozlowski nonchalantly replied.
</P>
<P>
"Where did the buck stop?" she continued.
</P>
<P>
"The buck stops with me with everything at Tyco," he said
in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
Sitting calmly on the witness stand for nearly four hours, Kozlowski,
who is accused, along with the company's chief financial officer,
of looting the company of $150 million by secretly forgiving
loans they had received, acknowledged that mistakes had been made
in disclosing some payments in government and tax filings. But
he said they were innocent mistakes and the payments were
properly authorized bonuses.
</P>
<P>
While Kozlowski admitted many of the prosecution's assertions about how the
money was used, he consistently said that he never intended
to commit a crime because all the loans, which he
says were approved by the board, were "in the records
and books of the company," as he explained at one
point.
</P>
<P>
During the last portion of his direct testimony, he said that
he had typically tried to pay off his loans at
the end of every year.
</P>
<P>
He also said that when he left Tyco in June 2002,
he owed the company about $16 million in outstanding loans,
but the company held about $80 million in compensation he
had deferred.
</P>
<P>
Still, his most difficult testimony came when he was confronted with
his W-2 form from 1999, which omitted $25 million that
Tyco had forgiven him. Again, Kozlowski agreed with Donnelly. "I
absolutely agree that the $25 million belonged on my W-2
that was prepared by Tyco," he said. "The numbers were
big; I had a lot of money in deferred income,"
he said as in way of explanation. He said he
also earned about $38 million, which he deferred, and as
a result, it was not taxed.
</P>
<P>
Donnelly, seeming almost exasperated, pressed him further. "It's your testimony that
you did not notice that $25 million was missing?" she
asked. "That is absolutely my testimony," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski later told jurors that his tax bill for that year
was $9.6 million. Had the $25 million been included, he
said, he would have owed the government about $17.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski is not charged in this trial with evading the tax,
but prosecutors hope to use the W-2 form as evidence
that he tried to conceal that payment.
</P>
<P>
Donnelly also displayed minutes from a 1999 Tyco compensation committee meeting
where Kozlowski's pay was approved. "There is no section in
these minutes that gives you $25 million in loan forgiveness,
is there?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
"No," he said. He later said she misused the term "loan
forgiveness."
</P>
<P>
"Ms. Donnelly, I was given a bonus, and instead of taking
the cash bonus, I was paying down debt to the
company," he said.
</P>
<P>
Donnelly spent much of the afternoon questioning Kozlowski about his use
of two of Tyco's loan programs, which he is accused
of misusing. Kozlowski used the two programs, one to help
employees pay relocation costs and another to help them pay
taxes on restricted stock grants, to pay for an assortment
of items that fell outside of those purposes. He did
not deny that the loans were used for purposes other
than the ones described. "I thought I was authorized," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The program had been used for other purposes by other executives
since the 1970s, he said, "long before I was CEO
of the company, well before I was an officer."
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski also said that the decision to use the loan program
instead of his own money for certain payments was typically
made not by him, but by an assistant at the
company who was in charge of his personal finances.
</P>
<P>
"So you are saying that it was the responsibility of Cathy
McRae, who ran your personal affairs, to decide whether or
not she should use Tyco money for your personal investment?"
Donnelly asked.
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility of my personal affairs were mine," he said. "She
had the authority to manage my personal affairs and make
decisions within that sphere of responsibility."
</P>
<P>
He added: "Cathy did make some decisions whether she would pull
from the Key Employee Loan that I was entitled to,
or whether she would write a check from one of
my banks."
</P>
<P>
At one point, Kozlowski came under fire after acknowledging that he
had said he did not know the $25 million he
received was used to pay down an employee loan, instead
of his relocation account balance.
</P>
<P>
"Ms. Donnelly, it may seem inconceivable to you that I may
not know how that happened," he said. "I am responsible
for what I owe Tyco. I take full responsibility for
that. But to sit down and to track the loans
on a day-in and day-out basis, to reconcile loans, to
make wire transfers, to take care of the things that
I was doing, that responsibility I delegated to somebody else,
simply because I was the chief executive officer of Tyco
and, you know, I was doing many, many other things
at that time."
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski was also shown proxy materials and annual reports from certain
years that described the loan programs in explicit terms, unlike
those from several other years in which the terms were
slightly vaguer.
</P>
<P>
Donnelly asked Kozlowski, who is also accused of securities fraud, whether
it was his responsibility to make sure the proxy was
accurate when he signed it. "I'm not skirting my signing
responsibility, but in my becoming chief executive officer of Tyco,
I relied upon the experts in the field of proxy
preparation and SEC law to appropriately represent that which needed
to be disclosed for Tyco and that which did not
need to be disclosed for Tyco," he said. "Still, I'm
ultimately responsible."
