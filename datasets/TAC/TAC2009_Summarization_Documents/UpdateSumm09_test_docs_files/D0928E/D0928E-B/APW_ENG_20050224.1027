Ex-Tyco VP: Never saw documents showing bonus approval

Tyco International Ltd.'s former head of finance testified Thursday he never saw
that millions of dollars in special bonuses for former top executives L. Dennis
Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz were ever approved by the company's compensation
committee.
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by prosecutors, Mark D. Foley, the Bermuda conglomerate's
former senior vice president of finance, also said he wasn't aware of any
documents being provided to the committee that detailed the special bonuses paid
to Kozlowski, Tyco's former chief executive, and Swartz, its ex-chief financial
officer, in those years.
</P>
<P>
"Did you know of any document provided to the compensation committee that stated
Dennis Kozlowski got $32 million in loan forgiveness and gross ups in September
2000?" asked Assistant District Attorney Marc Scholl.
</P>
<P>
"No," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claim Kozlowski and Swartz took millions of dollars of compensation
without proper authorization by Tyco's directors, including more than $32
million (euro24.13 million) in loan forgiveness and payments to cover taxes,
known as gross ups, to Kozlowski in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski, 58 years old, and Swartz, 44, are on trial in New York State Supreme
Court, facing charges of grand larceny, securities fraud and other crimes in
connection with giant bonuses and other compensation they received while working
as Tyco's top executives. They each face up to 25 years in prison on the most
serious charge of grand larceny. They have denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Their first trial ended in a mistrial in April after a juror reported receiving
a phone call and letter about the case during deliberations. The juror's name
had been disclosed by several news organizations after she appeared to give an
"OK" signal to the defense.
</P>
<P>
In his fifth and final day of testimony, Foley said management representation
letters provided to Tyco's auditors and its directors indicated millions of
dollars in management bonuses were paid to key employees in 1999 and in 2000,
but didn't specifically state bonuses were paid to Kozlowski and Swartz. More
detailed documentation of the bonuses were provided separately to the auditors,
Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"Was Dennis Kozlowski a key Tyco employee?" asked James R. DeVita, one of
Kozlowski's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
Brian Moroze, Tyco's deputy general counsel, testified Thursday that Swartz
ordered him to change a company relocation program in 1995 to allow certain
employees to borrow money for more than one home.
</P>
<P>
Moroze said Swartz, in a handwritten memo, also told him to change the program
to extend the period in which employees could receive temporary housing
assistance from 12 months to 24 months and to add language that allowed the
employees to receive educational expenses for their children. The program was in
connection with the relocation of certain employees to New York, including
Kozlowski and Swartz.
</P>
<P>
Before that, Tyco had only provided "bridge" loans for relocation, meaning
employees could borrow against the equity in their homes to buy a new home near
their new work location. The employee would repay the bridge loan when they sold
their old home, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Moroze said he didn't have personal knowledge if the company's
compensation committee ever approved the changes.
</P>
<P>
Tyco has its headquarters in Bermuda, but now operates out of New
Jersey.
