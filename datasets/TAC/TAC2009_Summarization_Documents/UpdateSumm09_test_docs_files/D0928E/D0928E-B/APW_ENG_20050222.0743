A $2 million (euro1.5 million) birthday party, a key component in the
prosecution's case in the first trial of Tyco International Ltd.'s former top
executives, was raised for the first time Tuesday in their retrial.
</P>
<P>
In his third day of questioning by prosecutors, Mark D. Foley, Tyco's former
senior vice president of finance, testified that he was told the 2001 party was
a "management meeting" on the island of Sardinia off the coast of Italy and
would include a meeting of Tyco's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
Foley said he later learned the meeting would include a number of nonmanagement
personnel.
</P>
<P>
"I think it worked out close to 50-50," Foley said in response to a question by
Assistant District Attorney Marc Scholl.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claim the weeklong event was more of a celebration for Chief
Executive L. Dennis Kozlowski's wife, Karen Mayo, rather than a company
function. The event was attended by about 75 people, including Chief Financial
Officer Mark H. Swartz.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski, 58 years old, and Swartz, 44, are on trial in New York State Supreme
Court, facing charges of grand larceny, securities fraud and other crimes in
connection with giant bonuses and other compensation they received while working
as Tyco's top executives. They each face up to 25 years in prison on the most
serious charge of grand larceny. They have denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Their first trial ended in a mistrial in April after a juror reported receiving
a phone call and letter about the case during deliberations. The juror's name
had been disclosed by several news organizations after she appeared to give an
"OK" signal to the defense.
</P>
<P>
In the first trial, Barbara Jacques, a former Tyco employee who helped plan the
event, testified that about half the party was paid for by Tyco and the rest was
paid by Kozlowski. During her testimony, prosecutors played a videotape of the
party, which included an elaborate ice sculpture of Michelangelo's David, models
in Roman dress and a performance by pop musician Jimmy Buffett.
</P>
<P>
As cross-examination by defense attorneys began Tuesday, Foley testified that he
wasn't instructed to withhold documents from Tyco's auditors, its audit
committee or the company's directors.
</P>
<P>
"Did Dennis Kozlowski ever tell you to withhold any records from the outside
auditors?" asked James R. DeVita, one of Kozlowski's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"No," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
Tyco has its headquarters in Bermuda, but now operates out of West Windsor, New
Jersey
