KOZLOWSKI TESTIFIES HE NEVER NOTICED $25 MILLION OMISSION
</HEADLINE>

NEW YORK

<P>
L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of
the conglomerate Tyco International, took the stand to declare his
innocence at his retrial Wednesday, a surprising reversal in strategy
from his first trial, at which he did not testify.
</P>
<P>
As word spread early Wednesday at the New York State Supreme
Court in Lower Manhattan that Kozlowski was about to testify,
the often near-empty courtroom quickly filled with spectators.
</P>
<P>
Looking directly at the six men and six women of the
jury, Kozlowski, whose first trial ended in a hung jury,
explained why he had decided to take the stand. "I'm
here so I can explain to them why I'm innocent
of all the charges against me," he said, dressed in
a gray suit, light blue shirt and navy tie.
</P>
<P>
In long and sometimes rambling answers to his lawyer's questions, Kozlowski
portrayed himself as an earnest, often harried, executive who rose
through the ranks and had the full support of the
company's board. While his testimony was clearly prepared and perhaps
unsurprising, Kozlowski will face his most important test as early
as Thursday, when the prosecution is expected to begin its
cross-examination of him. He is likely to be challenged in
particular over his explanation on Wednesday on why his 1999
tax return omitted a $25 million payment that was used
to forgive a loan from Tyco. He matter of factly
said the omission was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski's decision to testify -- a choice that is fraught with
risk -- gave members of the jury their first chance
to hear directly from the man whom they have sat
across from for nearly four months. Speaking in his trademark
squeaky, nasal voice, which seems at odds with his physically
imposing appearance, Kozlowski and his lawyers may be hoping that
putting him on the stand will humanize him and allow
him to directly answer the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
"Once a defendant decides to testify, in many senses everything that
came before it in the trial becomes irrelevant," said Jonathan
Polkes, a partner at Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges and a
former federal prosecutor. "If the jury likes and believes the
defendant, the jury will be inclined to acquit. If they
don't, they'll be inclined to convict."
</P>
<P>
Kozlowksi and Tyco's former chief financial officer, Mark H. Swartz, are
accused of stealing $150 million by improperly forgiving company loans
to themselves and awarding themselves unauthorized bonuses. They are also
accused of profiting illegally by selling $575 million worth of
Tyco stock whose value they had artificially inflated.
</P>
<P>
In choosing to put Kozlowski on the stand, his lawyers may
have been encouraged by interviews with jurors after the first
trial, who had commented that their impression of Kozlowski had
changed for the better after they viewed a snippet of
him speaking on a videotape of the now infamous $2
million birthday party for his wife in Sardinia that was
partially paid for with Tyco funds. The jurors said they
were fascinated by how out-of-place Kozlowski seemed at the party
and his unpretentious demeanor. The most famous of those jurors,
Ruth Jordan, Juror No. 4, who had held out for
an acquittal, made a much noticed appearance in court on
Wednesday, taking a seat in the back row after lunch.
She drew more attention by the throng of camera crews
that assembled outside of the courthouse than even Kozlowski.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski may have also felt he needed to testify because the
prosecution, so far, has appeared to put on a substantially
stronger, more focused case this time around. During the first
trial, jurors said they were put off by the prosecution's
often meandering and disorganized presentation that focused as much attention
on his lavish spending as it did on the criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski's lawyer, Stephen Kaufman, spent much of the morning having him
recite his rags-to-riches story. Kozlowski, 58, told the jury how
he grew up in Newark, N.J., played guitar in a
band to make money in high school (he said he
was a horrible guitar player but was good at booking
gigs), went to Seton Hall University, was married to a
woman from the Bronx and was paid $28,000 a year
when he started at Tyco as an accountant in the
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
He then outlined his credentials, testifying that revenue at Tyco was
about $20 million when he arrived and had grown to
$40 billion by the time he left the huge conglomerate
in June 2002.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski also explained a crucial part of the defense's case --that
Tyco's compensation committee, and specifically its leader Phillip V. Hampton
-- had approved the bonuses in question. Hampton died of
cancer in 2001. Several of Tyco's directors on the compensation
committee have testified that the bonuses were not approved.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski described Hampton as a mentor and the man who had
helped him become chief executive. "He covered my back at
the organization," Kozlowski said. He recounted several conversations in which
he insisted that Hampton had given him explicit permission to
forgive the loans in question. At one point, he recalled
a conversation with Hampton in which Kozlowski told him that
the year's bonuses were going to be huge and he
suggested that instead of paying them in full, the bonuses
be partially used to pay off loans. "The numbers are
going to be big, embarrassingly big," he said he told
Hampton, whom Kozlowski said signed off on the plan.
</P>
<P>
Hoping to take the heat out of perhaps the prosecution's strongest
piece of evidence -- that a $25 million payment was
absent from his 1999 tax return, Kozlowski just apologized. "I
cannot explain why," he said. "I was not thinking when
I signed my tax return."
</P>
<P>
He said he never noticed the money because it was forgiveness
of a company loan and he never received a check
for it. Seeming almost embarrassed, he said that it was
part of a pay package that year that amounted to
more than $60 million, much of which he had deferred
for tax purposes. Furthermore, he insisted, his accountant and an
administrator missed the omission as well.
</P>
<P>
He portrayed himself in his testimony as a busy executive with
a punishing schedule and endless commitments that often put him
on the road and consumed his attention, forcing him to
delegate the details to others. He added that he trusted
the company's day-to-day operations to others and preferred to delegate
rather than delve into details.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had a computer in his office, he replied,
"Yes, but just for show."
