<P>
Former Tyco International Ltd. chief L. Dennis Kozlowski took the witness stand
Wednesday and denied he ever abused company loan programs or received a bonus to
which he was not entitled.
</P>
<P>
Testifying in his own defense at his retrial on larceny charges _ he did not
take the stand at the first trial _ Kozlowski said his intent was always to grow
the company, never to commit a crime.
</P>
<P>
Still, asked by his lead lawyer why a $25 million (euro19 million) bonus from
the company did not appear on his 1999 tax return, Kozlowski said he could not
explain why.
</P>
<P>
"I just was not thinking when I signed my tax return that I had a $25 million
loan forgiveness," Kozlowski said. "Year in and year out at Tyco, my tax returns
for the most part had been correct. I didn't pick up on it."
</P>
<P>
The $25 million forgiveness of loans from the company had come as part of $62
million (euro48 million) in bonuses Kozlowski received at the time. Prosecutors
say it should have been reported as income.
</P>
<P>
Tyco, which has about 250,000 employees and $36 billion (euro27.8 billion) in
annual revenue, makes electronics and medical supplies and owns the ADT home
security business. Nominally based in Bermuda, its operations headquarters are
in West Windsor, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski, 58, was the first defense witness in the trial of him and former
Chief Financial Officer Mark H. Swartz, 44. The two are accused of looting the
conglomerate of $600 million (euro460 million).
</P>
<P>
They are accused of stealing $170 million (euro131.5 million) from Tyco by
hiding unauthorized pay and bonuses and by abusing company loan programs and
making $430 million (euro332.8 million) by inflating the value of Tyco stock by
lying about the company's finances.
</P>
<P>
The defendants are being retried in Manhattan's state Supreme Court on charges
of grand larceny, falsifying business records and violating state business laws.
Their first trial ended in a mistrial in April 2004 after a juror received
menacing messages during deliberations as a result of her name being
published.
</P>
<P>
The press customarily does not name jurors during a trial.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski, whose appearance as a witness was something of a surprise, began by
answering a series of questions posed by his lawyer, Stephen Kaufman. Had he
ever taken a bonus to which he was not entitled? Did he abuse Tyco's loan and
relocation programs?
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski replied "no" to each question.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski later testified that he thought a $20 million (euro15.5 million) fee
he paid Tyco board member Frank Walsh for arranging the acquisition of
commercial lender CIT Inc. had been proper.
</P>
<P>
When another board member suggested Walsh should give the fee back because of
enhanced corporate scrutiny following the fall of Enron Corp., Kozlowski said he
defended the deal.
</P>
<P>
"I said if they thought I did something wrong I was willing to step down as CEO
of Tyco," Kozlowski said.
</P>
<P>
He said none of the directors objected. Walsh later quit the Tyco board rather
than give the fee back.
</P>
<P>
Kaufman asked Kozlowski: "Did you believe the payment of the fee to Frank Walsh
required the authorization of the board of directors?"
</P>
<P>
"No, I did not," Kozlowski replied.
</P>
<P>
"Did you intend to steal the money?" the lawyer asked.
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," Kozlowski said.
</P>
<P>
Swartz was the only defense witness in the first trial. On the witness stand for
nine days, he explained in detail Tyco's compensation plans, his and Kozlowski's
relations with the board of directors and actions that prosecutors said were
illegal.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, after the prosecution rested, defense lawyers suggested that
Kozlowski could testify, but they insisted no decision had been
made.
