Kozlowski says he stuffed some of the "awful" apartment decorations in closet

A prosecutor turned the witness chair into the hot seat for former Tyco CEO L.
Dennis Kozlowski on Monday with questions about $12 million the company spent on
decorations and millions more for art for Kozlowski's Manhattan
apartment.
</P>
<P>
Assistant District Attorney Ann Donnelly noted for the jury that 2001
renovations on the Fifth Avenue apartment occurred at a time when Kozlowski had
promised shareholders Tyco was engaged in a relentless push to save money
throughout the organization. She asked Kozlowski if the decorations _ including
a $15,000 umbrella stand and dozens of paintings _ were inconsistent with "a
relentless push to cut costs."
</P>
<P>
"That's correct," he answered. "It was overspent, and I take responsibility for
that. On the other hand, I thought it would appreciate in value."
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have said furnishings at the luxurious duplex also included a $6,000
gold-threaded shower curtain, a $2,900 set of hangers and a $2,665 blue velvet
pillow.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski drew laughter from several jurors and a few raised eyebrows in
Manhattan's state Supreme Court when he said he did not like some
decorations.
</P>
<P>
"I stuffed some in the closet," he said. "Some of it was God
awful."
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski also defended as "appropriate" the company's $1 million expense for a
weeklong celebration on the Italian island of Sardinia that was promoted as a
40th birthday party for his wife.
</P>
<P>
He said the birthday party, featuring a performance by singer Jimmy Buffett and
scantily clad young men and women dancing and serving, was only one evening of a
trip that rewarded some of the company's most overworked employees.
</P>
<P>
"A perk trip like this from time to time spent money on employees to keep them
motivated and hopefully reward their spouses as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor repeatedly brought up references to Kozlowski's wife, saying her
clothing was at the Manhattan apartment, where an $18 million renovation
repaired light fixtures and damaged walls and floors before the decorating
began.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski said his wife spent only two nights in the apartment and he used it
only as a hotel room.
</P>
<P>
"Her clothing might have been there, but she wasn't," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than $10 million, most of it Tyco money, was spent on at least a dozen
paintings, including a Monet and a Renoir, for the apartment, the government
said.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski insisted he enlisted a respected art dealer to obtain a fair price for
Tyco, sending her back to a London gallery to drive a $2 million price tag for
some art down another $50,000.
</P>
<P>
"It's just like buying a car _ a very, very expensive car," he said, prompting
one juror to snicker.
</P>
<P>
The testimony came in the second trial of Kozlowski and former Chief Financial
Officer Mark Swartz.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are charged with grand larceny, falsifying
business records, conspiracy and business law violations. Their first trial
ended with a mistrial in April 2004 when a juror received a menacing letter and
phone call after some media reported her name during deliberations.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski testified that his main residences were in Florida and New Hampshire
and that he used the Manhattan apartment only for business meetings or when he
needed to stay in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
He said he never saw a bill for the decor, which was chosen by a woman who had
renovated his property in New Hampshire and selected cushions for his
yacht.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski and Swartz are accused of stealing $170 million by hiding unauthorized
bonuses and secretly forgiving loans to themselves and pocketing $430 million
more by pumping up Tyco stock with lies about the state of the company's
finances.
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the current top charge, first-degree grand larceny, and some of
the other more serious counts, the defendants each could face up to 30 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
Tyco International Ltd., which has about 250,000 employees and $40 billion in
annual revenue, makes electronics and medical supplies and owns the ADT home
security business. Nominally based in Bermuda, its operations headquarters are
in West Windsor, New Jersey.
