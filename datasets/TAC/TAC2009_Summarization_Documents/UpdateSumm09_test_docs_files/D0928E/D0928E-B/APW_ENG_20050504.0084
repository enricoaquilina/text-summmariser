<P>
Former Tyco International Ltd. CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski finished four days of
testimony at his grand larceny trial, insisting that he left it to lawyers and
accountants to decide what to tell shareholders about his compensation.
</P>
<P>
Testifying only briefly Tuesday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan in response
to followup questions from his lawyer, Kozlowski acknowledged that as CEO he
signed the company's most important documents relating to what was publicly
reported about his finances.
</P>
<P>
He said he trusted the decisions of the lawyers and accountants and did not
direct them on whether to include information on public documents such as tens
of millions of dollars in loans that were forgiven as part of his annual bonus
packages.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski also testified that he did not notice that $25 million in bonus
payments used to pay off a company loan was not included on his tax forms from
the company for 1999.
</P>
<P>
"No one ever told me it wasn't on my W2," he said, referring to the tax document
that lists how much he was compensated for the year by the company. "It never
dawned on me."
</P>
<P>
He also said he paid about $1 million of his own money toward the company's
weeklong celebration on the Italian island of Sardinia that was promoted as a
40th birthday party for his wife. The company also paid about $1
million.
</P>
<P>
Since taking the stand April 27, Kozlowski testified extensively about the party
and the tens of millions of dollars the company spent on a Fifth Avenue
apartment he said he used only sparingly.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Kozlowski's co-defendant, former Chief Financial Officer Mark
Swartz, was to begin testifying.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are charged with grand larceny, falsifying
business records, conspiracy and business law violations. Their first trial
ended with a mistrial in April 2004 when a juror received a menacing letter and
phone call after some media reported her name during deliberations.
</P>
<P>
They are accused of stealing $170 million from the company by hiding
unauthorized bonuses and secretly forgiving loans to themselves and pocketing
$430 million more by pumping up Tyco stock with lies about the company's
finances.
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the top charge against them, first-degree grand larceny, and
some of the other more serious counts, the defendants each could face up to 30
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
In their first trial, Swartz was the only defense witness. On the witness stand
for nine days, he explained Tyco's compensation plans, his and Kozlowski's
relations with the board of directors and actions that prosecutors said were
illegal.
</P>
<P>
Tyco International Ltd., which has about 250,000 employees and $40 billion in
annual revenue, makes electronics and medical supplies and owns the ADT home
security business. Nominally based in Bermuda, its operations headquarters are
in West Windsor, New Jersey.
