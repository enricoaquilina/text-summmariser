<P>
A retired chairman of the board of Tyco International Ltd. testified the
company's financial monitors never told him about millions of dollars in
forgiven loans and bonuses for Tyco's two top executives.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's former CEO, and Mark H. Swartz, the
company's former finance chief, suggested that former chairman John F. Fort and
other directors knew about _ but did not protest _ money the executives
received.
</P>
<P>
Fort, 63, was chairman of the board's audit committee for much of Kozlowski's
time as CEO. He said Mark Foley, Tyco's director of financial operations, never
told him Kozlowski and Swartz had a total of $37.5 million in loans from Tyco in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Fort, under redirect questioning by prosecutor Ann Donnelly, also said the head
of Tyco's external audit team, Richard Scalzo of the accounting firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers, never told him anything about Tyco's finances being
amiss.
</P>
<P>
Fort said he asked Scalzo in each audit committee meeting whether he had seen
anything that might hurt or embarrass the company or that the board needed to
worry about, and Scalzo always answered that nothing was wrong.
</P>
<P>
"In each meeting he assured us of that," Fort testified.
</P>
<P>
Fort was the first witness in the retrial of Kozlowski and Swartz, and testified
for three full days.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are on trial in Manhattan's state Supreme Court
on charges of grand larceny, securities fraud, falsifying business records and
related counts. If convicted of grand larceny alone, each could face up to 25
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Kozlowski and Swartz stole $150 million outright by improperly
forgiving company loans to themselves, awarding themselves unauthorized bonuses
and having Tyco pay for their personal expenses.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say the defendants also made undetermined illegal profits by selling
$575 million worth of Tyco stock whose value they had artificially
inflated.
</P>
<P>
When the trial continues Thursday, the next witness is expected to be Frank
Walsh, a former Tyco director whose receipt of a $20 million investment banking
"fee" marked the beginning of the end of Kozlowski's tenure.
</P>
<P>
Walsh was indicted in connection with the payment but pleaded guilty and escaped
prison in part by returning the money.
</P>
<P>
Tyco International Ltd., which has more than 250,000 employees and $36 billion
in annual revenue, makes a wide range of products including electronics, medical
supplies and security devices. It is nominally based in Bermuda but has its
operations headquarters in West Windsor, New Jersey.
