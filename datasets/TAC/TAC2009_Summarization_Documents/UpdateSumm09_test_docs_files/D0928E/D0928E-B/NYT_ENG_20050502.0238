THINGS TURN A BIT TESTY AT TRIAL OF EX-TYCO CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During his first two days on the witness
stand, L. Dennis Kozlowski appeared calm as he parried a
series of tough questions. On Monday, things turned decidedly more
contentious as he faced accusations that he misused company funds
for lavish living and lied about it on the stand.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski, former chief executive of Tyco International, and Mark H. Swartz,
his former chief financial officer, are facing charges that they
looted the company of $150 million by secretly forgiving millions
of dollars of loans to themselves and others, without board
approval. He has contended that the board approved bonuses that
were used to forgive the loans.
</P>
<P>
In a fiery exchange at the end of the day, Kozlowski's
key testimony -- that he had received verbal approval for
millions of dollars of bonuses from the head of the
compensation committee, Philip Hampton, who has since died from cancer
-- was challenged during a heated cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
"It is true, it is a fact you never had any
conversation with Phil Hampton about you and your co-defendant getting
37-and-a-half million dollars in 1999, did you?" Ann Donnelly, an
assistant district attorney, asked derisively.
</P>
<P>
"I had conversations with Phil Hampton in 1999, in 2000, yes.
I did," Kozlowski responded, clearly agitated.
</P>
<P>
"You never had any conversation with Phil Hampton in which he
knew you and your co-defendant were taking $24 million, did
you?" Donnelly continued.
</P>
<P>
"That is totally untrue," Kozlowski answered.
</P>
<P>
The cross examination in the trial-level state Supreme Court in Manhattan,
which ended Monday -- redirect examination begins Tuesday -- often
put Kozlowski on the defensive. While he frequently appeared composed,
there were points in his testimony at which he challenged
Donnelly. At other times, he appeared unable to answer certain
questions, responding by saying, "I can't recall" or "I don't
remember."
</P>
<P>
Donnelly spent much of the afternoon asking about Kozlowski's prolific spending
of the company's money. She asked him whether using $1
million of Tyco's money on an elaborate trip in Sardinia,
Italy, at which a birthday party was held for Kozlowski's
wife, was consistent with a statement in the company's annual
report that called for "a relentless push to cut costs."
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski responded: "There was a relentless effort to cut costs, but
we also spent some money on employees to keep them
motivated and to hopefully reward them, especially their spouses who
gave up an awful lot of time with Tyco employees."
</P>
<P>
Donnelley zeroed in on an $18 million apartment on Fifth Avenue
that Kozlowski had the company buy, and an additional $12
million of company money that was used to renovate and
decorate the apartment. Kozlowski, who said a decorator he hired
had "overspent," acknowledged: "I did not oversee this in the
manner in which I should have overseen that apartment. I
was doing other things and I should have been focused
on the amount of money being spent there. I take
responsibility for that."
</P>
<P>
Calling some of the decorations "god-awful" and telling jurors that "I
stuffed some of it in the closet,"' he added: "I
also felt that the asset was going to improve --
appreciate for Tyco -- and I was given assurances by
the decorator that the antiques and things that she put
into that apartment were of ultimate value and should appreciate
in value. And those items belong to Tyco."
</P>
<P>
He said he rarely used the apartment and treated it like
a hotel: "I used the apartment for business meetings and
to sleep there when I was in town on Tyco
business." Calling the apartment "a Tyco facility," and saying his
wife slept there only two times ("Her clothing might have
been there, but she wasn't," he said). He insisted he
did not consider it a home, describing home as "a
place where you live, where you may have your family
dog." He kept homes in Boca Raton, Fla., and Nantucket,
Mass., he said.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski also defended using more than $10 million of Tyco money
on expensive artwork, including a Monet and a Renoir, saying
that they were assets of the company and that he
thought he had negotiated a good deal to buy them.
Describing how an agent went back and forth with a
London art dealer to negotiate a deal for one of
the paintings, he said, "It's just like buying a car
-- a very, very expensive car."
</P>
<P>
Donnelly, trying to mock him, questioned his motives for later wanting
to sell the art, challenging an answer he gave in
which he said he felt he could not move the
art to his house in Boca Raton because his wife
had security concerns.
</P>
<P>
"Didn't Tyco own ADT?" Donnelly shot back, referring to the security
alarm company.
</P>
<P>
"We had a security system," Kozlowski said. "People know how to
get around those from time to time."
