Manhattan judge denies request to combine Kozlowski larceny, tax
trials
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge refused to combine a retrial of larceny charges against
former Tyco International Ltd. chief executive L. Dennis Kozlowski
with a trial on charges that he failed to pay sales taxes on $13
million worth of art.
</P>
<P>
In denying the prosecution's consolidation request on Monday, state
Supreme Court Justice Michael Obus noted that the larceny trial, set
to begin Jan. 18, includes Tyco's former chief financial officer Mark
Swartz, 44. The judge said there is not enough evidence that Swartz
was involved in the tax scheme to join that trial with the larceny
retrial.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence that Swartz entered into any agreement, tacit
or express, with either Kozlowski or the art vendors to avoid the
payment of the sales tax," Obus wrote in his 11-page ruling.
</P>
<P>
The tax indictment charges Kozlowski, 57, with conspiracy, falsifying
business records and tampering with evidence. Obus had earlier noted
that nonpayment of sales taxes is not a crime but it is a crime to
fail to collect them.
</P>
<P>
Obus also said the charges involved different victims _ Tyco and its
shareholders in the larceny case, New York state in the tax evasion
case.
</P>
<P>
In the tax case, Kozlowski was accused of scheming with dealers to
avoid paying more than $1 million on $13 million worth of artworks.
In the larceny case, Kozlowski and Swartz are accused of looting more
than $600 million from Tyco.
</P>
<P>
If convicted on the first-degree grand larceny charge after their
retrial, Kozlowski and Swartz each could face up to 25 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
Tyco, based in Bermuda but with U.S. headquarters in West Windsor,
New Jersey, makes everything from telecommunications equipment to
home alarm systems.
