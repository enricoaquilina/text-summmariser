BIG FINANCIAL TRIALS COLLIDE

The Triple Crown of corporate scandals reached full stride
this week with the spectacle of three former big-money CEOs
on trial simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Cases against Tyco's Dennis Kozlowski and WorldCom's Bernie Ebbers Jr. began
last week in New York. The trial of HealthSouth's Richard
Scrushy launched Tuesday in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
The coincidental confluence gives Americans a glimpse of corporate theater: Accountants
in the limelight. CEOs on hot seats. Lavish lifestyles on
display.
</P>
<P>
Legal and business academics say the cases raise questions about big
themes, such as the delicate balance between a free market
and government regulation. But academics doubt Americans will be as
riveted by the trials as they were by less significant
courtroom dramas like the California case against wife-murderer Scott Peterson.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for a lot of people to get outraged. They
see them as a bunch of rich people ripping off
a bunch of other rich people," said Robert Thompson, a
Syracuse University professor of TV and pop culture.
</P>
<P>
Actually, corporate scandals hurt workers, clients and stockholders at all levels,
Thompson said. But plenty of educated Americans find it excruciating
to sort through complex financial allegations to keep track of
such malfeasance after recent government crackdowns, he said.
</P>
<P>
After all, this is just the latest bubble of corporate trials.
A similar round in 2003 and 2004 included the first
trial of Tyco's Kozlowski -- which ended in a mistrial
-- and cases against former Wall Street investment banker Frank
Quattrone, former Rite Aid senior executive Franklin C. Brown and
corporate chief/home maven Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
While corporate cases in recent years have tended to be big,
allegations of wrongdoing are far from new in the world
of business, said Emory law professor William Carney. "My first
reaction to some of these cases is, 'Ho-hum, just another
financial fraud case.' "
</P>
<P>
But Columbia University law professor John Coffee said the latest cases
highlight how prosecutors are broadening what they consider corporate crimes
they will pursue. In past decades, business leaders usually faced
only civil penalties for wrongdoing, except in cases of tax
fraud, insider trading or price-fixing, Coffee said.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are seeing virtually any kind of corporate scandal that
involves the interest of investors will be examined and scrutinized
by criminal enforcers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The allegations of the Tyco case -- including news of lavish
parties and a $6,000 shower curtain -- revolve around whether
corporate executives had the permission of the company's board before
embarking on "extraordinary conspicuous consumption," he said.
</P>
<P>
HealthSouth's Scrushy is fighting allegations of fraud and stock manipulation for
supposedly trying to make the company's financial situation look better
than it was, Coffee said. Ebbers is charged with fraud
after the collapse of the long-distance phone company he founded.
</P>
<P>
The cases will focus public attention again on corporate misbehavior, Coffee
said. But Americans' views of what is reprehensible will be
determined by "who goes to prison and for what."
