FORMER CHIEF OF TYCO STILL CLAIMS INNOCENCE ON EVE OF TRIAL NO. 2

L. Dennis Kozlowski wants to be clear: The
$6,000 shower curtain wasn't his idea.
</P>
<P>
The shower curtain, bought by his decorator on Tyco International's tab
for an extravagantly furnished Manhattan apartment, became perhaps the most
notable symbol of corporate excess and conspicuous consumption of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
"I understand why a $6,000 shower curtain seems indefensible," Kozlowski, Tyco's
former chief executive, said on the eve of his retrial
on charges of looting the company. "But I didn't know
about it. I just wasn't even aware of it."
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a pair of jeans and hiking boots, Kozlowski did
not look much like a swashbuckling, custom-suit-wearing chief executive.
</P>
<P>
He did not sound like one either. Soft-spoken and uncharacteristically reticent
at times, Kozlowski, in his first extensive interview since he
was charged more than two years ago with stealing hundreds
of millions of dollars from Tyco, said that he was
innocent and that the public perception of him was misguided.
</P>
<P>
"People think that I'm a greedy guy; that I was overcompensated,"
he said, leaning forward in his chair. "Greed, I think,
is the key word. But while I did earn enormous
sums of money, which for a poor kid from Newark
was spectacular, I worked my butt off, and it was
all based on my performance in Tyco's long established pay-for-performance
culture."
</P>
<P>
That image of greed, of course, stems from accusations that he
not only awarded himself unauthorized bonuses, but that he had
the company also pay $15,000 for an umbrella stand and
half the cost of a multimillion-dollar birthday party for his
second wife in Sardinia, with a now notorious ice sculpture
of Michelangelo's "David" that flowed vodka.
</P>
<P>
But Kozlowski, who faces a second trial on Tuesday in New
York state Supreme Court in Manhattan, portrayed himself as a
self-made entrepreneur who has become the victim of an overzealous
prosecutor interested in sensational headlines and a board trying to
protect itself from shareholder lawsuits. While clearly anxious about the
retrial and humbled by the enormity of the situation, he
remained unapologetic about his conduct at Tyco.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that I never did or intended to do
anything wrong," he said. "I never thought in my wildest
imagination I or any of us did anything wrong my
entire time there. I still cannot believe that they say
words like larceny."
</P>
<P>
It is a long way down from flying on private jets
and being driven everywhere by a chauffer. "I'm given an
allowance to pay for food and, you know, basic essentials
that I need," Kozlowski said.
</P>
<P>
The case against him, he argued, should have been heard in
a civil court, not criminal. "I do believe this is
a civil case between Tyco and I. After 27 years,
there was an unamicable breakup, a faulty divorce. And I
do believe this should be ironed out in a civil
manner and certainly not in a criminal manner."
