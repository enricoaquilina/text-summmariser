DEFENSE LAWYERS ADOPT NEW APPROACH IN KOZLOWSKI-SWARTZ TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK - Defense lawyers took a decidedly new approach in
their opening arguments in the retrial of L. Dennis Kozlowski
and Mark H. Swartz in state Supreme Court on Thursday,
lashing out at the former directors of Tyco and attacking
their credibility.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are saying the two men had illegally awarded themselves millions
of dollars in bonuses and concealed them from the company's
board and shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for both defendants, who had appeared to soft-peddle that issue
in the first trial, told the jury that the directors'
accusations that the two men stole more than $150 million
-- the entire basis of the prosecution's case -- is
part of a self-serving strategy by directors to protect themselves
from shareholder lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
"The directors are concerned about their pocketbook," Kozlowski's lawyer, Stephen Kaufman,
said, calling their contention that they had never approved millions
of dollars of bonuses for the men "revisionist history." Raising
his voice, Kaufman added: "If Dennis can be blamed, that
helps them."
</P>
<P>
Swartz's lawyer, Charles Stillman, applied the same theme, telling jurors, "You
need to decide who is telling you the truth." But
in a revealing moment, Stillman also appeared to divulge a
strategy shift, one that could ultimately pit Swartz against Kozlowski.
At the end of his presentation, Stillman told the jury,
"You must consider the evidence for each man separately."
</P>
<P>
That statement is a departure from the strategy that defense teams
used in the first trial in which both appeared to
approach the case with an all-for-one and one-for-all policy. Indeed,
throughout Stillman's presentation Thursday, he constantly referred to Swartz individually
and rarely mentioned Kozlowski's unless he was making the case
that Swartz was his subordinate.
</P>
<P>
Before the first trial and the retrial, Swartz had sought to
separate the cases, but the judge refused the requests. Still,
Stillman's remarks were the first time he seemed to try
to distance Swartz from Kozlowski, despite the fact that both
men are charged with nearly all the same crimes. The
shift may be the result of interviews with jurors from
the first trial, who said that they liked Swartz, who
testified in the first trial, better than they liked Kozlowski,
who did not testify.
</P>
<P>
One issue that both defense teams did agree on was to
make the issue of criminal intent a part of their
presentations. In the first trial, which ended in a mistrial,
at least one juror said she was planning to acquit
the men because she could not find that the defendants
had criminal intent.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski's lawyer, Kaufman, spoke in front of a projection screen that
said "Good Faith Belief Equals No Criminal Intent."
</P>
<P>
"The facts are that every penny that my client earned was
on the books and records of the company he headed,"
he said. "Dennis never committed any act of concealment."
</P>
<P>
"Criminals act in criminal ways," Kaufman said. "Does this strike you
as a criminal acting in a criminal way?"
</P>
<P>
Stillman, who stood next to a placard with a similar message
about criminal intent, also told the jury, "Mark had no
criminal intent because his intentions were honest. No criminal intent
means no crime."
</P>
<P>
Jurors in the retrial, which is expected to last about four
months, are expected to hear the first testimony on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rebutting each of the accusations the prosecution made on Wednesday during
its opening argument, Stillman also sought to dissuade the jury
from putting any stock in one of the prosecution's main
pieces of evidence, the company's board minutes. The prosecution said
it plans to show that the board approved none of
the bonuses paid to Kozlowski and Swartz and documented in
the minutes. Stillman said the minutes "cannot be relied on
to prove anything" because they are incomplete. He went on
to say that he planned to prove that "the directors
kept no minutes for half of their meetings." He added,
"You will hear of meeting in which important decisions were
made and no minutes."
</P>
<P>
As he closed, Stillman told the jury to pay attention to
what the directors actually did, not what they said. "My
mother taught me actions speak louder than words," he said.
