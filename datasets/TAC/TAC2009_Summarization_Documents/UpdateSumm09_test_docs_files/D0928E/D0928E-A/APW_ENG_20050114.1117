The retrial of two top Tyco International executives accused of stealing $600
million (euro458 million) of company money to finance lifestyles of gaudy excess
is set to begin next week. Legal experts say prosecutors should, and probably
will, focus less on items like the $6,000 (euro4,580) gold-threaded shower
curtain bought with company money and concentrate more on the alleged
thefts.
</P>
<P>
The first trial of L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz was aborted after six
months last year by a menacing letter and telephone call to a
juror.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have told the judge they expected to present a shorter, leaner case
against Kozlowski, Tyco's former chairman and chief executive officer, and Mark
Swartz, the former finance chief. They expect it to last a little more than four
months.
</P>
<P>
In the first trial in Manhattan's State Supreme Court, prosecutors gave jurors a
videotaped look at the $2 million (euro1.53 million) birthday party Kozlowski
threw for his wife on a Mediterranean island, and a video tour through his $18
million (euro13.75 million) Fifth Avenue apartment _ .
</P>
<P>
Jurors were told Kozlowski spent some $11 million (euro8.4 million) of Tyco's
money to furnish the apartment with amenities such as a $4,050 tablecloth and a
$515 toaster. There was also a $2,900 set of hangers, a $4,995 custom-made
blue-and-gold bedskirt, and a $2,665 blue velvet pillow.
</P>
<P>
And those were the little things.
</P>
<P>
The jurors also saw a Persian rug that cost $191,250, a George I walnut
arabesque clock that set Tyco back $113,750, an Ascherberg grand piano that cost
$77,000, and a pair of French antique stools, bought for $125,000.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau's office said at
the time that the extravagances demonstrated the defendants' greed and showed
where some of the money they allegedly stole ended up.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are charged with grand larceny, falsifying
business records, conspiracy and business law violations.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the defendants stole $170 million (euro130 million) by hiding
unauthorized bonuses and secretly forgiving loans to themselves, and pocketed an
additional $430 million (euro328 million) by pumping up Tyco stock by lying
about the state of the company's finances.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers said Kozlowski and Swartz earned every penny they got from
Tyco.
</P>
<P>
The trial judge, Justice Michael Obus, has already thrown out the top charge in
the original indictment _ enterprise corruption. That count suggested that
Kozlowski and Swartz had conspired with others to turn Tyco into a criminal
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the current top charge, first-degree grand larceny, and the
other more serious counts, the defendants each face up to 30 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
Tyco, which has about 270,000 employees and $36 billion (euro27.5 billion) in
annual revenue, makes a wide range of products including electronics, medical
supplies and security devices.
