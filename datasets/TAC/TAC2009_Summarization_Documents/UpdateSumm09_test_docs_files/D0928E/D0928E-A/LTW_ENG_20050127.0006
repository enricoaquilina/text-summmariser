Tyco Trial Begins Anew

The two former top executives of Tyco International
Ltd. stole $150 million from the industrial conglomerate even though
they were among the highest-paid people in corporate America, a
prosecutor told jurors as their retrial began Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a 3 1/2-hour opening argument, assistant Manhattan district
attorney Owen Heimer said L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz earned
almost $300 million in legitimate pay between 1999 and 2001, but took
the additional money to finance sumptuous lifestyles that included
purchases of lavish apartments and fancy artwork.
</P>
<P>
``This authorized compensation -- as huge as it was -- was just not
enough for these two men,'' Heimer said. ``They had to have more, so
they stole another $150 million.''
</P>
<P>
The first trial of Kozlowski and Swartz ended in mistrial last
April after a juror's actions upstaged the legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The juror, retired teacher Ruth B. Jordan, made a gesture in court
that some observers interpreted as an ``OK'' sign to the defendants.
Jordan was identified by several news organizations and subsequently
received a threatening letter, prompting the judge to declare a
mistrial a week later.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Jordan sat in the back row as Heimer finished his
presentation.
</P>
<P>
``I'm interested -- that's all,'' Jordan said afterward in
explaining her appearance. She indicated that she may attend further
court sessions, but would not come regularly. ``I've got a life,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski, Tyco's former chief executive, and his one-time chief
financial officer Swartz are accused of grand larceny, securities
fraud and conspiracy in an alleged plot to loot the company and cheat
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The men, who have pleaded not guilty, face up to 30 years in prison
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys are scheduled to give their opening statements
Thursday. In the first trial, defense lawyers said the executives'
actions were approved by the board, and that living an extravagant
lifestyle is not a crime.
</P>
<P>
Heimer argued Wednesday that Kozlowski and Swartz committed a range
of illegal acts, including drawing huge loans from the company and
then instructing underlings to erase them from the books. The men told
Tyco employees that the board of directors had ``forgiven'' the loans
through bonuses even though they hadn't, Heimer said.
</P>
<P>
After the first trial, several jurors criticized the Manhattan
District Attorney's office for what they saw as an overly lengthy and
ponderous presentation. The trial had gone on six months before ending
in mistrial.
</P>
<P>
Heimer appeared to be cognizant of that Wednesday as he delivered a
crisp and methodical argument that focused on seven specific instances
of alleged theft.
