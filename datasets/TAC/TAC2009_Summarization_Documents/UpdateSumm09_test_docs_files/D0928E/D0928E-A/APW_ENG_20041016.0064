Judge allows Tyco class-action lawsuit to proceed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge has allowed Tyco International Ltd. shareholders to
go forward with a class action lawsuit against the company and
others.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge Paul Barbadoro on Thursday struck down a
related claim that sought damages on behalf of Tyco stemming from
allegations of fraud and corporate looting.
</P>
<P>
Former top executives L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz are
awaiting retrial in federal court in New York on charges of stealing
$600 million (euro483.33 million) from the company. Their first trial
resulted in a hung jury. They have denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Barbadoro dismissed the claim seeking damages on behalf of Tyco
against most of its current directors and several of its former
directors and officers. Barbadoro said it was barred under Bermuda
law. Tyco, managed from West Windsor, New Jersey, is registered in
Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
"This represents a big shareholder win and a major step forward in
the case," Jay Eisenhofer, the plaintiffs lawyer, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Barbadoro rejected the defendants' attempt to separate the accounting
fraud allegations from the looting allegations, finding "both
interrelated and interdependent."
</P>
<P>
In the class-action lawsuit, shareholders seek damages against the
company, Kozlowski; Swartz; Mark Belnick, former director Frank
Walsh; and the company's auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
According to some estimates, investors lost $60 billion (euro48.33
billion).
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Tyco spokesman David Polk said: "We believe
we have a very strong case, and we are prepared to defend it
vigorously."
