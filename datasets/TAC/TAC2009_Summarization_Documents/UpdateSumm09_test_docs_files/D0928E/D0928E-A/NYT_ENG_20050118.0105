THE 'IDIOT' DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors have been chasing corporate crooks and piling up big statistics
in court for five years. Now get ready for a
series of trials featuring many of the biggest executives charged
with the most audacious crimes of their era.
</P>
<P>
A few big figures, like Martha Stewart and Frank Quattrone, were
mixed into the mostly no-name court lineup last year. But
2005 will be remembered as the year of the marquee
CEO on trial. Take a look at this lineup:
</P>
<P>
Bernie Ebbers. The trial of the former WorldCom Inc. chief executive
charged as the front man for an $11 billion fraud
begins this week in New York.
</P>
<P>
Ebbers is charged with fraud and conspiracy in the WorldCom collapse,
the largest bankruptcy in US history. Former chief financial officer
Scott Sullivan, who cut his own plea deal, will be
the government's star witness.
</P>
<P>
This will be an important test of the "idiot CEO" defense
(see Richard Scrushy and Ken Lay, below). Ebbers is expected
to say he left all the numbers to Sullivan, who
told prosecutors what they wanted to hear when he got
in trouble. Ebbers was a big-picture guy.
</P>
<P>
L. Dennis Kozlowski, the sequel. The former Tyco International Ltd. chief
who became a symbol of material excess began his retrial
in New York Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The first trial of Kozlowski and Tyco chief financial officer Mark
Swartz ended in a sensational mistrial after a juror favoring
acquittal found herself in the middle of a media frenzy
and ultimately received a threatening note.
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski and Swartz are charged with stealing hundreds of millions of
dollars from Tyco by hiding details of their compensation from
directors and selling big blocks of company stock after inflating
its value.
</P>
<P>
But it was Kozlowski's outrageous spending on the company tab ($15,000
for an umbrella stand?) that got most of the headlines.
</P>
<P>
Richard Scrushy. The founder of HealthSouth Corp. is charged as the
mastermind behind a $2.7 billion earnings fraud in a trial
underway in Alabama. A jury is being selected.
</P>
<P>
The HealthSouth scam wasn't as big as the WorldCom fraud, and
the company continues to operate today. But Scrushy takes the
cake when it comes to defense stories. He wasn't just
the idiot CEO, he may have been in a coma.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors will rely on five former chief financial officers who will
all implicate Scrushy as the ringleader. One secretly recorded the
former chief executive for the government.
</P>
<P>
Scrushy will blame his lieutenants for inflating HealthSouth's profits. See a
pattern?
</P>
<P>
Ken Lay. The former Enron Corp. chairman faces two trials. One,
in which Lay faces fraud, conspiracy, and bank fraud charges
alone, will probably be held later this year. The other,
in which he is charged along with two other former
Enron executives, may not make it to court before spring
2006.
</P>
<P>
Former chief executive Jeff Skilling and ex-chief accounting officer Richard Causey
will join Lay at a second fraud trial.
</P>
<P>
The Enron team was on the job during the most infamous
corporate fraud of its time. More than 5,000 employees lost
their jobs when Enron filed for bankruptcy in 2001. Lay,
as you surely know by now, was just another big-picture
guy in the dark about his company.
</P>
<P>
The idiot CEO strategy may sound risky, but it has been
successful elsewhere. A jury in Hartford was unable to reach
a verdict against former Cendant Corp. chairman Walter Forbes two
weeks ago, despite incriminating testimony from three executives.
</P>
<P>
The trials ahead culminate the effort to hold people criminally responsible
for the worst excesses of a dangerously excessive time. But
don't count the idiots out yet.
