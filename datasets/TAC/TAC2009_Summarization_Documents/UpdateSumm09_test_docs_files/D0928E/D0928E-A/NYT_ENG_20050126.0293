PROSECUTORS REWRITE SCRIPT IN TRIAL OF EX-TYCO OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors rewrote their opening script for the retrial of L. Dennis
Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz on Wednesday, purging the most
striking accusations of lavish spending that they had concentrated on
during the first trial.
</P>
<P>
Instead, prosecutors focused on laying out the core theme of their
case, saying the two men, former Tyco executives, had illegally
awarded themselves millions of dollars in bonuses and concealed them
from the company's board and shareholders.
</P>
<P>
"This case is the story of how two men -- the
defendants in this case -- stole $150 million from a
company named Tyco and that corporation's owners, its shareholders," said
Owen Heimer, an assistant Manhattan district attorney, in his opening
statement in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. "These
defendants ran Tyco, but they did not own Tyco."
</P>
<P>
While the case against Kozlowski and Swartz is very similar to
the first trial, the prosecution's new strategy -- conceived after
hours of interviews with jurors from the previous trial who
criticized their approach as unfocused -- may mean this trial
could take on a markedly different tone.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution needed no reminder of that trial. The lessons it
had learned were already on display: Heimer, a veteran, was
added to the prosecution's team and took the lead in
opening arguments, while Kenneth Chalifoux, an assistant Manhattan district attorney
who presented a meandering and often confusing opening during the
first trial, looked on from the prosecution's table.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Kozlowski and Swartz are scheduled to present their opening
arguments on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Heimer spent much of his presentation arguing that Kozlowski and Swartz
had intended to commit a crime. In the last trial,
at least one juror said she had been prepared to
acquit on all charges because she could not find that
the men had the requisite criminal intent. Many other jurors
said they, too, had wrestled with the issue of criminal
intent. Heimer repeatedly spoke to the jury of a process
he described as "instruct, deceive and conceal."
</P>
<P>
He said he would show evidence that the men had instructed
their subordinates to forgive loans, deceived the subordinates by telling
them the bonuses had been approved by the board and
then had concealed the payments from the board and the
public by not disclosing them.
</P>
<P>
Heimer said the men had also paid their subordinates unapproved bonuses
"because they were buying the employees' loyalty and buying the
employees' silence."
