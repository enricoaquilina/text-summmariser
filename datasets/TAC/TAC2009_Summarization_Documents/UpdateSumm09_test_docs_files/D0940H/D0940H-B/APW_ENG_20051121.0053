Attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland is running below government forecasts two
months after the park opened, the South China Morning Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Disneyland officials have refused to say how many people have visited the park.
This has angered lawmakers, who say the public has the right to know since the
government owns 57 percent of the attraction.

The Post reported that it sent four reporters to Disneyland on Nov. 13 and 16 to
count visitors with handheld tally counters. The reporters counted 12,972
visitors passing through the turnstiles on Nov. 13 and 11,399 on Nov. 16, the
paper said.

<P>
The government has said it expected 5.6 million visitors _ an average of 15,342
per day _ to the park in its first year of operation, the paper
said.

<P>
The MTR Corp., which operates a special subway line to the park, said it usually
carries 10,000 riders a day on weekdays and 20,000 on Sundays, the paper said.
However, some of the riders only visit the promenade outside Disneyland and
don't go into the park, the paper said.

A Disney spokeswoman said the newspaper's count was flawed but declined to give
the company's own figures, the report said. A Tourism Commission spokeswoman
said the Hong Kong government, which is the majority owner of the park, won't
disclose attendance figures for commercial reasons, the paper
said.

<P>
The government paid US$2.4 billion for the park's construction, while Walt
Disney Co. paid over US$314 million, according to official figures.
