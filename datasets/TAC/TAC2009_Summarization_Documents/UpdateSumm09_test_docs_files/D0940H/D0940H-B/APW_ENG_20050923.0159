The newly opened Hong Kong Disneyland said Friday it prefers that its 5,000
workers not unionize as activists described tough work conditions at the park
such as long hours, harsh turnarounds and lack of breaks.
</P>
<P>
Disneyland, which opened two weeks ago, said in a statement it respects the
right of workers to seek union representation, but that it thinks it's more
effective for labor and management to "work and communicate directly with each
other."
</P>
<P>
The statement came as activists detailed strenuous work conditions at the park
and an organizer said it's exploring the option of setting up a union with park
workers.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions Organizing Secretary Elaine Hui said the
park was unresponsive to workers and that they need the leverage of a union to
protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, if they want to discuss their treatment with the company, they
need to rely on the power of a union to get the right to dialogue under equal
circumstances," she said, noting Disneylands in the U.S. and France have
unions.
</P>
<P>
However, Hui said a stumbling block to unionizing is concern that the park may
retaliate against workers who join the union.
</P>
<P>
As the union dilemma is debated, activists said Disneyland workers complain they
work up to 13 hours a day and must make quick turnarounds, with some leaving
work late in the evening and due back early in the morning the next
day.
</P>
<P>
The long hours are aggravated by the long travel time to and from the park,
which is located on Hong Kong's outlying Lantau island, the Hong Kong
Confederation of Trade Unions and Disney Hunter, a Disneyland watchdog group,
said in a statement issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The activists urged Disneyland, which opened Sept. 12, to arrange bus services
for workers covering more areas.
</P>
<P>
They also said the workers' 45-minute lunch break should be lengthened to an
hour and that 15-minute breaks every four hours aren't enforced because of staff
shortages.
</P>
<P>
"Disney's goal is to pursue dreams and bring happiness to the masses, but its
labor policy is entirely opposite to such a goal, disappointing its eager
workers and the masses," the activists said in their statement.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Disneyland spokeswoman Esther Wong said Friday the park won't comment
on the allegations in detail, but that some of them are inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
Wong said labor-management relations are good and that staff retention has been
strong.
</P>
<P>
But she said the park will listen to worker feedback.
</P>
<P>
"Our cast members are a very important component," she said, using Disney's
terminology for its workers.
