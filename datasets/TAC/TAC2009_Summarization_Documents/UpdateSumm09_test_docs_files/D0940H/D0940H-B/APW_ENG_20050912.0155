Disney opens its newest theme park in Hong Kong

Hong Kong Disneyland threw open its gates to the public on Monday, marking
Mickey Mouse's biggest push into China _ a market the U.S. company hopes will
flood the theme park with splurging tourists from the world's most populous
nation.
</P>
<P>
With the pink Snow White Castle behind them, Disney executives and a senior
Chinese leader celebrated the opening with musicians clanging cymbals, Chinese
lion dancers prancing precariously on tall poles and fireworks bursting in the
sky.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony ended with a parade of skipping Disney characters old and new:
Mickey, Donald Duck, Mushu the dragon, Lilo and Winnie the Pooh.
</P>
<P>
Robert Iger, president of the Walt Disney Co., said it was exciting being part
of China's future. "As millions discover the wonders of Hong Kong and China _
one of the most rapidly growing travel destinations in the world _ the future is
indeed bright," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice President Zeng Qinghong called the park "Hong Kongers' eternal
carnival."
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of visitors lined up outside the park's gate, waiting to get in despite
muggy, sweltering heat.
</P>
<P>
Michael Kuzma, of Celebration, Florida, began queuing up a day early and was
first in line. "For over 50 years, the American people have experienced the
happiness of Disney theme parks. I hope the people of China can enjoy the
happiness," the 36-year-old consultant said.
</P>
<P>
The attraction and its two resort hotels are surrounded by mountains on lush
Lantau Island, just 30 minutes away by subway from bustling central Hong Kong.
It looks much like the first Disneyland in California, with a Space Mountain
thrill ride, a classic Cinderella Carousel and Sleeping Beauty Castle _ which
Disney predicts will be one of the most photographed buildings in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's government _ the biggest investor in the US$3.5 billion park _ says
the attraction will help turn this global financial capital into Asia's best
family holiday spot.
</P>
<P>
Disney hopes the park _ the 11th in its global empire _ will be a magnet for
increasingly wealthy Chinese tourists, who have a reputation for being
big-spenders.
</P>
<P>
Iger, president of Walt Disney Co., has said the Hong Kong park is a "first big
step" in expanding the company's reach into China, where generations have grown
up with little or no familiarity with Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
Iger said the park would create a media buzz and word-of-mouth excitement that
would ignite interest in Disney films, TV shows and other products. Hong
Kong-based Phoenix Television broadcast the Disneyland opening live to viewers
across China.
</P>
<P>
Michael Eisner, Disney's chief executive officer, said China and Disneyland will
be a perfect match because they both value families.
</P>
<P>
"You go to the park and you see mothers, daughters and kids and grandparents.
The family unit in China is unbelievably strong. It's not just Hong Kong, it's
mainland China," Eisner said.
</P>
<P>
An hour before Monday's opening ceremony, a small crowd of labor, human rights
and anti-Disney activists gathered outside the park's front gate, chanting "No
Conscience" and "Evil Mickey." They were protesting alleged labor abuses at
factories making Disney products in China. Disney has said it's investigating
the claims.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Disney struck a deal to build the park in 1999 _ just two years
after the former British colony returned to Chinese rule. The city had been
battered by the Asian financial crisis, and desperately needed a new project to
boost its spirits and troubled economy.
</P>
<P>
Disneyland says it employs 5,000 people and will draw 5.6 million visitors in
its first year.
</P>
<P>
So far, the biggest complaint among some of the thousands who got a sneak peak
at the park during a soft opening period has been that Hong Kong Disneyland is
too small. It's Disney's smallest park at 40 hectares (about 100
acres).
</P>
<P>
The entire attraction _ including the two hotels _ is 121 hectares (298 acres) _
and there's room to expand to 200 hectares (494 acres).
</P>
<P>
Chinese tourist Zhang Wei predicted the park would be a big hit with the
mainland Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"Disney has a big name and it will definitely attract people and be a success,"
said the 38-year-old businessman from Beijing as he finished watching the daily
parade of floats carrying a waving Little Mermaid, Alice in Wonderland and Buzz
Lightyear.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kongers have a reputation for being brusque and unsmiling, but the
Disneyland staff _ including cleaners and guards _ have been trying to master
the Disney tradition of giving guests a warm smile and hello.
</P>
<P>
The greetings were Hong Kong visitor Evie Chan's favorite thing about the park.
"The staff here is very friendly," said Chan, an employee of a marketing firm in
her late 20s. "It's like we've known each other for a long time."
