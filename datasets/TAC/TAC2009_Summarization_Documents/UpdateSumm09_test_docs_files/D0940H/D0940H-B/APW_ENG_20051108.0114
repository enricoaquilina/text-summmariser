Hong Kong Disneyland said Tuesday it will offer ticket discounts for one month
to local residents to thank them for their support, but denied the move was
prompted by low attendance at the park, which opened two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
"The discount has absolutely no relation to attendance numbers," park
spokeswoman Esther Wong said. "We are thanking locals for giving us good support
since we opened."
</P>
<P>
Starting Tuesday, prices for Hong Kong residents will be slashed by HK$50
(US$6.40; euro5.5) per ticket _ a reduction of about 20 percent. A peak time
ticket for an adult will cost HK$300 (US$38.60; euro33), instead of HK$350
(US$45; euro38.50).
</P>
<P>
The discount, given to those with a Hong Kong ID card, will last until Dec.
8.
</P>
<P>
Although Hong Kong Disneyland said the discount was unrelated to attendance, the
park has repeatedly refused to disclose how many people have been visiting. Many
local media reports have said that attendance has been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Wong said the park has no plans to disclose attendance numbers
because they are confidential commercial information.
</P>
<P>
This has angered some lawmakers who argue that the public should be privy to the
information since the Hong Kong government is the biggest investor in the
park.
</P>
<P>
The government paid US$2.4 billion for the park's construction, while Disney
paid over US$314 million, according to official figures.
