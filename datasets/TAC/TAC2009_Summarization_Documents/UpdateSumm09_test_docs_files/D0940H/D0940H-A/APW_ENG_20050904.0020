High hopes for Hong Kong Disneyland's economic impact, but critics say Disney magic overrated

Hong Kong is banking on Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Buzz Lightyear to turn the
city of skyscrapers and designer boutiques into one of the best places in Asia
for a family holiday.
</P>
<P>
But critics say Hong Kong Disneyland, which opens Sept. 12, won't be the magic
kingdom its supporters say it will be. They question whether the park is the
best way to create jobs, and they're also doubtful that it will attract
big-spending tourists.
</P>
<P>
A fantasy land with a Sleeping Beauty Castle set against lush mountains on an
outlying island, Hong Kong Disneyland predicts it will draw about 3.6 million
tourists to Hong Kong within a year and up to 7.4 million annually after 15
years.
</P>
<P>
The park is expected to create 18,400 jobs _ 5,000 on site and the rest
indirectly _ a number predicted to grow to 35,800 over two decades, according to
the park and its prime investor, the Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have bold ambitions: They hope Mickey Mouse will bring in a total of
148 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$19 billion; euro15 billion) over 40 years and
transform the center for shopping and gourmet food into a tourist destination
for all ages.
</P>
<P>
These potential benefits came at a hefty price for the government, which has a
57 percent stake in the park.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong taxpayers are shelling out HK$16.5 billion (US$2.1 billion; euro1.7
billion), including costs for reclaiming land and supporting infrastructure, and
extending a HK$6.1 billion (US$782 million; euro631 million)
loan.
</P>
<P>
Disney's tab comes in much smaller. It's paying HK$2.45 billion (US$314 million;
euro253 million) and HK$120 million (US$15.4 million; euro12.4 million) in rent
per year.
</P>
<P>
But even Hong Kong's political opposition, frequently at odds with the
government, thinks it's the right move.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party lawmaker Sin Chung-kai, the opposition's point man on the
project, said the park will boost Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
"Looking at jobs creation ... tourism, we approved the project from this
perspective," Sin said.
</P>
<P>
But critics say Hong Kong Disneyland is overrated.
</P>
<P>
Without the theme park, the territory's economy would still be able to generate
just as many jobs _ and without the hefty investment from taxpayers, argues
Credit Suisse First Boston economist Tao Dong.
</P>
<P>
"It has more news value than economic value," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tao questioned whether Hong Kong offered enough flights and hotel rooms to
handle the expected influx of Disneyland visitors. The Hong Kong Hotels
Association has said the territory aims to add 14,000 extra hotel rooms by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Disneyland officials have said they expect about 40 percent of the visitors will
eventually come from mainland China, just a short ride away by bus or train.
China relaxed rules on travel to Hong Kong in 2003, allowing its citizens to go
as individuals instead of part of a tour group.
</P>
<P>
Tony Latter, a senior research fellow at the Hong Kong Institute of Economics
and Business Strategy, expressed worries that low-spending tourists _ an
apparent reference to visitors from China, where wages are low _ may create more
problems than benefits.
</P>
<P>
"High spenders are fine. But the low spenders probably incur more hidden costs
in terms of inconvenience, and pressure on infrastructure, than they generate
added value for the economy," Latter said in a recent op-ed piece in the South
China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
Chinese traveling to Hong Kong on their own instead of with a tour group spent
an average of HK$7,429 (US$952; euro768) in 2005, down from HK$10,440 in 2004,
according to a study by Market Insights Group, which also found that more than
10 percent of the visitors in 2005 were just window-shoppers.
</P>
<P>
They spent an average of about four days in the city in 2005, compared to about
a week in 2004, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The government should enrich the tourist experience beyond shopping by
developing more tourist sites and activities unique to Hong Kong, not just
Disneyland, Market Insights Group Director Roland Leung said.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of developing tourism facilities, we are focusing too much on one new
site _ Disneyland," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We worry that even though people will spend an extra few hundred (Hong Kong)
dollars (US$20-30) on tickets and some extra money on food, drinks and souvenirs
because of Disneyland, overall it may not necessarily have a significant
economic effect," he said.
