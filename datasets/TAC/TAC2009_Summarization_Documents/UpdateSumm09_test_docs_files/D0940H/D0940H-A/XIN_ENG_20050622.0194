Commissioner for Tourism Eva 
Cheng Wednesday said the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland will be 
divided into three phases from early August in order to ensure a 
smooth and well-coordinated start.
</P>
<P>
"The idea of a phased opening is to give the theme park, public
transport operators and relevant departments a familiarization 
period to adjust their operation and services," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
From early August to mid-August, the Disneyland Resort Line is 
scheduled to run between Sunny Bay and Disneyland Resort Stations.
A section of the Park Promenade linked to the line will be opened.
</P>
<P>
From August to Sept. 11, all public facilities at Penny's Bay, 
including public roads, the Park Promenade, the Inspiration Lake 
Recreation Center, the Disneyland Resort Public Transport 
Interchange, the Disneyland car and coach parks and the Disneyland
Resort Pier will begin operation. Franchised buses and taxis will 
also start service.
</P>
<P>
From Sept. 12, the theme park and hotels will be open to the 
public.
</P>
<P>
To ensure both the public and visitors are well informed of the
operation sequence, communication channels have been set up by 
relevant departments and operators.
</P>
<P>
Visitors can obtain information for planning their trips by 
visiting a designated website, the Transport Department's website,
and the Hong Kong Disneyland website.
</P>
<P>
Inquiry telephone lines will also be provided by the department
and Hong Kong Disneyland. Information booklets, TV and radio 
commercials will be launched in August.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said the familiarization period will last for more than 
one month. She urged people to plan their visit, and make good use
of communication channels to gather important information, such as
the new transport services and opening hours.
