<TEXT>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern 
admitted on Tuesday that he had held a series of private one-on-one 
meetings on the Northern Ireland peace process with Sinn Fein leader 
Gerry Adams, but denied they had been secret in any way.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions in parliament, Ahern told MPs that the 
meetings with Adams, whose party is the political wing of the IRA, 
Northern Ireland's main Catholic paramilitary group, had merely been 
to maintain dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been "possibly three or four meetings" with 
Adams since March.
</P>
<P>
"On balance, these meetings at this particular time were better 
conducted outside the glare of publicity," Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
In April, Adams appealed to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to 
end violence and fully embrace democratic means.
</P>
<P>
Ahern said he explained to Adams the clear position required by 
the Irish government before negotiations could resume on restoring 
the power-sharing political institutions in British-ruled Northern 
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
These included a total end to IRA paramilitarism and related 
criminality and full decommissioning of the IRA's arms and 
explosives arsenals.
</P>
<P>
"It is only on that basis that we can move forward," Ahern 
said.
</P>
<P>
Ahern is to meet his British counterpart Tony Blair in London on 
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He will also be holding talks with Ian Paisley, leader of 
Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant political group, the 
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
</P>
<P>
Ahern stressed to MPs that Northern Ireland was entering the 
summer season of Protestant loyalist Orange Order marches, that 
traditionally cause tensions between Catholics and Protestants.
</P>
<P>
Hopes are rising in Northern Ireland that the IRA will, by the 
end of this month, announce a plan for a complete and swift process 
of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
A deal on the so-called "decommissioning" of IRA weapons was 
almost reached at the end of last year, but foundered on demands 
from the DUP that the process by verified through photographs.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland has seen a virtual end to more than 30 years of 
violence since the landmark 1998 Good Friday peace deal, but Dublin 
and London, as well as an independent monitoring body, have accused 
paramilitary groups of continued criminal activities.
