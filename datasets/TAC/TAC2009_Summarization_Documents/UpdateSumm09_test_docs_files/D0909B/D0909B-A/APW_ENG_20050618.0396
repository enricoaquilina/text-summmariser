Northern Ireland priest appeals to IRA to reveal location of victims' bodies

<P>
A Roman Catholic priest appealed Saturday to the Irish Republican Army to reveal
the burial spots of more than a dozen people whose bodies have never been
found.
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Sean Dooley made his plea at the funeral of Gareth O'Connor, 24, an IRA
dissident who disappeared in May 2003. Last weekend, police divers found his
body still inside his car in a canal in Newry, 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Police and O'Connor's family say IRA members killed him, probably because he had
been arguing with an IRA member over a money-raising racket the IRA was running
in South Armagh, a major power base for the outlawed group. The IRA has denied
involvement.
</P>
<P>
At the time of his disappearance, O'Connor had been driving towards a police
station to report for bail in the neighboring Republic of Ireland, where he was
facing trial for membership in a splinter group called the Real
IRA.
</P>
<P>
Dooley said the O'Connor family's "worst has come to the worst," but the
relatives of others slain by the IRA had not been allowed to lay their loved
ones to rest.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to anybody who has any information about the disappeared to contact
their families directly or indirectly so that other bodies may be cut down from
the crosses and given Christian burials," Dooley told several hundred mourners
at O'Connor's funeral Mass in St. Patrick's Cathedral in Newry.
</P>
<P>
In a direct plea to those who killed more than a dozen IRA victims, mostly in
the 1970s and early 1980s, he asked, "How can you go home to your families every
night knowing the hell these families are enduring?"
</P>
<P>
The search for unmarked graves of IRA victims is one of many unfinished chapters
of Northern Ireland's peace process.
</P>
<P>
The IRA in 1999 described the locations of eight burial spots to a joint
British-Irish commission coordinating the search, but remains of only three IRA
victims have been found. The group has rejected responsibility for several other
long-missing people abducted from IRA power bases in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The IRA killed about 1,800 people from 1970 to 1997, when it called an
open-ended truce. Despite this, IRA members continue to administer crippling
beatings _ and occasionally fatal shootings and stabbings _ to their criminal
opponents in Catholic areas.
