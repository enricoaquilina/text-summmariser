Sinn Fein bosses quit IRA's ruling body: report

DUBLIN, July 23
</DATELINE>

<P>
Three senior Sinn Fein leaders, 
including party president Gerry Adams, have stepped down from their 
posts on the ruling body of the party's Irish Republican Army 
military wing according to the Irish Independent newspaper on 
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Adams, chief negotiator Martin McGuinness and 
convicted gun-runner Martin Ferris who is an lawmaker in the Irish 
Republic's parliament have all resigned from the seven-man army 
council of the Catholic IRA paramilitary group.
</P>
<P>
It says their posts have been filled by three men from Northern 
Ireland who are closely aligned to the Adams-McGuinness group 
pushing the movement onto a purely political path.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper says none of the new appointees is a member of 
Sinn Fein but all are regarded within the Provisional republican 
movement as militarists with proven records.
</P>
<P>
"The ground-breaking decision means that all links between the 
leadership of the political and military wings of the Provisional 
movement have been severed.
</P>
<P>
"The changes in personnel are also seen as part of the 
"sanitisation" process within Sinn Fein as the party prepares to 
present itself as a democratic body that is ready to play a full 
part in political developments north and south of the border," the 
Independent says.
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented charge in January, Irish Justice Minister 
Michael McDowell claimed the three Sinn Fein men were leaders of 
both the political and military wings of the republican movement.
</P>
<P>
However, in a joint statement the trio "categorically" denied 
they were members of the ruling body of the outlawed IRA and accused 
McDowell of abusing his office.
</P>
<P>
The Independent says that in the wake of the London bombings, 
and with an increasingly hostile climate towards terrorist violence, 
the Provisional movement is understood to have decided that this is 
the right time to move into a new mode. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Adams has made a direct appeal to IRA 
"volunteers" to embrace purely political and democratic activity.
</P>
<P>
The Irish and British governments hope for a response before the 
August holiday period from the IRA, which declared a ceasefire in 
its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland before a 1998 
peace deal which largely ended 30 years of violence.
</P>
<P>
Protestant factions in Northern Ireland are adamant that there 
can be no political progress toward a lasting peace settlement 
without a move by the IRA to end all paramilitary and criminal 
activity and a decommissioning of weapons arsenals.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Good Friday peace deal paved the way for a 
Protestant-Catholic power-sharing assembly, but that was suspended 
more than two years ago amid allegations of IRA espionage.
</P>
<P>
British and Irish efforts to revive power-sharing and secure a 
permanent settlement collapsed before Christmas after Sinn Fein 
rejected Protestant demands for photographic proof of IRA weapons 
destruction.
