Northern Ireland's 7-year-old peace accord will eventually work but requires the
Irish Republican Army to deliver a "clear and decisive" end to all its
activities, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to British and Irish academics at University College Dublin, Ahern
said the U.S.-brokered Good Friday pact of 1998 contained a complex set of goals
that, if achieved, would ensure a stable, peaceful Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But he said the pact's key goal _ a joint Catholic-Protestant administration _
would be revived only "in the context of a complete end to IRA paramilitarism
and criminality and the putting beyond use of their weapons."
</P>
<P>
The major Protestant party, the Democratic Unionists, refuses to cooperate with
Sinn Fein, the IRA-linked party that represents most Catholics, citing the IRA's
continued underground activities.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, a reputed IRA commander, appealed to
IRA members to leave behind their "armed struggle" in favor of democratic
politics.
</P>
<P>
"We now need the IRA to deliver a clear and decisive response to Gerry Adams'
recent appeal," Ahern said. "I hope that this response will be translated into
clear reality on the ground."
