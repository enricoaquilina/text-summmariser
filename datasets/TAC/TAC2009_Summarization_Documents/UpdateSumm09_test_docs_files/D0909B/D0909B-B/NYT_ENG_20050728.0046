IRA RENOUNCES VIOLENCE IN POTENTIALLY PROFOUND SHIFT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
BELFAST, Northern Ireland
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army declared an end
to its campaign of violence against Britain that claimed more
than 3,500 lives over 36 years, saying there was "an
alternative way to achieve" its goal of a United Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The announcement in a DVD released to reporters was taken in
London as, potentially, a profound shift in Northern Ireland's destiny,
reversing decades of Republican commitment to violence in the effort
to end British rule."This may be the day on which,
finally, after all these false dawns and dashed hopes, peace
replaced war, politics replaces terror on the island of Ireland,"
Prime Minister Tony Blair said in a televised statement in
London. He also said the announcement "creates the circumstances" in
which Northern Ireland's power-sharing local government could be revived. "This
is a step of unparalleled magnitude in the recent history
of Northern Ireland."
</P>
<P>
The Irish Prime Minister, Bertie Aherne, struck a more cautious note,
saying the IRA statement would be momentous if the organization
matched words with deeds.
</P>
<P>
Among the troubling issues is whether the IRA will halt the
criminal operations -- such as armed robbery, smuggling and money
laundering -- that fund the organization. The IRA said that
its members must not engage in any other activities whatsoever,
but skeptics worry that the organization may break up into
small independent crime gangs.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the IRA said: "Our decisions have been taken
to advance our republican and democratic objectives, including our goal
of a united Ireland. We believe there is now an
alternative way to achieve this and to end British rule
in our country."
</P>
<P>
"All IRA units have been ordered to dump arms," said the
statement, which was read out on a DVD by a
former prisoner, Seana Walsh.
</P>
<P>
Blair said Unionists -- the IRA's foes -- would want to
ensure that the "clear statement of principal is kept to
in practice."
</P>
<P>
The widely expected statement could mark the conclusion of the bloodiest
chapter in modern Irish history, foretold in 1994, when an
IRA cease-fire began winding up the tradition of militant Irish
republicanism. And it takes a step towards restoring Northern Ireland's
local government, which was established under a 1998 peace accord
but suspended in 2002 due to allegations of IRA activity.Gerry
Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the IRA, said at a news conference in Dublin that
the announcement could "help revive the peace process" and said
it was a challenge to the British and Irish governments
as well as the Ulster Unionists to see that the
peace accord is carried out.
</P>
<P>
Unionists, the province's largest political group who are mostly Protestant, are
likely to insist on a delay of at least a
year before returning to share seats in the provincial legislature
with Sinn Fein. "There are still a number of areas
of loose ends," Jeffrey Donaldson, a Northern Irish member of
the British parliament for the hard-line Democratic Unionists, told RTE
radio. "We'll probably need a period of time now over
which we can judge whether what the IRA says is
what they actually do."
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
The statement came four months after Adams, who denies repeated reports
that he has been an IRA commander, called on the
guerrilla group to embrace purely political and democratic activity. Top
Sinn Fein representatives are in Washington, London and Brussels to
brief international leaders on the IRA decision.
</P>
<P>
The loose ends include the possible continuation of IRA criminal operations.
Police blame the IRA for crimes like the robbery of
$50 million from a Belfast bank last December, and the
murder of a Belfast man, Robert McCartney, in January, but
no prosecutions have followed in either case.
</P>
<P>
Mainstream politicians want Sinn Fein, and its IRA supporters, to endorse
Northern Ireland's fledgling police service, which has been revamped to
gain the trust of Roman Catholics, who suffered from discrimination
in the past.
</P>
<P>
Dismantling the IRA's massive stashes of weapons, which are mostly hidden
in underground bunkers in the countryside, has been the most
stubborn obstacle to a functioning power-sharing system between Roman Catholic
and Protestant political groups in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has destroyed arms dumps on three separate occasions with
the cooperation of John DeChastelain, the retired Canadian general who
heads a commission supervising disarmament. But Unionist parties withdrew from
government on several occasions after the 1998 pact in protest
at the slow pace of the process.
</P>
<P>
The IRA said on Wednesday that it would complete "the process
to verifiably put its arms beyond use", and that it
invited Protestant and Catholic clergymen to serve as witnesses so
that disarmament can be completed "as quickly as possible."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that, based on DeChastelain's previous methods, the issue would
likely be dealt with in a matter of days. Last
December, the Democratic Unionists, led by the firebrand preacher Ian
Paisley, scuttled an effort to restore Northern Ireland's government by
demanding photographic evidence that the arms had been destroyed, which
the IRA refused.
</P>
<P>
Paisley's party, which favors continued union with Britain, indicated it would
take months to negotiate a revival of Northern Ireland's power-sharing
assembly.
</P>
<P>
Even before the IRA statement was issued, Paisley told the BBC:
"I am saying now the proof of the pudding is
in the eating and digesting of it. We've heard it
all before. You can wrap it up any way you
like, put a new bit of ribbon on the package
but we want the action, the proof this is happening."
</P>
<P>
Paisley's party refuses to talk to Sinn Fein and says it
is indistinguishable from the IRA.
