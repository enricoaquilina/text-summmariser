IRA SAID TO RENOUNCE VIOLENCE IN FAVOR OF POLITICAL STRUGGLE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Irish Republican Army has renounced its armed struggle for a
united Ireland, agreeing to turn solely to political methods, an
American businessman said Tuesday after being briefed on a statement
expected from the guerrilla group later this week.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, if borne out, would be a historic turning point
in the violent history of Ireland and Northern Ireland. But
there is still widespread official skepticism about IRA promises, particularly
when it comes to the issue of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it was not immediately clear whether the IRA would address
how several tons of arms, hidden in bunkers across Ireland,
would be disposed of, according to the businessman, Niall O'Dowd,
who brokered talks between the IRA and American officials that
helped lead to a cease-fire in 1994. The continued existence
of those weapons, which were to have been destroyed under
an agreement reached after the cease-fire, contributed to the collapse
of the Northern Ireland government in 2003.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, an Irish government spokesman said an IRA commitment
to nonviolence had to be backed by an unambiguous process
for disposing of all its weapons. "The ultimate test is
the delivery on that," said the spokesman, who as a
matter of routine practice spoke only on the condition that
he not be identified. A spokesman for the British government
declined comment.
</P>
<P>
A number of recent signs have pointed to major developments occurring
within the IRA.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Ireland's justice minister, Michael McDowell, said the top leaders
of the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, including Gerry Adams
and Martin McGuinness, had stepped down from positions on the
IRA's secretive governing council.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland was cutting short
a vacation to return to Dublin later this week. John
DeChastelain, a Canadian general who is the chairman of a
commission set up to oversee the destruction of paramilitary weapons,
is in Ireland this week, the Irish government spokesman said.
And McGuinness is to go to Washington on Thursday to
brief American officials on the peace process, according to Rita
O'Hare, Sinn Fein's representative in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The developments follow a public appeal by Adams in April, in
which he urged the republican movement to turn away from
violent struggle and to devote all its energies to politics.
Adams said he had justified the IRA's activities in the
past because no alternative existed for people who did not
wish to submit to British authority.
</P>
<P>
"That struggle can now be taken forward by other means," Adams
said in a speech in Belfast. He asked, "Can you
take courageous initiatives which will achieve your aims by purely
political and democratic activity?"
</P>
<P>
O'Dowd, the publisher of a magazine, Irish America, and a newspaper,
Irish Voice, said Adams and other senior republicans had persuaded
the IRA membership that it could succeed politically. Sinn Fein
is now the second-largest party in Northern Ireland, and it
has made significant gains among voters in the Republic of
Ireland since 1994.
</P>
<P>
"This is a truly historic moment in Irish history," O'Dowd said.
"It is the first time since the founding of the
Irish state that the IRA has agreed that there should
be no armed struggle. Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness have
taken an armed revolutionary movement and succeeded in placing it
on a political path. Irish history is littered with people
such as Michael Collins, who tried to do the same
and failed."
</P>
<P>
However, the IRA's failure to disarm since 1994 has created much
official skepticism about its motives and statements.
</P>
<P>
"There is no position whatsoever between being armed and being unarmed
for the IRA," said McDowell, the justice minister. "If the
IRA are decommissioning, they must decommission all their weapons in
their entirety, every single pistol, every single bullet, the lot."
