Rain Thrashes Southern California

A fourth day of thrashing thunderstorms began to
take a heavier toll on southern California on Sunday with at least
three deaths blamed on the rain, as flooding and mudslides forced road
closures and emergency crews carried out harrowing rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
In Elysian Park, just north of downtown, a 42-year-old homeless man
was killed and another injured when a mudslide swept away their
makeshift encampment. Another man was killed on Pacific Coast Highway
in Malibu when his sport utility vehicle skidded into a mud patch and
plunged into the Pacific Ocean. Ventura County officials reported
Sunday that a 20-year-old man died north of Ojai as he tried to cross
a rain-gorged creek Saturday, wearing a harness attached to a wire.
</P>
<P>
For others, it was a day of close calls.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people fled threatened neighborhoods from Santa Clarita
to San Dimas. In the Hollywood Hills, a family narrowly survived as
their two-story home collapsed, apparently in a torrent of mud.
Hundreds of motorists skidded into minor traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
Unresolved Sunday was the fate of a Highland man who remained
stranded but safe in a San Bernardino County cave as raging waters
outside prevented rescuers from reaching him. ``The only way to get to
the cave is to cross this water, (but) it's flowing too heavily. It's
too dangerous,'' said Cindy Beavers, a spokeswoman for the San
Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
The storms had stalled over an area of the Pacific Ocean on Sunday
evening, a few hundred miles off the coast of Point Conception, west
of Santa Barbara, said Bruce Rockwell, a weather specialist with the
National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
``It's stationary off the coast and constantly pumps in moist water
from the south,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters had originally said some areas of southern California
might receive more than 20 inches of precipitation over the weekend.
Although they later reduced that estimate, a campground near Mount
Wilson, Opids Camp, received 20.8 inches of precipitation just between
4 p.m. Saturday and 4 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In that same time period, downtown Los Angeles received 4.5 inches
of rain, Beverly Hills 7.8 inches, Santa Monica 4.7 inches, Chatsworth
5.8 inches, Claremont 7.5 inches and Lancaster 2.4 inches.
</P>
<P>
Continued downpours were expected through Tuesday, when the jet
stream airflow from the north was expected to start pushing the storm
inland toward Nevada.
</P>
<P>
Southern California has been drenched by a string of storms that
began in late December and have been only sporadically interrupted by
clear skies.
</P>
<P>
The current dousing, which began Thursday, has been the heaviest.
On average, Los Angeles receives 18 inches of rain in the first six
months of each year, but more than 15 inches have fallen in the first
nine days of 2005.
</P>
<P>
All across the Southland, residents dealt with rockslides, debris
flows, downed trees, power outages and mandatory evacuations, though
there were few serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
Mudslides, a sinkhole and other water damage forced Metrolink and
Amtrak to cancel some train routes serving Los Angeles and Ventura
Counties on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, a combination of storm runoff and big surf caused
health officials to close Corona del Mar State Beach in Newport Beach
and Capistrano County Beach in Dana Point because of sewage pipe
leaks.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 miles away in the Eastern Sierra, skiers and
snowboarders glided atop 48 inches of snow that has fallen on Mammoth
Mountain since Friday. ``We've just been pounded,'' said Joani Lynch,
a Mammoth Mountain spokeswoman. Some ski runs were closed at Big Bear
Mountain Resorts because of heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, the Department of Water and Power reported
thousands of power outages in homes from Echo Park to Bel-Air. A
rain-related accident on Mount Wilson tore down transmission lines,
interrupting the broadcast of the Indianapolis Colts and Denver
Broncos playoff game on KCBS for two hours.
</P>
<P>
And in Arcadia, eight of nine horse races at Santa Anita Park were
canceled for the first time in 10 years because of rain. ``If it gets
slippery, it could potentially be dangerous to horses, jockeys and all
involved,'' said park spokesman Vince Bruun.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain fell in other parts of California, but the storms in the
Southland presented the biggest challenges.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old homeless man who died in Elysian Park had been
living with a younger acquaintance in a tent on top of a hill on the
1700 block of Stadium Way, just north of the Pasadena Freeway.
</P>
<P>
The man, identified as Jeffrey Lynn Earwood, was trapped under
hundreds of pounds of thick mud, according to Los Angles City Fire
Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said. When rescue workers arrived,
they said, only one of his limbs was visible. Humphrey said
firefighters dug him out in less than 10 minutes, but he died at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
The other man, who was unidentified, received minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
The victim in the Malibu traffic accident died after the SUV he was
traveling in skidded off the road in the 19700 block of PCH. Los
Angeles County fire rescue workers recovered the man's body about 500
feet from where the vehicle went into the water off Tuna Canyon Beach,
said Lt. Randall Dickey of the Malibu Lost Hills Sheriff's Station.
</P>
<P>
Four passengers in the car sustained minor injuries, Dickey said.
Names and ages of the victims were not released.
</P>
<P>
On Laurel Canyon Boulevard, three people were safe after their
5,000-square-foot house collapsed, apparently the result of a
mudslide. An unidentified motorist helped the father pull his
5-year-old daughter out of the rubble, authorities said. Firefighters
rescued the man's 10-year-son. The family was hospitalized with minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
Humphrey said this was one of a number of areas where mudslides
caused problems. ``Choose your street with `Canyon' in the name, and
that likely has been impacted by mud.''
</P>
<P>
Around 4 p.m., ``tons of mud'' from a hillside slid into the third
floor of a home in Silver Lake, , trapping a man inside, he said.
Firefighters had to break a window in the home in the 1900 block of
North Lucile Avenue to reach the man, who was uninjured. The fire
department also evacuated three other nearby homes.
</P>
<P>
In Tujunga, five people were evacuated from the 6200 block of Gyral
Drive after a mudslide near the Angeles National Forest, Humphrey
said. No one was injured, though one house was damaged. People in 15
houses farther down the street were advised to leave.
</P>
<P>
Humphrey estimated that more than 100 roads in Los Angeles had seen
flooding or mudslides or downed trees. ``Most of the incidents are
minor, and people do their civic duty with shovels in the mud.''
