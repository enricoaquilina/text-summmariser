Southern California Rains Disrupt Rail Transport
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shippers scrambled for alternative routes Wednesday as Union
Pacific Corp. struggled to overcome what it said was a ``probably
unprecedented'' disruption of service in Southern California because
of the recent rains.
</P>
<P>
Mother Nature might be to blame for Union Pacific's latest woes,
but the recurring problems the railroad has had moving goods in and
out of the region, coupled with recent backlogs at local ports, could
threaten the economy, shipping experts and economists said.
</P>
<P>
``If I'm a shipper, I'm starting to get disturbed about being able
to use Southern California as a base to get stuff into the country and
out to my stores,'' said John Husing, an independent economist in
Redlands, Calif.
</P>
<P>
Citing mudslides and washed-out tracks and bridges, Union Pacific
closed four of its five main rail lines out of the Los Angeles Basin.
That brought the railroad's freight traffic in the region to a near
standstill. The company said it was racing to make track repairs and
hoped to resume limited service on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific's troubles included 23 mudslides that covered tracks
in the Cajon Pass east of Los Angeles, a key passageway from Southern
California to Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, and eventually to the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
``We have been told that the route from Los Angeles to Chicago has
effectively been closed,'' said Scott Dailey, a spokesman for APL, a
leading shipper of intermodal cargo containers and a unit of Neptune
Orient Lines of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The fresh disruption -- coming on top of last year's gridlock at
local ports and railways -- persuaded APL to decide to permanently
send ``a lot of our transcontinental cargo'' to Seattle rather than
Los Angeles, he said. ``That is a major shift.''
</P>
<P>
Decisions like that and Union Pacific's not-infrequent
difficulties, in addition to bottlenecks at the ports, ``certainly
should cause people to think about the whole infrastructure'' in
Southern California, said Jim McKenna, president of the Pacific
Maritime Association, which represents West Coast shipping lines.
</P>
<P>
Husing said the ``real damage is the continuing problems we have,
whether it's 93 ships tied up off the coast or Union Pacific not being
able to get its cargo through the area.''
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific, which was suffering major congestion problems on its
tracks before the heavy rainfall, is the nation's largest railroad,
with 33,000 miles of track from the West to the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
Based in Omaha, Neb., it is one of two railroads that ferry goods
from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach -- the world's busiest
port complex -- north and east to the rest of the country. The other
is Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp.
</P>
<P>
About half of the raw materials and finished goods that arrive at
the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, mostly from Asia, are
transported by truck to destinations in Southern California. The rest
is forwarded nationwide by rail, with Union Pacific and Burlington
Northern each handling about half of that freight.
</P>
<P>
Burlington Northern suffered no major setbacks from the storms, a
spokesman said, and is carrying some freight for Union Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts wondered why the nasty weather affected Union Pacific
and not Burlington Northern. In the Cajon Pass, for instance, the
railroads' tracks nearly parallel each other west of Interstate 15.
</P>
<P>
But Union Pacific tracks are higher in elevation than Burlington
Northern's are, Union Pacific spokesman John Bromley said, and thus
were first to be hit by mudslides. The damage was even more
pronounced, Bromley said, because ``the slides have occurred in areas
where we've had all the forest fires and the ground cover was burned
off.''
</P>
<P>
Union Pacific's stock fell 38 cents Wednesday to $63.96 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
