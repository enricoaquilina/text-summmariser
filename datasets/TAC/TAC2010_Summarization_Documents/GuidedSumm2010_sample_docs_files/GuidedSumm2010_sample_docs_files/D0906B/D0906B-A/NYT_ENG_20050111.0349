RESCUE CREWS HUNT FOR SIGNS OF LIFE BENEATH A MUDSLIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LA CONCHITA, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rescue workers using sensitive listening devices and
cadaver dogs probed for buried victims on Tuesday in a
25-foot-deep mountain of mud and debris left by Monday's mudslide
as the rains finally ended and desperate family members kept
vigil.
</P>
<P>
Bob Roper, the Ventura County fire chief, said Tuesday afternoon that
monitoring equipment was still picking up faint sounds of life
from the debris pile, raising the possibility of survivors.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for any movement," Capt. Conrad Quintana of the county
fire department said. "A part of an arm. A finger
tapping. A cough. Someone crying. Any indication someone is alive
in there."
</P>
<P>
The missing included the wife and three children of Jimmie Wallet,
a carpenter who left them briefly on Monday just before
a 500-foot-high rain-saturated hillside above this tiny coastal hamlet collapsed.
</P>
<P>
"He was running toward the mountain while people were running away
from it," said Wallet's mother, Linda Silva, who came to
La Conchita on Tuesday to await word of her daughter-in-law
and grandchildren. "He ran up there and started digging with
his hands. He was yelling, 'I have to get my
kids! My kids!"'
</P>
<P>
Rescuers pulled three more bodies from the mud on Tuesday, bringing
the official death count to six.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the hillside here was a deadly coda to
five days of merciless rains across Southern California that have
left 20 dead and driven thousands from their homes under
threat of floods and mudslides.
</P>
<P>
Even as skies cleared on Tuesday, 4,000 people were evacuated from
the banks of a surging creek in the Orange County
communities of San Juan Capistrano and Dana Point. And a
hiker who had been trapped for three days in a
cave by raging floodwaters in the San Bernardino Mountains was
rescued by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead across the region were a man whose body
was found wedged in a tree in a canyon, a
woman who was run over by her husband, who could
not see her in the driving rain, and an 18-year-old
woman who was killed when her car hit a fallen
tree. Here in La Conchita, where as many as 12
people were missing, 14 people were also injured, two of
them critically, and roughly half of the town's houses were
destroyed or badly damaged. Dozens of roads around the area
remained closed because of mud or deep standing water.
