FLOOD OF TROUBLE FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LOS ANGELES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles will get a much-needed break early
Monday from the unforgiving rain that has pounded Southern California
since Thursday, but a new front will move in Monday
night, bringing with it an additional 2 inches to 4
inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
It will be the last storm at least for a while
and forecasters say Southern Californians will see sunshine Tuesday, ending
a wave of storms. The latest storm wave on Sunday
alone dumped 4 1/2 inches of rain downtown, 6 inches
in Burbank and Chatsworth, 3.29 inches in Woodland Hills and
nearly 8 inches in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
"We'll begin to see some normalcy come back on Tuesday, but
it's still winter," said National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Hoffer.
"We should see clear to partly cloudy skies from Tuesday
all the way out to Saturday."
</P>
<P>
While there might be blue skies on the horizon, the relentless
storm system that has hovered over Southern California since Thursday
caused massive flooding, mudslides, power outages, several evacuations, school closures
and disrupted commuter rail service.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rainfall is being attributed to a sluggish, low-pressure system
that collided with a stream of tropical moisture from the
southern Pacific known as a "Pineapple Express."
</P>
<P>
On the third consecutive day of heavy downpours Sunday, the skies
dumped up to 2 inches of rain an hour in
some areas -- turning some streets in hillside communities into
raging rivers and stranding dozens of motorists who had to
be rescued by overtaxed emergency workers.
</P>
<P>
At Sun Valley's infamous intersection -- San Fernando Road and Tuxford
Street -- a swift-water rescue team plucked 20-year-old Amber Pitts
from her car after she became stuck in as much
as 4 feet of water at about 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
"It was the fourth rescue we have made at that intersection
(Sunday). Luckily, she was OK," said Los Angeles Fire Department
spokesman Brian Humphrey. "That intersection is always flooded when it
rains, and some people decide to try to make it
through."
</P>
<P>
In the Ventura County community of Bardsdale, just south of Fillmore,
resident Doug Bofolo and his family had to evacuate their
house just east of Highway 23 when a massive water
flow overtook his property.
</P>
<P>
"The water was chest-deep. Everything was floating," Bofolo said. "We've got
a 5-foot block wall and we can't even see the
top of it. This is even worse than the flooding
we got in 1969."
</P>
<P>
In Santa Clarita, residents of the Polynesian Mobile Home Park at
San Fernando Road and Sierra Highway were evacuated when saturated
hillsides and roadbeds gave way to the nonstop flooding.
</P>
<P>
Thirty engine companies, the Urban Search and Rescue teams and county
lifeguards were deployed with more than 200 firefighters responding.
</P>
<P>
"The whole (Santa Clarita) valley (was) on alert," Los Angeles County
Fire Department Capt. Dave Peterson said during Sunday's deluge.
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department reported flooding as high as second-story windows at
cabins along Bouquet Canyon in the Angeles National Forest. By
midafternoon, department resources were stretched thin and there was not
much more that could be done to hold back mudslides.
</P>
<P>
Flooding was reported at Bouquet Canyon Road and Vasquez Canyon Road,
causing a road closure.
</P>
<P>
In Saugus, firefighters led a dozen people to high ground after
they were stranded on San Francisquito Canyon Road by flooding
and mudslides from the rain-swelled San Francisquito Creek.
</P>
<P>
Four adults and eight children were rescued by helicopter and taken
to safety at a church at the mouth of San
Francisquito Canyon.
</P>
<P>
Gary Brynjegard and sons Peter, 16, and Garrison, 13, of Castaic
had headed into the canyon earlier to survey damage. Brynjegard
works for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,
which operates two plants along winding, two-lane San Francisquito Canyon
Road just north of Santa Clarita.
</P>
<P>
"We drove up to look around, then saw a mudslide and
I said, We better get out of here," Brynjegard said.
"We ran like crazy; the mountains were sliding down around
us."
</P>
<P>
In Fillmore, 145 people had to be evacuated from the El
Dorado Mobile Home Park, where floodwaters began breaching their homes.
</P>
<P>
A mudslide closed Highway 126 between Fillmore and Piru, and Highway
23 between Fillmore and Moorpark was closed by a massive
water flow that was a quarter-mile wide.
</P>
<P>
Emergency notifications in Ventura County indicated that all schools in the
Fillmore Unified School District would be closed Monday, and Metrolink
said its Ventura County line will be closed Monday because
of flooding and mudslides.
</P>
<P>
Metrolink said its trains will not be operating from stations at
Camarillo, Oxnard or Montalvo. Passengers are being asked to go
to the Oxnard station, where buses will be provided to
take them to Moorpark station.
</P>
<P>
In Ventura, fire crews rescued six residents of the evacuated Emma
Wood State Beach RV park who were trapped on a
rock on the Santa Clara River bottom near the West
Main Street Bridge on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Ventura County, Sheriff's Department officials reported flooding in the
Arroyo Vista Mobile Home Park in Moorpark, where residents were
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Late Saturday, a man drowned after being washed away by a
swollen river north of Ojai in Ventura County, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Sunday was a long day for L.A. city and county firefighters,
who responded to numerous mudslides, collapses and rescues.
</P>
<P>
A mudslide in Elysian Park buried a makeshift homeless encampment, killing
one man and injuring another while they slept in a
tent. One person died and four people were hurt in
a single-car crash on Pacific Coast Highway near Malibu.
</P>
<P>
A two-story home collapsed in the Studio City area above the
San Fernando Valley, and a 33-year-old man and his two
children were pulled from the rubble with minor injuries. Fire
officials said the house rolled down the hill and collapsed
into a pile of debris in a matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
The rain caused a hillside to give way in the 6200
block of Gyral Drive in Sunland, damaging a home and
prompting authorities to evacuate five people from three residences, Humphrey
said.
</P>
<P>
And in Los Feliz, a man was rescued from a three-story
home built into a hillside in the 1900 block of
Lucille Drive when a mudslide overran the patio and flowed
into the house.
</P>
<P>
The roads in Los Angeles County were equally frustrating. Dozens of
roads and highways were closed throughout the day. Authorities reported
scores of traffic crashes and ordered scattered road closings, including
the southbound side of Interstate 5 at the Pasadena Freeway
because of a mudslide.
</P>
<P>
In Malibu, a rain-related, single-vehicle crash in the 19700 block of
Pacific Coast Highway left a man dead and four other
people injured just before 8 a.m. The vehicle ended up
in the ocean, said sheriff's Lt. Randall Dickey of the
Malibu-Lost Hills station. The conditions of the four other people
were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
The storm drew a number of curious Southlanders out to hard-hit
canyon areas, further complicating the work of firefighters and other
rescue workers. Humphrey urged people to stay off the roads
if they can over the next day or two of
wet weather.
</P>
<P>
"Many people have been found sightseeing," which Humphrey said was "hampering
the efforts of emergency officials."
</P>
<P>
As many as 12,000 DWP customers lost power Sunday morning. Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric spokesman David Eisenhauer said 11,000 customers remained
without power, scattered throughout the company's service area. Southern California
Edison, which has 4.6 million customers in a 50,000-square-mile service
area in five counties, reported only minor power outages.
</P>
<P>
Several Los Angeles-area radio stations were knocked off the air for
hours Sunday after trouble with transmitters on Mount Wilson, which
was assumed to be related to the stormy weather.
</P>
<P>
Monday, Topanga Elementary School at 141 N. Topanga Canyon Blvd. in
Topanga will be closed because of storm-related road damage, said
Stephanie Brady of the Los Angeles Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
It was unknown when the school will reopen, she said. Parents
seeking more information should contact the school or its Web
site.
</P>
<P>
The storm wreaked havoc in Northern California and Nevada as well,
piling snow deeper across the Sierra Nevada, stranding an Amtrak
train, knocking out service at the Reno airport and shutting
down major highways across the mountains.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters called the series of storms the snowiest in the Reno-Lake
Tahoe area since 1916.
</P>
<P>
"I've lived here for almost 40 years and I've never seen
anything like it," Peter Walenta, 69, of Stateline said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An avalanche knocked a 13-year-old boy from a ski lift at
the Las Vegas Ski &amp; Snowboard Resort, 45 miles northwest
of Las Vegas, said Clark County fire spokesman Bob Leinbach.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters extended a winter storm warning into Tuesday across the Sierra
and parts of northern Nevada, where as much as 2
more feet of snow was expected. The latest storm had
left up to 6 1/2 feet of snow in the
Sierra and 2 1/2 feet in the Reno area.
