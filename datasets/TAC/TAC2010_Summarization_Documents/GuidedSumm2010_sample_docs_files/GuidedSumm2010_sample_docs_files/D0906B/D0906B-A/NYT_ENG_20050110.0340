SOAKED HILLSIDE GIVES WAY, KILLING 2 ON CALIFORNIA COAST
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
LA CONCHITA, Calif.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Part of a rain-saturated hillside gave way
on Monday, sending a Mississippi-like torrent of earth and trees
onto four blocks of this oceanfront town and killing two
men. At least 12 people were known to be missing.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department, Joe L. Luna,
said that nine people had been recovered from the wreckage
of their homes and that seven of them had been
taken to a hospital to be treated for injuries. A
helicopter took a 62-year-old man to a hospital, where he
was listed in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
La Conchita was the site of a similar but smaller landslide
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"This one came down quickly and suddenly, and very violently," Luna
said. "It impacted 15 to 20 homes."
</P>
<P>
The disaster was the latest caused by rain and snow that
has battered California since Dec. 25. Meteorologists say Southern California
has not been hit by this much rain in nearly
40 years. Downtown Los Angeles has had more than 15
inches of rain since Jan. 1, more than its average
rainfall for an entire year, including 2.6 inches on Sunday,
a record, the National Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they were concerned about the possibility of more mudslides.
Rescuers expected to work through the night searching for the
missing people.
</P>
<P>
"It's very sad," said Kirk Peterson, who has lived here for
a year and whose house was undamaged. "We've lost a
few friends."
</P>
<P>
His wife, Dawn, said, "We're hoping they're not buried."
</P>
<P>
La Conchita is a sliver of a town between the Pacific
Ocean and scenic bluffs just south of the Santa Barbara
County line. The bluffs, saturated by Pacific-borne storms that began
on Friday, were known to be unstable, and Ventura County
fire officials asked residents on Monday morning to leave voluntarily.
About 200 complied, boarding government-provided buses, Myra Raya, a spokeswoman
for the Fire Department, said.
</P>
<P>
"Most people chose to leave, but a few did not," Raya
said.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers, including a search-and-rescue team from neighboring Los Angeles County,
worked through the gloom of the fading afternoon, combing the
debris for the living and dead and keeping a wary
eye on the hillside and the sky.
</P>
<P>
A 2-year-old drowned on Sunday in Palmdale, in the desert, after
slipping from her mother's grasp when helicopter rescuers tried to
lift them from a car that had been swallowed in
a torrent. The child's body was recovered a few hours
later.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are considering bringing charges against the mother, whose name
they did not release, because she had driven around barricades
and into the rushing water.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, a saturated hillside gave way in Elysian Park,
burying a homeless man who was waiting out the weather
in his encampment. His companion was injured.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, a motorist drowned near Malibu when he hit
a mud patch on the Pacific Coast Highway and skidded
off the road into the ocean. A 20-year-old in Ventura
County died on Sunday when he tried to cross a
raging creek in a harness attached to a wire.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents on Sunday numbered 720, more than three times the
total of the previous Sunday, when the roads were dry,
the California Highway Patrol said. One hundred roads and highways
in Los Angeles County were closed because of flooding and
rock slides, clogging traffic.

A confluence of tropical air from the South Pacific and a
cold front barreling down from the north have combined to
create the extraordinary weather across the West. On Friday, Las
Vegas was coated in a freak snow squall.
</P>
<P>
The Sierras have had 4 feet of snow, and forecasters expect
an additional 5 feet by midweek. The Reno airport was
closed two times in a week, the region not having
seen so much snow since 1916. More than 6,000 houses
were without power on Monday in Los Angeles, where county
officials estimate the property damage in excess of $19 million.
</P>
<P>
The downpours are part of the fundamentally chaotic and occasionally extreme
nature of the atmosphere, said William Patzert, an oceanographer at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. He said Los Angeles
had not seen such intensity and such a pattern of
winter downpours since the fall and winter of 1889-90.
</P>
<P>
Patzert said that the snowpack in the north could help bolster
water supplies for Southern California but that the torrential rains
would not slake the longstanding drought. "It's like trying to
fill a glass full of water when someone is shooting
a fire hose at you," he said. "Seventy-five to 80
percent will end up in the ocean."
</P>
<P>
Southern California, it is widely said, has two seasons: fire and
flood. Landslides are not freak occurrences. La Conchita was the
victim of a 600,000-ton slide in 1995 destroying or damaging
14 houses. Even then, despite warnings to leave, some residents
stayed. No one then was killed.
</P>
<P>
After the slide on Monday, evacuation was made mandatory.
