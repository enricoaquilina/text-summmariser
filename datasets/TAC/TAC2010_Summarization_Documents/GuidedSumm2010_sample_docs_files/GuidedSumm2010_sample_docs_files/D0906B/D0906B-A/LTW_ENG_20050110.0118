Deadly Mudslide Brings Toll to 10 in Southern California Storms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Super-saturated land tumbled down a mountain Monday in the coastal
community of La Conchita, Calif., killing at least one person and
injuring many more, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
``We have one dead and numerous injuries,'' said Myrna Raya, fire
information officer for the Ventura County Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers were searching through the mud for survivors, she said. It
was unknown how many people were trapped; at least six people were
taken to area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The death brought to 10 the number of people killed in Southern
California during the past weekend's storm, one of three bringing
record precipitation across the state.
</P>
<P>
Mike and Barbara Bell, residents of La Conchita since 1983, said
the landslide struck without warning about 1:15 p.m. PST. The Bells,
who live on a street away from the slide, said they were cleaning up
mud when they heard the slide.
</P>
<P>
``We were standing on the street and just talking and somebody
said, `Oh my God!' and then the hill came down,'' Mike Bell said. ``It
covered the same three or four houses it hit the first time, then came
across the street and hit six or seven more houses. It clearly
destroyed them. It just blew them apart.
</P>
<P>
''Now I've got to get a backhoe and try to save my own house. The
mudslide's at the other end of the street, but every time we get a
torrential rain the mud flow comes right down my street. I've got to
go if I'm going to save my house,`` he said.
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Wood, who has lived in the community since 1985, was
taking a walk with a friend through La Conchita when the slide
occurred. ''I looked up and saw a cloud of dust. It was silent and
then it really came down. It snapped the retaining wall,`` she said.

Sam and Cynthia Ficklend, whose family had been going up to La
Conchita on vacation for the last 50 years, moved to the seaside
community two years ago. They were going home to put things in crates
and boxes and looking for their cat.
</P>
<P>
''We thought we'd retired to paradise,`` Cynthia Ficklend said.
''Well, paradise is over.``

La Conchita is a small community fronted by U.S. 101, about 60
miles north of downtown Los Angeles. It was also struck by a major
landslide in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The fifth day of thrashing storms took a heavy toll on Southern
California as the rain swelled streams and rivers and undermined the
integrity of the ground.

A slackening rainfall was expected to bring some relief for evening
commuters, a step up from the morning drive, which was a treacherous
game of stop and go.
</P>
<P>
Delays and some closures were reported on most major roads. Because
many secondary roads were closed, traffic was forced onto the
highways, further clogging the principal routes. Where roads were
open, sizable delays of more than an hour were reported in many areas.
</P>
<P>
Schools in some parts of the region were forced to close for the
day. Glendale Community College canceled evening classes because of a
nearby mudslide.

An estimated 6,000 customers in Los Angeles were reported without
power Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier , Monday, the body of a 2-year-old girl was recovered in
Palmdale, a high desert town in far northeastern Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
The toddler plunged to her death after slipping from her mother's
grasp as they were being lifted to safety by rescuers, who responded
when the family's vehicle became stuck in a flooded wash Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the girl's mother, whose name was not released,
drove around a barrier, one of several put up by county employees in
the area because of dangerously swirling creek waters caused by two
weeks of stormy weather.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Michael Handley said cars are
swept away all too often when people mistakenly think they can ford
swollen waterways in the area. ''It happens all the time,`` he said.
''I don't know what it is, the lemming mentality or something. They're
so intent on getting where they're going that they think they can
drive through the flood waters.``
</P>
<P>
Roads were clogged with rain and mud, and at least 720 crashes were
reported Sunday, more than three times the number of accidents during
the previous Sunday when streets were dry, the California Highway
Patrol said. Fire officials estimated that 100 roads in Los Angeles
saw flooding, mudslides or downed trees.
</P>
<P>
By Monday morning, the National Weather service reported that
downtown Los Angeles received 5.16 inches since Friday and more than
2.5 inches on Sunday alone. Beverly Hills received 7.79 inches, the
L.A. community of Eagle Rock 3.8 inches, Santa Monica 4.7 inches, and
Chatsworth, in the San Fernando Valley, 5.81 inches.
</P>
<P>
According to the weather service, Los Angeles has received almost
21 inches of precipitation since July 1. That surpasses the average
annual rainfall of 15.14 inches with five months yet to go.
</P>
<P>
The rain was expected to let up Monday afternoon, , but the region
will have little time to dry out. Substantial rains were forecast for
Monday night and through Tuesday. A real break was expected by
Wednesday, when clearing should take place for a few days at least.
