The sun began poking through the clouds as California emergency crews shifted
into cleanup mode after a six-day drenching that killed at least nine people,
destroyed dozens of houses and flooded roads and airports.
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department hurried Wednesday to clear at least 20 major roads
closed by mudslides and flooding, and in Malibu, crews prepared to destroy a
boulder the size of a house that dangled precariously above the Pacific Coast
Highway, held back by only a retaining wall. Crews also worked to fill thousands
of potholes _ some the size of cars.

<P>
Engineers fanned out across Los Angeles to assess whether houses on slipping
soil were still habitable. More than 100 homes were temporarily uninhabitable or
safe only for limited entry.

Los Angeles city fire spokesman Brian Humphrey said some ambulance crews had
been diverted to work as reconnaissance teams to spot signs of flooding and
mudslides.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters, meanwhile, were working 24-hour shifts with little time to eat or
even use the restroom. On Monday, the heaviest day of rain, the department
received nearly 2,000 calls _ twice the normal amount, Humphrey
said.

<P>
Rain fell early in the day Wednesday across part of Southern California but was
expected to taper off as the storm's center headed east along the
California-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
The storms began last Thursday, bringing 9.14 inches (23.22 centimeters) by
Wednesday morning to a city where the average for an entire year is about 15
inches (38.1 centimeters). Damage in Los Angeles County alone since Jan. 1 was
estimated at $52.5 million (euro39.76 million), including up to $10 million
(euro7.57 million) in damage caused by the latest storm.

In Ventura County, the small Santa Paula airport remained closed after more than
155 feet (46.5 meters) of runway crumbled into the rushing Santa Clara River.
Mudslides forced Amtrak to suspend train service between Los Angeles and Santa
Barbara through at least Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among those killed were a man who was driving when a eucalyptus tree fell on his
pickup truck in San Diego County and a 16-year-old girl who was doing homework
in an apartment bedroom when boulders hit her home near Irvine.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall since July 1, when California begins its yearly rainfall measurements,
now totals 34.36 inches (87.27 centimeters) _ more than Seattle or Portland and
the most in Los Angeles since 1889-90. The record for a single year _ 38.18
inches (96.98 centimeters) _ was set in 1883-84.

<P>
South of the border in Tijuana, Mexico, authorities reported at least seven
homes had collapsed in landslides and more than 150 people were
evacuated.
