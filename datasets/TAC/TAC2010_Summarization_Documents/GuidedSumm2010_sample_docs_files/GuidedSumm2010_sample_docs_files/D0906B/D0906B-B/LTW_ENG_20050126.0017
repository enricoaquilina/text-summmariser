How About That Weather?

It's looking like a crazy year for weather, and January isn't over
yet. Already we've seen record rains in California, floods in the
Midwest and snow in south Texas. Has Mother Nature gone bonkers?
</P>
<P>
Maybe just a little. The weather definitely has been wild lately:
</P>
<P>
-- Seventeen inches of rain fell on Los Angeles in 15 days from Dec.
27 to Jan. 10. That's two inches more than the city averages for an
entire year. The heavy rains softened the ground and caused mudslides
that killed people and destroyed homes.
</P>
<P>
-- Can you imagine if all that rain had been snow? Folks in the
Sierra Nevada mountains can. The same storms that produced so much
rain in the valleys of Southern California dumped 19 feet of snow in
the mountains to the north. That's 228 inches!
</P>
<P>
-- Brownsville, Texas, recorded 1.5 inches of snow on Christmas Day.
It was the first measurable snow there since 1895, and might have been
the town's first-ever White Christmas. Snow is so rare there that a
Brownsville snowball sold for $92 on eBay.
</P>
<P>
-- More than nine inches of precipitation has fallen in Indianapolis
since the beginning of the year. Normally, the Indiana city would have
less than two inches by this time in January. Large amounts of rain
and snow have caused rivers all over the Midwest to spill over their
banks and flood homes.
</P>
<P>
-- Temperatures have been wacky, too. Last week the mercury dropped
to 54 degrees below zero in Minnesota. The state record is 60 below.
Here in Washington we were having a mild, snowless winter -- the high
temperature reached 64 degrees or higher five times in the first half
of January. Now, it's freezing outside and we've had snow three times
in one week.
</P>
<P>
So, what's going on? Is it global warming? Is El Nino to blame?
While scientists believe that global warming -- the slow increase in
Earth's overall temperature -- could result in more extreme weather,
there's no way to be sure it has anything to do with what has happened
in the last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
Crazy weather is often blamed on El Nino, the warming of waters in
the eastern Pacific Ocean that affects weather patterns all over the
world. But the current El Nino is pretty weak and probably isn't
responsible for the wicked weather we've seen this year.
</P>
<P>
Instead, forecasters have traced some of the unusual activity,
especially the storms out West, to another phenomenon in the Pacific
Ocean. This one is called the Madden-Julian Oscillation, or MJO.
Discovered by scientists Roland Madden and Paul Julian, the MJO causes
an increase in tropical rainfall and thunderstorms, which in turn
affects weather in the United States and around the globe.
</P>
<P>
It's also important to remember that the weather is rarely
``normal'' anyway. Temperatures and precipitation tend to go through
cycles. Just as sports teams have winning and losing streaks, the
weather has warm and cool streaks, and wet and dry streaks.
</P>
<P>
That's part of what makes our planet so exciting. You never know
exactly how long a cold spell or heat wave will last, or how much rain
or snow is on the way.
</P>
<P>
Makes you wonder what kind of wild weather tomorrow will bring.
