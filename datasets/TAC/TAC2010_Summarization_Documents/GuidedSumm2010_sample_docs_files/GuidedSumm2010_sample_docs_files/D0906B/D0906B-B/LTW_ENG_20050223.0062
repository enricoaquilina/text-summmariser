Now That the Rain Has Left L.A., It's Cleanup Time

<P>
Southern California's six-day siege of torrential
rains finally came to an end Wednesday, leaving scores of roads
blocked by mudslides and washouts, dozens of homes uninhabitable and a
massive cleanup job that could last for weeks.
</P>
<P>
Traffic on more than 100 roads in Los Angeles County was blocked or
interrupted by the storms, and public works officials said highway
damage was so widespread that some roads might not reopen until summer
or even fall.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council transferred $500,000 from its reserve
fund to provide loans and grants for residents displaced by damage, or
the threat of it, to their homes.
</P>
<P>
Parting showers raised the rainfall total for the season in
downtown Los Angeles to 33.87 inches Wednesday, making it the third
wettest season on record and the rainiest in 115 years.
</P>
<P>
Typically, almost 5 inches of rain falls on the city between now
and June 30, when the season ends. That means there's a better than
even chance that by the time this season is over, it will be the
wettest ever, surpassing the record of 38.18 inches in 1883-84. Just
three years ago, the 2001-02 season was the driest ever, with only
4.42 inches.
</P>
<P>
Despite at least five storm-related deaths and damage that could
top $100 million, the rain did some good, too. Southern California's
storage reservoirs and underground aquifers are once again full,
meaning there will be less reliance on water from distant sources such
as the Colorado Basin, which is still in the throes of a long-term
drought.
</P>
<P>
Dry weather is expected for the remainder of this week, but the
National Weather Service said there's a chance of light rain Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The county and city departments of public works and the California
Department of Transportation face a monumental task of cleaning up the
mess created by the storms. The cost of repairing roads has climbed to
$37.6 million for the county alone.
</P>
<P>
Major routes that remained blocked Wednesday included Pacific Coast
Highway in Malibu, the Angeles Crest Highway above La Canada
Flintridge, state Highway 39 above Azusa, Bouquet Canyon road above
Newhall, Topanga Canyon Boulevard near Fernwood, the Sierra Highway
between Palmdale and La Canada Flintridge and Malibu Canyon Road above
Malibu.
</P>
<P>
The storm damage included bridge failures, flooding, pavement
breakup, rock slides, failed retaining walls and erosion.
</P>
<P>
On Malibu Canyon Road, firefighters used their hoses to try to
clear a tall pile of fallen rocks, taking time out to pull out a horse
that got stuck chest-deep in mud. The hoses weren't powerful enough to
wash away the slide, and officials said they would try explosives on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Other major routes that remain closed by slides, washouts or bridge
failures include parts of Mulholland Drive and a stretch of Stadium
Way between Elysian Park and Chavez Ravine, near Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
City officials said more than 2,000 potholes had been repaired
since Friday, with hundreds more to go.Sixteen more homes were
red-tagged in the Glassell Park neighborhood, raising the total marked
unfit for habitation in the city of Los Angeles to at least 43.
Another 70 homes in the city had been marked with yellow tags,
indicating that access was allowed only during daytime hours.
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, six houses were red-tagged in the San Rafael District.
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, three homes had been destroyed by slides and 13
more were threatened.
