Rivers at Risk: Drugs, Household Chemicals More Evident in Water

<P>
Last fall, Maceo Carrillo Martinet, a graduate
student in biology at the University of New Mexico, took a sample from
a well beside the Rio Grande here and shipped it to a laboratory for
analysis.
</P>
<P>
Among other compounds, the sample, taken within a large cottonwood
forest, contained 1,100 parts per trillion of DEET, the chemical used
in insect repellents.
</P>
<P>
This was startling. It was nearly double the level found upriver,
above the Albuquerque wastewater treatment plant, and strongly
suggested that some of the DEET came from treatment plant discharges.
</P>
<P>
``We put it on our skin, we go home, we wash or we take a shower
and it goes into the system,'' Martinet said. ``It actually does not
biodegrade in treatment plants.''
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceuticals and personal care products, such as prescription
and nonprescription drugs and substances like insect repellents and
disinfectants, are turning up in many U.S. rivers.
</P>
<P>
``As we look more and more, these compounds are showing up in a lot
of places,'' said Dana W. Kolpin, a research hydrologist with the U.S.
Geological Survey who published the first major overview of the
pharmaceutical question only three years ago. It found, for example,
that DEET, steroids and a kind of fire retardant were present in the
waters of a majority of 139 streams tested in 30 states.
</P>
<P>
Water samples from rivers receiving treated wastewater often reveal
the presence of insecticides, antidepressants such as Prozac,
disinfectants, antibiotics and caffeine, too.
</P>
<P>
``You can find caffeine in just about any river with a wastewater
treatment plant discharging into it,'' said Judith L. Meyer, a
University of Georgia professor whose research focuses on stream
ecology.
</P>
<P>
Wastewater treatment plants can break down some of these substances
during treatment, but many pass right through or are only partly
intercepted. Cities and towns aren't doing anything wrong, because the
plants were never designed to treat substances such as steroids and
antidepressants. Moreover, there are no regulatory standards for these
substances in wastewater.
</P>
<P>
While some of the substances have been around for many years, only
in recent years has the analytical equipment been available to measure
them in a comparatively inexpensive and speedy manner. And so it is
only in the past few years that researchers ``fully realized that it
is as widespread as it appears to be,'' said Paul E. Stackelberg, a
hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
Already, however, there are indications that some of these
substances, typically found in tiny amounts, are harming some forms of
aquatic life, notably fish and amphibians. Whether they pose any
threat to humans is essentially unknown.
</P>
<P>
In one new study conducted by the Geological Survey and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, samples of water were analyzed
from streams that both receive treated wastewater effluent and are
used for drinking water, after treatment.
</P>
<P>
They found that prescription drugs and other organic wastewater
contaminants survived treatment processes and were present in drinking
water, though in concentrations far below what would constitute a
therapeutic dose.
</P>
<P>
For example, carbamazepine, an anti-epileptic drug, has been
identified in many rivers, and was identified in the unnamed stream
used in the study. But if a person drank 2 liters of water a day for
70 years at the concentrations found in that stream, he or she would
ingest only 13 milligrams of the drug, far below a single therapeutic
dose of the drug, which is 100 milligrams or more.
</P>
<P>
``Nevertheless, most studies on the therapeutic effects of drugs
are based on the short-term ingestion of relatively high doses; little
is known about potential health effects associated with long-term
chronic ingestion of low concentrations through drinking water,''
according to that study.
</P>
<P>
``It's a natural question to ask,'' said Stackelberg, one of the
authors of that study. ``But here, really, at this point there is no
response. There have been no studies conducted to make that
determination.''
</P>
<P>
Some of these compounds break down more quickly in the environment
than others. It appears that DEET does not readily biodegrade when it
leaves wastewater treatment plants, Martinet said, which raises the
question of whether it might accumulate in groundwater or sediments
and increase over time to more troublesome levels. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency classifies DEET as slightly toxic, but
whether the levels in rivers like the Rio Grande are anything to worry
about is unknown.
</P>
<P>
A recent study looking more closely at DEET, in which Kolpin was
one of the authors, suggested additional studies on DEET's potential
toxicity to aquatic life because it is so widespread in streams
receiving treated wastewater.
</P>
<P>
Bryan Brooks, an assistant professor of environmental studies at
Baylor University in Texas, tested sunfish, channel catfish and black
crappie from Pecan Creek. The stream, near Dallas, receives almost all
of its flow from a wastewater treatment plant and connects to a
drinking water supply.
</P>
<P>
He found tiny amounts of fluoxetine, the active ingredient in
Prozac, in liver and brain tissue.
</P>
<P>
Prozac has been identified in many streams at low levels. ``It is
going to be fairly common to detect in rivers receiving wastewater
treatment effluent, especially when the wastewater treatment plants
are a significant source of flow,'' said Marsha Black, an
ecotoxicologist at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
In her own lab experiments, Black found that even low levels of the
antidepressant harmed amphibians and fish.
</P>
<P>
Tadpoles exposed to levels of Prozac like those found in streams
were smaller when they turned into frogs than tadpoles that were not
exposed to the drug, she found. At higher concentrations than
typically seen in the environment, fish became lethargic. In both
instances, that could leave the animals far more vulnerable to
predation or environmental stress, she said.
</P>
<P>
Using outdoor, artificial streams fed by treated municipal
wastewater, Brooks found that male fish developed some female sexual
characteristics. Such fish also have been encountered in the wild,
recently on the South Branch of the Potomac River in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
Still, Brooks cautions that concentrations of personal care
products and pharmaceuticals are small, and that extensive research
will be needed to determine if there is any effect on humans.
</P>
<P>
``It is not prudent to make some sort of quick decision,'' he said.
``We need to make sure if we make decisions that they are
science-based.''
</P>
<P>
Brooks, in fact, is skeptical of any human impact. ``To make the
leap to human health, I just don't see it,'' he said. ``Even if a
compound were stable enough to be taken up by fish and eaten by
humans, they're at such low levels you would have to eat hundreds of
meals to even approach one therapeutic dose.''
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the impact on frogs, fish, amphibians, and even
algae ``is a different story altogether,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Researchers say there are other questions to be answered. Even if
pharmaceuticals meant to be ingested are found only at low levels,
what about compounds not meant to be ingested at all, such as flame
retardants, pesticides, DEET and other substances? And what if there
is a synergistic effect among any of these many compounds in the
water?
</P>
<P>
And even if a compound breaks down relatively quickly in the
environment, unlike such well-known enduring pollutants as PCBs or
DDT, what is the long-term impact if the substance is gushing from
treatment plant effluent pipes every day?
</P>
<P>
However widespread they may be, these contaminants are only just
entering the public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
On a recent day, as he walked along the banks of the Rio Grande
just south of Albuquerque, Martinet ticked off a list of the compounds
found in the river and groundwater, including fire retardants and the
ubiquitous caffeine.
</P>
<P>
``We've been using DEET for a while, birth control pills for a
while, caffeine forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
``What happens to these compounds once they are in the system is a
huge, huge question mark right now.''
