FUNGUS FUELED BY GLOBAL WARMING SAID TO KILL AMPHIBIANS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Scientists studying a fast-dwindling genus of colorful harlequin frogs on misty
mountainsides in Central and South America report Thursday that global
warming is combining with a spreading fungus to kill off
many species.
</P>
<P>
The researchers implicated global warming, as opposed to local variations in
temperature or other conditions. Their conclusion is based on their
finding that patterns of fungus outbreaks and extinctions in widely
dispersed patches of habitat were synchronized in a way that
could not be explained by chance.
</P>
<P>
If the analysis holds up, it will be the first to
link recent climate changes to the spread of a fungus
lethal to frogs and salamanders and their kin. The chytrid
fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, has devastated amphibian communities in many parts
of the world over in recent decades.

<P>
Experts on amphibian disease and ecology are divided over the finding,
which is being published Thursday in the journal Nature. Several
scientists criticized the paper Wednesday, saying it glossed over significant
sources of uncertainty; others said it was evidence that warming
caused by human activity was already harming wildlife.
</P>
<P>
The study was led by J. Alan Pounds, a biologist at
the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
More than 110 species of brightly colored harlequin frogs once lived
in the tropics of the Western Hemisphere, but about two-thirds
of them have vanished since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
A leading suspect is the chytrid fungus, which in recent decades
has killed amphibians from deserts to lowland tropical forests to
mountainsides.
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, the fungus thrives best in cooler conditions, challenging the theory
that global warming is responsible. But the Pounds team, in
studying trends in temperature and disease around the American tropics,
found patterns that they say explain the situation.
</P>
<P>
Because warming increases evaporation, it can create clouds that tend to
make days cooler by blocking sunlight. In an interview, Pounds
said that could have created conditions for the spread of
the chytrid fungus. He said that because the seeming extinctions
had occurred in lockstep over widely dispersed field sites, they
were hard to attribute to anything other than the broad
warming trend linked to greenhouse gases.
