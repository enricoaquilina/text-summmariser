International conservation groups are proposing a $404 million (euro332.8
million) effort to preserve frogs and other amphibians whose sensitive, porous
skins often make them the first indicator when nature goes awry.
</P>
<P>
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature, Conservation
International and other groups said they plan a series of emergency actions and
long-term research that will include describing at least 1,000 new species,
preventing future habitat loss and reducing trade in amphibians for food and
pets.
</P>
<P>
The groups are looking to governments, private institutions and individual
donors for money.

"The frogs are trying to tell us something," said Andrew Dobson, a professor at
New Jersey's Princeton University who studies infectious diseases in the wild.
"We're making the world a sicker place and, mercifully, the frogs have picked up
on it before us humans."
</P>
<P>
Almost a third of known species of frogs, toads and other amphibians are
considered "globally threatened" by the IUCN, which is based in Gland,
Switzerland. By comparison, 23 percent of mammal species and 12 percent of bird
species are threatened.
</P>
<P>
Declines and disappearance of amphibian species are occurring mostly in North
and South America, Puerto Rico and Australia. The chief causes are a fungal
disease that tends to occur at higher elevations and by streams, habitat loss
and degradation, climate change, chemical pollution, nonnative species and
overharvesting of amphibians for food and pets.
</P>
<P>
"The fungus is the cause of a lot of the massive die-offs we're seeing in recent
years," said Claude Gascon, a senior vice president at Conservation
International.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have discovered 5,743 species of amphibians so far, but they believe
about 10,000 exist. Those include frogs, toads, salamanders and caecilians,
snakelike creatures that live mostly underground.
</P>
<P>
At least 43 percent of species are declining in population size, including 1,856
that might soon become extinct, according to a team of 500 scientists in 60
countries. In the past 35 years, they believe, 122 species already might have
disappeared.
