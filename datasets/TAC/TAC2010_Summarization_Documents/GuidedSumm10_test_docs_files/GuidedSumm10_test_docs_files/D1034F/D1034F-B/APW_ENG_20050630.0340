35 new Sri Lanka frogs discovered, but 11 on the verge of extinction

Researchers confirmed 35 new species of frog in Sri Lanka's dwindling rain
forest over the past decade but also found that 17 frog species have disappeared
and 11 others face imminent extinction unless their habitat is
protected.
</P>
<P>
"We need a concerted effort from the government together with international
agencies" to preserve the frogs' rain forest habitat, warned researcher Rohan
Pethiyagoda, "or it's not going to be only the frogs that will be in
trouble."
</P>
<P>
Pethiyagod and his team also found 50 previously unknown species of snails, 17
new crabs, seven new lizards, and a mysterious new species of mouse deer,
according to their decade-long study published Thursday in the peer-reviewed
Raffles Bulletin of Zoology.
</P>
<P>
Pethiyagod and his team scoured Sri Lanka's rain forests and compared what they
found with Sri Lankan wildlife collected earlier and preserved in museums in
London, Paris and Berlin. They found that 17 frog species previously found no
longer existed in the wild.
</P>
<P>
"Sri Lanka's frogs are in deep trouble ... It's a desperate situation,"
Pethiyagoda said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press, adding that
captive breeding may be necessary to save 11 species on the brink of
extinction.
</P>
<P>
The 35 new frog species boosts Sri Lanka's frog diversity to 105 _ including the
17 now extinct _ and an additional 35 are in the process of being classified,
Pethiyagoda said. Sri Lanka is home to 3 percent of the world's frogs, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The study raises Sri Lanka's profile as an amphibian biodiversity treasure
trove, even challenging tropical islands ten times larger like Madagascar and
New Guinea, which have similar numbers of frog species.
</P>
<P>
In the study, Pethiyagoda wrote that less than 5 percent of Sri Lanka's rain
forest has survived the massive expansion of agriculture of the past two
centuries.
</P>
<P>
Many of the forests were cleared during the British colonial rule from 1815-1948
to make way for rubber, coffee, and tea plantations.
</P>
<P>
Three of the newly discovered tree frog species lay very sticky bright green
eggs on similar colored leaves that develop into young frogs _ skipping the
tadpole stage _ and emerge as smaller versions of their parents.
</P>
<P>
Although the pace of biodiversity research has accelerated, Pethiyagoda said,
biodiversity managers and scientists need more engagement with the government
and the public.
</P>
<P>
"Only then can an effective strategy be developed for securing the integrity of
biodiversity as a whole, and preventing further extinction," he
said.
