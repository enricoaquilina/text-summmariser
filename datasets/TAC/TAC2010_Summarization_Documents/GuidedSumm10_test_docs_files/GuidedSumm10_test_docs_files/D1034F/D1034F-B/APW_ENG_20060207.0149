Scientists discover dozens of new species in isolated Indonesian jungle

Scientists surveying an isolated Indonesian jungle discovered dozens of new
species of frogs, butterflies and plants, and glimpsed large mammals that have
been hunted to near-extinction elsewhere, the team announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The expedition also found rare animals that were remarkably unafraid of humans
during the rapid survey of the Foja Mountains, an area with more than a million
hectares of old growth tropical forest in Indonesia's easternmost Papua
province, said Bruce Beehler, a co-leader of the month-long trip.
</P>
<P>
Two Long-Beaked Echidnas, a primitive egg-laying mammal, simply allowed
scientists to pick them up and bring them back to their camp to be studied, he
said, noting that the enigmatic animals were probably so unwary because they
never had seen people before.
</P>
<P>
The December 2005 expedition _ organized by the U.S.-based environmental
organization Conservation International and the Indonesian Institute of Sciences
_ was funded by the National Geographic Society, the Swift Foundation, the
Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Global Environment Project
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Papua, the scene of a decades-long separatist rebellion that has left an
estimated 100,000 people dead, is one of Indonesia's most remote provinces,
geographically and politically, and access by foreigners is tightly
restricted.
</P>
<P>
The 11-member team of U.S., Indonesian and Australian scientists needed six
permits before they could legally fly by helicopter to an open, boggy lakebed
surrounded by forests near the range's western summit, where they set up camp at
an altitude of 1,500 meters (yards).
</P>
<P>
"There was not a single trail, no sign of civilization, no sign of even local
communities ever having been there," said Beehler, adding that two headmen from
the Kwerba and Papasena tribes, the customary landowners of the Foja Mountains,
accompanied the expedition.
</P>
<P>
"They were as astounded as we were at how isolated it was," he told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview from Washington D.C. "As far as they
knew, neither of their clans had ever been to the area."
</P>
<P>
The scientists said they discovered 20 frog species _ including a tiny
microhylid frog less than 14 millimeters (a half inch) long _ four new butterfly
species, and at least five new types of palms during their trip.
</P>
<P>
Their findings, however, will have to be published and then reviewed by peers
before being officially classified as new species, a process that could take six
months to several years.
</P>
<P>
One of the most remarkable discoveries was the Golden-mantled Tree Kangaroo, an
arboreal jungle-dweller new for Indonesia and previously thought to have been
hunted to near extinction, and a new honeyeater bird, which has a bright orange
face-patch with a pendant wattle under each eye, Beehler said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the rich diversity in the forest, the group rarely had to stray more
than a few kilometers (miles) from their base camp.
</P>
<P>
"We've only scratched the surface," said Beehler, vice president of Conservation
International's Melanesia Center for Biodiversity Conservation, who hopes to
return later this year with other scientists to continue the field
work.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for the rainforest's isolation, he said, was that only a few
hundred people live in the region and game in the mountain's foothills was so
abundant that they had no reason to venture into the jungle's
interior.
</P>
<P>
There did not appear to be any immediate conservation threat to the area, which
has the status of a wildlife sanctuary, he said.
</P>
<P>
"No logging permits are given to this area, there is no transport system _ not a
single road," Beehler said.
</P>
<P>
"But clearly with time everything is a threat. In the next few decades there
will be strong demands, especially if you think of the timber needs of nearby
countries like China and Japan. They will be very hungry for
logs."
