Frog that has survived for thousands of years faces extinction from lethal Fungus
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, California
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mountain yellow-legged frog has survived for thousands of years in lakes and
streams carved by glaciers, living up to nine months under snow and ice and then
emerging to issue its raspy chorus across the Sierra Nevada range.
</P>
<P>
But the frog's call is rapidly going silent as a mysterious fungus pushes it
toward extinction in its remaining refuge in national parks.
</P>
<P>
"It's very dramatic," said Lara Rachowicz, a Yosemite biologist who is leading
an effort to save the tiny creature. "One year, you visit a lake and the
population will seem fine. The next year you go back, you see a lot of dead
frogs scattered along the bottom of the pond. In a couple years the population
is gone."
</P>
<P>
There are about 650 populations left in Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings Canyon
national parks, but most lakes have only one to five frogs _ not enough to
guarantee their survival _ and 85 percent of them are already infected with the
lethal fungus.
</P>
<P>
At one time, the frogs were so thick that tadpoles frothed the water in shallow
waters, and it was hard not to step on a frog on shore.
</P>
<P>
Their decline started when trout were stocked in Sierra lakes _ first carried in
buckets by mule and then dropped by plane _ to supply fishermen. The voracious
fish, which are still being introduced into the high Sierra outside park
boundaries, are leaving only isolated groups scattered over widespread lakes as
high as 13,000 feet (3,900 meters).
</P>
<P>
Despite living within the protective borders of some of the nation's most
beloved parks, the remaining frogs can't resist the onslaught of the fungus and
can't travel far enough in trout-infested streams to repopulate areas devastated
by the fungus.
</P>
<P>
For the past five years, they've been disappearing at a rate of 10 percent a
year, Rachowicz said at a gathering last month of 24 experts trying to save the
frog.
</P>
<P>
The chytrid fungus, which has been linked to the extinction of amphibians in
places as far away as Australia and Costa Rica, kills the frogs by growing on
their skin, making it hard for them to use their pores and regulate water
intake. The frogs die of thirst in the water, Rachowicz said, pointing to a
photograph of an emaciated frog floating belly up in a shallow
pool.
</P>
<P>
While the species deserves to be designated as endangered, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service lacks the funds to complete the process and the frog lingers on
a waiting list.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials also questioned whether listing it as endangered would help,
since the immediate threat to its survival isn't coming from agriculture or
development that threatens other species and can be curbed.
</P>
<P>
"It's an act-of-God type thing," said Harry McQuillen, chief of the endangered
species recovery branch of the Sacramento office of U.S. Fish and Wildlife who
attended the meeting. "How do you deal with something that seems overwhelmingly
out of your control?"
</P>
<P>
In a handful of years the frogs may be gone, leaving the high elevation lakes in
silence, and snapping the local food chain.
</P>
<P>
"There would be an unraveling of that web of life, because this species plays
such an important role," said Roland Knapp, a research biologist with the Sierra
Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The frog's disappearance would affect about 300 species in the rugged high
country, from the insects they prey on to the garter snakes and coyotes that eat
them, said Knapp, who led a survey counting the frogs in more than 6,500 bodies
of water in the parks in 2000-2002 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
What's frightening about the fungus' attack on amphibians is that it kills them
quickly even in untouched habitats, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a mass extinction in the making," said J. Alan Pounds, main author of an
article in the January issue of Nature that linked global warming to the fungus
first named by scientists in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
His research in the misty jungle of Costa Rica's mountains offers the first
solid clue to what's been an international scientific mystery _ the
disappearance of as many as 112 amphibian species since 1980.
</P>
<P>
Pounds concluded that global warming has created conditions that favor the
fungus, and helps explain why 65 species of vibrantly colored harlequin frogs in
Costa Rican forests have succumbed to it in the last two decades _ five of them
after 1987, an unusually warm year.
</P>
<P>
No research has been done to prove a link between climate change in the high
Sierra and the fungus' lethal spread here, but scientists who gathered in the
park in January said they can't wait for those studies.
</P>
<P>
Park biologists will examine the possibility of breeding the critters in
captivity, which no one's done successfully. They may also re-establish frogs in
areas where they've disappeared, and continue to remove nonnative trout from
some high Sierra lakes. Trout removal has had promising results in Sequoia and
Kings Canyon, but might prove unpopular with anglers.
</P>
<P>
"Recreational fishing is a long-standing, valid activity in the park, and we
recognize that," said Steve Thompson, +Yosemite+'s lead wildlife biologist. "But
the park has a dual mission, to protect resources and provide for their
enjoyment. If you don't protect the resources, it'll prevent the
enjoyment."
</P>
<P>
Amphibians are facing an ecological disaster on a global scale _ and the
majority of endangered species don't enjoy such dedicated attention.
</P>
<P>
The Global Amphibian Assessment, a worldwide collaborative survey by hundreds of
scientists completed in 2004, found that one-third of the world's 5,743
amphibian species are threatened and 168 are possibly extinct.
</P>
<P>
"I suspect that climate change is involved in general in these enigmatic
declines," said Pounds. "Ultimately we have to have a transition to cleaner
energy technologies, to cleaner sources of energy. But by then, it might be too
late for the mountain yellow-legged frogs."
