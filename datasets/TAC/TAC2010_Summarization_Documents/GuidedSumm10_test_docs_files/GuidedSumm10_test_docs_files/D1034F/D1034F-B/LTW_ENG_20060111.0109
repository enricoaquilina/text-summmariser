Rising temperatures are responsible for pushing dozens of frog
species over the brink of extinction in the past three decades,
according to a new findings being reported Thursday by a team of Latin
American and U.S. scientists.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the journal Nature, provides concrete
evidence that climate change has already helped wipe out a slew of
species and could spur more extinctions and the spread of disease
worldwide. It also helps solve the international mystery of why
amphibians across the globe have been vanishing from their usual
habitats over the past quarter century: as many as 112 species have
disappeared since 1980.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have speculated that rising temperatures and changing
weather patterns could endanger the survival of many species, but the
new study documents for the first time a direct correlation between
global warming and the disappearance of roughly 65 amphibian species
in Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
The fate of amphibians, whose permeable skin makes them sensitive
to environmental changes, are seen by scientists as a possible
harbinger of global warming's effects. Rising temperatures are
threatening the survival of flora and fauna worldwide, from coral
reefs in the Caribbean that serve as critical fish nurseries to the
South African rhododendrons, which cannot move to a cooler climate.
</P>
<P>
J. Alan Pounds -- resident scientist at the Tropical Science
Center's Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve in Costa Rica and the
study's lead author -- worked with 13 other researchers to pin down the
link between rising temperatures in the tropics and the spread of the
deadly chytrid fungus that has wiped out dozens of species of
harlequin frogs in recent years.
</P>
<P>
``Disease is the bullet killing frogs, but climate change is
pulling the trigger,'' Pounds said. ``Global warming is wreaking havoc
on amphibians and will cause staggering losses of biodiversity if we
don't do something first.''
</P>
<P>
The paper helps explain how global warming has allowed the chytrid
fungus -- which kills frogs by growing on their skin and attacking
their epidermis and teeth as well as by releasing a toxin -- to thrive
in Costa Rica and neighboring countries. The higher temperatures
result in more water vapor in the air, which in turn forms a cloud
cover that leads to cooler days and warmer nights. These conditions
favor the fungus, which grows and reproduces best at temperatures
between 63 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
At least 110 species of the vibrantly-colored amphibians once lived
near streams in the Central and South American tropics, but about
two-thirds disappeared in the 1980s and 1990s, including the golden
toad. While researchers had previously identified the fungus as a
major reason for the frogs' demise, they have been trying determine
why the disease has taken such a major toll in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Looking at more than 65 harlequin frog species that had vanished,
researchers found that 80 percent of the time there was a correlation
between higher temperatures and the species' disappearance. After a
warm peak in 1987, for example, five species died off.
</P>
<P>
``There's a coherent pattern of disappearances, all the way from
Costa Rica to Peru,'' Pounds said in an interview. ``Here's a case
where we can show that global warming is affecting outbreaks of this
disease.''
</P>
<P>
Amphibians are experiencing a precipitous decline in Africa, Asia
and North America, according to a comprehensive 2004 survey, which
cited climate change as well as deforestation, pollution and habitat
loss as key factors.
</P>
<P>
``We have a biodiversity crisis,'' said Andrew Blaustein, director
of Oregon State University's graduate programs in environmental
science. ``Amphibians seem to be harder hit than other groups.''
</P>
<P>
Michael Totten, senior director for climate and water initiatives
at the environmental group Conservation International, said humans
have made it more difficult for animal and plant species to adapt to
the shifting climate by fragmenting natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
``Traditionally species have been resilient and capable of going
through dramatic climate change, but with humans changing the face of
the landscape, we've created lots of prisons for species, and that's
the major problem they face,'' Totten said.
</P>
<P>
Stanford University climatologist Stephen Schneider said the new
research represents ``a creative step in the right direction, but it's
still early in the game to sound the `solved' bell.'' He added the
study was ``just further evidence'' that global warming is linked to
accelerating extinctions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
While Pounds and his colleagues are still researching the harlequin
frogs' disappearance, their findings are prompting even some
scientists who had been skeptical about climate change's impact on
amphibians to reassess their position.
</P>
<P>
James Collins, who studies harlequin frogs at Arizona State
University, called the paper ``an intriguing contribution'' to
understanding what is happening to amphibians worldwide. He added the
study shows that when it comes to climate change, ``these forces don't
all move in one direction,'' since some habitats are becoming drier
while others are becoming wetter.
</P>
<P>
Collins and a team of researchers are trying to determine if the
chytrid fungus is surfacing in areas where it had never thrived
before.
