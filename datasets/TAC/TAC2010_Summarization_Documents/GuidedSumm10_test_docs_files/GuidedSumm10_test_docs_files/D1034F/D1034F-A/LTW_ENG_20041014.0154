A Third of Amphibian Species Face Extinction, Study Says

Amphibians are experiencing a precipitous decline
across the globe, according to the first comprehensive world survey of
the creatures, which include frogs, toads and salamanders. Up to 122
species have disappeared since 1980 and another 1,900 are in danger of
going extinct.
</P>
<P>
The rapid drop -- the equivalent of tens of thousands of years worth
of extinctions in just a century -- is being caused by a range of
factors that include deforestation, pollution, habitat loss and
climate change, the researchers said. But they added that the
phenomenon also tells a disturbing tale of broad environmental
degradation that may ultimately threaten humans and other animals as
well. Amphibians are often considered ``canaries in the coal mine''
because their permeable skin makes them especially sensitive to
changing environmental conditions.
</P>
<P>
``This is the first group being affected by a death by a thousand
cuts in the way that we as humans have been affecting the biosphere in
the past fifty or hundred years,'' said Claude Gascon, a scientific
adviser to the study who serves as vice president for regional
programs at Conservation International, an environmental group. ``It's
entirely possible other groups of biodiversity may go down the
drain.''
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 32 percent of amphibian species face
extinction, compared to 12 percent of bird species and 23 percent of
mammal species. The three-year, $1.5 million study, which involved
more than 500 scientists from more than 60 countries, is being
published Friday in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
Scientists began noticing the disappearance of amphibians in the
late 1980s and early 1990s, but before this study they'd never
conducted a worldwide assessment of the frogs, toads, salamanders and
legless caecilians, also called rubber eels.
</P>
<P>
``We've never documented anything like this for any other species.
When species become rare and begin disappearing, we nearly always know
why,'' said Simon Stuart, leader of the global assessment team. ``This
has taken the scientific world completely by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
Amphibians are under assault for three major reasons, according to
the report. Habitat decline, from deforestation to water pollution and
wetlands destruction, threatens them because the animals live both on
land and in water. Over-harvesting of amphibians for food and medicine
is a second threat. The third is more enigmatic, but it has resulted
in catastrophic declines, often linked to a fungal disease called
chytridiomycosis, particularly in cooler habitats that are
experiencing drought.
</P>
<P>
Surveys showed the amphibian population of Costa Rica's Monteverde
Cloud Forest, for example, was stable until 1987. The next year it
began to crash and by 1989, 40 percent of its amphibian species had
gone extinct, including the striking golden toad. Stuart said it is
now widely believed chytridiomycosis played a pivotal role in the
devastation, which took place in a dry period.
</P>
<P>
The fact that more than 200 amphibian species are showing rapid
enigmatic declines is alarming, Stuart said, because it is probably
linked to recent disruptions in rain and storm patterns. ``This is a
wake-up call to us that we don't have a grip on the massive climate
change that's going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Humans are responsible for amphibians' decline in other regions of
the world, including China, where many are sought as a delicacy. The
Chinese giant salamander -- at six feet the largest amphibian in the
world -- sells for at least $300 on the street and makes for several
meals, and it has now disappeared from nearly all its range.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, habitat destruction poses the biggest
challenge. Developers and environmentalists are feuding in central
California over the fate of the California tiger salamander, a
striking black animal with yellow spots. A casualty of urbanization
and agricultural development, federal officials estimate the
salamander has lost 75 percent of its habitat over time. The U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service decided in July to list the salamander as
threatened and identified 383,000 acres of habitat as key to its
survival.
</P>
<P>
Al Donner, an assistant field supervisor in Fish and Wildlife's
Sacramento office, said federal officials are trying to ``be sensitive
to the interests of all affected parties'' in the tiger salamander
case, including developers, landowners and environmentalists, ``while
working to ensure the survival of the species.''
</P>
<P>
Four years ago the federal government launched a national program
to research and monitor the state of amphibians in the United States,
and it now devotes $4 million a year to identify threats to amphibians
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
``We've had a leap in our understanding into the causes of
amphibian decline,'' said Rick Kearney, national coordinator for the
U.S. Geological Survey's amphibian research and monitoring initiative.
``We recognize how there are connections between the decline in water
quality (and availability) and amphibians. ... Amphibians are a very
important indicator of our environmental quality.''
</P>
<P>
But Paul Ehrlich, a Stanford University ecologist, said the
amphibian study was worrying and showed that administration officials
are ``destroying the working supports of our life system'' by
exploiting rather than conserving habitat. ``They're sawing off the
limb that humanity is sitting on,'' Ehrlich said. ``Without
biodiversity we'd be dead.''
</P>
<P>
Gascon, at Conservation International, said ``there are some
actions we can take today to prevent the immediate extinction of many
species as we work on a longer term solution.'' These include creating
parks and ecological reserves, working to reduce emissions that
contribute to climate change and breeding animals in captivity in
order to sustain vulnerable species.
