Airport authorities have detained three Belgians accused of smuggling
some 600 rare frogs into the country from Panama, news reports said
Tuesday.

<P>
The frogs are protected species and are valued at up to euro250
(US$300) a piece for collectors in Europe, Belgian media reported.

<P>
The three suspects were arrested last week at Brussels airport after
customs agents grew suspicious about the large number of film rolls
the three were carrying.

<P>
After inspecting the plastic film containers, agents found the
brightly colored animals hidden inside.

<P>
Some of the frogs had survived the trip and were taken to the Antwerp
zoo, the reports said.
