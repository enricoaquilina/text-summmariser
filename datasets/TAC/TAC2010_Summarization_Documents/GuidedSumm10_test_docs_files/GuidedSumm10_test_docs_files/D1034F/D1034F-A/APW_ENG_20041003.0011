U.S. mine tries to dig out from under local discontent in Peruvian
Andes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gerardo de la Cruz, a 42-year-old farmer, is one of thousands who
spent two weeks blockading a U.S.-run gold mine in the Andes, the
latest example of the uneasy relationship between Peru's rural poor
and the mining industry.
</P>
<P>
The siege of Latin America's largest gold mine was lifted Sept. 17
after Peru's Mining Ministry struck a deal to postpone the search for
ore pending a study of the impact mining could have on the water
supply to de la Cruz's village. But the Yanacocha mining company,
51-percent owned by Denver-based Newmont Mining Corp., still has a
serious image problem to overcome.
</P>
<P>
"The mine here is interested only in money _ hauling off gold _ and
nothing else," de la Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
The blockade of the mine's access road was sparked by fears that new
mining on Cerro Quilish, the mountain where Yanacocha had started
exploratory drilling, could deplete and contaminate water supplies.
</P>
<P>
Yanacocha isn't the first mining company to run up against broad
public opposition. The government last year withdrew permission for
Canada's Manhattan Minerals Corp. to develop the Tambogrande gold and
copper project in northern Peru that called for uprooting a third of
nearby townspeople.
</P>
<P>
Yanacocha, acknowledges it underestimated the concern over water, but
points to an independent study that said its operations pose no
immediate health threat and isn't to blame for decreased water
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Mining is key to Peru's economy, which has been growing at about 4
percent annually since President Alejandro Toledo took office in
2001. Mining provides about half of Peru's more than US$11 billion
(euro8.9 billion) in exports this year, but directly employs only
about 70,000 of Peru's 27 million people, mostly in remote regions.
</P>
<P>
For years, Yanacocha has provoked resentment among the area's 140,000
inhabitants, in part because it hired only about 1,260 of them.
</P>
<P>
For many like de la Cruz, who ekes out a living raising a few head of
cattle and growing potatoes and carrots, Yanacocha represents only
the downside of boomtown economics: a higher cost of living and
increased crime and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
But water is the most explosive issue for farmers, who accuse
Yanacocha of contaminating and drying up water sources that irrigate
crops and sustain dairy production. They claim some waters downstream
from the mine are now putrid, and that the company has refused to
reopen one diverted irrigation canal, leaving 160 families dry.
</P>
<P>
Community relations were also greatly damaged in June 2000 when a
mine contractor spilled 335 pounds (150 kilograms) of mercury in a
small town south of Cajamarca, sickening 1,100 people whose damage
claims are now in U.S. courts. Yanacocha spent US$14 million
(euro11.3 million) cleaning up the spill.
</P>
<P>
"The frogs, ducks and trout we used to have in the Rio Grande are
gone," said Segundo Briones, a community leader, referring to one of
three rivers that drop down from the mining operations. "We won't be
fooled anymore."
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Yanacocha has operated an open pit mine on a plateau
about 13,000 feet (3,940 meters) above sea level, nine miles (15
kilometers) from Cajamarca, a small Spanish colonial city 350 miles
(560 kilometers) north of Lima. The company uses cyanide and massive
amounts of water to extract gold from ore piled on impermeable
barriers designed to prevent toxins from seeping into the ground.
</P>
<P>
Yanacocha blames water scarcity on drought and points to the study
that was commissioned by the World Bank and completed last year by
Colorado-based Stratus Consulting Inc. The 20-month study determined
the mine didn't cause water supplies to drop, and posed no "imminent
short-term danger of illness or death to people, livestock, or
crops."
</P>
<P>
It said the mine could be responsible for killing fish and other
water life, but added that the greatest health threat was from human
and animal waste.
</P>
<P>
Newmont, Yanacocha's owner, has global operations that make it one of
the world's biggest mining companies. Its spokesman, Doug Hock, said
Yanacocha underestimated water concerns but was eager to work more
closely with the community on the new water study.
</P>
<P>
He said Yanacocha, which yielded just under 3 million ounces (84
million grams) of gold last year, paid about US$140 million
(euro112.8 million) in Peruvian income tax, of which half goes to
Cajamarca's government.
</P>
<P>
In the last 11 years, Yanacocha independently financed the
construction of 35 schools, built miles (kilometers) of road and
brought electricity and drinking water to remote communities, Hock
said, adding the company has poured tens of millions of dollars into
Cajamarca's economy through local suppliers to the mine.
</P>
<P>
Still, Antonio Brack, a leading Peruvian ecologist, blames Yanacocha
and the government in distant Lima, which he says gives short shrift
to the region's traditions and water needs and thinks of its people
as "poor peasants, period."
