Wanted, Dead: Exotic frog that has invaded Florida and was found in
Georgia for the first time
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The small frogs that croaked in Diane Butler's backyard pond had been
silenced and her goldfish were disappearing. But she had bagged the
culprit, and stashed the body in her freezer.
</P>
<P>
Butler's capture of a 4.5-inch (11-centimeter) Cuban tree frog in
coastal Savannah has caused a nervous stir among wildlife biologists
in Georgia and Florida.
</P>
<P>
The exotic amphibian invaded the Florida Keys nearly 80 years ago and
slowly spread throughout the state, devouring native frogs and
insects in its path. But Butler's catch marks the first time the
species has been documented farther north in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
That's bad news if the Cuban frogs, known to hitchhike to new homes
in shipments of potted plants, are breeding in Georgia, biologists
say. Previously, the northern boundary for U.S. populations was
believed to be Jacksonville, Florida _ 120 miles (190 kilometers)
south of Savannah.
</P>
<P>
"Because Savannah's on the coast, where the temperature's more
moderate, oh boy, that's where I get worried," said Steve Johnson, a
University of Florida ecologist who tracks the spread of Cuban tree
frogs. "They could be anywhere between there and Jacksonville."
</P>
<P>
Growing up to 5.5 inches (14 centimeters) long, large enough to fill
a grown man's hand, it is the largest tree frog in North America.
Because of its size and warty skin, it could be mistaken for a toad
if not for its large, padded toes.
</P>
<P>
Since its discovery in Key West, Florida, in the 1920s, the Caribbean
frog has been considered an unwanted predator that disrupts
ecosystems by dining on native species _ including smaller tree
frogs.
</P>
<P>
"They're (a) huge relative to our native frogs," said John Jensen,
Georgia's state herpetologist with the Department of Natural
Resources. "Like pretty much all frogs, they eat anything they can
catch and fit in their mouths."
</P>
<P>
Butler, an office assistant at an advertising firm, believes the
Cuban frog in her yard feasted on her pond frogs and goldfish before
she caught it Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
Her husband had noticed the frog weeks earlier outside their porch
door, telling her it resembled "one of those weird African frogs."
Butler snapped a photo of it and searched the Internet trying to
identify it.
</P>
<P>
Butler found a similar picture of a Cuban tree frog online and
notified the U.S. Geological Society. Soon afterward, she got a phone
call from Johnson, who wanted to see her photo immediately.
</P>
<P>
She had some qualms complying with Johnson's second request _ catch
the frog, euthanize it in her freezer and send it to the university
after preserving it in alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Jensen wants to determine if Butler's frog was a lone hitchhiker or
if others are breeding here.
</P>
<P>
"If people encounter them, they can kill them and send us the actual
animal or they can take photos," Jensen said. "But we definitely
encourage folks to kill the animals if they find them."
