Now facilitated by the small stairways in the washboard design,
entrapped frogs can get out of the ditches easily. There are also
passages beneath the ditches for them to cross from one plot to
another.

A comparative study shows the devices help preserve 32 more frogs per
mu on average. "And we now have decreased the use of pesticide by
half, which used to be 100 yuan per mu every year," says Xu Jingqi, a
local farmer in his late 40s, attributing less insects to the
presence of more insect-eating frogs.

The "frog freeway" device has been extended to other consolidation
projects in Yiwu, says Jia Huamin.

"And many villages are applying for land consolidation projects
eagerly." Jeffrey Soule, policy director of the American Planning
Association and UNDP advisor on China's land consolidation, is more
interested in the project at Zoumadi Town in Quanzhou City, Fujian
Province, for its "comprehensive and diversified agriculture
production and management strategy."

The coastal city has opened numerous granite mines, leaving many
hilly slopes bare, says Qiu Genghua, head of the city's Bureau of
Land and Resources. While using natural silting to reclaim land from
the sea over the years, the bureau is trying to restore vegetation on
a total of 1.45 million square meters of naked hill slopes after
mining at 187 spots.

Although there is room to be desired in implementation, Soule, who
has been to seven of the 13 UNDP sites in China, says "all the
projects offer benefits to local people" in one way or another.

While different areas may have different concerns, farmers' revenues
from the land have obviously increased, and people are more conscious
of environmental sustainability.

Prof. Wu Cifang of Zhejiang University calls the land consolidation
efforts "a good governance project" of the Chinese government. "No
single farm holder can afford the cost of up to 2, 500 yuan per mu
(301 U.S. dollars) to consolidate the land," he says. "It has indeed
made farmers happy."
