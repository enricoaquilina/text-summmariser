ONE-THIRD OF AMPHIBIAN SPECIES CALLED THREATENED
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first vertebrate species to begin hopping and crawling on land
350 million years ago may be the first to die out, according to a
study released Thursday that found a third of all amphibian species
worldwide are threatened with extinction.
</P>
<P>
Isolated reports of silent forests and empty streams began to
circulate about three decades ago, but the latest assessment is the
first to provide a complete snapshot of a global decline in the
diversity of frogs, salamanders, newts, and worm-like caecilians, and
to show that they are at greater risk than both birds and mammals.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say the survey is bad news for humans, too. Amphibians'
permeable skin and dual existence on land and in water make them
"canaries in the coal mine," early indicators that pollution, climate
change, and overall degradation of the environment may eventually
threaten human life, according to zoologists.
</P>
<P>
"Amphibians have a moist, wet, rather delicate skin. They absorb
things from their environment and can lose water very quickly through
their skin," said Geoffrey Hammerson, a research zoologist who
contributed to the report. "They're good red flags for us to watch."
</P>
<P>
The survey, published online by the journal Science, studied the
5,743 known amphibian species and found that at least 1,856 of them
face extinction, more than 100 species may already be extinct, and 43
percent are in a population decline -- many for unknown reasons.
</P>
<P>
"I've lived a decline," said coauthor Bruce Young, an international
zoologist of the environmental organization NatureServe who lives in
Costa Rica. "I first came here in 1987 and then you could walk up a
stream during the day, there were these beautiful frogs mottled
yellow and black that were on almost every boulder as you walked. At
night you would hear several, many different kinds of frogs calling.
You'd walk in the forest during the day and frogs would just sort of
hop out under your feet."
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, the stream is empty. The nights are quiet.
</P>
<P>
The study, a three-year collaborative effort between 500 zoologists,
biologists, and wildlife specialists around the world, was organized
by three wildlife organizations: NatureServe, Conservation
International, and the International Union for the Conservation of
Nature. They compiled a database containing the results of thousands
of studies that monitored the populations of individual species in
particular regions.
</P>
<P>
They determined that 32.5 percent of amphibian species were
threatened with extinction, compared with 12 percent of birds and 23
percent of mammals.
</P>
<P>
"They've established very convincingly that global declines are true
and are far worse than anyone imagined," said James Hanken, director
of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology.
</P>
<P>
The authors attributed some of the declines, which have occurred
mainly in tropical areas, to habitat loss or to humans collecting
animals for food, medicine, or pets.
</P>
<P>
But nearly half of the rapidly declining species are suffering
because of unexplained causes, and could begin to die by the hundreds
over the next decades if nothing is done, the report said. The
mysterious declines are even happening in pristine, well-protected
areas.
</P>
<P>
Scientists suspect a variety of factors, including the spread of a
deadly fungus that may have originated in Africa, global climate
change, or a combination.
</P>
<P>
Ultraviolet light also has been shown to weaken the immune responses
of amphibian embryos in studies; a thinning ozone layer could let in
more potentially damaging light, sickening animals.
</P>
<P>
The spread of the deadly chytrid fungus is poorly understood. The
fungus apparently began spreading in the 1970s, because museum
specimens captured earlier than then are free of it, said Young. He
speculated that the fungus could have been spread by trade in pets
and wild animals, or South African clawed frogs could have spread the
fungus when they were used widely in the 1960s for human pregnancy
tests.
</P>
<P>
"It starts us thinking that we should be paying attention to these
because parallel things could happen in humans," Hammerson said.
</P>
<P>
Even in New England, where native amphibian species aren't
endangered, local declines are common. The Massachusetts endangered
species list includes five of the 10 kinds of salamander that live in
the state -- mostly because of fragmented habitat.
</P>
<P>
New England's frogs and salamanders depend on vernal pools, shallow
ponds that dry up each summer, to lay their eggs free from the threat
of hungry fish. Such wetland areas are often filled in during
development or cut off by highways and housing complexes from the
forests where adult amphibians live.
