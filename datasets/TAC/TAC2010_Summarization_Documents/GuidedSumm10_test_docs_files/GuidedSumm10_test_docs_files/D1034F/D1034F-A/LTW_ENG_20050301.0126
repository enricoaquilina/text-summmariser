More Hermaphrodite Frogs Found in Years When DDT Was Used
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists who compared frogs collected over the past 150 years
have discovered a dramatic increase in hermaphrodites during the times
when contamination from the pesticide DDT and other organochlorine
chemicals was widespread.
</P>
<P>
Frogs with both male and female reproductive organs were rare in
the 19th century and early 20th century but abundant during the 1950s,
when the largest volumes of the popular chemicals were used.
</P>
<P>
The findings, reported Tuesday in the journal Environmental Health
Perspectives, adds to the growing evidence that a variety of
pesticides and industrial chemicals can alter the sex hormones of
animals.
</P>
<P>
The ability of chemicals to mimic or block estrogen and
testosterone, which are critical for normal sexuality and
reproduction, is considered one of the most disturbing discoveries in
environmental science of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that the phenomenon has been occurring for
decades but wasn't documented in wildlife until the early 1990s, when
it was observed first in Florida alligators and then many other
species.
</P>
<P>
Toxicologists and veterinarians at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, led by Amy Reeder, examined the reproductive organs
of 814 cricket frogs collected in Illinois between 1852 and 2001 and
stored at natural history museums.
</P>
<P>
Studying endocrine disruption of animals dating back over a century
is novel.
</P>
<P>
Cricket frogs, once abundant, declined dramatically around Chicago
and other regions in the 1960s, and the scientists found that the
times and places with high rates of hermaphrodites, also called
intersexes, overlapped with when and where the frogs disappeared in
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
The scientists theorize that DDT, industrial compounds called PCBs,
and other contaminants had an anti-estrogenic effect, reducing the
proportion of females and causing them to develop skewed sex organs,
triggering a population crash, particularly in the Chicago region.
</P>
<P>
Frogs and other amphibians have been vanishing worldwide over the
past few decades.
</P>
<P>
``These guys have been around a long time, since before the
dinosaurs, and they are declining all over the place,'' said Val
Beasley, a co-author of the study and a professor of ecotoxicology at
the university's College of Veterinary Medicine. ``Endocrine
disruptors seem to be a factor, but certainly not the only factor.''
</P>
<P>
Frogs are considered a key sentinel for effects of environmental
degradation because they undergo a vulnerable time of metamorphosis
and spend most of their time in water, where pollutants accumulate.
Environmental Health Perspectives science editor Jim Burkhart said
frogs ``may show the effects of ecological change more quickly or more
obviously than other species.''
</P>
<P>
The new study has limitations. The team did not measure individual
animals for contaminants because archived samples cannot be reliably
tested. As a result, there could be other explanations for the
hermaphrodites, such as factory and vehicle emissions or other
environmental changes. Also, the scientists could not compare frogs
from the same lakes or ponds over time.
</P>
<P>
The highest rates of intersex animals were found in frogs collected
from 1946 through 1959, when large volumes of DDT were used for
mosquito control in Illinois. The area around Chicago had four times
more intersex frogs than southern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
Between 1852 and 1929, one intersex frog was found in the 84
collected. Then, beginning in the 1930s, the intersex rate increased.
Between 1946 and 1959, 17 out of 153, or 11 percent, were intersex.
</P>
<P>
Recent rates of hermaphrodites were the lowest of any period
studied except for 1852-1929. Out of 339 collected from 1980 through
1996, there were nine intersex frogs, or less than 3 percent. DDT and
PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) were banned in the 1970s in the
United States and although they remain in the environment, levels are
low now in most areas.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the scientists reported, ``we cannot conclude that
the era of endocrine disruption in cricket frogs has come to an end.''
The severity of the current problem is unknown, Beasley said,
``because you can't collect where the intersex rate was high. There
aren't any frogs left in those areas to collect.'' Also, males still
outnumber females, while it was the opposite before 1930.
</P>
<P>
Atrazine, a herbicide widely used today on corn, might also
contribute to the sexuality problems and decline of the frogs, the
report says. Beasley said the intersex rate in central Illinois, where
atrazine is used, is twice as high as in the southern areas, where
atrazine use is low.
