WASHINGTON, Oct 15 (AFP)
</DATELINE>

<P>
About one third of amphibians are under threat of extinction,
according to researchers who carried out a global census.
</P>
<P>
Climate changes and pollution have been blamed for some of the
disappearing species, according to the study published by Science
magazine Friday.
</P>
<P>
But some are threatened for no apparent reason, according to
researchers who carried out the three year Global Amphibian
Assessment.
</P>
<P>
Of the 5,743 known species of toads, frogs, salamanders, newts and
worm like amphibians, 1,856 (32.5 percent) are under threat,
according to the work by 500 researchers in 60 countries.
</P>
<P>
The study was organised by the World Conservation Union, Conservation
International and NatureServe.
</P>
<P>
Among the species, 122 have completely disappeared since 1980 and
scientists fear that hundreds more will become extinct in coming
decades.
</P>
<P>
Tropical zones in central and South America have been worst hit,
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The researchers called for efforts to protect the habitat of
amphibians and to reproduce the threatened species in captivity.
