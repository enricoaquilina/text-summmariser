Amphibians Are Disappearing at Alarming Rate, Study Finds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost 150 species of amphibians have apparently gone extinct and
at least one-third of the rest are facing imminent threats that could
soon wipe them out, according to a worldwide assessment by scientists
published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The severity of the global threat to thousands of species of frogs,
salamanders and other amphibians makes them perhaps the most
endangered class of animals on Earth, with their rapid decline
outpacing that of mammals and birds.
</P>
<P>
David B. Wake of the University of California-Berkeley's Museum of
Vertebrate Zoology, one of the world's leading amphibian experts,
called the prospects for their survival ``very grim.''
</P>
<P>
``These are simply stunning results,'' Wake said of the report,
published in the online version of the journal Science. ``Nearly
one-third of all the species are in the three top categories of
endangerment, and nearly half the declines for unknown causes.''
</P>
<P>
For two decades, scientists have been trying to figure out why
amphibian populations worldwide are vanishing. Studies have documented
an array of threats, varying from place to place, including infectious
disease, destruction of freshwater and rainforest habitats,
introduction of non-native predators such as trout, pesticides,
parasites, global climate change and the thinning ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
The findings of more than 500 scientists were included in the
first-ever global amphibian assessment, a three-year effort by
researchers with IUCN-The World Conservation Union, the Center for
Applied Biodiversity Science of Conservation International and
NatureServe.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say amphibians serve as sentinels for environmental
problems that might be jeopardizing entire ecosystems. They spend much
of their lives in water and breathe through permeable skin, which
leaves them vulnerable to pesticides and changes in climate and water
quality.
</P>
<P>
``Amphibians are one of nature's best indicators of overall
environmental health,'' said Russell A. Mittermeier, president of
Conservation International. ``Their catastrophic decline serves as a
warning that we are in a period of significant environmental
degradation.''
</P>
<P>
The report evaluated the status of all known species of amphibians
-- 5,743 of them -- and concluded that 1,856, or 32 percent, were
critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable to extinction.
</P>
<P>
Too little is known about 1,300 of the species to determine their
status, but scientists believe that most of them are in peril, too.
That means as many as 55 percent of all known amphibians, more than
3,000, could be on the verge of extinction, plus scores of species
that have yet to be identified. Only 359 are considered not
threatened.

In the United States, 21 percent of known species are threatened or
extinct. California has more threatened amphibians than any other
state, according to Conservation International, accounting for 13 of
the nation's 54. Many are in the higher elevations of the Sierra
Nevada, including Yosemite National Park.

``Amphibians are indeed telling us that our planet is being harmed
right where you and I live,'' said Andrew Blaustein, director of the
Graduate Program in Environmental Sciences at Oregon State University.
</P>
<P>
Nine of 34 known amphibian extinctions have occurred since 1980 --
the onset of what is considered an age of accelerated, unnatural
extinction driven by human activities. An additional 113 species have
not been seen recently in the wild and probably are extinct, according
to the report's lead author, Simon Stuart. Evolutionary biologists say
species naturally disappear at a much slower pace.
</P>
<P>
Amphibians have inhabited Earth in their modern form for at least
150 million years, surviving the mass extinctions of the dinosaur age
virtually unscathed.
</P>
<P>
``The fact that this tough survival group is checking out on our
watch should concern us all,'' said Wake, whose research focuses on
the evolution and decline of salamanders. ``The fate of every species
is extinction, but they have a chance to give rise to other species
before they go extinct. These species are going extinct in a blink --
not even a blink in geological time.''
</P>
<P>
Scientists say the rate of extinction is so rapid that the report
probably underestimates the numbers threatened. Perhaps hundreds of
varieties of frogs and salamanders are being wiped out before they are
even discovered, Wake said. For example, more than 90 percent of Sri
Lanka's rainforest is gone and the fragment that is left ``is
literally filled with undescribed species,'' he said. ``Who knows what
we have lost?''
</P>
<P>
Similar evaluations of birds and mammals found smaller percentages
at risk -- 23 percent for mammals and 12 percent for birds.
