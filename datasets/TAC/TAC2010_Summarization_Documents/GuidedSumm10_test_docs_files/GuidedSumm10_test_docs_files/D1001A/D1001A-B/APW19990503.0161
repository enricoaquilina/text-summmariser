<HEADLINE>  Man Arrested In Colo. Shooting Case </HEADLINE>

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A 22-year-old man was arrested Monday on  
suspicion of supplying the Columbine High School gunmen with a 
semiautomatic handgun, one of four weapons used in their rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest came on the same day Columbine students returned to  
classes at another school, nearly two weeks after the massacre that 
left 15 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Manes of Littleton was booked for investigation of  
providing a handgun to a minor, a charge that carries a maximum six 
years in prison. He was released on bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they do not know if Manes knew what the gun would be  
used for, but an attorney for Manes said his client knew nothing of 
the impending massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was horrified when it happened,'' attorney Robert Ransome  
said. ``I would like to say he has followed the path of integrity 
from the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manes, who once attended Columbine, was the first person since  
the April 20 shootings to be arrested on charges of helping Eric 
Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, arm themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other arrest in the case is that of a man accused of  
lying about the two teens having bought possible bomb supplies at a 
hardware store. Police are still trying to determine if others had 
a hand in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've always, from day one, had a feeling that there had to  
be some people who had some knowledge or helped them plan or build 
some of these bombs,'' Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis said. ``I think they're still leaning that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said an employee at the pizza parlor where Harris  
and Klebold worked put the two teen-agers in touch with Manes and a 
TEC DC-9 semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the last person who had it before it was supplied to  
one of our gunmen,'' said Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear which gunman obtained the weapon or  
when, Davis said, or whether it was sold, traded or given to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes' first court hearing was scheduled for May 10.  
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students returned to classes at Chatfield High School  
on Monday. But administrators decided it would be best if friends 
of Harris and Klebold were taught at home for the rest of the year. 
The parents agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Primarily, for their well-being, and because it's a very  
uncomfortable and difficult time for everyone involved,'' said Rick 
Kaufman, a spokesman for the school district. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaufman declined to say how many students were affected,  
although Davis put the number at eight to 10. He said he did not 
know whether they were associated with the gunmen's clique known as 
the Trenchcoat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators also have banned trench coats at every school in  
Jefferson County, which has 89,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Students at Chatfield, which has a sports rivalry with  
Columbine, went out of their way to welcome the 1,900 Columbine 
students. The Chatfield students tacked up banners in hallways and 
outside the school and distributed ribbons that blended their 
school's burgundy with Columbine's navy blue. 
</P>
<P>
	They also handed out T-shirts that bore a ``C,'' with clasped  
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can do anything to help them, we're happy to do it,''  
said Amber Mancuso, 17, a Chatfield junior. ``I think it's hit all 
of us hard, all of us have friends there. When we found out, 
probably half the school was crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uniformed sheriff's deputies, police officers and five guards  
patrolled the school grounds, and students had to show 
identification before filing into Chatfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be nice to see the other kids and get back in  
the classroom, not necessarily to learn, but to see people and get 
back into the routine of things,'' said senior Nathan Montgomery, 
19. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Columbine students were apprehensive about returning to  
classes while their own school remained a massive crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really nervous about it,'' said sophomore Krysti DeHoff,  
16. ``I don't really want to go back because I keep feeling like 
something's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold killed 12 schoolmates and a teacher before  
they killed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have said that Robyn Anderson, Klebold's girlfriend,  
purchased the other three weapons used, two rifles and a shotgun 
and has been interviewed as a witness. Under Colorado law, an 
18-year old without a felony record can furnish minors with rifles 
and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson has made no public comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Five of the 23 students who were wounded at Columbine remained  
hospitalized Monday, two in serious condition and three in fair 
condition.
