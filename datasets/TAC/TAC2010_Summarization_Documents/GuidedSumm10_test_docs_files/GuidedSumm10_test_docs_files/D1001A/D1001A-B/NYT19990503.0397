   LITTLETON, Colo. _ In October, they came together for the
homecoming football game, and Columbine High School won. In April,
they came together for the funerals, and Columbine lost, so much,
so many.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Columbine and Chatfield senior high schools came
together yet again, neither as rivals nor as mourners, but as
partners in helping Columbine students to reclaim their lives as
normal teenagers for whom school is a place to learn, not to flee.
</P>
<P>
   With donated books and supplies _ their own backpacks were left
behind in the mad dash from the school _ most of the 1,960
Columbine students returned to classes 13 days after the massacre.
Attendance was 94 percent, school officials said, slightly above
normal.
</P>
<P>
   They came to Chatfield, nestled in the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains and just four miles from Columbine, because their school
remains a cordoned-off crime scene with bullet-pocked walls, broken
windows, and the ghosts of their innocence. It will not reopen
until September at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Once the students made it through a heavy ring of security, they
were greeted by Chatfield not as survivors of a slaughter or
crosstown competitors, but as friends and neighbors in this Denver
suburb of 35,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   A huge banner, ``Welcome Columbine,'' hung from the school
entrance. Another banner used the two schools' colors _ blue and
burgundy _ to form a heart, under which was written, ``We are
one.'' It was a change from their traditional bleacher chants of
``We are Columbine'' versus ``We are Chatfield.'' Inside, they were
still Columbine Rebels, and their hosts were still Chatfield
Chargers, but that seemed irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter that we're going to Chatfield. What matters
is that we're all going to be together, and we're all going to get
back to normal,'' said Sean Corkery, 16, a sophomore. His freshman
typing teacher, William ``Dave'' Sanders, was the only adult
killed. Fourteen students died, including the two gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Havilane, 16, a junior, said she wished she was
returning to Columbine, but was looking forward to being back in
school. ``I don't think we're ever going to be done mourning, but
everyone needs to smile the same amount as they cry,'' said
Havilane, who ran from the cafeteria when the shootings began.
</P>
<P>
   On her way home, senior Mandy Dugan, 18, said the day was
``really uplifting, not like the crying of all the memorials and
the funerals. We spent a lot of time clapping for our teachers and
thanking them.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all Columbine students were as welcome as others. School
officials said they called eight to 10 ``friends and
acquaintances'' of gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold and asked
if they would prefer not to attend Chatfield. School department
spokesman Rick Kaufman said several declined the offer and came to
Chatfield, while others accepted home tutoring or other
``alternative'' educational options. He would not identify the
students.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said the offer was made ``in the best interests of those
students as well as other students.'' He said the list was drawn up
in consultation with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department.
Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said those students were considered
witnesses, not suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said school officials also informed all Columbine
students that trench coats were banned from school property.
Klebold and Harris were members of a group of outcasts known as the
``Trench Coat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   The preferred dress code was a white T-shirt with blue and
burgundy hands clasped together in celebration of the schools'
unification. Students also received heart-shaped lapel ribbons, in
burgundy intertwined with blue, to honor the murder victims and 23
wounded students, five of whom remained hospitalized. The Chatfield
neighborhood did its part as well, decorating trees, homes and
street signs with balloons, posters, flowers and ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate roughly 4,000 students in a school built for half
as many, Chatfield students will attend classes in the mornings,
and Columbine students will take their places from 12:50 p.m. to 6
p.m. The split shifts will only last a short time because school
ends May 27. Columbine's graduation will take place as scheduled
May 22.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors warned that some, perhaps many, Columbine students
will continue to suffer for months or years. Grades will drop,
anxieties will rise, behavior will change, nightmares will haunt,
and hearts will harden, they said. But at least outwardly,
Columbine students streaming into their temporary new school seemed
indistinguishable from Chatfield students who were leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's school day began with the ``National Anthem'' and a
one-hour assembly. Then there were ``debriefing'' sessions in which
students assembled in groups of six to discuss their feelings. Each
student was given two minutes; whenever a student chose not to
speak, there was a two-minute silence. Students then spent 15
minutes in each of their classes, mostly to get a sense of where
they were expected to be.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers said they planned to use that brief time to
continue the healing and restart the learning.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Samson, an advanced placement English teacher, said she
would give each of her 90 students a polished rock and a poem by
Charles Simic called ``Stone.'' Two lines of the poem read: ``So
perhaps it is not dark inside after all. Perhaps there is a moon
shining from somewhere, as though behind a hill _ just enough light
to make out the strange writing, the star charts on the inner
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to learn to focus and find stillness and get on with
what we have to do,'' said Samson, whose students included senior
Lauren Townsend, a candidate for valedictorian who was killed in
the rampage. ``I think it will be like trying to conduct a
symphony. We'll have to understand what all the different pieces
do, and then bring them together.''
</P>
<P>
   The school also set up several ``safe rooms'' where students and
teachers could seek time alone or a meeting with one of several
dozen counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said among the teachers in attendance Monday was Peggy
Nielsen, whose terror-struck voice was heard on a tape of a 911
telephone call made just before 10 students and the gunmen died in
the school library. She has declined to discuss her ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   On their way in and out of Chatfield's main entrance Monday,
Columbine students could not help but see a gray stone monument
placed by Chatfield parents. It was inscribed with a message: ``To
Columbine _ We open our doors so you may continue to learn. We open
our hearts so that together we may heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Chisled into the top corner of the stone was a delicate
blue-and-white flower. It was a columbine, a perennial that will
bloom again this month.
