	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pressured to help stop kids from killing,  
Congress is opening hearings on the causes of a ``crisis among our 
young'' amid a thorny political question of what government should 
do to prevent massacres like the one in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tragedy at Columbine High and the ongoing carnage on our  
inner city streets presents us with a complicated cultural moment 
and an important opportunity to thoroughly examine the root causes 
of a crisis among our young,'' House Judiciary Committee Chairman 
Henry Hyde told reporters on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde's committee will hold a wide-ranging hearing beginning May  
13 focusing on urban and suburban violence by kids. 
</P>
<P>
	The witness list was still in its infancy late Monday, but  
several people close to the committee said it could include 
individuals involved in the Columbine tragedy, survivors of other 
school shootings, entertainment industry executives and interest 
groups on both sides of the gun control debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde, who has supported gun control legislation, is committed to  
keeping the hearing from spiraling into a partisan shoot-out over 
gun policy, according to two officials close to the panel who asked 
not to be named. They acknowledged, however, that the discussion 
would have to touch on such issues as new firearms technology and 
whether access to guns should be further restricted. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Hyde's support of gun control legislation makes him no  
friend of the National Rifle Association, these officials would not 
rule out testimony by the group's president, actor Charlton Heston, 
or any other of the group's officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, the Commerce Committee on Tuesday opens a hearing  
on the marketing of violent material to children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate hearing was scheduled before the April 20 Columbine  
massacre.
