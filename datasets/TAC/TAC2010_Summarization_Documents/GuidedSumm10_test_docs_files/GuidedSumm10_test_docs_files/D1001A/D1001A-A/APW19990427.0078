<HEADLINE> Columbine Kids To Attend Chatfield </HEADLINE>

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The day that Columbine High School  
students are to return to class has been delayed because so many 
have been attending funerals for students killed in the April 20 
massacre, an administrator said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The students are scheduled to begin classes Monday at another  
school a few miles away in afternoon sessions until the end of the 
year, said Barbara Monseu, area administrator for the Jefferson 
County School District. 
</P>
<P>
	Students were originally scheduled to go back Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Calling the return to the classroom ``a very important next step  
in the process of healing,'' Monseu said the first thing Columbine 
students will do when they arrive at Chatfield High School is 
attend an assembly to reunite them with their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The teachers are very anxious to see their students again,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine and Chatfield are sports rivals, but junior John Danos  
said he welcomed the newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fine with it,'' he said. ``We're going to treat them  
normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To accommodate the 1,965 Columbine students, the school day is  
being split with Chatfield students beginning early in the day and 
Columbine students showing up shortly before 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	To prepare for the resumption of classes, some of Columbine's  
158 teachers met Tuesday morning for the first time since two 
student gunmen fatally shot 12 fellow students and a teacher before 
taking their own lives.
