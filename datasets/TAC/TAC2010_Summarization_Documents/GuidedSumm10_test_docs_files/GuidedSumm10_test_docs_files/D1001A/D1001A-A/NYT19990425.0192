   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Vice President Al Gore on Sunday bid farewell
to Columbine High School's dead, issuing a ringing challenge to
parents and schools before a crowd of 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us must change our lives to honor these children,''
said Gore, in a forceful speech filled with religious references
less than a mile from the site of the worst school killing in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering, held in a movie theater parking lot under
threatening skies, commemorated 12 students and one teacher killed
Tuesday when two gunmen burst into the Jefferson County school
wielding guns and bombs. Authorities believe Columbine students
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold carried out the massacre and then
killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Owens acted as master of ceremonies during the
75-minute memorial service that included speeches from Archbishop
Charles Chaput, and Franklin Graham, the son of evangelist Billy
Graham. Singers Amy Grant and Michael Smith joined a large bagpipe
band in providing music for the crowd, joining two Columbine
students who wrote a song in honor of their fallen classmates.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd were people who had driven hundreds of miles to pay
their respects. ``It's something that can help us personally by
coming and seeing and sharing the hurt and the pain. It's just
something that struck my heart,'' said Tim Weitzel, who with his
wife, Donna, drove from Grand Junction to attend the service.
</P>
<P>
   Owens extended his sympathy to the families of the slain and
wounded, some of whom gathered in front of the crowd, while the
archbishop told them that ``love is stronger than death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Confronted with an unimaginable evil, this community has grown
closer,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   The nation and the world have joined in grieving for the
students of Columbine, Gore said. He asked the crowd ``to feel the
embrace of hundreds of millions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the hidden truths of the human condition is that
suffering binds us together,'' Gore said. ``Here in Jefferson
County, the spring has yielded to the cold winter of the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore asked that the shootings serve as a wake-up call for
parents and schools. Decrying the violence and cruelty of pop
culture, Gore said parents must cushion their children against
hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a parent, your children need your attention,'' Gore
said. ``If you are a grandparent, they need your time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too easy for children to get guns, and schools must focus
on discipline in teaching character, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In his only comment that addressed the killers, Gore called for
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have the courage not to look away, either in life or
in death, from those who feel despised or hated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold, who authorities say planned the massacre for
more than a year, have been portrayed by classmates as outcasts
from the popular students at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects were not mentioned by name during the service,
although Chaput also asked they be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Graham praised the Columbine community for uniting under the
pain of a tragedy that could have torn it apart. He seized the
opportunity to chastise public schools for being empty of ``the
teachings of God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are indeed dangerous places,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Owens closed the memorial by reciting the names of the 12
students and one teacher killed and releasing a white dove for
each, as many in the crowd wept and light rain fell.
</P>
<P>
   It was a message of hope that was repeated throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love is stronger than death _ I believe that,'' Chaput said.
``Love is stronger than death.''
