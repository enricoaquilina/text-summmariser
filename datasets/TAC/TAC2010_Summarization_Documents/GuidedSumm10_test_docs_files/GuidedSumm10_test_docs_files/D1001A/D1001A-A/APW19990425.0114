<HEADLINE> Thousands Mourn Columbine Victims </HEADLINE>

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Comforting each other with ceremony and  
song, Columbine High School's mourners turned a strip-mall parking 
lot into an arena of grief and promised each other they would reach 
past their pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore brought the 70,000 heartbroken people a  
message Sunday: ``You are not alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators, spending the day at the memorial service, were to  
resume their work this morning, conducting more interviews and 
eyeing the possibility of additional suspects in Tuesday's 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 12 students slain, three were to be laid to rest today. A  
funeral also was scheduled for Dave Sanders, a popular teacher 
hailed as a hero for shepherding students to safety during the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's outdoor ceremony was a mass catharsis at the foot of  
the snow-capped Rockies. People hugged and wept as a parade of 
students, singers and public officials tried to make sense of the 
week's events. Many wore Columbine clothing; everything in sight -- 
even portable toilets -- was festooned with blue Columbine memorial 
ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Behind you, scarred but still standing, is Columbine High  
School,'' Gov. Bill Owens said. ``One thing is clear: This 
community will not be beaten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian singer Amy Grant began a tribute song to the victims  
with a gentle lament: ``So much pain and no reason why.'' Bagpipe 
players played ``Amazing Grace'' and four F-16 jets flew over in a 
``missing-man'' formation after 13 doves were released -- one for 
each victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Brothers Jonathan and Stephen Cohen sang a tribute they wrote.  
Jonathan Cohen, a junior, was trapped in the Columbine choir room 
when gunfire erupted. Stephen, a senior, was in the cafeteria where 
many students were shot or hit by shrapnel from pipe bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you still hear raging guns ending dreams of precious  
ones?'' they sang. ``In God's son, hope will come, his red stain 
will take our pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine Principal Frank DeAngelis called the gathering ``the  
end of a nightmare.'' Religious leaders urged trust in God. And 
Gore, thundering like a preacher at a revival, underscored that 
bloodshed like that allegedly caused by Dylan Klebold and Eric 
Harris must remain an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
	``The young killers of Columbine High School do not stand for  
the spirit of America,'' Gore said. ``America is a good and decent 
place, and our goodness is a light to all the nations of the 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pair, enraged by what they considered taunts and insults  
from classmates, allegedly rampaged through their school with guns 
and bombs before turning their weapons on themselves. 
Investigators, amazed at the sheer firepower, are trying to 
determine if others were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have found a diary plotting the mayhem in precise detail,  
as well as bomb-making materials and weapons in one of the pair's 
bedroom. More interviews were set for this week; more than 500 have 
already been conducted. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies suspended their investigation and media briefings for  
the day, concentrating on directing traffic for the shopping-center 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	At times, the service took on the flavor of a somber pep rally.  
Senior Amber Burgess, after eulogizing Sanders, urged the crowd to 
persevere and invoked school spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are!'' she yelled.  
</P>
<P>
	``Columbine!'' thousands replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Then the proceedings moved en masse to Clement Park, adjacent to  
Columbine and -- as long as the school remains cordoned off -- the 
mourning place of choice and site of a vast makeshift memorial. 
Hundreds lined the procession route. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always knew this school was very strong and this is a good  
community, and all the kids love each other. But to see the kids 
and the community come together was just amazing,'' said Scott 
Rathbun, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Foss, 18, grazed by a bullet while helping teachers and  
students hide in a closet and overhead air ducts, limped behind 
Gore and was supported by DeAngelis. Mourners applauded as they 
passed, and Littleton firefighters walked beside Foss, patting him 
on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	``God Bless you guys!'' a man shouted. ``You've got a reason to  
live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday evening, some 1,300 friends and family gathered at a  
church to remember Daniel Mauser, 15, and Kelly Fleming, 16. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a cross-country runner who had recently returned from a  
two-week trip to Paris with the French club; she was an aspiring 
songwriter and author eager to get her driver's license. The 
victims' families held the dual funeral because they belong to 
neighboring churches of the same Roman Catholic archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County school officials said Columbine's 1,800  
students would return to classes Thursday a few miles south at 
Chatfield High School, a school originally built to accommodate 
Columbine's overflow. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's graduation ceremony will be held May 22 at Fiddler's  
Green, a suburban amphitheater normally used for rock concerts -- 
one baby step toward normalcy -- and in defiance of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted death and destruction. Instead, we've all come  
together,'' said Phyllis Cain, whose daughter, Mickey, attends 
Columbine. ``They can't kill the message. They can't kill the 
hope.''
