	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Pat  
Buchanan says stricter gun laws could not have prevented the deadly 
school shootings in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is who has the weapons, the good people or those  
who are ugly and warped,'' he said. ``The problem began long before 
they walked into school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people, including the two killers, died Tuesday in a  
shooting and bombing spree at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``The massacre is a tragic reflection of the dark side of  
American society,'' Buchanan told reporters Wednesday. ``At 
Littleton, America got a glimpse of the last stop on that train to 
hell America boarded decades ago when we declared that God is dead 
and that each of us is his or her own god who can make up the rules 
as we go along.''
