	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They streamed in from all over --  
hand-lettered signs and cards and bouquets by the hundreds, aimed 
at comforting a town torn asunder. One good wish, soaked by the 
morning rain, was signed, simply, ``Your community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But what community was it from? So many forms of community,  
rippling outward from Columbine High and across the planet, have 
come together since last week's violence that it was difficult to 
tell. 
</P>
<P>
	In an age when so many Americans regularly lament the breakdown  
of community, the many communities that the Columbine massacre has 
produced are proving that the notion, at least in time of crisis, 
still thrives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jefferson County has 500,000 residents, but today our  
community is much larger,'' county commissioner Patricia Holloway 
said Sunday at a shopping-center parking lot service attended by 
70,000 people -- a hastily stitched-together community unto itself. 
</P>
<P>
	There are the communities that existed already, like Columbine  
students and Columbine Valley residents. There are myriad 
mini-communities created by the bloodshed: Denver-area students, 
their rivalries suddenly rendered irrelevant; emergency personnel, 
united in their harrowing experiences; towns like Jonesboro and 
Paducah and Springfield and Edinboro, who understand Columbine's 
anguish but never asked to be members of this kind of community. 
</P>
<P>
	The list continues onward, outward -- beyond metropolitan Denver,  
past President Clinton and his prayers, as far as the president of 
the West African nation of Ghana, who counted himself among the 
community of Littleton mourners and said ``something must be done 
to stop this thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The response is most visible in metropolitan Denver, radiating  
outward from the high school and adjacent Clement Park, which has 
become a mourner's Lourdes. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast-food restaurants are flying flags at half-staff and posting  
sympathy signs. Businesses are contributing goods and raising 
funds. Denver's newscasters have donned blue Columbine ribbons. 
Big-league sports teams canceled games in deference; Mile High 
Stadium now sports a giant Columbine ribbon visible from Interstate 
25. Hugs have become a greeting of choice -- even, sometimes, 
between strangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get so busy in our everyday lives and we're so  
self-sufficient that we think we don't need the help of our 
community,'' said Marny Danneberg, a volunteer dispensing hot 
drinks and food from a Red Cross truck near the high school since 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's when something like this happens that we realize the  
community's there for us,'' she said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	After the shootings, messages and contributions of support came  
in from across the nation, from towns and individuals that 
repeatedly reassured mourners that they were ``part of a larger 
community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Folks from Elgin, Ill., drove a giant banner of support into  
town. Kids by the busload came from towns across the West to share 
grief. In Seaside Heights, N.J., 1,800 miles away, Mayor P. Kenneth 
Kershey scheduled a candlelight vigil on an Atlantic Ocean beach as 
``a clear demonstration of the nationwide caring for the people of 
Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What unifies regions this way? A national culture, for one -- the  
very mass media that many blame for fomenting the violence. 
Instantaneous news delivery unites people in shock and grief, 
creating a virtual community of TV viewers and another of Internet 
users that didn't exist 40 years ago. Thus, people who don't know 
each other can mourn together. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire nation is a community of shock, of love and of  
grief,'' Vice President Al Gore said Sunday. ``One of the hidden 
truths of the human condition is that suffering binds us 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Littleton (literally ``Little Town''), an affluent town of  
35,000 at the foot of the Rockies, the fresh bonding of its 
existing communities and the birth of so many new ones are serving 
as salves for recuperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents say the area around Columbine in the Southern Platte  
River Valley has been a tight-knit community for 26 years, since 
the high school opened on an undeveloped patch of prairie and 
houses sprouted up around it. This was long before the retail 
sprawl unfurled from the north to connect Columbine to Denver and 
make the area a suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``A community formed around that high school, and the school  
grew as the community grew,'' said Gerry Difford, who opened 
Columbine in 1973 and was principal for its first two years. ``It 
has a sound community base to it that's somewhat unusual for a 
suburban high school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, though a few patches of open prairie remain, houses  
continue to sprout. And the families that have streamed into 
Denver's suburbs in recent years have, some say, created a populace 
unfamiliar with its neighbors -- one hungry for the coming-together 
that the Columbine deaths caused. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disaster brings out the best of us, not the worst. People may  
not know each other, but when disaster hits that doesn't matter. We 
knock on the neighbor's door and talk about it,'' says Robert R. 
Butterworth, a psychologist who studies both child trauma and how 
people cope with public tragedy. ``That sense of reaching out makes 
us feel better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That reaching out resonates nationally and globally as people  
sew together crisis bonds that wouldn't otherwise exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as the event recedes and coping begins, some are hoping  
that perhaps, this time, the unity allegedly caused by two angry 
boys' violent acts can last. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they would have known the revival they have started, they  
never would have done what they did,'' said Phyllis Cain, whose 
daughter, Mickey, attends Columbine. ``They wanted death and 
destruction. Instead, we've all come together.''
