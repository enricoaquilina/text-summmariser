<P>
Renegade tribesmen on Wednesday ended a blockade of a strategic road in
southwestern Pakistan where a gunbattle with security forces last month left
about 60 people dead, an official said.
</P>
<P>
In return, Pakistani security forces have started removing checkpoints they set
up around the tense town of Dera Bugti, where the clash occurred March 17, said
Col. Abdul Wahid, a spokesman for the Frontier Corps.
</P>
<P>
The conflict was linked to a tribal leader's demands for more revenues from
natural gas extracted from the region, about 300 kilometers (185 miles)
southeast of the city of Quetta, the capital of southwestern Baluchistan
province.
</P>
<P>
"The tribesmen have opened the main road and we are also removing extra
checkpoints," Wahid told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The stand-down follows recent negotiations between Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain,
head of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Q Party, and Nawab Akbar Bugti, head
of the local Bugti tribe and de facto ruler of Dera Bugti.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of troops were sent to the region after last month's clash, which was
ended with an uneasy cease-fire between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Tensions remained high with armed supporters of Akbar Bugti retaining control of
the road from Dera Bugti to Sui, site of Pakistan's main gas field. The blockade
made it difficult to supply a Frontier Corps base in Dera Bugti.
</P>
<P>
The region has been on edge since January, when authorities say armed tribesmen
attacked the gas facilities with rockets. At least eight people, including some
soldiers, were killed in the fighting, and gas supplies to other parts of the
country were briefly suspended.
</P>
<P>
The tribesmen were angered by the rape of a female doctor at the gas plant and
authorities' failure to arrest suspects _ amid allegations that army personnel
were involved in the assault. Tribesmen also oppose government plans to set up
new military garrisons in the region.
