Battle for gas revenues in Pakistan's poorest province fuels dangerous tribal rebellion
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
DERA BUGTI, Pakistan
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outside this tense desert town, tribesmen with guns sit in bunkers near the
roadside. Bullet casings from a recent bloody clash with security forces litter
the asphalt.
</P>
<P>
The tribe's charismatic chieftain, Nawab Akbar Bugti, has long dominated this
remote corner of southwestern Pakistan _ site of the country's richest gas
fields. Now the weak authority of the government is strained to the breaking
point.
</P>
<P>
Last week, an explosion of violence killed dozens of people, including eight
soldiers, risking another security crisis for President Gen. Pervez Musharraf _
whose armed forces already are deployed by the tens of thousands elsewhere to
counter al-Qaida and Taliban militants along the border with
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a delegation of 15 government and opposition lawmakers traveled to
restive Baluchistan province to try to defuse the tribal rebellion _ traveling a
road to Dera Bugti that has been off-limits to security forces for five
days.
</P>
<P>
Armed tribesmen stood sentinel on the craggy mountainside along the road, where
every few kilometers (miles) they had laid piles of rocks to block traffic. A
military truck with a shot-out windshield lay abandoned after an ambush during
the March 17 fighting.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Shujaat Zamir Dar, the Frontier Corps commander for Baluchistan,
claimed Bugti has a private army of 3,000 to 4,000 and is bent on perpetuating
his feudal-style dominance of the region. He also is blamed for a deadly rocket
attack on a nearby gas field in January that interrupted supplies across
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Nawab Akbar Bugti wants to maintain his personal rule" in the region, Dar told
visiting lawmakers. "There's no government ... The nazim (district mayor) is
ineffective. The government is Nawab Akbar Bugti."
</P>
<P>
Only by abandoning their armed escort could the lawmakers gain passage to
Bugti's high-walled redoubt in Dera Bugti.
</P>
<P>
The silver-bearded chieftain, who is about 80 and has led the Bugti tribe for
decades, accuses the central government of pillaging Baluchistan's natural
resources while locals live in poverty _ even though the country's main gas
field is only 60 kilomters (35 miles) away.
</P>
<P>
He described the gas as a "ripe apple not for our consumption."
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is after our Baluch national wealth. We don't get anything out of it,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Bugti is said to receive about US$1.7 million a year from the state gas company
in lease fees, and the province receives a portion of the gas profits in
royalties, though local leaders complain that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
Bugti accused security forces of provoking last week's fighting. He claimed
shelling in the town killed more than 60 locals, including 32 minority Hindus
and women and children. The Frontier Corps says it acted with restraint, but it
concedes that some civilians might have died.
</P>
<P>
Gaping holes in the roof of Bugti's sitting room and an open-sided pavilion _
where he says he was sitting when rockets rained down _ suggest he was targeted
during the 16-hour battle.
</P>
<P>
Rangy tribesmen with turbans and Kalashnikov rifles who crowd his compound
beckoned visitors down trash-strewn alleyways to view other damage. At a Hindu
temple, the floor was strewn with rubble and the sandals that panicked
worshippers left behind when they were caught in the firing.
</P>
<P>
The fighting subsided with a cease-fire that has held since Friday.
</P>
<P>
The chiefs of the Frontier Corps, who say they have 400 troops at a base in Dera
Bugti, sound in no mood for compromise.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, they made veiled threats of much stronger military action unless the
road to Dera Bugti was cleared of armed tribesmen.
</P>
<P>
Bugti now sits like "a wounded lion in his lair," said visiting lawmaker Sherry
Rehman, who pushed the government to organize the trip.
</P>
<P>
The chieftain has been ruthless over the years in maintaining his dominance of
the Bugtis and commands great loyalty among them _ although there is little sign
in the dirt-poor town that he has used his personal wealth to improve the lives
of its people.
</P>
<P>
He is protected by a tribal militia that could be badly outgunned if security
forces launched a major military operation. Some 6,000 Pakistani forces,
including the regular army, are in the region.
</P>
<P>
But by taking such a drastic step, the government could provoke a guerrilla war
in the forbidding, barren terrain _ revisiting the unrest of the 1970s, when a
tribal insurgency wracked the province.
</P>
<P>
"This standoff has no military solution," Rehman said.
</P>
<P>
Bugti has indicated he is willing to negotiate with former Prime Minister
Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, who heads a parliamentary committee charged with
making recommendations to address the grievances of people in
Baluchistan.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers said a solution will hinge less on constitutional issues and demands
for greater autonomy than on what financial concessions Bugti can squeeze from
the government.
