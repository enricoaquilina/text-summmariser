<P>
Three bombs in Pakistan's 
restive southwestern province of Baluchistan damaged a power line 
and a shop but caused no casualties, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A power pylon was toppled on Monday at Killi Kishungi in Naushki 
district, 130 kilometres (80 miles) southwest of Quetta, said 
electricity company spokesman Gibrael Khan.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of homes in the area were plunged into darkness, he 
said.
</P>
<P>
Another bomb ripped through the shutters of a steel workshop in 
Naushki, a local police official said.
</P>
<P>
The third bomb exploded near the regional office of the army-led 
Anti-Narcotics Force in the town of Turbat, 600 kilometers southwest 
of Quetta, but caused no damage, said local police official 
Habibullah.
</P>
<P>
Nobody claimed responsibility for the blasts. Officials have 
blamed nationalist tribesmen demanding autonomy and greater benefits 
from the region's natural resources for a string of revent bomb 
blasts and rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
Resource-rich but poverty-stricken Baluchistan has seen a rise 
in violence since January when rebels launched a deadly rocket 
barrage on a major gas plant in revenge for the rape of a female 
doctor there.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of troops moved into the province following the 
attack, which killed eight people.
