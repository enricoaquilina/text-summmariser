Armed tribesmen have surrounded some 300 paramilitary troops and government
officials at a base in a southwestern Pakistani town where fears of fresh
fighting between renegade tribesmen and troops have forced thousands of
residents to flee for safety, an official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The tribesmen have set up road blocks and dug trenches along roads into Dera
Bugti, a town of about 84,000 people which lies 300 kilometers (185 miles)
southeast of the Baluchistan provincial capital, Quetta, Baluchistan Gov. Awais
Ahmed Ghani said.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters were airlifting supplies to the troops to avoid traveling by road
and confrontation with the tribesmen, Ghani told reporters in
Quetta.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 government employees and their families escaped Saturday in
vehicles under paramilitary escort from Dera Bugti after a 16-hour battle in the
town last week. Ghani said up to 45 people, including eight soldiers, were
killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, about 3,000 people, mostly women and children of local Bugti
tribesmen, also left the town because they fear fresh fighting, said top
administrator Abdul Samad Lasi. He said they were camped in the open outside
Dera Bugti or sheltering with relatives in neighboring towns.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Dera Bugti is very tense. You can expect anything (to
happen)," Lasi told The Associated Press by satellite telephone from the
town.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's fighting in Dera Bugti _ about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from
Pakistan's main gas fields _ was an alarming escalation of a low-level tribal
rebellion in Baluchistan, the country's poorest province. A cease-fire has been
holding since early Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing intelligence information, Lasi said about 5,000 armed Bugti tribesmen
have taken up position on mountains near the town, and that the paramilitary
Frontier Corps was ranged against them.
</P>
<P>
"If they (the Bugti tribesmen) make any move, if they open fire or attack, the
government will give full response," he said.
</P>
<P>
Army spokesman Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan said additional army troops have been
sent to the gas fields at Sui to strengthen security, but denied the army was
involved in an operation against the Bugti tribesmen.
</P>
<P>
Nawab Akbar Bugti, the chief of Bugti tribe in Dera Bugti, claimed that hundreds
of his armed supporters have taken up positions on mountains near the town and
they were ready to face the security forces.
</P>
<P>
"We have every right to defend ourselves," Bugti told AP by satellite telephone
from the town.
</P>
<P>
"The government wants to kill us. They want to defeat us. They want to loot our
resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Aftab Khan Sherpao told reporters in the capital, Islamabad,
that tribal fighters were digging in around Dera Bugti and destroying roads. He
described these as "serious developments," but maintained the government wanted
to resolve the situation through talks.
</P>
<P>
Tribesmen are demanding more returns from the natural gas extracted from their
territory and resent the army's moves to set up garrisons in the region. Attacks
against government targets are common in many parts of the province and have
grown in intensity this year.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary committee has been set up to examine the grievances of the
tribesmen in Baluchistan, which was roiled by insurgency in the 1970s, and make
recommendations to the government.
