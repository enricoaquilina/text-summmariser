QUETTA, Pakistan, March 18

<P>
Fierce gun battles between 
tribal rebels and Pakistani troops in the troubled southwestern 
province of Baluchistan have left up to 30 people dead and more than 
70 injured, an official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fighting lasted all day Thursday after the heavily-armed 
clansmen, who want more autonomy and increased benefits from the 
area's natural resources, ambushed a convoy of paramilitary Frontier 
Corps soldiers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, railway officials said a bomb hidden in a toilet 
tore through a carriage on a passenger train heading towards the 
provincial capital Quetta, killing one person and injuring five.
</P>
<P>
The province has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for 
more than a year but the violence surged after the January rape of a 
32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui in 
Baluchistan.
</P>
<P>
"According to our assessment, based on reports from security 
officials in the area, up to 30 people died and more than 70 
injured," a home ministry official told AFP on condition of 
anonymity following the clashes.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear if the toll included the figure of eight soldiers 
killed and 23 injured given by officials earlier for the violence at 
Dera Bugti, southeast of Quetta.
</P>
<P>
A ceasefire was agreed late Thursday to remove the dead and 
wounded.
</P>
<P>
"The casualties were high because the exchange of rockets and 
mortar shells continued from both sides throughout the day on 
Thursday," the home ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
The government has dismissed the tribesmen's claims that up to 
50 people on their side alone were killed as "exaggerated".
</P>
<P>
"The ceasefire is still holding," head of the Interior 
Ministry's National Crisis Management Cell, Brigadier Javed Cheema, 
told AFP on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the attack, which he blamed on the area's dominant 
Bugti tribe, was "totally unprovoked and blatant aggression".
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao said tribesmen used light and 
heavy weapons and rained more than 150 rockets and mortar shells on 
a nearby paramilitary base from 12 different directions.
</P>
<P>
Officials said regular army troops backed by two military 
helicopters had been sent to tackle the situation.
</P>
<P>
Authorities were also hunting the culprits behind the bombing of 
the Chiltan Express train heading from the eastern city of Lahore to 
Quetta, the latest in a series of attacks on the rail network in 
Baluchistan.
</P>
<P>
Ghulam Rasool, deputy controller of Pakistan railways, told AFP 
an explosive device was placed in a toilet and detonated at 2:00 pm 
(0900 GMT) as the train was stopped at Much, a town 70 kilometres 
(43 miles) southwest of Quetta.
</P>
<P>
A shadowy group called the Baluchistan Liberation Army has 
claimed responsibility for some of the earlier blasts targeting main 
railway lines in the province.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after a rocket 
barrage on the gas plant at Sui left eight people dead in January.
</P>
<P>
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising 
which was brutally put down by the government.
