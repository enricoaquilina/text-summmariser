Thousands of government workers and their families have evacuated a remote town
in southwestern Pakistan, a senior official said, amid fears of renewed fighting
between renegade tribesmen and security forces after clashes left at least 30
people dead.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Samad Lasi, a senior official at Dera Bugti, said they had received
reports from intelligence and security officials that more than 1,500 armed men
from the dominant local Bugti tribe had taken up positions in mountains outside
the town and were waiting for an order to attack government installations.
</P>
<P>
A security official, who requested anonymity, said that paramilitary
reinforcements were being sent to the region to support an already-strong troop
presence.
</P>
<P>
The government and tribal forces fought a 16-hour gunbattle in Dera Bugti on
Thursday that officials say left at least eight troops and 22 tribesmen dead.
Tribal representatives claim at least 50 of their people died. They agreed to a
cease-fire early Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lasi said government officials and their families starting leaving the town on
Saturday morning in vehicles escorted by paramilitary troops after receiving a
warning from the chief of the Bugti tribe, Nawab Akbar Bugti, that he could not
guarantee their safety.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he (Bugti) has asked all government official to leave Dera Bugti before 3
p.m. (1000 GMT) today, and they are leaving with their families," he told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview from the town.
</P>
<P>
Lasi said all 3,314 officials and their families would leave Dera Bugti, which
lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas fields and 300
kilometers (185 miles) southeast of the provincial capital, Quetta.
</P>
<P>
The tribesmen, who have demanded more revenues for natural resources extracted
from their territory, often launch attacks on government targets in restive
areas of Baluchistan, but violence has escalated this year and the army has
deployed thousands of soldiers and set up a garrison at the gas
fields.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary committee has been set up to examine the grievances of the
tribesmen in Baluchistan _ the biggest and poorest of Pakistan's four provinces
_ which was roiled by insurgency in the 1970s. The committee is expected to make
its recommendations to the government soon.
</P>
<P>
Bombs exploded on two trains in Baluchistan on Friday killing two people and
wounding eight. There was no claim of responsibility for the attacks, the latest
in a series of small explosions to hit the state-run rail network in the
province.
