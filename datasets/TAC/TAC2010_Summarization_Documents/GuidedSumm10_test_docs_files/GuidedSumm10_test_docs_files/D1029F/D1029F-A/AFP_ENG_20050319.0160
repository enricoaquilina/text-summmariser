QUETTA, Pakistan, March 19

<P>
Hundreds of people fled their 
homes in a remote southwest Pakistan town Saturday fearing renewed 
clashes after a rebel tribal chief warned them to take care of their 
safety, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Raziq Bugti, spokesman for the provincial government of 
Baluchistan, said the exodus was sparked in the town of Dera Bugti, 
245 kilometres southeast of Quetta after the chief told officials 
and paramilitary forces to leave.
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of government officials have left their homes with 
their families," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the tribal chief, Nawab Akbar Bugti, had also set a 
deadline of 3:00 pm (1000 GMT) Saturday for everyone to leave. There 
are no family ties between the tribal chief and the government 
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Security forces were on high-alert to deal with any untoward 
situation in the area where fierce gun battles between tribal rebels 
and Pakistani troops have killed at least 30 people and wounded more 
than 70.
</P>
<P>
Fighting lasted all day Thursday after the heavily-armed 
clansmen, who want more autonomy and increased benefits from the 
area's natural resources, ambushed a convoy of paramilitary Frontier 
Corps soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The whereabouts of Nawab Akbar Bugti was unknown, however, 
District administrator Abdul Samad Lasi said 90 percent the Dera 
Bugti population had left town.
</P>
<P>
Baluchistan has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for 
more than a year but the violence surged after the January rape of a 
32 year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after a rocket 
barrage on the gas plant at Sui left eight people dead in January.
</P>
<P>
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising 
which was brutally put down by the government.
