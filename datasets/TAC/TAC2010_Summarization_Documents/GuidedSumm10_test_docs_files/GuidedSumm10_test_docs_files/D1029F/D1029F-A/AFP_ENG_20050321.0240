<P>
Investigators suspect rebel 
tribesmen may have been involved in the weekend bombing of a 
religious shrine in Pakistan's restive southwest that killed 39 
people, police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police have largely ruled out sectarian rivalry and say 
Saturday's attack on the holy site may be linked to bloody clashes 
two days earlier between government forces and nationalist clans in 
the unruly province of Baluchistan.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed outrage after the bomb 
ripped through a crowd of devotees celebrating the anniversary of 
the death of a 19th century Sufi Muslim saint in the remote town of 
Fatahpur.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the blast.
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong possibility that the attack could be a 
reaction to the situation in Dera Bugti, because of the violence 
there," Baluchistan police chief Chaudhry Muhammad Yaqub told AFP. 
He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Dera Bugti, some 160 kilometres (99 miles) from the shrine, was 
the scene of fierce gunbattles on Thursday between troops and 
tribesmen, who are waging a revolt in a bid to win more royalties 
from the province's natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao has said that eight 
security personnel and 21 tribesmen including two Hindu minority 
members were killed in the battles, while 34 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
Yaqub said investigators had rejected the possibility of 
sectarian elements behind the attack on the shrine memorial as 
members of the rival Sunni and Shiite Muslims communities had 
visited it.
</P>
<P>
Up to 20,000 people had gathered at the shrine on Saturday 
evening, most of them from nearby towns and villages. Sufism is a 
semi-mystical strain of Islam that believes music, dance and song 
are ways of reaching God.
</P>
<P>
However Yaqub added that some Muslims resent people dancing and 
singing at shrines and a number of such people in the area were 
being quizzed. No arrests had been made, he said.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from Saturday's bomb blast remained at 39, Yaqub 
said, dismissing local media reports that more bodies had been 
discovered at the scene.
</P>
<P>
Annan condemned the attack "in the strongest terms", saying it 
appeared to have targeted civilians, the UN chief's spokesman Fred 
Eckhard said. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary general also called for restraint after the 
"brazen and cowardly act".
</P>
<P>
Police said Sunday they were also investigating whether the 
bombing had targeted the custodian of the shrine, Sadiq Ali Shah, 
who had been involved in a dispute with relatives and who last year 
survived an assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
Shah escaped unhurt.
</P>
<P>
However his brother Syed Kamil Shah poured cold water on the 
theory, saying the attack was part of a "terrorism wave" in the 
region.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year Baluchistan has been hit by 
frequent, low-level bombings aimed at government and military 
institutions as well as the railway network.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after eight people 
died in a rocket attack on Pakistan's largest gas plant at Sui, 
which the tribesmen said was sparked by the rape of a female doctor 
at the installation.
</P>
<P>
During the 1970s the government brutally put down a major 
nationalist uprising in Baluchistan, leading to long-lasting 
distrust and resentment on both sides.
