<P>
Four people were injured and 
a powerline and a government office damaged in three separate bomb 
blasts in southwestern Pakistan's restive Baluchistan province, 
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two blasts caused by home-made bombs rocked the remote town of 
Turbat, some 500 kilometres (310 miles) west of the provincial 
capital Quetta, late Saturday, Baluchistan home secretary Humayun 
Khan told AFP.
</P>
<P>
In one of the blasts, close to the wall of the irrigation 
department, four people were injured. The other blast, near a 
paramilitary camp, damaged a main power line, Khan said.
</P>
<P>
The third blast late Saturday was in the provincial capital 
Quetta. It broke the windows of Federal Investigation Agency office 
but there were no casualties, Khan said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the little-known Baloch Liberation Front, who 
identified himself as Colonel Doda, called the Quetta Press Club and 
claimed responsibility for two bomb blasts in Turbat.
</P>
<P>
Also late Saturday 39 devotees were killed and scores injured in 
a powerful bomb blast at the memorial of a Muslim Sufi saint in the 
remote town of Fatahpur, around 300 kilometres from Quetta.
</P>
<P>
Baluchistan has been gripped by a sporadic tribal revolt for 
more than a year but violence surged after the January rape of a 32 
year-old doctor at Pakistan's largest gas field at Sui.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of troops moved into Baluchistan after a rocket 
barrage on the gas plant left eight people dead in January.
</P>
<P>
During the 1970s Baluchistan was the scene of a major uprising 
which was brutally put down by the government.
