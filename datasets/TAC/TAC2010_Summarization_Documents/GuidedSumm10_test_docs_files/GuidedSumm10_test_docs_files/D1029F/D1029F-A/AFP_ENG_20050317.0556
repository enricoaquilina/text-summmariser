<P>
Tribal rebels attacked a 
paramilitary convoy in restive southwest Pakistan on Thursday, 
killing three soldiers and injuring seven others, a senior military 
officer said.
</P>
<P>
Gunbattles between the renegade clansmen and troops from 
Pakistan's Frontier Corps continued throughout the day after the 
attack in Baluchistan province, corps chief Major General Shujjat 
Zamir Dar told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He described the rebels' claims that up to 50 tribesmen had been 
killed in the exchange of fire as "exaggerated" but said there had 
been some casualties.
</P>
<P>
The clash erupted when a convoy of soldiers came under attack by 
armed men belonging to the Bugti tribe in the clan's stronghold of 
Dera Bugti, some 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of the 
provincial capital Quetta, he said.
</P>
<P>
Armed men blocked a six-vehicle corps convoy containing 40 
personnel that was moving towards the nearby gasfield town of Sui 
and opened fire.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic firing continued late Thursday despite a ceasefire 
agreed between the two sides to remove dead and wounded from the 
clash site.
</P>
<P>
The tribesman have been waging a months-long rebellion in a bid 
to win increased royalties and more jobs from the province's natural 
resources.
</P>
<P>
Earlier corps spokesman Colonel Rizwan Malik said the tribesmen 
used light and heavy weapons and also rained more than 150 rockets 
and mortar shells on a nearby military base.
</P>
<P>
He said regular army troops backed by two military helicopters 
had been sent to tackle the situation.
</P>
<P>
"The future line of action will be reciprocal and after today 
the other side should not consider paramilitary forces as weak," 
General Dar warned.
</P>
<P>
Violence in Baluchistan surged after the January 2 rape of a 
32-year-old doctor in her lodgings near Pakistan's largest gasfield 
in Sui.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of troops moved into the region after a rocket barrage 
on the gas plant left eight people dead in January.
