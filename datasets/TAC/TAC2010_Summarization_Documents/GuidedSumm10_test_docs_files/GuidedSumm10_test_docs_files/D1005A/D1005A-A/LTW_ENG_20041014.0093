How Far Should Stem Cell Research Go?

Do you know any kids who have diabetes? Living with the disease can
mean having to prick your finger to test your blood and getting
insulin shots to keep the disease from becoming even more serious.
</P>
<P>
Maybe you know an adult with Parkinson's disease, a brain disorder
that causes shakiness and stiffness, and makes it hard to walk --
symptoms that get worse over time. Actor Michael J. Fox, former boxer
Muhammad Ali and former attorney general Janet Reno are among the 1.5
million Americans with Parkinson's disease. Or maybe you know of
someone who can't walk because of an accident, such as ``Superman''
actor Christopher Reeve, who died this week.
</P>

Cures for these and other diseases, many scientists now believe,
could come from research into human embryonic stem cells. Embryos are
created when a male's sperm fertilizes a female's egg. The stem cells
in days-old embryos can develop into almost any kind of tissue --
brain, muscle, eyes -- leading to the hope that the cells could repair
injured organs and cure disease.
</P>
<P>
It's a bit like the ability kids have to learn a language more
easily than adults do. These embryonic cells can ``learn'' just about
any job they need to do, scientists think.
</P>
<P>
If they morphed into cells that make insulin, they could cure
diabetes. They might replace muscle injured in a heart attack or
regrow nerves damaged by accidents. Many hope they will lead to a cure
for Alzheimer's disease, which can cause an older person to become
confused and lose his memory. (That breakthrough is not likely to come
soon, scientists say, since Alzheimer's involves the loss of many
kinds of brain cells.)

What do stem cells have to do with the election? There's a big
debate over whether research on them is a good idea and whether the
government should pay for it. The debate centers on whether the
embryos used in stem cell research are human beings.
</P>
<P>
Normally, an embryo grows into a baby in its mother's womb. In
doing their research, scientists take a few stem cells from very young
embryos and grow them into colonies, called stem cell ``lines.'' The
process destroys the embryo.
</P>
<P>
Some people, including some religious groups, say embryonic stem
cell research should be banned because it ends a human life. They say
it's not up to scientists or the government to decide which life is
more important: the embryo or the patients who could be helped.
</P>
<P>
Others think that these five-day-old cell clusters -- no bigger than
the dot on an ``i'' on this page -- are not yet fully human. It's
better to use these embryos to help others, they argue. Generally,
only embryos in medical clinics that are not going to become babies
are used in this research.
</P>
<P>
In a kind of compromise, President Bush announced three years ago
that government money could be used for stem cell research, but only
on cell lines created before his Aug. 9, 2001, announcement. This
would not hurt the research, he said, because there were more than 60
lines available; he promised $100 million per year in federal funds to
work on them.
</P>
<P>
But scientists say that the restrictions have severely held them
back, and that only 22 cell lines have turned out to be useful. They
want to use new techniques to make better lines but can't get federal
money to do it, they say. So far, the government has awarded about $35
million for human embryonic stem cell research.
