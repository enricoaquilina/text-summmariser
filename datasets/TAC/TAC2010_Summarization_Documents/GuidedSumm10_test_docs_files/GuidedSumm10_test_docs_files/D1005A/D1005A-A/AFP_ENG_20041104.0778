A new medical study helps explain the puzzling effect of the hormone
dopamine on patients suffering from the degenerative nerve disorder
Parkinson's disease, said a report out Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Doctors have been aware that dopamine levels worsen performance in
some cognitive tasks while improving performance in others, without
knowing why.
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's patients, when off their dopamine-increasing medications,
learn better from negative feedback, such as being scolded, the study
said. And they learn less from positive feedback, such as being
praised, than do healthy people of the same age and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
The study was published in the current issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
"When these same Parkinson's patients take their dopamine medication,
they show the reverse pattern, learning better from positive feedback
and worse from negative feedback than controls," said the University
of Colorado research team.
</P>
<P>
"Dopamine is a brain chemical associated with feelings of pleasure
and reward that is thought to contribute to learning through both
positive and negative feedback," said the report.
</P>
<P>
"Loss of dopamine leads to the symptoms of Parkinson's. This work may
also extend beyond Parkinson's to address the neurobiology of
learning from experience: learning that occurs when positive feedback
or rewards reinforce behavior and negative feedback causes people to
avoid such behavior," it said.
</P>
<P>
The research also identified a group of brain receptors in mice that
appear to be responsible for nicotine addiction.
</P>
<P>
"These findings may help scientists find targets for drugs aimed to
help smokers kick their habit," said the report. "Nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors are expressed in the brain structures thought
to be involved in the addiction to smoking.
</P>
<P>
"These receptors, which are embedded in the surfaces of neurons, can
be composed of different combinations of subunits ... Mice with a
mutation in the 'alpha4' subunit were unusually sensitive to the
effects of nicotine."
