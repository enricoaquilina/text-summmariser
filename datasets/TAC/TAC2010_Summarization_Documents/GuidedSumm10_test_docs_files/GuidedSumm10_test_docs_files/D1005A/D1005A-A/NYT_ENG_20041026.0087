WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- An international research team, led by
scientists at the National Institute on Aging (NIA), has discovered a
gene which, when mutated, causes Parkinson's disease in some
families. Although Parkinson's disease is usually not inherited, the
discovery of this gene and further study of how it works could open
up new avenues of research for preventing or delaying the onset of
the disease.

Investigators studied five families with a history of Parkinson's
disease who lived in the Basque region of Spain and in England.
First, the group identified a small region of the "chromosome 12"
shared by all of the Basque families and then systematically assessed
each gene in this region for mutations that might cause disease.

The investigators identified two mutations in the same gene, one
associated with Parkinson's disease in the Basque families and the
other which was linked to the disease in the English family.
