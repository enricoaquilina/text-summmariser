Actor Michael J. Fox films stem-cell campaign ad for Sen. John Kerry

Actor Michael J. Fox is returning to TV _ in a commercial praising
Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry for his stance on stem
cell research.
</P>
<P>
"John Kerry strongly supports stem cell research. George Bush is
putting limits on it," Fox says in an ad Kerry's campaign unveiled
Thursday. "Stem cell research can help millions of Americans whose
lives have been touched by devastating illnesses. George Bush says we
can wait. I say lives are at stake and it's time for leadership.
That's why I support John Kerry for president."

<P>
Fox, who has Parkinson's disease, campaigned with Kerry in New
Hampshire on Monday and filmed the ad after the event. The campaign
said the ad would run in local media markets in states considered
battlegrounds.

Three years ago, Bush limited federal funding of embryonic stem cell
research to the 78 stem cell lines in existence. Less than a third of
those initial lines are available to researchers because of problems
with the lines' growth or their ownership.
</P>
<P>
Some religious groups oppose the culling of stem cells, which kills
the embryos, because they say it's abortion. Proponents of the
research, including former first lady Nancy Reagan and 58 U.S.
senators, say the focus should be on the possibility of cures for
diseases such as Parkinson's, diabetes and Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
The Bush campaign called the ad false. "George Bush is the first
president to allow for the federal funding of embryonic stem cell
research and has provided hundreds of millions of federal dollars for
stem cell research," said Brian Jones, a Bush spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Fox is best known for the "Back to the Future" movies. He largely
left the industry in the mid-1990s because of his disease. Since
then, he's been a loud voice in the stem cell debate.
