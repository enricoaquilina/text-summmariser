A TRICKY DEMENTIA

Q. What is Lewy body disease? I saw it listed as the cause of death
in an obituary.
</P>
<P>
A. It is a form of dementia that the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke calls dementia with Lewy bodies. It
is associated with abnormal structures, called Lewy bodies, found in
certain areas of the brain, and leads to a slowly progressing
neurological degeneration.
</P>
<P>
Both the abnormal bodies and many of the symptoms are associated with
Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's, the institute points out, so
scientists do not know whether the ailment is a distinct disease or a
variant of Alzheimer's or Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have recently found that Lewy bodies contain a protein
called alpha-synuclein, which is also linked to Parkinson's and an
ailment called multiple system atrophy.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms can be as diverse as loss of spontaneous movement, rigidity,
tremor and shuffling gait, acute confusion, memory loss and problems
with other mental functions. Visual hallucinations may be an early
sign, and there may also be delusions and depression.
</P>
<P>
The problem is the second most frequent cause of dementia in older
adults, after Alzheimer's, though it can affect younger people as
well. There is no cure, but the symptoms can be treated.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, treatments for the Parkinson's-like symptoms, like
tremors, may exacerbate mental symptoms, and psychiatric drugs may
worsen the physical ones.
