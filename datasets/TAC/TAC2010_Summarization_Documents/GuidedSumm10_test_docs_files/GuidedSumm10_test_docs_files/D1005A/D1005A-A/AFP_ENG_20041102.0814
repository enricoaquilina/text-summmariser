Californians voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to become the first US
state to fund controversial embryonic stem cell research that was
effectively banned by President George W. Bush, US media reported.
</P>
<P>
The emotionally- and politically-charged Proposition 71, which allows
nearly three billion dollars to be put aside for stem cell research
over 10 years, passed by 64 percent against 36 percent opposition,
CNN reported, citing early poll results.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the measure say the decision could help find cures to
diseases including cancer, AIDS, spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's
disease and Alzheimer's disease more quickly than had been expected.
</P>
<P>
They also claim that the measure will make California, already the
United States' leading hub for biotech industries, a world hub of
stem cell research too.
</P>
<P>
Bush in 2001 effectively banned further federal funding for the
science citing the killing of human embryos that occurs in the
process.
</P>
<P>
The California measure is seen as a way of circumventing federpe to
be able to learn using human embryonic stem cell cells," he said.
