Brain Cell Study Alters Huntington's Disease Theory
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new robotic microscope that follows a brain cell in the lab from
a normal state to its death has led researchers to a surprising
finding that appears to debunk a long-standing theory about
Huntington's disease.
</P>
<P>
Like many degenerative brain diseases, including Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's, proteins targeted in the disease process begin misfolding
and clumping in or around brain cells, which are called neurons.
</P>
<P>
It has long been thought that the sticky protein triggers the death
of brain cells.
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Steve Finkbeiner and colleagues at the University of
California in San Francisco and the university's Gladstone Institute
of Neurological Disease have discovered that the mutant protein that
clumps inside the brain cells of Huntington's patients actually saves
cells from dying.
</P>
<P>
``This process appears to be protective,'' said Finkbeiner, an
assistant professor in the department of neurology and physiology.
</P>
<P>
Today, a major treatment strategy is aimed at developing medicines
to stop this abnormal protein from clumping. If Finkbeiner is right,
this could worsen matters.
</P>
<P>
``This has been an area of great controversy,'' said Dr.
Christopher Ross, a professor at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes in
Baltimore. ``It's an important finding.''
</P>
<P>
The study will be published Thursday in Nature.
</P>
<P>
While proteins that cause Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are
different, the pathology -- these deposits in or around brain cells --
is similar.
</P>
<P>
A few years ago Finkbeiner and colleagues published a paper in the
journal Cell showing that when these protein clumps, called inclusion
bodies, disappear, neurons got worse.
</P>
<P>
He decided to build a microscope that would allow scientists to
follow brain cells over a long period, akin to videotaping a neuron's
life.
</P>
<P>
In the experiment, they took neurons from the striatum, the brain
region hard hit by Huntington's.
</P>
<P>
In a lab dish, they added either the normal Huntington gene, or the
mutant form that causes the disease.
</P>
<P>
``Inclusion-body formation actually prolonged survival and
protected neurons,'' Dr. Harry Orr of the Institute of Human Genetics
at the University of Minnesota wrote in an accompanying editorial.
</P>
<P>
He said the scientific approach could serve the field well.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists now think the vulnerable neurons sweep the abnormal
protein ``to get it out of the way,'' explained Hopkins' Ross.
</P>
<P>
Normally, neurons have enzymes that actually work like garbage
disposals to get rid of material floating around a cell.
</P>
<P>
But in this case, it's more like a recycling bin.
</P>
<P>
The problem, Ross said, ``is that no one ever comes to pick up the
garbage.''
</P>
<P>
Huntington's is an inherited, fatally degenerative disease of the
central nervous system that appears on average at age 35.
</P>
<P>
Complete mental and physical deterioration progresses slowly, with
death resulting in 10 to 15 years.
