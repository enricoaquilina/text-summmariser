PATIENTS DECRY PARKINSON'S DRUG'S RECALL DESPITE RISKS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With his condition deteriorating from Parkinson's disease last year,
Steve Kaufman gave up making improvements to his home in Algonquin,
Ill. "I couldn't even hold a nail stable," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, after taking an experimental drug in a clinical
trial, Kaufman built new kitchen cabinets and an outdoor deck. He was
so steady he could walk across a narrow piece of lumber like an
Olympic gymnast on the balance beam.
</P>
<P>
The drug, however, is no longer available to Kaufman or other
Parkinson's patients in clinical trials. In June, its developer,
Amgen, announced that the drug, which is called glial cell
line-derived neurotrophic factor, or GDNF, had not proved better than
a placebo. Two months later, the company said that safety issues had
been discovered and it abruptly ordered all patients taken off the
drug.
</P>
<P>
Amgen's move has provoked an outcry from patients who say the company
is robbing them of their only hope. "It's almost the same thing as a
diabetic losing their insulin," said Kaufman, who is 50 and has had
Parkinson's for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The story of Amgen's drug shows the clash between the faith of
patients and the cold logic of science and business. At a time when
public debate is focused on whether unsafe drugs like Vioxx are
remaining on the market too long, this story shows patients who are
more than willing to accept risks to get a drug. Their willingness
also raises an ethical question: If a company stops developing a drug
for safety or efficacy reasons, is it obligated to continue supplying
it to patients from its clinical trials?
</P>
<P>
A complicating factor in the clinical trials is the nature of
Parkinson's, a disease that chokes off the supply of dopamine, a
signaling chemical, in the brain. Some studies have suggested that
mere anticipation of treatment can induce a patient's brain to
produce more dopamine, which alleviates the symptoms. The patients
not only feel better, they are better -- at least for a time. In
fact, some of patients in the GDNF trial who improved the most had
received a placebo.
</P>
<P>
But while Amgen executives say they empathize with the four dozen
patients who have participated in the trials, they also say they
cannot keep giving them a drug that does not work and might be
dangerous. "How can we ethically justify administering this drug?"
said Roger Perlmutter, executive vice president for research and
development.
