Parkinson's disease at a glance

<P>
Parkinson's disease, which robs people of control over their movements, usually
starts in middle or late life and develops slowly. It is both chronic, meaning
it persists over a long period of time, and progressive, meaning its symptoms
grow worse over time.
</P>
<P>
The degenerative condition can include such symptoms as tremor, slow movement,
slurred speech, a shuffling gait, stiff limbs and difficulty in keeping balance.
Symptoms may appear on one or both sides of the body.
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's itself does not kill, but eventually _ when medication loses its
effect _ a patient can become bedridden and could die from complications.
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's disease occurs when a group of brain cells which produce a chemical
called dopamine begin to malfunction and eventually die. Symptoms occur once 80
percent of the cells have died.
</P>
<P>
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, or chemical messenger, that transports signals
to the parts of the brain that control movement initiation and coordination.
When Parkinson's disease occurs, for unexplained reasons, these cells begin to
die at a faster rate and the amount of dopamine produced in the brain
decreases.
