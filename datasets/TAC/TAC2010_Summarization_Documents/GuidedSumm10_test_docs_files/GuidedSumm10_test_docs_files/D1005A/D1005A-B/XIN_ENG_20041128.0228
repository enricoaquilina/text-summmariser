Two-thirds of Swiss voters on Sunday endorsed government-proposed
legislation to allow limited stem cell research, local media
reported.

<P>
Some 66.4 percent of the voters said yes to the legislation which
will allow scientists to study stem cells from unwanted embryos but
strictly prohibit any forms of human cloning.

The government said Switzerland should not lose its edge in
pharmacology and bio-technology by banning stem cell research, which
provides hopes for the treatment of various diseases, such as
paralysis, heart attack, diabetes, Parkinson's disease and
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
However, religion groups, right-wing organizations and some
ecologists were opposed to embryonic stem cell research, arguing it
will open the door for human cloning.

Stem cells are master cells that can develop into other cell types.
