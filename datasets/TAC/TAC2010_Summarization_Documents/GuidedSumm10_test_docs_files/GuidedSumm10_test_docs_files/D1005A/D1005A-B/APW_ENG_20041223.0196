South Korea to allow stem-cell research to cure disease
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Korea will allow stem-cell research to find cures for 18
diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer's and cerebral palsy, government
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's parliament passed a law in January banning human
cloning, but left it to the government to establish detailed rules on
stem-cell research.
</P>
<P>
Those guidelines were passed by the Cabinet on Thursday and will take
effect on Jan. 1, said an official at the Ministry of Health and
Welfare, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, scientists will also be allowed to use
fertilized eggs that are left over at fertility clinics.
</P>
<P>
In February, a team of South Korean researchers became the first in
the world to successfully clone a human embryo, and then collect from
its master stem cells.
</P>
<P>
Many doctors consider the process key to one day creating customized
cures for diabetes, Parkinson's and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
However, despite its medical ramifications, critics say the research
is unethical because culling stem cells destroys the embryo and could
lead to human cloning.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean researchers said the harvest of stem cells was done
to benefit medicine only, and not to clone human beings.
