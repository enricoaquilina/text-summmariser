AMGEN REFUSES FURTHER USE OF EXPERIMENTAL PARKINSON'S DRUG
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small group of people with Parkinson's disease had been pleading
for months with the biotechnology company Amgen: Let them resume
taking an experimental drug that the patients said had helped
them but which the company said was ineffective and possibly
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
Friday Amgen gave its answer: No. The company said it would
not make the drug available to the 48 patients who
had participated in its clinical trials, even though the Food
and Drug Administration had left the door open for it
to do so. Company executives said that besides exposing the
patients to unnecessary risks, to let them continue treatment would
only generate false hopes. It might also ultimately hinder development
of improved versions of the drug, Amgen said.
</P>
<P>
"I know this will be received by the patients in a
devastating way," Kevin W. Sharer, chief executive of Amgen, said
in an interview, describing the verdict as "the hardest decision
I've made in my life." But, he added, "we're trying
to do the right thing for the most people."
</P>
<P>
Some patients, along with their family members and doctors, reacted swiftly
and angrily, as did some patient advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
"They have every reason in the world to give this medication
to the patients and they're not," said Kristen Suthers, whose
father had received the drug. "To be able to decide
whether people are going to suffer -- I just wish
that I'd never heard of the company."
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the drug, the subject of an article in
The New York Times in November, raises the question of
whether drug companies are obligated to continue providing drugs to
participants in clinical trials, even after the trials are ended.
In this case, in order to receive the drug the
patients had to undergo surgery to have catheters implanted in
their brains and pumps in their abdomens.
</P>
<P>
"We think there is kind of a moral pact that one
makes with a company in these situations that gives the
patients a privilege of having continued access to treatment," said
Robin Anthony Elliott, executive director of the Parkinson's Disease Foundation.
</P>
<P>
But Dorothy E. Vawter, associate director of the Minnesota Center for
Health Care Ethics, said the question was "not a settled
area of research ethics at all and is raising its
head more and more all the time." She said an
obligation to provide drugs to patients indefinitely after trials are
over could discourage drug development.
</P>
<P>
Amgen's decision reverberated beyond the 48 patients in the trials because
the drug, called glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, or GDNF,
had the potential to stall or even reverse the progression
of the disease rather than just reduce the symptoms, as
the currently available Parkinson's drugs do.
</P>
<P>
"As someone with Parkinson's disease who for four years has had
GDNF as my big hope, it's absolutely devastating," Tom Isaacs,
co-founder of the Cure Parkinson's Trust in England, said of
Amgen's decision. Isaacs walked around the coast of Britain, more
than 4,000 miles, to raise money for Parkinson's research, much
of which he said he planned to devote to studies
of GDNF.
</P>
<P>
In initial trials in England and Kentucky involving a total of
15 patients who knew they were getting the drug, virtually
all experienced lessening of the tremors and rigidity that characterize
the disease, and in some cases the improvements were dramatic.
But a subsequent trial involving 34 people who did not
know whether they were getting drug or a placebo indicated
that the drug did not prove meaningfully better than the
placebo.
</P>
<P>
Amgen concluded that the positive results in the earlier trials represented
a placebo effect, something that is known to occur in
Parkinson's trials. Moreover, it said, it found that some monkeys
given high doses of the drug had developed potentially serious
brain damage. So last summer the company shut down the
trials and ordered all patients taken off the drug.
</P>
<P>
Some doctors involved in the trial, however, have argued that the
unsuccessful trial had been poorly designed and that the drug
worked. They also discounted the findings in monkeys, saying the
animals had received a much higher dose than the patients.
</P>
<P>
Amgen executives and some of the trial investigators met with the
FDA in January. According to the company, the agency said
that safety issues would preclude the drug's being given to
new patients but that it would consider allowing Amgen to
resume treating the existing patients.
</P>
<P>
Amgen executives said they held many meetings among themselves and talked
with outside experts and ethicists. In the end, the executives
said, they decided they had to stick with the scientific
evidence that the drug might be dangerous and had not
been proven effective.
</P>
<P>
Sharer said another factor was that if the drug supply were
resumed and some patients experienced a placebo effect they attributed
to the drug, pressure would only grow on the company
to start treating even more patients. "We couldn't find a
way to contain this medicine to just these 40 or
50 patents," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the company was committed to GDNF and hoped to
begin another trial, perhaps delivering the drug by another method,
a year or two from now, if the safety issues
can be resolved.
</P>
<P>
"The best thing to do for all patient is to do
a proper development of GDNF," Sharer said. He said that
money was not a factor in the decision and that
concerns about the company's legal liability had not been an
insurmountable barrier.
</P>
<P>
Amgen executives also said that there was already an approved therapy,
deep brain stimulation, that could help alleviate the symptoms of
the patients from the clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
An ethicist consulted by Amgen, Arthur Caplan of the University of
Pennsylvania, said he agreed with the company. Patients "are not
in a position, even though they are the recipients, to
really understand what is going on in terms of animal
signals that may harm them," Caplan said. "And what they
interpret as positive might be colored by hope."
</P>
<P>
But doctors at the University of Kentucky who had conducted one
of the early trials criticized Amgen's decision. So did one
of the patients treated in that trial.
</P>
<P>
The patient, Bob Green, 51, of Wilmore, Ky., said GDNF had
allowed him to dress himself, get out of bed by
himself and even drive on occasion. "So many things that
people consider trivial are major to those of us who
lack those abilities," he said. Now off the drug, he
said his condition is deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a sad commentary on Amgen's outlook on life,
especially as it pertains to us who readily put ourselves
on the line to test the medication," he said. "We
went through the surgery thinking it might offer hope for
us and for others."
