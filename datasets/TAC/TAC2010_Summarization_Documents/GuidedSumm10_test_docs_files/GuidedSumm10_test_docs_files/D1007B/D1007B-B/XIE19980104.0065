<HEADLINE> Macao Prepared for Any Possible Outbreak of Bird Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Macao is fully prepared for any
possible outbreak of the bird flu although no case of H5N1 virus
has been found so far, a doctor with the Government Hospital said.
</P>
<P>
The doctor was quoted by the Tai Chung Po newspaper on Sunday
that his hospital is fully prepared to cope with the treatment and
testing of the bird flu disease which had killed four people in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said the hospital has been paying special attention to the
bird flu disease because of the geographical proximity between the
two places.
</P>
<P>
If a patient is tested positive of the virus in Macao, the
doctor said, the hospital will alert the Health Department to send
the samples for further testing in Hong Kong. In the same time the
patient will be treated as catching bird flu to prevent any
possible delays.
</P>
<P>
Although doctors have repeatedly called on local residents to
remain calm, sales of chickens in Macao have plummeted by more
than 50 percent over the past month. Many residents have turned to
pigeons, geese or pork for substitutes.
</P>
<P>
Another report in the Macao Daily News said on Sunday that the
imports of pigeons and geese have increased by more than 10
percent. The sales of pork also increased.
