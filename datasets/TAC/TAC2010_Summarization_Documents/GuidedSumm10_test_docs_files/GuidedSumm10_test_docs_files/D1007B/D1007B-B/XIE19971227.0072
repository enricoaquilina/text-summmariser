<HEADLINE> Macao Inspection on Chicken Farms Finds Nothing Abnormal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Macao has stepped up inspection
of all its chicken farms and nothing abnormal was found, an
official told local television Friday.
</P>
<P>
Joaquim Carvalho, president of the Macao Municipal Council of
Islands, said that an inspection into all 27 farms in the Taipa
and Coloane islands found no evidence of the bird flu.
</P>
<P>
He warned, however, that farmers should notice the council once
they find dead chickens so that the dead birds could be examined
and dealt with properly.
</P>
<P>
Although the deadly H5N1 virus has killed several patients in
Hong Kong, no case of bird flu was reported in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Local experts say that it is safe to eat birds that were cooked
thoroughly. It is also advised that people wash their hands clean
before taking food. Doctors believe that the disease is not caused
by eating birds.
</P>
<P>
In addition, over the past few days, local authorities have
increased cleaning of bird markets.
</P>
<P>
Sales of birds have dropped considerably in Macao, but
officials said there is no plan to stop importing birds from
China's inland. They insist that current examinations on imported
birds are sufficient.
