<HEADLINE> Bird-to-Human Main Mode of H5N1 Transmission, </HEADLINE>

HONG KONG, December 27 (Xinhua) -- Test results related to the
first bird flu case detected in a human suggested that the main
mode of influenza A H5N1 virus transmission was bird-to-human, it
was known here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Antibody to the virus was found in nine blood samples out of
502 tested in relation to the first avian flu case detected in
Hong Kong. The antibody to the virus was detected mainly among
poultry workers and people directly exposed to the virus.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of the viral genes shows that they are avian in nature
without evidence of assortment with human influenza virus genes.
</P>
<P>
The results and findings were released today jointly by the
Hong Kong Department of Health, the World Health Organization and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the
United States. They stressed the observations were preliminary and
additional findings are expected by late January next year.
</P>
<P>
The results leave open the possibility of person-to-person
transmission. However, the absence of antibody among the family
members of the ill child and the overall low number of antibody
positive people in contact with the child suggested that such
transmission, if occurring, is relatively inefficient at this
time.
</P>
<P>
The nine persons tested positive of antibody were all from the
502 people in the "exposed group", made up of poultry workers,
people in contact with the boy and people working with the virus,
such as laboratory workers.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, another 419 people in a "comparison group" who had
no history of contact with the ill child were all negative for the
antibody.
</P>
<P>
Follow-up investigation of the nine antibody positive persons
indicated that five were poultry workers, one was a student with
exposure to poultry, one was a laboratory worker and one was a
person whose exposure history was not clear.
</P>
<P>
The remaining antibody positive person was a healthcare worker
who helped take care of the child. The healthcare worker gave no
history of exposure to poultry raising the possibility of
human-to-human transmission.
</P>
<P>
Director of Health Dr. Margaret Chan told the press conference
that the Hong Kong government has already initiated measures to
help make sure that chicken sold in the market are free of avian
flu.
</P>
<P>
"With the cooperation of the authorities of the China's inland,
export of chicken from the inland to Hong Kong has been
temporarily suspended to allow time to put in place a system in
the inland to ensure the health status of chicken exported to Hong
Kong and a system here to conduct rapid tests on chicken imported
again in the future," she said.
</P>
<P>
"So far, surveillance of local farms has not detected any
chicken that are positive for influenza A H5N1. The situation
will be closely monitored by the Agriculture and Fisheries
Department," she said.
</P>
<P>
At the wholesale and retail level, blitz cleaning of chicken
stalls has been started and will continue over the next few days
to improve the hygiene conditions of these places, she went on.
</P>
<P>
The director concluded that "all these public health measures
are taken to ensure that chicken sold in Hong Kong are healthy and
to rebuild consumers' confidence."
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Health, the total number of
Influenza A H5N1 cases has so far reached 11 confirmed and nine
suspected, with three confirmed and one suspected dead.
