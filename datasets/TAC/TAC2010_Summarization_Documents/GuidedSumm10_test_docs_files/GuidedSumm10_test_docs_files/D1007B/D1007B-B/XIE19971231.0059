<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Visits Poultry Wholesale, Retail Markets in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said
here Wednesday that the government had closely monitored the avian
flu situation.
</P>
<P>
"The top priority is always the protection of public health,"
he stressed while visiting a temporary wholesale poultry market
and poultry stalls here in Wednesday afternoon to see the
condition there after cleansing.
</P>
<P>
To date, the total number of confirmed cases of bird flu in
Hong Kong remains 13 and that of suspected cases is six.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that once the presence of the H5N1 virus was
established in samples taken from chickens, the government had
resolutely and aptly made the decision to launch the chicken
slaughter exercise.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Tung was also briefed on the progress of
actions taken in tackling the problem of avian flu.
</P>
<P>
Up to Tuesday mid-night, Hong Kong had destroyed more than one
million poultry in a bid to help prevent the spread of the H5N1
virus.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating that the poultry trade had encountered losses and
residents had been inconvenienced by the chicken slaughter
exercise, Tung said that the government would shortly seek funds
from the Finance Committee to assist those in need.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the problem will soon be over. The raising and sale of
chickens will resume once all the farms, wholesale markets and
retail outlets have been thoroughly cleaned and a good control
system is in place to ensure chickens entering Hong Kong are free
from virus."
