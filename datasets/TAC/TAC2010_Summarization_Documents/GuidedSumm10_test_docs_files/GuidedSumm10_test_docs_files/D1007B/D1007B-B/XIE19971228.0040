<HEADLINE> HK to Slaughter Chickens to Fight "Bird Flu" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
said on Sunday that it will slaughter all chickens in local
chicken farms and all poultry at wholesale markets and retail
outlets in an attempt to get rid of the source of influenza A H5N1
virus or "bird flu."
</P>
<P>
The move is being taken following the discovery of the H5N1
virus in samples taken from a local chicken farm and the sudden
death of chickens at a wholesale poultry market.
</P>
<P>
The operation would begin on Monday, said Stephen Ip, secretary
for Economic Services, at a press conference here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It will cover all chicken farms, mixed poultry farms, wholesale
markets, market stalls and fresh provision shops in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the extension of the mass slaughter to all
poultry at wholesale markets and retail outlets was necessary
because the birds were being kept together and cross-infection
could not be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
There are 160 chicken farms and 39 mixed poultry farms in Hong
Kong. The number of fresh provision shops and market stalls
operating under the two municipal councils is about 430 and 560
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Ip said that as an extra precaution against infection, the
Municipal Council and the Housing Department will jointly launch a
massive and thorough cleansing exercise at all market stalls after
the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Chan, director of Health, said her department will
"provide health checks for chicken farmers, retailers and poultry
workers."
</P>
<P>
"It will also step up the medical surveillance program and
increase the provision of out-patient services in respect of the
avian flu," she added.
</P>
<P>
Chan stressed that the cluster of cases of human influenza A
H5N1 seen in Hong Kong is no indication of an epidemic. According
to the World Health Organization, there is no need for travel
restrictions in Hong Kong or elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
There are now 12 confirmed cases and eight suspected cases of
"bird flu" in Hong Kong.
