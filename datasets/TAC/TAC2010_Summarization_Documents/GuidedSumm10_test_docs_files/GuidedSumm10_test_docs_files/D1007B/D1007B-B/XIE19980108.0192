<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Adopt Confidence-building Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will adopt
confidence-building measures before it resumes importing poultry
and starts rebuilding its own poultry industry, local newspapers
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The papers quoted Michael Suen Ming-yeung, who acted in
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang's place during
her official visit to Beijing earlier this week, as saying that
the measures would be announced in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The measures would include steps raising the standards of
sanitation and hygiene in Hong Kong, particularly on the farms,
wholesale markets and retail outlets to make people eat chickens
again, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
According to the papers, Chan has confirmed that she heads a
task force handling the bird flu matters, and stressed that the
task force was "nothing new" and that she and Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa
had been keeping a close watch on the "whole avian flu affairs."
</P>
<P>
The priorities of the task force reportedly are to examine ways
to ensure sanitation in transporting chickens.
</P>
<P>
Defending the SAR government's efforts to handle the bird flu
problems, Suen said Wednesday: "We acted swiftly once we noted the
problems, and the actions were undertaken by various policy
bureaus and departments."
</P>
<P>
"Now we need more departments to get involved and the
coordination is getting wider," Suen said, adding that "that's why
Mr. Tung announced last (Tuesday) night that Mrs. Chan should
coordinate the actions."
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that the SAR government will work better in
the future and will not disappoint the people of Hong Kong.
