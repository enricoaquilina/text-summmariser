<HEADLINE> Source of Killer "Bird Flu" Hunted in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong health authorities
are stepping up the hunt for the source of a deadly influenza
strain previously found only in birds which has caused a global
alert.
</P>
<P>
The "bird flu" has claimed four victims here, killing two,
including a 54-year-old man who died Friday.
</P>
<P>
At least seven staff who had contact with the victims were
experiencing flu-like symptoms, but it was not clear if they had
also contracted the H5N1 strain, local health officials said
today.
</P>
<P>
Investigators fanned out across the territory Monday, checking
poultry farms for traces of the disease amid the speculation that
it could have been passed to humans by chickens.
</P>
<P>
All hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong have been ordered to
test patients for the flu.
</P>
<P>
A number of the patients' relatives were also found developing
flu-like symptoms and were undergoing tests.
</P>
<P>
A three-year-old boy and a man died earlier this year after
catching the "bird flu", or H5N1 strain of influenza, and a
13-year-old girl is in hospital with the disease.
</P>
<P>
Another victim, a two-year-old boy, who was hospitalized with
fever in November, later fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
World Health Organization (WHO) officials in Geneva said
leading researchers would this week decide whether a vaccine
should be developed, according to reports reaching here.
