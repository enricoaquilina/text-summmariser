MACAO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The sales of chicken have
dropped about 30 percent since bird flu killed children in Hong
Kong this month, the Va Kio newspaper reported today.

Macao residents are eating less birds these days although there
has been no report of bird flu cases in Macao. Compared with
normal days, the daily sales of chicken has dropped by some 2,000.

A spokesman for the Nam Yue (Group) Co. LTD., which imports
birds from China's inland areas for Macao, said that the company's
daily chicken shipment to Macao has dropped about 30 percent. But
the shipment of ducks, which total 3,000 a day, has not been
affected.

The spokesman stressed the imports from the inland areas are
all strictly examined and quarantined, and are safe. He warned
local residents not to buy birds smuggled in without quarantine.

Related authorities in Macao said that they have increased
inspections at Macao chicken farms and chicken markets, but
nothing abnormal has been found.

Local chicken farmers say that sales have dropped between 30
percent to 50 percent over the past weeks.

"It will be better if you cook your food thoroughly, and wash
your hands before taking meals," the report quoted a doctor as
saying.
