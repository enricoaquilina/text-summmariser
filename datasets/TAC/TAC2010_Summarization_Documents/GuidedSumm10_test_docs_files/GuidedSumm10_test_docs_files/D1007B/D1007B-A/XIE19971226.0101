<HEADLINE> No Bird Flu Cases Reported in Hong Kong's Neighbor City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, December 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's neighbor city of
Shenzhen has not discovered any case of H5N1 virus infection at
its 200 poultry farms, according to a local official in charge of
animal epidemics.
</P>
<P>
"There is no report of H5N1 cases among chickens so far, so
eating chickens is safe," Zhao Changwang, director of the Shenzhen
Institute of Veterinary Epidemic Prevention, told Shenzhen
citizens today.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the H5N1 virus has not been found in 15,000 chicken
blood samples that were taken randomly throughout Guangdong
Province, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The virus, known to cause "bird influenza" among chickens,
apparently has been transferred to humans in Hong Kong. The virus
is believed to be transmitted through contact with birds or their
feces.
</P>
<P>
Because strict preventive measures have been taken for a long
period, Zhao said, there has been no bird flu epidemic in recent
years among Shenzhen's 168 chicken runs and 38 pigeon farms. Zhao
said that procedures for breeding and transporting poultry are
always under intensive monitoring to avoid an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
A top Chinese official in charge of animal quarantines
confirmed on Thursday that the H5N1 virus has not been found among
chickens shipped to Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Yu Dahai, director of the Administration of Animal and Plant
Quarantine under the Ministry of Agriculture, said he was
satisfied with the disease control measures adopted by poultry
farms and ports in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Inspections are under way to prevent a bird flu outbreak, such
as random screening of chickens and checks on all poultry farms,
said Yu, who is on a fact-finding tour in Shenzhen.
