<HEADLINE> Bird Flu Not Epidemic in Hong Kong: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The bird flu in Hong Kong,
which has killed two people, has not become an epidemic, a local
senior health official said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here, Director of the Health
Department of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
Margaret Chan said that the SAR government would take "a number of
 preventive measures to protect public health."
</P>
<P>
"The present cluster of cases detected in Hong Kong has not
reached epidemic proportions," she said. "The efficiency of
transmission from human to human should not be high or there
should be hundreds and thousands of such cases in the SAR by now,
according to past experience with other types of influenza," she
added.
</P>
<P>
However, "the transmission of the virus both from bird to human
and human to human is possible," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
She stated that the SAR health authority has been working very
closely with the World Health Organization and the Centers for
Diseases Control in the United States in dealing with the
investigation and study of this new strain of influenza A H5N1
virus.
</P>
<P>
For the public, she advised that the best way to combat
influenza infection is to build up body resistance by having a
proper diet with adequate exercise and rest.
</P>
<P>
"Good ventilation should be maintained," she said, urging the
public to maintain good personal hygiene.
</P>
<P>
Chan told reporters that initial assessment made by a Special
Working Group on Influenza A H5N1 noted an association with
poultry in some of the cases under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The inter-department Special Working Group was set up yesterday
to coordinate efforts toward the prevention and control of the
spread of the mysterious bird flu after three more people were
suspected last week of having been infected with the H5NI virus,
bringing the number of confirmed or suspected cases to seven.
</P>
<P>
A 5-year-old child died in May in the first known case of a
human contracting the virus. A 54-year-old succumbed to the virus
early this month, but a 2-year-old boy recovered after
hospitalization in November.
</P>
<P>
Three more people remain hospitalized for the illness.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, two more cases were classified as "suspected" by the
Department of Health, increasing to nine the total number of H5N1
cases in human, Chan said.
