GI IN IRAQI PRISONER ABUSE SCANDAL PLEADS GUILTY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pfc. Lynndie R. England, the 22-year-old woman who became an infamous
presence in the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse photographs, pleaded guilty
on Monday to seven of the nine counts against her,
under an agreement with military prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
England had faced up to 16 1/2 years in prison if
convicted on all full nine counts, which included conspiracy, dereliction
of duty, maltreatment and indecent acts. But one of her
lawyers, Capt. Jonathan Crisp, said last week that England would
enter a guilty plea at the pretrial hearing Monday on
seven counts and then face sentencing by a military jury.
The reduced charges carry a maximum sentence of 11 years.
</P>
<P>
Two people close to the prosecution have said England can expect
to receive no more than 30 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
When the proceedings, at Fort Hood, Texas, resume on Tuesday, a
military jury will be seated to hear evidence on sentencing.
That phase of the proceedings is expected to last up
to seven days, possibly including weekends, according to a statement
from the Fort Hood public affairs office. The statement said
England was charged with violations of the Uniform Code of
Military Justice that occurred at the prison near Baghdad from
October to December 2003.

At the hearing Monday, the judge, Col. James L. Pohl, rejected
a defense motion to recuse himself. Crisp, one of England's
lawyers, had argued that it was not proper for Pohl
to preside over her case because he had been involved
in the other cases related to the Abu Ghraib scandal.
</P>
<P>
Crisp said England's defense team would present evidence that she had
a history of mental health problems and learning disabilities. He
said her lawyers would also present evidence that another soldier,
Spec. Charles A. Graner Jr., who military investigators say was
the ringleader of the abuse and who was her boyfriend
at the time, was a corrupting influence on her.
</P>
<P>
England, an Army reservist from West Virginia, was shown in photographs
from the prison holding a leash around the neck of
a naked and crawling Iraqi detainee. In other photos, she
appeared grinning or giving a thumbs-up over naked detainees, holding
a cigarette between her teeth.
</P>
<P>
She and six other soldiers implicated in the abuse were reservists
with the 372nd Military Police Company based in Cresaptown, Md.
Four have pleaded guilty in exchange for reduced punishments; one,
Specialist Sabrina Harman, faces court-martial next month.
</P>
<P>
Graner was convicted and sentenced in January to 10 years in
prison and dismissed from the military. He is in a
military prison in Leavenworth, Kan. The seven soldiers have said
they were following orders.
