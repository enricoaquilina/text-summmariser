Private England Pleads Guilty

FORT HOOD, Texas

<P>
Army Pfc. Lynndie R. England formally pleaded
guilty Monday to mistreating inmates at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison, with
many of the seven counts related to her appearance in some of the most
graphic photographs of the abuse that shocked the world last spring.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal she made with military prosecutors, the reservist from
Fort Ashby, W.Va., will serve less than the maximum term of 11 years
in prison that could result from her guilty plea. She had faced nine
counts and could have received up to 16 1/2 years. A military jury
here will decide her sentence this week.
</P>
<P>
England, 22, was perhaps the most familiar face in the notorious
photos. She was pictured holding one inmate tethered to a leash. In
another, she smiles and smokes a cigarette while pointing at a naked
prisoner. Her involvement in a group of sexually humiliating scenarios
went alongside images of military dogs attacking prisoners, soldiers
carrying out physical assaults, and detainees being chained to their
beds and cell doors in ``stress positions.''
</P>
<P>
The emergence of the Abu Ghraib photographs spawned nearly a dozen
defense department and military inquiries into detainee abuse and
focused an international spotlight on U.S. detention operations in
Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. While government officials
initially tried to minimize the Abu Ghraib abuses as being at the
hands of a few bad apples in the Army Reserve, the larger
investigations revealed widespread abuses involving questionable and
harsh interrogation tactics.
</P>
<P>
England's defense team has been arguing for nearly a year that her
case was part of a bigger picture, initially trying to get top U.S.
officials, including Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, to testify at
her court martial about the nation's policies for handling and
interrogating detainees. They argued England was simply doing as she
was told and as a low-ranking soldier, she wasn't in a position to
question her orders.
</P>
<P>
Still, in the end England negotiated a plea. But those careful
arrangements almost went awry in the stark military courtroom Monday
when a skeptical Army judge raised questions about her admission of
guilt.
</P>
<P>
In military law, a judge cannot accept a defendant's guilty plea
without assurance that the plea is true.
</P>
<P>
England told the judge, Col. James L. Pohl, that she was sent to
Iraq as a records clerk with the 372nd Military Police Company, based
in Cumberland, Md., and had no training as a prison guard when the
Army assigned her to work at Baghdad's toughest prison. When Pohl
asked the defendant why she posed for the leash picture, she responded
that she had been told to do so by then-Sgt. Charles A. Graner Jr, who
was trained as a prison guard.
</P>
<P>
``Did you question this procedure?'' the judge asked.
</P>
<P>
``I assumed it was OK,'' England replied, ``because he was an MP
(military police soldier), he had the corrections officer background.
He was older than me.''
</P>
<P>
Pohl appeared troubled by her answer, noting she had to have
knowledge her actions were wrong to be legally culpable. He told
prosecutors that ``it's going to be difficult to make a photograph of
a lawful act into a crime.''
</P>
<P>
After a brief recess for the lawyers to meet, England returned to
the courtroom and said she knew at the time that use of the leash
``was not only morally wrong but legally wrong. I had a choice, but I
chose what my friends wanted me to do.''
</P>
<P>
England went on to say she had deliberately done wrong in posing
for other pictures, including one that showed seven naked prisoners
forced to form a human pyramid. ``I knew it was wrong,'' she said.
``Who would morally do something like that in a U.S. prison?''
</P>
<P>
England becomes the eighth U.S. soldier to plead guilty or be
convicted in relation to the Abu Ghraib abuses. Graner, the
highest-ranking soldier implicated, was the only one to go to trial.
Described by investigators as a ringleader of the abuse, he was
convicted at a court martial in January and is serving a 10-year
sentence.
</P>
<P>
No senior officer at the prison, and no one higher up in the chain
of command, has faced charges in the case. Last week, the Army's
inspector general exonerated four generals in Iraq of any blame for
Abu Ghraib.
</P>
<P>
(optional add end)
</P>
<P>
England became pregnant while in Iraq. Her child -- believed to be
Graner's son -- is a few months old and is living with relatives.
</P>
<P>
She told the judge Monday that many of the photos in which she is
seen standing beside naked Iraqi inmates were taken late on the night
of Nov. 7, 2003. She said she had gone to Cell Block One-Alpha that
night to celebrate with the guards there; the next day was her 21st
birthday.
