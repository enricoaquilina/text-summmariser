<P>
The defense on Monday demanded 
that the judge be changed for the court martial of Private Lynndie 
England, the US soldier seen in photographs from Iraq's Abu Ghraib 
prison holding a leash attached to the neck of a naked inmate.

<P>
England's lawyers threw up their objections at the start of the 
court martial forcing a recess barely 30 minutes after the hearing 
opened, and before England had made her expected guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Rick Hernandez asked the military judge, Colonel 
James Pohl, to recuse himself because he had presided over all the 
other Abu Ghraib abuse cases. Hernandez said this "gives the 
appearance of bias."
</P>
<P>
When the judge said it made sense for one judge to preside over 
the "factually complicated cases" that had thousands of pages of 
supporting documents, Hernandez responded that the fact that England 
was going to enter a guilty plea meant the case would not be 
"complicated."
</P>
<P>
Pohl became increasingly frustrated during the questioning and 
told Hernandez that in order to recuse himself: "I'd have to believe 
there was an appearance of impropriety from two colonels and two 
three-star generals."
