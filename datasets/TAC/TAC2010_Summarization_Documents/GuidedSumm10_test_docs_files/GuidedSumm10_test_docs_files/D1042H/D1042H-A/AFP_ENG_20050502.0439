<P>
Lynndie England on Monday pled 
guilty to charges of abusing Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib 
prison but told a court martial she did not believe she was doing 
wrong when photographed holding a leash on a naked inmate.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old private, who featured in some of the most 
graphic pictures of sexual humiliation of prisoners at the jail near 
Baghdad, told the hearing she had been following the orders of her 
former boyfriend, Specialist Charles Graner, one of the abuse 
ringleaders.
</P>
<P>
"I assumed it was okay because he was an MP and he had the 
background of being a corrections officer," said England, who pled 
guilty to seven charges relating to the abuse of prisoners in 
October and November 2003.
</P>
<P>
The military judge, Colonel James Pohl, halted proceedings after 
England indicated that she did not believe her actions were wrong.
</P>
<P>
"I want you to understand this is your trial. I don't want you 
to plead guilty unless you are guilty," Pohl said.
</P>
<P>
England told how she was at the prison to visit friends and 
Graner had taken her into the cellblock where he was trying to get 
an uncooperative inmate out of his cell.
</P>
<P>
"The detainee was on the ground," England said. "He (Graner) 
proceeded to tie the strap around his neck and he told the detainee 
to start crawling around the cell. When the detainee would not do 
that he had me hold the strap."
</P>
<P>
The prisoner then crawled out of the cell with England holding 
the strap.
</P>
<P>
When the judge asked England why Graner handed her the strap, 
England replied: "He wanted it to look more degrading with a female 
of my size." Graner had also wanted other prisoners to witness the 
degradation. "It would be more humiliating to him."
</P>
<P>
England said she believed Graner took the pictures "for his own 
amusement."
</P>
<P>
The abuse pictures were shown around the world and led to 
widespread condemnation of US practices in Iraq at a time when it 
was still trying to bring the country under control after the 2003 
invasion.
</P>
<P>
England reached a plea bargain with military prosecutors, who 
dropped a dereliction of duty charge and one of committing an 
indecent act when she was photographed performing fellatio on 
another solider.
</P>
<P>
That brings the maximum sentence she risks down to 11 years from 
the original 16-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
Her defense asked the judge to roll several maltreatment charges 
into one, which would bring the maximum sentence down to eight 
years.
</P>
<P>
England's lawyer, Rick Hernandez, asked Pohl to recuse himself 
because he had presided over all the other Abu Ghraib abuse cases. 
Hernandez said this "gives the appearance of bias." But the judge 
rejected the demand and England went on to make her plea.
</P>
<P>
The proposed punishment under the plea bargain with prosecutors 
will remain secret until after the military jury decides the 
sentence it believes she should face. England will then receive the 
lesser of the two sentences.
</P>
<P>
England was accused of posing for a number of photographs.
</P>
<P>
As well as the infamous image holding a leash, England is also 
seen pointing to the word "rapeist" (sic) written on the exposed 
buttocks of a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
She also posed with naked prisoners who formed a human pyramid 
and some who had been forced to masturbate. She was also 
photographed engaging in fellatio with Graner, the father of her 
newborn baby, who is serving a 10-year jail term for beating and 
sexually humiliating prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Graner is reported to have married another soldier charged in 
the scandal, Megan Ambuhl, who pleaded guilty and received a 
dishonorable discharge.
</P>
<P>
Of the eight soldiers charged over the Abu Ghraib scandal, only 
Graner's case has gone to trial.
</P>
<P>
Five soldiers pled guilty and received sentences ranging from a 
dishonorable discharge to eight years in prison. The final hearing, 
that of Specialist Sabrina Harman, is scheduled to begin May 11.
</P>
<P>
A number of US investigations categorized the abuse as the 
isolated acts by a small group. But many groups have raised 
suspicions that the US administration has protected the upper ranks. 
US rights groups have called for a special prosecutor to look into 
torture allegations.
</P>
<P>
Some top officers have received nonjudicial punishment, 
including Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, commander of the 
military police unit at Abu Ghraib, was relieved of her command and 
reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
The senior US military commander in Iraq at the time, Lieutenant 
General Ricardo Sanchez, and three other high-ranking officers were 
cleared of any wrongdoing by a US military probe.
