<P>
A female US soldier accused of 
abusing Iraqi detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison pleaded guilty on
Monday to several charges at a court-martial at Fort Hood, Texas.
</P>
<P>
Private Lynndie England, perhaps the most well-known in the 
abuse scandal that occurred in the fall of 2003, pleaded guilty to
seven charges, including two counts of conspiracy to maltreat 
prisoners, four counts of maltreating prisoners and one count of 
committing an indecent act.
</P>
<P>
England, 22, reached a plea bargain with military prosecutors 
last week, which would lower her maximum possible sentence from 16
and a half years in prison to 11 years. The prosecution dropped a 
dereliction of duty charge and one of committing an indecent act.
</P>
<P>
If the plea agreement was accepted by the military judge, a 
jury of officers and soldiers would decide her punishment 
following a sentencing hearing.
</P>
<P>
England, from West Virginia, was one of seven members of the 
Maryland-based 372nd Military Police Company charged with 
humiliating and assaulting prisoners at Abu Ghraib.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Ghraib abuse scandal went public in April 2004, after 
photographs showing American soldiers mistreating and humiliating 
Iraqi prisoners surfaced. The scandal caused a widespread outrage,
particularly in the Arab world, prompting President George W. Bush
to apologize.
</P>
<P>
England and the other soldiers accused have insisted that they 
were following orders from military intelligence officers at the 
prison to "soften up" the prisoners for interrogation.
</P>
<P>
Of the seven members of the 372nd Military Police Company 
charged in the abuse scandal, four have previously entered guilty 
pleas, and the only soldier to stand trial so far was Charles 
Graner, who was serving a 10-year jail term.
