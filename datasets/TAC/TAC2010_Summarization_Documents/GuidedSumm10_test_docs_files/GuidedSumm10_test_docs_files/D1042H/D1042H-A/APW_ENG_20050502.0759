<P>
Pfc. Lynndie England's guilty plea, if approved by the judge, would bring to
eight the number of Army reservists convicted of abusing detainees at the Abu
Ghraib prison.
</P>
<P>
Spc. Sabrina Harman, 27, the other remaining soldier charged in the scandal, is
scheduled for trial at Fort Hood next week. She faces up to 6 1/2 years in
prison if convicted of conspiracy, maltreating detainees and dereliction of
duty.

The others previously convicted:
</P>
<P>
_ Charles Graner Jr., 36, is the only defendant to go to trial. Prosecutors
described Graner, who is said to be England's ex-boyfriend, as the ringleader of
a group of Abu Ghraib guards who mistreated Iraqi detainees. He was photographed
giving the thumbs-up sign behind a pile of naked detainees and ordering them to
masturbate. He is serving a 10-year prison sentence at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas,
after he was found guilty in January.
</P>
<P>
Last month he married Megan Ambuhl, 30, a former Abu Ghraib guard who pleaded
guilty to failing to prevent or report maltreatment of prisoners. She was
accused of watching prisoners being abused and helped set up the photograph of
England holding a naked prisoner by a leash. Ambuhl was discharged from the Army
without serving prison time.
</P>
<P>
_ Ivan Frederick, 38, was sentenced to 8 1/2 years in October after pleading
guilty to conspiracy, dereliction of duty, maltreatment of detainees, assault
and committing an indecent act. Frederick admitted he helped place wires on a
detainee's hands and told him he would be electrocuted if he fell off a box. He
was a staff sergeant, making him the highest-ranking soldier to serve prison
time in the case.
</P>
<P>
_ Jeremy Sivits, 25, pleaded guilty last May to four counts for taking pictures
of naked Iraqi prisoners being humiliated, including some of the photographs
that triggered the scandal. The former guard was sentenced to a year in
prison.
</P>
<P>
_ Roman Krol, 23, admitted pouring water on naked detainees and forcing them to
crawl around the floor at Abu Ghraib, and throwing a foam football at them while
they were handcuffed. After pleading guilty, Krol was sentenced in February to
10 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
_ Armin Cruz, 24, was sentenced to eight months in September after pleading
guilty to conspiracy and mistreating prisoners. Cruz was accused of forcing
naked prisoners to crawl along the floor and handcuffing men
together.
</P>
<P>
_ Javal Davis, 27, received a six-month sentence after pleading guilty in
February to assault, dereliction of duty and lying to Army investigators. Davis
admitted stepping on the hands and feet of handcuffed detainees and falling with
his full weight on top of them.
