<P>
Pfc. Lynndie R. England, the woman seen holding
an Iraqi prisoner on a leash in the iconic photo from the Abu Ghraib
prison, pleaded guilty Monday to seven charges stemming from prisoner
abuse.
</P>
<P>
The military judge overseeing the case, Col. James Pohl, accepted
the plea after initially expressing some doubts about at least one of
the charges against her. The case now will begin a sentencing hearing
in which a military jury will determine what punishment England, 22,
should face.
</P>
<P>
Before accepting England's plea, Pohl carefully scrutinized the
charges and the actions of the 22-year-old Army reservist.
</P>
<P>
He asked England what happened in the facility outside Baghdad that
caused the infamous scene of the prisoner being led by a leash.
England responded that the man was refusing to cooperate with the
guards and that her supervisor, Spec. Charles A. Graner Jr., told her
to go get the strap and put it around the prisoner as a leash. He also
instructed her to hold the prisoner because Graner said it would be
more degrading to the man.
</P>
<P>
Then Pohl asked England what training she had for prison work.
England, who was a records clerk in the military before being assigned
to Abu Ghraib, said she had none and told the judge she was unaware of
the Geneva Conventions. But she said that Graner had worked as a
civilian as a prison guard and she trusted his analysis of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Pohl then said, ``I don't see how it would be illegal to pose for a
photograph if you considered it legal.'' But after a recess, he
accepted the plea deal.
</P>
<P>
England, from Fort Ashby, W. Va., originally faced nine charges,
but the Army agreed to drop two of those as part of the agreement. She
pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy, four counts of maltreating
prisoners and one count of dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
Her defense lawyers said the deal was expected to reduce the
maximum sentence she faced from 16 1/2 years in prison to 11.
</P>
<P>
She is the seventh enlisted soldier to face criminal penalties in
the Abu Ghraib case. No commissioned officers at the prison, and no
senior officer in the chain of command, has been charged. Six enlisted
soldiers have entered guilty pleas in the case.
</P>
<P>
Graner, who reportedly fathered a child with England during their
service in Iraq, faced a court-martial in January. He was convicted
and sentenced to 10 years in prison despite his assertion that senior
officers directed and approved the actions of guards in cellblock
One-Alpha.
