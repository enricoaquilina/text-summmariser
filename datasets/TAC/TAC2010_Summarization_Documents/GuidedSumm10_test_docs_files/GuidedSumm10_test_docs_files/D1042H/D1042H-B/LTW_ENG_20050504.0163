Judges Tosses Guilty Plea in Abu Ghraib Case
</HEADLINE>

FT. HOOD, Texas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A military judge abruptly tossed out a guilty
plea Wednesday and declared a mistrial in the court-martial of Pfc.
Lynndie R. England, throwing in doubt the prosecution of an Army
reservist notorious for her role in the Abu Ghraib prison abuse
scandal.
</P>
<P>
The judge, Col. James Pohl, dismissed the jury in the sentencing
phase of her case and sent the year-old matter back to a lieutenant
general who will weigh a range of options, including starting over or
dismissing the case.
</P>
<P>
The judge's action came after Pvt. Charles A. Graner Jr., a former
guard at Abu Ghraib, testified that photographs used as evidence of
abusing prisoners were taken for legitimate training purposes. In one
photo England is seen holding a naked Iraqi detainee on a leash.
</P>
<P>
Pohl scolded England's defense lawyers for presenting testimony by
Graner suggesting that her actions were not illegal. He said that
testimony directly contradicted England's guilty plea of Monday, in
which she accepted some responsibility for how Iraqi detainees were
abused and sexually humiliated in late 2003.
</P>
<P>
Looking sternly down at the 22-year-old Army Reservist from rural
West Virginia, the judge said, ``You can't have it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
The sentencing trial began Monday with all expectations that it
could be over by Wednesday. Instead, England finds herself back at
square one. Lt. Gen. Thomas F. Metz could start the process again with
a pre-trial hearing and then another court-martial.
</P>
<P>
England left the courtroom without speaking to reporters. But her
military attorney, Capt. Jonathan Crisp, vented his frustration. ``I'm
disappointed with what happened today,'' he said. ``. . . This is a
very uncommon occurrence and something I would say everyone is unhappy
with.''
</P>
<P>
Military prosecutors did not comment.
</P>
<P>
Except for one other defendant who had a minor role in the scandal,
England's court-martial was expected to be the final chapter in a year
that has brought derision to the Pentagon effort to stabilize Iraq.
The photos of naked, humiliated Iraqi men, some with women's
underclothing draped over their heads, other stacked in
cheerleader-like pyramids, were seen around the world and inflamed
anger in the Middle East toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
England is seen giggling and flashing the thumbs up in many of the
photos snapped during the overnight shift on Tier 1A at Abu Ghraib,
the U.S. military's main prison for enemy Iraqis just outside Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
England was one of seven members of the 372nd Military Police
Company charged in the abuse scandal, along with two military
intelligence officers. All but one, Graner, pleaded guilty and
received sentences ranging from no prison time to 8 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
Graner, considered the ringleader on Tier 1A, was convicted at
trial in January and given 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, England pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy, four
charges of mistreating detainees and one count of dereliction of duty.
Two other charges against her were dropped.
</P>
<P>
``I had a choice, but I chose to do what my friends wanted me to,''
the 5-foot-1 soldier told the judge in admitting guilt.
</P>
<P>
The plea arrangement reduced her maximum penalty from 16 1/2 years
to 11 years, but defense lawyers were hoping to win further leniency
during the sentencing phase that followed her plea.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors made an opening statement but put on no witnesses in
the penalty phase. Defense lawyers had her high school psychologist
testify about her learning difficulties as a child.
</P>
<P>
Then on Wednesday, the defense team called Graner to the witness
stand. He not only was her superior at the prison but also fathered
the child she gave birth to last fall. Graner and England since had a
falling out.
</P>
<P>
A one point England turned to a courtroom sketch artist who was
drawing Graner and said, ``Don't forget the horns and goatee.''
</P>
<P>
From the stand, Graner testified that he asked England to pose for
photographs holding a leash around a naked prisoner's neck because he
wanted to use the photo to document how to extract an unruly prisoner
from their cells.
</P>
<P>
Graner said he took three photographs in all, indicating to the
jury that this was a proper procedure.
</P>
<P>
``This was going to be a planned use of force,'' Graner testified.
``. . .We didn't have a video camera. This was the closest way I could
document it.'' He added, ``It was to me the safest way of getting the
prisoner out of the cell.''
</P>
<P>
The judge then abruptly called a halt to the proceedings. Clearing
the courtroom of jurors, he warned the defense lawyers that they could
not put on testimony that indicated she was not guilty of any crimes.
</P>
<P>
Pohl said that if Graner was not acting illegally, England could
not have conspired with him -- one of the charges against her. ``You
can't conspire with yourself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He told England, ``You can't have it both ways. You can only plead
guilty if you believe you are guilty. If you plead guilty, you can't
put on evidence that you're not guilty.''
