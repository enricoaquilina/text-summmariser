<P>
Defense attorneys for a woman 
who pleaded guilty to abusing Iraqi detainees at the Abu Ghraib 
prison are trying to show she lacks the mental capacity to properly 
judge her actions.
</P>
<P>
Private Lynndie England has testified that she knew posing for 
photographs with naked Iraqi prisoners was wrong but did it anyhow 
in order to please her friends.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old army reservist's lawyers are now trying to 
convince jurors that her sentence should be reduced because she has 
mental deficiencies that cause her to be overly compliant in social 
situations.
</P>
<P>
"She's clearly in a different mental capacity ... than the 
others," defense attorney Rick Hernandez told reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Publication of photos of the diminutive soldier leading a 
mentally ill prisoner around on a leash and grinning as she pointed 
at naked detainees led to widespread condemnation of US practices in 
Iraq at a time when US forces were trying to bring the country under 
control after the 2003 invasion.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with the prosecution, England pleaded guilty 
Monday to seven charges of abuse. She faces a maximum prison term of 
11 years.
</P>
<P>
England's former boyfriend is scheduled to testify in her 
defense Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ringleader of the abuse, Charles Graner, handed a note to 
reporters as he was led out of the court in handcuffs Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Knowing what happened in Iraq, it was very upsetting to see 
Lynn plead guilty to her charges," the former corporal wrote of the 
mother of his infant son.
</P>
<P>
Graner has recently married another soldier charged in the 
scandal and is currently serving a 10-year term for his role in the 
abuse.
</P>
<P>
England's mother, Terri, was also scheduled to testify Wednesday 
and brought her 7-month-old grandson. England cradled her son in the 
halls of the courthouse as she waited to be called in for morning 
arguments.
</P>
<P>
England's former school psychologist, Thomas Denne, testified 
Tuesday that England had been temporarily deprived of oxygen at 
birth and had suffered from a learning disability.
</P>
<P>
As a young girl England was electively mute, meaning that she 
rarely spoke, and "appeared intimidated in all social interactions," 
Denne said, adding that England was favored by teachers because she 
was quiet and always did as she was told.
</P>
<P>
In introducing mitigating factors that they hope will reduce 
England's sentence, her lawyers must tread carefully as any evidence 
showing the reservist was not guilty could lead the judge to throw 
out her plea bargain accord with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
At one point during Denne's testimony, the military judge 
dismissed jurors and asked England if she wished to withdraw her 
guilty plea. When she said no, he brought jurors back in and 
instructed them to disregard Denne's implication that England's 
learning disabilities meant she did not know right from wrong.
