JUDGE DECLARES MISTRIAL IN LYNNDIE ENGLAND CASE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
FORT HOOD, Texas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pfc. Lynndie England's court-martial on charges of
prison abuse came to an abrupt end Wednesday when the
judge rejected her guilty plea, threw out her pre-trial agreement
and declared a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
Fort Hood's top commander, Lt. Gen. Thomas Metz, will now decide
how to proceed with England's case.
</P>
<P>
The move by the judge, Col. James Pohl, was spurred by
testimony from England's former lover, Pvt. Charles Graner, and England's
own statements earlier this week suggesting that she did not
believe she had done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, England, 22, pleaded guilty to seven counts of conspiracy,
maltreatment and an indecent act, all related to acts of
prisoner abuse she and fellow members of the Maryland-based 372nd
Military Police Company committed at the Abu Ghraib prison.
</P>
<P>
Including England and Graner, eight soldiers have pleaded or been found
guilty in connection to incidents at the Baghdad-area prison. England's
sentencing hearing began Tuesday. She faced up to 11 years
in prison, demotion, forfeiture of pay and a dishonorable discharge.
</P>
<P>
However, Graner, who testified on England's behalf Wednesday morning, said he
thought one of their most infamous deeds -- dragging a
prisoner out of his cell by a leash and photographing
the act -- was legitimate at the time. That prompted
Pohl to dismiss Graner and call a 3 1/2 hour
recess before entering a plea of not guilty for England
on one count of conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
"He told me something inconsistent with her guilty plea," Pohl said.
"Basically, he said he didn't think he was doing anything
illegal. This trial is going to stop today and be
picked up at another time."
</P>
<P>
Pohl's move voided England's pre-trial agreement, which would have limited her
maximum sentence to 30 months, and sent all seven charges
back to Metz, commander of Fort Hood's III Corps.
</P>
<P>
Fort Hood legal spokesman Capt. Cullen Sheppard said Metz has several
choices: he could drop the charges, refer them to the
military equivalent of a grand jury hearing, or he could
recommend non-judicial punishment.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, England will return to Fort Bragg, N.C., where
she is stationed. Sheppard could not say when or where
any possible future hearings for England would occur.
</P>
<P>
The sudden conclusion of England's trial brings to an end three
long and bizarre days of trial and testimony. On Monday,
England's two lawyers moved unsuccessfully to recuse Pohl, alleging that
his participation in multiple Abu Ghraib-related court-martials -- despite the
fact he is not assigned to Fort Hood -- gave
the appearance of bias.
</P>
<P>
Pohl then spent three hours Monday intensely questioning England's guilty plea
before accepting it.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, which was the first day of the sentencing phase,
defense witnesses said England lacked proper training and oversight at
the prison.
</P>
<P>
The first witness, Thomas Denne, a school psychologist who had tested
England's mental abilities throughout her childhood, said England was a
shy, submissive child who had been deprived of oxygen at
birth and had language and cognitive difficulties. He added that
he was not able to diagnose her with a specific
learning disability.
</P>
<P>
Maj. David DiNenna, who served at Abu Ghraib with England, said
the prison was lacking in supplies, oversight, sanitation and personnel.
</P>
<P>
England's case was discussed in court Wednesday for less than an
hour. Graner, the first witness, spoke for only 25 minutes
before Pohl brought the proceedings to a halt.
</P>
<P>
When the recess was called, England, who bore Graner's son in
October, leaned over to the sketch artist and, referring to
a drawing of Graner, said: "Don't forget the horns and
goatee."
</P>
<P>
After the long recess, it took Pohl less than 15 minutes
to reject England's plea and dismiss the six-member, all military
jury.
</P>
<P>
England and her lawyers declined to comment after the court-martial was
dismissed. Instead, they marched out of the courthouse, looking straight
ahead, faces inscrutable.
