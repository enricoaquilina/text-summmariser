A US military judge presiding 
over the court-martial of Lynndie England, the soldier 
photographed with an Iraq detainee on a leash, Wednesday threw out
her guilty plea in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no findings of guilty that can be declared at 
this point," said Colonel James Pohl, the judge, after hearing 
testimony from Charles Graner, who was also involved in the abuse 
scandal.
</P>
<P>
"This trial is going to stop today and pick up at some time in 
the future," Pohl told the military court at Fort Hood, Texas.
</P>
<P>
At England's sentencing hearing, Graner testified that pictures
he took of her holding a naked prisoner on a leash at Abu Ghraib 
near Baghdad were meant to be used as a legitimate training aid 
for other guards, and argued that was a legitimate prison 
procedure.
</P>
<P>
England told the judge when she pleaded guilty Monday that she 
knew the pictures were being taken purely for the amusement of the
guards.
</P>
<P>
Pohl said the two statements could not be reconciled. "Both 
sides have indicated to me there is no way to resolve this 
inconsistency," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is evidence being presented that you are not guilty," he
told England.
</P>
<P>
England, 22, pleaded guilty on Monday to several charges, 
including conspiracy to maltreat prisoners, maltreating prisoners 
and committing an indecent act, after reaching a plea bargain with
military prosecutors last week which would lower her maximum 
possible sentence from 16 and a half years to 11 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
England was one the seven members of the 372nd Military Police 
Company charged in the abuse scandal. Four of them have entered 
guilty pleas, and the only soldier to stand trial so far was 
Charles Graner, who was serving a 10-year jail term.
