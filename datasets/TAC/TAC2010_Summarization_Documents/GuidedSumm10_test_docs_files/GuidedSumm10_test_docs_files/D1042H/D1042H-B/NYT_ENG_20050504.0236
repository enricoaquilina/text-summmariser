MISTRIAL CALLED IN ABU GHRAIB CASE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
KILLEEN, Texas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The court-martial of Pfc. Lynndie R. England, accused
of abusing naked Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib prison, collapsed
abruptly on Wednesday when a military judge threw out her
guilty plea over testimony by the convicted ringleader of the
scandal and father of her baby.
</P>
<P>
The surprise mistrial canceled what had seemed to be a pro-forma
punishment phase and sent the case back to the Army
commander at Fort Hood, Lt. Gen. Thomas F. Metz, for
re-examination. But government and defense lawyers said they would meet
as early as Thursday to consider their options.
</P>
<P>
The judge, Col. James L. Pohl, ordered the mistrial after Spc.
Charles A. Graner Jr., testifying on behalf of England, his
former lover, portrayed their handling of a leashed prisoner as
legitimate, contradicting England's sworn admission of guilt. He said she
acted at his request.
</P>
<P>
"I was asking her as the senior person at that extraction,"
Graner said.
</P>
<P>
Clearly taken aback, Pohl broke in, lecturing the defense lawyers. "If
you don't want to plead guilty, don't," he said. "But
you can't plead guilty and then say you're not. Am
I missing something here?"
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement accepted by the judge on the opening day
of trial at Fort Hood on Monday, England, 22, pleaded
guilty to seven of nine charges of conspiracy, dereliction of
duty, maltreatment and indecent acts. She did so in exchange
for what people close to the prosecution said was no
more than 30 months in prison, although the jury panel
of six officers could impose a lower term.
</P>
<P>
England, who had arrived at court with her 7-month-old son, Carter
Allan, seemed bewildered by the turn of events.
</P>
<P>
Where the case -- which stretches back more than a year
-- goes from here was far from clear. Neither the
prosecutors, Capt. Chris Graveline and Capt. Chuck Neill, nor the
defense lawyers, Capt. Jonathan Crisp and Rick Hernandez, commented publicly
afterward. But they indicated they would follow up on the
judge's suggestion that they might "negotiate a new deal --
come back another day."
