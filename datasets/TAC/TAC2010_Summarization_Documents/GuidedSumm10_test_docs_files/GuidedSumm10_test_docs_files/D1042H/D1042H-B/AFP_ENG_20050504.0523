<P>
A judge has called into question 
the guilt of a soldier photographed leading an Iraqi through the Abu 
Ghraib prison by a leash tied around his neck.
</P>
<P>
Colonel James Pohl halted court-martial proceedings Wednesday 
after Charles Graner, the alleged ringleader in the abuse scandal, 
testified that he had ordered Private Lynndie England to hold the 
leash.
</P>
<P>
"There is evidence being presented that you are not guilty," 
Pohl told the 22-year-old reservist.
</P>
<P>
"If you don't believe you're guilty and you honestly believe you 
were doing what Graner told you to do, you can't plead guilty."
</P>
<P>
Pohl ordered a three-hour recess to allow England to consult 
with her lawyers. England pled guilty to abusing prisoners Monday in 
exchange for a reduction in charges. Her lawyers have been 
presenting evidence of mitigating circumstances in order to convince 
a jury to award her fewer than the maximum sentence of 11 years.
</P>
<P>
When the hearing resumes later Wednesday, the judge will 
reexamine England "to resolve the inconsistencies" in Graner's 
testimony, said Captain Cullen Sheppard, a spokesman for the judge.
</P>
<P>
"If the judge does not believe she is guilty he will enter a 
plea of not guilty on her behalf," added the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Her case would then be sent back to military authorities for a 
review. The prosecution could maintain some of the charges, reopen 
the whole investigation or all charges could be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
The risk to England is that her plea agreement, which The New 
York Times has reported would reduce her sentence to just 30 months, 
would then be thrown out. In military trials, defendants receive the 
lesser of the sentences determined by the jury and the plea 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Pohl admonished England's attorney for introducing evidence that 
implied England did not realize what she was doing was wrong when 
she posed for pictures of the abuse and sexual humiliation of 
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Graner's testimony contradicted England's written statement and 
testimony that she knew that posing for a picture holding a leash 
attached to the neck of a naked, mentally ill patient was wrong.
</P>
<P>
Publication of photos of the soldier leading the prisoner on a 
leash led to widespread condemnation of US practices in Iraq at a 
time when US forces were trying to bring the country under control 
after the 2003 invasion.
</P>
<P>
In his brief testimony, Graner said he had taken the photos in 
order to document his practices and aid the military in developing 
standards.
</P>
<P>
"I tried to bring what we could have done in Pennsylvania 
there," the former corrections officer said. "I can't say it was 
legitimate. It was to me the safest way to get the prisoner out of 
there."
</P>
<P>
Graner said he did not want to enter the inmate's cell because 
it was littered with urine and feces and he was concerned that the 
prisoner would become violent. Contrary to England's testimony, 
Graner said he wrapped the strap around the prisoner's shoulders and 
that it slipped up to his neck.
</P>
<P>
England's mother, Terri, was also to testify Wednesday and 
brought England's seven-month-old son, Carter Allan England, who was 
fathered by Graner.
</P>
<P>
This was the third time in as many days the judge has halted the 
hearing because of questionable testimony.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, England's former school psychologist testified that 
she had been temporarily deprived of oxygen at birth and had 
suffered from a learning disability.
</P>
<P>
As a young girl England was electively mute, meaning that she 
rarely spoke, and "appeared intimidated in all social interactions," 
Thomas Denne said, adding that England was favored by teachers 
because she was quiet and always did as she was told.
</P>
<P>
Pohl dismissed jurors after Denne testified that England scored 
poorly on social judgment tests.
</P>
<P>
When England said she did not wish to withdraw her guilty plea, 
Pohl brought jurors back in and instructed them to dismiss the 
implication that England's learning disabilities meant she did not 
know right from wrong.
</P>
<P>
In her initial testimony, England said she thought it was 
acceptable to hold a prisoner by a leash because she was told to do 
it by Garner, a military police officer and former prison guard. 
England did not work in the prison and was there simply to visit her 
friends.
</P>
<P>
It was only after Pohl asked her to reconsider her guilty plea 
and gave her time to consult her lawyers that England said she had 
always known her actions were wrong.
