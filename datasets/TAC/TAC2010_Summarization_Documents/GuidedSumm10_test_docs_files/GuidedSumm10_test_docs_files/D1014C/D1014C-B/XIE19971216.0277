<HEADLINE> Global Diabetes Cases Forecast to Double by 2010 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The number of diabetes cases in
the world is forecast to nearly double to reach 220 million by the
year 2010, according to a report published today.
</P>
<P>
The report by the British Diabetic Association (BDA) said that
in 1995 the number of people with the illness was estimated at 123
million, but over the next 13 years, the cases will increase
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
It said that the main reason for the rise is a rapid change in
lifestyle and population demography, with growing obesity,
Western-style diets, less physical exercise and a rising elderly
population all contributing.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that in Asia and Africa diabetes could
become two to three times more common than it is now, and by 2010,
it is forecast that Asia will be home to 61 percent of the total
global number of people with diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Paul Zimmet, one of the authors of the report, said that "with
the unrestrained forces of economic globalization and
industrialization, the prevalence of diabetes is likely to
dramatically increase in the next millennium".
</P>
<P>
He added that the corresponding burden of complications and
premature mortality resulting from diabetes will constitute a
major public health problem for most countries.
