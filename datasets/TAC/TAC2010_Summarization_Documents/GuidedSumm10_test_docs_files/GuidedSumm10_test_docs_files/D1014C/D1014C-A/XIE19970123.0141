<HEADLINE> Over Half of Kuwaitis Obese: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 23 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the
710,000 Kuwaiti citizens are suffering from obesity and anemia
because of poor eating habits and other causes, according to
studies by a leading local nutritionist.
</P>
<P>
Obesity is number one health threat associated with nutrition
in Kuwait, Director of Food and Nutrition Department of the
Ministry of health Fawzia Al-Awadi said in a recent study.
</P>
<P>
According to his study, 42 percent of Kuwaiti women and 28
percent of men are obese. Twenty-eight percent of Kuwaiti men are
overweight.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of female to male in Kuwaiti population is 51:49.
</P>
<P>
Several factors contribute to the higher prevalence of
obesity in adult women, Al-Awadi said. These factors include
repeated pregnancies, rapid decline in breast feeding, an early
introduction to bottle feeding as well as poor eating habits.
</P>
<P>
She revealed that police and army personnel were more
susceptible to becoming overweight (34.4 percent) while obesity
was most prevalent among males with a technical profession.
</P>
<P>
"Regular food consumption between meals, the use of sugar in
tea, and the consumption of an additional meal at Diwaniya (men's
leisure time in chatting gathering) contributed significantly to
the development of obesity among this group," she explained.
</P>
<P>
Al-Awadi's another survey conducted among 1,154 obese patients
revealed that nearly one quarter of them had hypertension and
about 33 percent suffered diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Al-Awadi noted that "it has been shown that obesity
shortens life which is mainly due to cardiovascular and
cerebro-vascular diseases, constituting an additional risk to
overweight patients."
</P>
<P>
The nutritionist also said a large percentage of Kuwaiti
children are suffering from malnutrition due to bad feeding
habits that cause iron deficiency anemia. She said the intake
of vitamin C rich foods such as fruit juices are very low,
particularly among pre-school children.
</P>
<P>
Factors affecting the eating habits in Kuwait are income,
food prices, food import policies and the drastic change in
food formula, she reiterated. Increase in family income causes
a change in the dietary patterns that mainly are represented
by an increase in consumption of soft drinks, tea, chocolates,
sweets, nuts and ready-made foods.
