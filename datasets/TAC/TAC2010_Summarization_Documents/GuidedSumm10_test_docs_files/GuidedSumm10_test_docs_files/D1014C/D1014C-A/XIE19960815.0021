<HEADLINE> UK's Healthy Nation Program Foiled by Heavy-Drinking, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 14 (Xinhua) -- Heavy-drinking women, school
children who smoke and the overweight of both sexes are ruining
Britain's drive to create a healthy nation.
</P>
<P>
Only 11 of the 27 targets set by the Department of Health to
reduce premature death and avoidable sickness by promoting
sensible lifestyles look certain to be reached, according to an
official report.
</P>
<P>
The National Audit Office today reported limited progress in
achieving the aims of the Health of the Nation White Paper of
l992.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious strategy to reduce coronary heart disease,
strokes, cancer, mental illness, sexually transmitted diseases and
accidents was introduced by Virginia Bottomley when she was health
secretary.
</P>
<P>
Teams from the National Health Service formulated "action
plans" to improve education, screening and preventive techniques.
Healthy targets were set to be reached by dates between 1994 and
2005.
</P>
<P>
But despite the implementation of the strategy, John Bourn, the
comptroller and auditor general, reported that Britons' behavior
is becoming worse in three areas: obesity in men and women,
drinking by women and smoking by the young.
</P>
<P>
The British government set targets on obesity because it
increases the likelihood of coronary heart disease, strokes and
illnesses including diabetes.
</P>
<P>
The government wants only 8 percent of women and 6 percent of
men, aged 16 to 64, to be overweight by 2005: the same proportion
as in 1980. But instead figures since then have risen to 16
percent of women and 13 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
Alcohol targets were set because too much drink raises the
blood pressure, increasing the risk of stroke, and is blamed for
liver cirrhosis, cancers and road traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
However, the Health Department is refusing to consider a ban on
cigarette and alcohol advertising, saying it is up to the public
to change lifestyles, following government health education.
