CANBERRA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of Papua New
Guinea (PNG)'s tidal wave disaster may be more than 3,000,
Australian media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press (AAP) and the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) quoted missionaries or local PNG
officials in the disaster-stricken areas as saying the death toll
would surpass 3,000.
</P>
<P>
The official death toll, however, is still below 1,000.

<P>
Massive 10-meter high tidal waves powered by strong undersea
earthquakes wiped out at least three of 12 affected villages on
northwest coast of PNG's remote West Sepik province Friday night,
leaving 6,000 homeless, the ABC News Radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The population of the 12 villages is estimated at 10,000 to
12,000.
