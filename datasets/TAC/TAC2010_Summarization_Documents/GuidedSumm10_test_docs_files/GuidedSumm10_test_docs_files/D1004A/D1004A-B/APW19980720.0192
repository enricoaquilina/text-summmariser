	   VANIMO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The village of Arop was built on
a sand spit and had a population of about 2,000 people. It no
longer exists.
	   ``There was nothing left except for coconut trees,'' said
resident Lusien Romme, who said he saw ``the sea rising up and
coming toward me.''
	   Romme, who spoke with the Australian Associated Press by
telephone from his bed at Aitape's Raihu Health Center, broke two
fingers and injured his ribs and a shoulder when the 23-foot
(7-meter) wave hurled him into a coconut tree and then into the
Sissano lagoon. His wife was killed.
	   The wall of water, stirred up by a magnitude-7 undersea
earthquake, also destroyed at least three other villages Friday
night when it crashed into the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea,
a nation on the island of New Guinea, where some live a near-Stone
Age existence amid jungles and swamps.
	   The official death toll from Friday's disaster was at least 700,
mostly children and the elderly. But John Tekwi, governor of West
Sepik Province, where the wave hit, was quoted by Australian
Broadcasting Corp. on Monday as saying at least 3,000 people had
died.
	   ``Where is everybody else?'' Tekwi asked.
	   The assistant defense attache at the Australian High Commission
in Port Moresby, Col. Richard Humby, said latest figures indicated
more than 1,000 villagers had died and at least 2,000 more were
missing.
	   Scores of children were among the dead. Hundreds of people were
injured and were awaiting urgent medical help, while others were
believed to have fled to higher ground in the interior. An
estimated 6,000 people were left homeless.
	   ``Several villages were completely washed out to sea and there
is no trace left at all,'' said Australian Defense Department
spokesman Col. Keith Jobson in Canberra.
	   Jobson said the primary concern was to treat the injured and
provide them with food, water and shelter.
	   About 1,000 bodies had been buried and at least 3,000 people
were still missing, Jim Croucher, a Roman Catholic missionary who
is coordinating rescue and recovery efforts, told The Associated
Press.
	   ``You can smell the stench, you can smell the death in the
air,'' he said.
	   Missionaries and villagers were burying the dead where they lay
on the beaches. Others patrolled the sea in motorboats, towing nets
to try to reclaim floating bodies, Croucher said.
	   ``There were so many bodies together I had to move the boat
slowly to pass through them,'' said fisherman Jerry Apuan. ``I was
afraid. It was the first time I had seen so many bodies.''
	   Marc Sindek, an oil company manager from Vanimo, about 60 miles
(96 kilometers) west of the area wiped out by the tsunami, said
villagers had told him giant salt-water crocodiles that live along
the coast were feeding on the corpses.
	   Vanimo is the main administrative center of Papua New Guinea,
located close to the border of the Indonesian province of Iryan
Jaya.
	   Many survivors were still in shock.
	   A lot of people were emerging from the jungle in a daze,
according to an Associated Press photographer in the ruined village
of Sissano.
	   ``We heard a large bang, then saw the sea rising up. We had no
choice but to run for our lives,'' Paul Saroya, a resident of Nimas
village, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television.
	   The first of three Royal Australian Air Force C-130 cargo planes
arrived at Vanimo on Monday with emergency supplies including a
field hospital and 100 doctors, nurses and engineers. New Zealand
was sending relief supplies and a medical team.
	   The combined population of the affected district is not
precisely known, but government chief secretary Robert Igara
estimated it at between 6,000 and 10,000 people.
	   Rescue efforts have been hampered by the remoteness of the
region. Australian cargo planes had to fly 2,350 (3,780 kilometers)
miles to the disaster scene.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, occupies the
eastern half of the island of New Guinea. It has a mountainous,
jungle-filled interior that has only been explored in the past 20
to 30 years, along with lush tropical beaches on the coastal
plains. The capital, Port Moresby, is about 375 miles (600
kilometers) northeast of Australia.
	   The tsunami struck west of Aitape village in West Sepik
province, hitting villages about 370 miles (595 kilometers)
northwest of Port Moresby.
	   Area disaster coordinator Dickson Dalle said the villages of
Nimas and Warapu also had been swept from a low-lying sand spit
into Sissano lagoon.
	   Other villages along the heavily populated coastline were badly
damaged.
	   Dalle said the confirmed death toll was 700, including 500 dead
at Warapu. He said most of the victims were old people and
schoolchildren.
	   ``Schools in Arop, Sissano and Warapu will be closed because we
don't have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're all dead.''
	   The area consists of jungle and swamps where tribes rely on
subsistence farming and fishing. Most live in homes made of jungle
materials and built on beaches.
	   In Rome, Pope John Paul II, who has visited Papua New Guinea
twice during his papacy, dedicated his Sunday morning prayers to
the victims. A spokesman said the pope was ``very concerned'' and
asked to be kept informed.
