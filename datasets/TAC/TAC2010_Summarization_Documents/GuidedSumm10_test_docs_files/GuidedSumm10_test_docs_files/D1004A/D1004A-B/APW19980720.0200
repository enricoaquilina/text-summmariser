	   A tsunami is a series of sea waves caused by underwater
earthquakes, landslides or volcanos. Sometimes referred to as
``great sea waves,'' a tsunami can travel at speeds up to 450 miles
per hour (720 kilometers per hour) and waves range in height from a
harmless few inches (centimeters) to 100 feet (30 meters).
	   A magnitude-7 quake generated the deadly and destructive
23-foot-high (7-meter-high) wave that swamped Papua New Guinea's
northern coast Friday.
	   The worst tsunami on record followed the Aug. 27, 1883, eruption
of Krakatau volcano in the East Indies. Its 100-foot (30-meter)
waves killed more than 36,000 people on the coasts of Java and
Sumatra.
	   On April 1, 1946, an earthquake in the Aleutian Islands sent a
wave ashore on Unimak Island, Alaska, that killed five. Hours
later, it reached Hawaii, where it killed 159 people.
	   More recently, a July 12, 1993, quake under the Sea of Japan
spawned waves up to 100 feet (30 meters). About 200 people died.
	   Tsunami can occur anywhere, but are most common in the Pacific
Ocean. Use of the Japanese name for the waves reflects the fact
that Japan has been the most affected country, with more than
100,000 deaths recorded in about 250 tsunamis over the centuries.
