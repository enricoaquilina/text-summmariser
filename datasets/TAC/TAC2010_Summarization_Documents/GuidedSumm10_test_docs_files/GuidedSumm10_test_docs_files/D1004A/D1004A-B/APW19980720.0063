	   SISSANO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Bodies, shattered coconut palms
and the remains of flimsy huts floated off the shores of this
Pacific nation after a wall of water crashed into three villages.
The death toll Monday was at least 700, but could rise to 3,000
people.
	   Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted John Tekwi, governor of
West Sepik Province, as saying the 3,000 figure was
``conservative.'' Shortly before that, Papua New Guinea's national
radio quoted provincial officials as saying the toll could top
2,000.
	   There was no warning before the 23-foot (7-meter) wall of water
crashed into the northwest coast of Papua New Guinea, a nation on
the island of New Guinea north of Australia, where some people live
a near-Stone Age existence amid jungles and swamps.
	   The devastating wave, known as a tsunami, shattered the region
Friday after a magnitude-7 earthquake.
	   On Monday, many survivors were in shock. Rescue officials said
they expected to have a better idea later Monday on the death toll.
	   Entire villages have disappeared.
	   The village of Arop was built on a sand spit and had a
population of about 2,000 people. It no longer exists. There are no
people to be seen. Three other villages have also been destroyed.
	   ``There was nothing left except for coconut trees,'' said
resident Lusien Romme, whose wife was killed. Romme, who broke two
fingers and injured his ribs and shoulder, spoke to Australian
Associated Press by telephone from his bed at Aitape's Raihu Health
Center.
	   Romme said he saw ``the sea rising up and coming toward me''
before he was hurled into a coconut tree and then into the Sissano
lagoon.
	   The first of three Royal Australian Air Force C-130 transports
arrived at Vanimo on Monday with emergency supplies including a
field hospital and a 100-strong team of doctors, nurses and
engineers.
	   ``Our first Hercules transport aircraft landed this morning at
Vanimo, and that hospital is beginning to function and treat
casualties,'' Australian defense department spokesman Colonel Keith
Jobson said in Canberra.
	   Jobson said up to 700 people had been buried and hundreds of
people were injured, mostly with multiple fractures. He said
sanitation equipment had been sent to make water supplies safe.
	   ``Until those missing come out of the bush, if indeed they do
come out of the bush, it is very difficult to determine how many
were actually killed,'' he said.
	   ``Several villages were completely washed out to sea and there
is no trace left at all. The prime concern at the moment is to
treat the injured and of course provide the survivors, those that
were uninjured, with food, water and shelter.''
	   New Zealand is sending a Hercules aircraft with relief supplies
and another medical team.
	   Vanimo is about 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of the area wiped
out by the tsunami. It is the main administrative center and is
close to the border of the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya.
	   Fisherman Jerry Apuan said that he couldn't even count the
number of bodies floating near one of the devastated villages.
	   ``There were so many bodies together I had to move the boat
slowly to pass through them,'' he said. ``I was afraid. It was the
first time I had seen so many bodies.''
	   Scores of children were among the dead. Hundreds of people were
injured and were awaiting urgent medical help, while others were
believed to have fled to higher ground in the interior. An
estimated 6,000 people were left homeless.
	   ``We heard a large bang, then saw the sea rising up. We had no
choice but to run for our lives,'' Paul Saroya, a resident of Nimas
village, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, occupies the
eastern half of the island of New Guinea. It has a mountainous,
jungle-filled interior that has only been explored in the past 20
to 30 years, along with lush tropical beaches on the coastal
plains. The capital, Port Moresby, is about 375 miles (603
kilometers) east of Australia.
	   The tsunami struck west of Aitape in West Sepik province,
hitting villages about 370 miles (595 kilometers) northwest of Port
Moresby.
	   Area disaster coordinator Dickson Dalle said Monday the villages
of Nimas and Warapu have also been swept from a low-lying sand spit
into Sissano lagoon.
	   Other villages along the heavily populated coastline were also
badly damaged. The area, which was home to up to 10,000 people, was
deserted after villagers fled to higher ground.
	   Dalle said the confirmed death toll was 700, including 500 dead
at Warapu.
	   ``There are still people out there who are injured that we have
not rescued,'' he said. ``They're scattered all over in the
mangroves.''
	   Dalle said most of the victims were old people and
schoolchildren.
	   ``Schools in Arop, Sissano and Warapu will be closed because we
don't have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're all dead.''
	   The area is a jungle, swamp area that includes tribes that rely
on subsistence farming and fishing. Most live in homes made of
jungle materials and built on beaches.
	   In Rome, Pope John Paul II, who has visited Papua New Guinea
twice during his papacy, dedicated his Sunday morning prayers to
the victims. A spokesman said the pope was ``very concerned'' and
asked to be kept informed.
