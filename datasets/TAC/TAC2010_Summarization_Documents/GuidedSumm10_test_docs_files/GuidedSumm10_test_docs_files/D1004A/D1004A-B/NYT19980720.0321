   Relief workers continued counting the dead in Papua New Guinea
Monday, as fears rose that the giant wave that obliterated several
fishing villages on Friday swept away far more children than
adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most saddening thing is that 70 percent of the survivors
have been adults _ most of the children are dead,'' the Rev. Austen
Crapp, the administrator of the Catholic Diocese of Aitape, told
reporters Monday at a hospital where hundreds of survivors have
been treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What chance would a 2-year-old or a 3-year-old child have?''
Crapp asked. ``It wipes out everything, destroys everything,
bounces people off trees, bowls them into the lagoon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The children may be hiding somewhere,'' he added. ``We hope
so. But the current fear is that they have drowned.''
</P>
<P>
   As Australian aid workers opened a field hospital on high ground
and relief supplies began trickling in, Papua New Guinea's prime
minister, Bill Skate, toured the worst-hit villages and the Sissano
lagoon, choked with dead fish and hundreds of rotting human bodies.
Skate put the official death toll at 705, although he and other
officials said the final number might be closer to 2,000 or 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finding more dead bodies now than Monday _ every minute
and every hour we find more dead bodies,'' Skate said. ``I will
always remember this as long as I live.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency officials began to worry that the huge numbers of dead
might threaten the living through disease and contaminated water
supplies. The Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald reported that
workers had dug a hurried mass grave in Aitape, about 20 miles to
the east of where the tsunami hit, and buried 90 people who died of
injuries after being taken to the hospital there.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven villages in the nation's remote and rugged
northwest were destroyed on Friday evening when a tsunami reported
up to 30 feet high pounded the coast. The tsunami was caused by an
earthquake that registered 7 on the Richter scale, followed 20
minutes later by a second quake that registered 5.7. Officials said
between 6,000 and 10,000 people lived in the area, mostly relying
on subsistence farming and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wave crashed into the house,'' a survivor, Raymond Nimis,
told The National newspaper of Papua New Guinea. ``People were
dying everywhere. Some died under the house. Others got rolled in
by the wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Skate, who has declared a state of emergency, appealed to other
countries for help _ for doctors, food and building supplies. By
Monday, Australia had sent three C-130 transport planes full of
personnel and relief supplies, with a fourth expected on Tuesday.
New Zealand was also sending two planeloads of supplies.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred relief workers from Australia _ including 60 doctors
and nurses _set up a field hospital in Vanimo, about 50 miles away
from where the tsunami hit, in case of another earthquake. Several
helicopters, paid for by local mining companies, began ferrying
hundreds of wounded people there. Seventy gravediggers were also
airlifted to the Sissano lagoon, but found that many of the bodies
were too decomposed to be buried without machinery, The Morning
Herald reported.

   Some workers complained of a shortage of supplies, and in
Washington Monday, relief officials said it would be difficult to
get the needed supplies quickly to the area, which is mountainous
and covered with thick jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems in this area is how remote it is,'' said
Ann Stingle, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross, which is
helping to coordinate relief aid. ``It is two days by boat for
mobilizing a lot of the relief goods. So this is going to be quite
a logistical challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, nations expressed their condolences and
offered help. A Vatican spokesman said Monday that Pope John Paul
II was ``profoundly saddened'' by the disaster and hoped that the
``international community will show its solidarity by providing
prompt and effective assistance.'' The secretary-general of the
United Nations, Kofi Annan, offered to help assess the damage and
coordinate relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she
would visit the capital of Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby, on July
29. The spokesman, James Rubin, said Albright had announced plans
for a brief visit between meetings in the South Pacific before the
disaster. But now her visit may also include a pledge of aid, Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be sure on one hand we are not causing an
undue logistical burden,'' he said. ``On the other hand, she has
asked the administration and the department to look at ways to be
helpful to them as they face this catastrophe.''
