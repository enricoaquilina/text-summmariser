PARIS, July 20 (Xinhua) -- France said Monday that it is ready
to send humanitarian aid to Papua New Guinea, where more than
3,000 people were killed by three tidal waves which hit the
northern shore of the country last Friday.

French Foreign Ministry assistant spokesman Yves Doutriaux said
that such aid will be sent either directly by France or through
international aid agencies.

Thousands of people have also been made homeless since
Tsunamis, or tidal wave, obliterated villages following a 7.0
degree earthquake on Richter scale in the Bismarck Sea off Papua
New Guinea's northwest coast.
