	   SISSANO, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ The village of Arop was built
on a sand spit and had a population of about 2,000 people. It no
longer exists.
	   ``There was nothing left except for coconut trees,'' said
resident Lusien Romme, who said he saw ``the sea rising up and
coming toward me.''
	   The 23-foot (7-meter) wall of water, stirred up by a magnitude-7
undersea earthquake, also destroyed at least three other villages
Friday night when it crashed into the northwest coast of Papua New
Guinea, a nation on the island of New Guinea, north of Australia,
where some people live a near-Stone Age existence amid jungles and
swamps.
	   The official death toll Monday was at least 700, but John Tekwi,
governor of West Sepik Province, was quoted by Australian
Broadcasting Corp. as saying at least 3,000 people had died.
	   Brother Jim Croucher, a Roman Catholic missionary from Vanimo
who is cordinating rescue and recovery efforts, told The Associated
Press about 1,000 bodies had been buried so far and ''at least
3,000 are still missing.''
	   Missionaries and villagers are burying the dead where they lay
on the beaches.
	   Others patrolled the sea in motorboats, towing nets to try and
reclaim floating bodies, Croucher said.
	   Marc Sindek, an oil company manager from Vanimo, said villagers
had told him giant salt-water crocodiles which live along the coast
were feeding on the corpses.
	   Romme, who spoke with the Australian Associated Press by
telephone from his bed at Aitape's Raihu Health Center, broke two
fingers and injured his ribs and a shoulder when the wave hurled
him into a coconut tree and then into the Sissano lagoon. His wife
was killed.
	   On Monday, many survivors were in shock.
	   ``There's a lot of people coming out of the jungle, dazed still,
after three days,'' said an AP photographer at the ruined village
of Cissano.
	   ``They're fishing an awful lot of bodies out of the lagoon, and
finding an awful lot of bodies around the village as well,'' he
said.
	   The first of three Royal Australian Air Force C-130 transports
arrived at Vanimo on Monday with emergency supplies including a
field hospital and a 100-strong team of doctors, nurses and
engineers.
	   Hundreds of people were injured, mostly with multiple fractures,
Australian defense department spokesman Col. Keith Jobson said in
Canberra.
	   ``Until those missing come out of the bush, if indeed they do
come out of the bush, it is very difficult to determine how many
were actually killed,'' he said.
	   ``Several villages were completely washed out to sea and there
is no trace left at all. The prime concern at the moment is to
treat the injured and of course provide the survivors, those that
were uninjured, with food, water and shelter.''
	   New Zealand is sending a Hercules aircraft with relief supplies
and another medical team.
	   The combined population of the district is not precisely known,
but government chief secretary Robert Igara estimated it at
betweeen 6,000 and 10,000 people.
	   Rescue efforts have been hampered by the remotness of the
region. Australian transport planes had to fly 2,350 miles(3,780
kilometers) to the disaster scene.
	   Vanimo is about 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of the area wiped
out by the tsunami. It is the main administrative center and is
close to the border of the Indonesian province of Iryan Jaya.
	   Fisherman Jerry Apuan said that he couldn't even count the
number of bodies floating near one of the devastated villages.
	   ``There were so many bodies together I had to move the boat
slowly to pass through them,'' he said. ``I was afraid. It was the
first time I had seen so many bodies.''
	   Scores of children were among the dead. Hundreds of people were
injured and were awaiting urgent medical help, while others were
believed to have fled to higher ground in the interior. An
estimated 6,000 people were left homeless.
	   ``We heard a large bang, then saw the sea rising up. We had no
choice but to run for our lives,'' Paul Saroya, a resident of Nimas
village, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, occupies the
eastern half of the island of New Guinea. It has a mountainous,
jungle-filled interior that has only been explored in the past 20
to 30 years, along with lush tropical beaches on the coastal
plains. The capital, Port Moresby, is about 375 miles (603
kilometers) east of Australia.
	   The tsunami struck west of Aitape village in West Sepik
province, hitting villages about 370 miles (595 kilometers)
northwest of Port Moresby.
	   Area disaster coordinator Dickson Dalle said Monday the villages
of Nimas and Warapu have also been swept from a low-lying sand spit
into Sissano lagoon.
	   Other villages along the heavily populated coastline were also
badly damaged.
	   Dalle said the confirmed death toll was 700, including 500 dead
at Warapu. He said most of the victims were old people and
schoolchildren.
	   ``Schools in Arop, Sissano and Warapu will be closed because we
don't have the children,'' Dalle said. ``They're all dead.''
	   The area is a jungle, swamp area that includes tribes that rely
on subsistence farming and fishing. Most live in homes made of
jungle materials and built on beaches.
	   In Rome, Pope John Paul II, who has visited Papua New Guinea
twice during his papacy, dedicated his Sunday morning prayers to
the victims. A spokesman said the pope was ``very concerned'' and
asked to be kept informed.
