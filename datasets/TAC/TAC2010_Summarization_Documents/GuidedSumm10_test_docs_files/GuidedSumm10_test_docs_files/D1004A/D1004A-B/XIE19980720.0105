<HEADLINE> Australian Coastline at Risk From Tsunamis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Australia's northwest coastline
is most at risk from tsunamis caused by earthquakes generated in
the seismic-active Indonesian region.
</P>
<P>
Tsunami researchers at the National Tidal Facility (NTF) in
Adelaide said Monday the northwest coastline had been identified
as the most vulnerable area in Australia because of its proximity
to the undersea earthquake-prone Java Trench, according to reports
by the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The NTF has joined forces with the Bureau of Meteorology to
develop an Australian Tsunami Warning System which would alert
authorities to a pending tsunami.
</P>
<P>
The system would use seismological information from Australian
Geological Survey Organization and sea level data from NTF to
predict where a tsunami - a tidal wave caused by an earthquake -
would hit and how much damage it would cause.
</P>
<P>
NTF research assistant James Chittleborough said the NTF was
simulating tsunamis to determine which areas of the Australian
coast were most at risk and to develop a model which would be used
in the warning system.
</P>
<P>
The research involves a computer program known as a
hydrodynamical model which simulates water movement in a given
region using the governing laws of physics.
</P>
<P>
Chittleborough said the NTF would also use data from the
tsunamis which wiped out villages on the remote northwest coast of
Papua New Guinea Friday night, killing more than 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"It's a seismically active zone (around the Java Trench) so
that poses the most risk ... we've got tremors that occur fairly
often there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Meteorology marine and oceanography services national
coordinator Phil Parker said the Australian Tsunami Warning System
could be in operation within a year if the agencies received the
necessary funding to finalize their research.
</P>
<P>
Parker said tsunamis could occur at any time and it was
important for people involved in the warning system to be
well-prepared.
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be something that people follow every day because
these can happen at any moment," he said.
