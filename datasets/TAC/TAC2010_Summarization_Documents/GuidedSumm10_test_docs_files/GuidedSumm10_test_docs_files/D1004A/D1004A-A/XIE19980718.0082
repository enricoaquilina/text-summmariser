<HEADLINE> Australia Sends Aid to PNG Tsunami Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia will provide transport
for relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea
(PNG) following Friday's tsunami tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said a Royal
Australian Air Force C130 Hercules aircraft currently in PNG on
training exercises would be diverted to deliver relief supplies
such as tarpaulins and food to the affected areas in the country's
remote north.
</P>
<P>
"We will also transport a mobile hospital and associated
Australian Defense Force (ADF) medical personnel to the disaster
area to provide urgent medical assistance to injured victims,"
Downer said Saturday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The massive tidal wave wiped seven villages off the map,
leaving hundreds people dead or missing.
</P>
<P>
The 10-metre tsunami engulfed the heavily populated villages
near Aitape, 800 kilometers north of Port Moresby on Friday night
- 30 minutes after an undersea earthquake of about 7.0 on the
Richter scale in the area.
</P>
<P>
Many of the villagers are believed to have died instantly as
the deadly wall of water struck without warning, sending their
homes crashing into the raging torrent.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the federal government stood ready to consider
further requests for assistance from the PNG government.
