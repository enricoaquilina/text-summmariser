	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Huge sea waves set off by
an earthquake crashed against Papua New Guinea's north coast,
killing at least 70 people and crushing villages, the country's
National Disaster Center said.
	   The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water, called tsunami, hit
Friday night without warning just after an earthquake about 12
miles (30 kilometers) off the coast. The Australian Geological
Survey Organization said it had a preliminary magnitude of 7.0.
	   The disaster center said late Saturday that hundreds are missing
and thousands are without food and shelter.
	   ``We expect that about 3,000 people have been made homeless and
there has been an estimate of about 300 people dead or missing,''
Fr. Austin Crapp, a relief organizer, told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
	   He said most of the dead were children who drowned.
	   Disaster authorities said the seismic sea wave struck to the
west of the town of Aitape in the West Sepik province, hitting at
least four villages _ Sissano, Warapu, Arop and Malol.
	   The area is spotted with villages consisting of homes built on
beaches of jungle materials.
	   ``At Warapu, there is no house standing _ it's a village of
1,800 people,'' Crapp said. ``Arop, again, is 1,800 to 2,000 people
_ there's nothing standing there.
	   ``They (the two villages) are both clean sand. It's complete
devastation.''
	   A helicopter pilot who landed in Aitape on Saturday reported
seeing bodies floating among the debris in the lagoon, he said.
	   Papua New Guinea provincial disaster coordinator Peter Tavun
said homeless survivors were in desperate need of food and shelter.
	   Crapp said a helicopter was picking up injured people and
doctors had been flown in to treat them. The injured, mostly
suffering cuts and fractures, were being taken to a mission
hospital at Aitape.
	   Rob Parer, a businessman who lives near Aitape, said some
villagers who fled into the jungle after the tsunami struck are
still hiding there.
	   ``The people have never heard of anything like it. They thought
the world had ended,'' Parer told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
radio.
	   In Canberra, Australian seismologist Kevin McCue from the
Australian Geological Survey Organization said the earthquake's
epicenter was just off the town of Aitape.
	   ``It was a shallow, major earthquake,'' he said.
	   An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 is devastating if it hits
an urban area. The last tsunami in the area had been in December
1930 when a magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck the Admiralty Islands,
McCue said.
	   Meanwhile, Australia said Saturday it will provide transport for
relief supplies and a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea.
	   Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said a Royal
Australian Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft now in Papua New
Guinea on training exercises would be diverted to deliver relief
supplies.
	   ``We will also transport a mobile hospital and associated
Australian Defense Force medical personnel to the disaster area to
provide urgent medical assistance to injured victims,'' Downer said
in a statement.
