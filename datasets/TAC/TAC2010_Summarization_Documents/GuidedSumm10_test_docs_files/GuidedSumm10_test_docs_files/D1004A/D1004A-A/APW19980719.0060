	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A tsunami spawned by a 7.0
magnitude earthquake crashed into Papua New Guinea's north coast,
crushing villages and killing nearly 600 people, officials said
Sunday.
	   The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water hit Friday night without
warning following an earthquake about 18 miles (30 kilometers) off
the coast of Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean.
	   Australian government aid agency Ausaid officers in Papua New
Guinea estimated the final death toll would climb to more than
1,000, with many thousands injured, Australian Defense Minister Ian
McLachlan said.
	   Authorities at Aitape in the West Sepik province, on Papua New
Guinea's northwest coast, said the tsunami that hit the coast west
of the village on Friday night had wiped out three villages and had
almost completely destroyed another.
	   ``The latest death toll for the district is 599,'' district
disaster coordinating chairman Dickson Dalle said. ``But the figure
may increase as more bodies are found.''
	   Dalle said it was impossible to say how many people are missing.
	   ``There are still people out there who are injured that we have
not rescued,'' he said. ``They are scattered all over in the
mangroves.''
	   Dalle said most of the victims of the disaster were old people
and schoolchildren. Ausaid estimated 6,000 people were left
homeless, McLachlan said.
	   ``We have assumed that the schools in Arop, the schools in
Sissano and the schools in Warapu will be closed because we don't
have the children,`` Dalle said. ``They're dead . . . they're all
dead.''
	   Dalle said the Nimas village near the Sissano lagoon, the Warapu
village and the Arop village had been wiped out and the Malol
village had almost been completely destroyed.
	   Associated Press photographer Brian Cassey flew over the lagoon
Sunday and said the beaches on which a number of villages had been
built had been swept clean.
	   ``The villages no longer exist. The beaches are clean,'' Cassey
said. ``The lagoon is filled with debris, coconut palms and what
used to be houses.''
	   In Arop, where according to locals about 2,000 people lived,
there was no sign of life, he said. No bodies were visible from the
air.
	   ``The place is desolate. Not a soul is there,'' Cassey said.
	   Dalle said that at Warapu 500 people had been confirmed dead,
while Malol village had 40 dead and Sissano 41.
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate was expected to arrive in Aitape later
this afternoon to assess the situation.
	   Earlier, the National Disaster Center said that hundreds of
people were missing and thousands had no food or shelter.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, is largely
dependent on agriculture and mining. The capital of Port Moresby is
located about 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of the northeastern
tip of Australia.
	   Disaster authorities said the stricken area, about 600
kilometers (370 miles) northwest of the capital of Port Moresby, is
spotted with villages consisting of homes made of jungle materials
and built on beaches.
	   Robert Igara, the government's chief secretary, said the
population in the area affected by the tsunami was 8,000 to 10,000
people.
	   Three Australian Defense Forces Hercules C-130 transport planes
were due to takeoff from Australia late Sunday with equipment to
set up a filed hospital in the stricken region. A fourth was
diverted from training exercises in Papua New Guinea and has begun
making food drops, McLachlan said.
	   The condition of airstrips in the region was unknown and it was
not known if the planes would be able to land.
	   Small aircraft and helicopters are already ferrying some of the
injured to unaffected towns.
	   Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to Papua New Guinea, which is
a member of the Commonwealth, expressing her shock at the deaths.
	   ``She said she was shocked at the tidal wave, and that her
thoughts were with the families of the bereaved and injured,'' said
a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman.
