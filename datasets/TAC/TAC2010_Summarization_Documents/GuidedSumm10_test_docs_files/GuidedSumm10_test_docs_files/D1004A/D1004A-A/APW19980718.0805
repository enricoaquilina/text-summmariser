	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A tsunami spawned by a 7.0
magnitude earthquake crashed into Papua New Guinea's north coast,
crushing villages and leaving hundreds missing, officials said
Sunday.
	   The 23-foot (seven-meter) wall of water hit Friday night without
warning following an earthquake about 12 miles (30 kilometers) off
the coast of Papua New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean.
	   The National Disaster Center said Sunday that hundreds of people
are missing and thousands have no food or shelter. The Papua New
Guinea Defense Force was on standby Sunday and police and health
services officials expected the official death toll of 71 to rise.
	   ``We expect that about 3,000 people have been made homeless and
there has been an estimate of about 300 people dead or missing,''
Fr. Austen Crapp, a relief organizer, told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. (ABC) radio.
	   ABC radio, a government-owned corporation, quoted Australian
army officials Sunday as saying the death toll could rise to as
high as 2,000 people, but that figure could not be confirmed by
Australia's government.
	   Papua New Guinea, with a population of 4 million, is largely
dependent on agriculture and mining. The capital of Port Moresby is
located about 600 kilometers (375 miles) east of the northeastern
tip of Australia.
	   Disaster authorities said the wave struck to the west of the
town of Aitape in the West Sepik province, hitting at least four
villages.
	   The area, about 600 kilometers (370 miles) northwest of the
capital of Port Moresby, is spotted with villages consisting of
homes made of jungle materials built on beaches.
	   Robert Igara, the government's chief secretary, said in a
statement that a community school, government station, Catholic
mission station and the Nimas village in the Sissano area west of
Aitape had been completely destroyed. Thirty people were confirmed
dead.
	   The Warapu village had also been completely destroyed, with 11
confirmed deaths and many missing, Igara said.
	   Sixteen people were confirmed dead in the devastated Arop
village, and two children had died in Malol, which was wiped out.
Five people died in the Teles-Lambu villages.
	   Igara said the population in the area affected by the tsunami
was 8,000 to 10,000 people.
	   ``Officers are now visiting the affected villages and areas to
establish the whereabouts, safety and health of the population,''
he said.
	   Australia said it will provide transport for relief supplies and
a mobile hospital to Papua New Guinea. Other air force transport
planes were on standby in Sydney, ready to fly supplies in if
requested by the Papua New Guinean government.
	   Queen Elizabeth II sent a message to Papua New Guinea, which is
a member of the Commonwealth, expressing her shock at the deaths.
	   ``She said she was shocked at the tidal wave, and that her
thoughts were with the families of the bereaved and injured,'' said
a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman.
