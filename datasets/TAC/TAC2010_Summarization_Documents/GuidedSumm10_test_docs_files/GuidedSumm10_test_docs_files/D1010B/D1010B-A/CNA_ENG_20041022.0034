</HEADLINE>

<P>
Department of Health officials said Friday
that there is no timetable for reintroducing the importation of U.S.
beef to Taiwan after America was declared an area affected by mad cow
disease late last year.
</P>
<P>
The health department suspended the import of beef and related
products from the United States on Dec. 24, 2003, the same day that
the United States announced it had discovered a case of mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
In late March, the United States applied to Taiwan's health
department to have the ban lifted.
</P>
<P>
Chen Lu-hung, director of the health department's Bureau of Food
Sanitation, noted that although there was only a single case of mad
cow disease found in the United States, the actual situation in the
United States has to be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
If everything is fine, U.S. beef can again be imported to Taiwan
soon, perhaps sometime between late this year or early next year,
Chen added.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen said, if there is any doubt over the quality of the
beef, the ban will not be lifted at that time.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, testing for mad cow disease from June 1 to Oct. 17 on
85,812 cows came up negative, indicating that there is very little
chance that American cows have mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.S. government has adopted stricter
slaughtering techniques to prevent possible infection, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Chen also stressed that although a Taiwan "mad cow disease
advisory committee" has suggested a conditional re-importation of
American beef, Chen said it is necessary that a team be formed to
check whether the new butchery measures are fully implemented.
