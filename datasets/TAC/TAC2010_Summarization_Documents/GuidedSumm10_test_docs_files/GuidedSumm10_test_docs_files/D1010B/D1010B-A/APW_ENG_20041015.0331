EU to spend euro98.1 million (US$122 million) on mad cow testing next
year
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The European Union head office said Friday it was allocating euro98.1
million (US$122 million) on testing cattle across the 25-nation bloc
to prevent the spread of mad cow disease next year.
</P>
<P>
The money would come from the euro188 million (US$235 million) set
aside in 2005 to combat animal diseases in the EU.
</P>
<P>
Under EU rules, all cattle for human consumption older than 30
months, all dead-on-farm cattle and emergency slaughtered cattle over
24 months have to be tested for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or
mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission helps co-fund the testing with national
governments.
</P>
<P>
The EU said the program was one of 82 programs tackling 10 major
animal diseases, including rabies, mad cow, and scrapie, a similar
brain-wasting disease found in sheep.
</P>
<P>
EU Health and Consumer Affairs Commissioner David Byrne said the
European Commission was boosting spending next year as a "commitment
to supporting pro-active monitoring, preventative action and disease
eradication.
</P>
<P>
"Healthy animals are the key to safe food," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
EU governments have made fighting animal diseases a top priority
after the mad cow crisis and foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks over
the last decade across Europe.
</P>
<P>
The health scares rattled consumer confidence in meat products and
how farm produce is controlled.
</P>
<P>
Mad cow sprang up in Britain in 1986 and spread through Europe and
Asia, prompting massive destruction of herds and devastating the
European beef industry.
</P>
<P>
A human form of the disease, which can be fatal, is believed to come
from eating beef products from cows struck with mad cow disease,
especially tissue close to the animal's nervous system.
