<P>
Japanese and US officials began talks Thursday on resuming US beef
shipments to top export market Japan, banned last year over mad cow
disease fears, amid signs of a resolution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The two-day talks, the fourth round since the ban was imposed in
December, come after two Japanese ministries last week recommended
exempting cows aged 20 months or younger from screening tests.
</P>
<P>
Japan had insisted on testing all US beef imports as a condition for
lifting the ban, which the US side has refused, but the difficulty in
detecting the disease in younger cows led Japan to back down.
</P>
<P>
Cows aged 20 months or younger account for some 80 percent of Japan's
total US beef imports, according to Japan's health ministry.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the largest export market for US beef, is among about three
dozen countries that halted US beef imports after mad cow disease was
discovered there in December 2003.
</P>
<P>
Japan has screened every cow slaughtered for consumption after
confirming mad cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in its
own herd in September 2001. The 14th case in Japan was confirmed last
week.
