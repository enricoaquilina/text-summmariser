Ireland suffers first suspected case of human form of mad cow disease
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ireland may have suffered its first homegrown case of the human form
of mad cow disease after a man in his early 20s was hospitalized in
Dublin for suspected variant Crutzfeld-Jakob Disease.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's health department confirmed that the man, who is in his
early 20s, has never received or donated blood, and has lived all his
life in Ireland. The government declined to identify the man or the
hospital treating him.
</P>
<P>
The fatal brain-wasting disease is believed to come from eating beef
products from cows struck with mad cow disease. But a positive
diagnosis of vCJD often does not occur until the patient dies and can
be autopsied.
</P>
<P>
Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, eats holes in
the brains of cattle. It appeared in Britain in 1986 and spread
through Europe and Asia, prompting massive destruction of herds and
devastating the European beef industry. Cases have also been detected
in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
So far 147 people in Britain, and another 10 elsewhere, are known to
have contracted vCJD since it was first identified in 1996 in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Until now, only one Irish resident has died from vCJD: a young mother
who spent most of her life in England.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's Food Safety Authority said that if the suspected Irish
victim had contract the disease from contaminated meat, he probably
would have done so more than a decade ago. Scientists say the disease
has an incubation period of 10 years or more.
</P>
<P>
Ireland banned the use of meat and bone meal as cattle feed, the
suspected origin of mad cow disease, in 1990. Agriculture Department
inspectors continue to identify and destroy cattle infected with BSE,
including 104 this year. The vast bulk of them are elderly dairy
cattle who would have eaten cattle-based feed in the 1980s.
