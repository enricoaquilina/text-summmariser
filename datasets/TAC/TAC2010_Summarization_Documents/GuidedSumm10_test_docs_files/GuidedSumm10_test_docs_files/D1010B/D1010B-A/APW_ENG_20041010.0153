Emory University says patients not exposed to human version of mad
cow after earlier alert
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emory University Hospital has confirmed that a brain surgery patient
does not have the human version of mad cow disease, but does have a
rare, fatal disorder that resembles it.
</P>
<P>
The hospital issued an alert more than a week ago saying preliminary
tests on the unidentified patient produced a diagnosis of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It warned that at least 500 other patients
may have been exposed to the disease if they came into contact with
surgical instruments used on the patient.

<P>
In a letter dated Friday, medical Director Robert B. Smith III said
laboratory tests came back positive but also "confirmed that this is
not the disease commonly called 'mad cow disease.'"
</P>
<P>
The human form of mad cow disease is called variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
</P>

Smith said it is extremely unlikely other patients would have been
exposed to the disease. "Although we cannot guarantee your risk of an
exposure is absolutely zero, it is immeasurably lower, for example,
than other types of potential infections that sometimes occur in a
hospital or other clinical surgical settings," he said.
