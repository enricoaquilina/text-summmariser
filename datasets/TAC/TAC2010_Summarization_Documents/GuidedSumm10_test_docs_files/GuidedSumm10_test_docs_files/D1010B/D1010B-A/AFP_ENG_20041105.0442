Beef in Bulgaria not properly tested for mad cow disease: expert
</HEADLINE>

SOFIA, Nov 5 (AFP)

<TEXT>
<P>
Beef sold in Bulgaria since June 2004 has not been certified free of
mad cow disease because the test used is not officially recognised by
the European Union, mad-cow expert Roumen Valchovski said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Beef and sheep meat has been tested but certificates were not issued
due to the fact that the test used has not been officially recognised
by the European Union. Tons of meat went to the market in violation
of European norms", Valchovski, a virus expert and medical doctor,
told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Since 2001 Bulgaria has been using one of five tests approved by the
European Commission. In June 2004 the country switched to a Dutch
test not yet recognised by the commission's veterinary control
service.
</P>
<P>
In an interview in the Bulgarian newspaper Troud, the director of
Bulgaria's laboratory for detecting mad cow, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), Raiko Pechev said the Dutch test was "more
precise, more rapid" than tests already approved by the EU and "is in
its last stage of EU pre-certification trials".
</P>
<P>
Kiril Kirov, director of the government's veterinary service, told
the newspaper 168 hours that "the import and the usage of the Dutch
test is a violation of EU requirements".
</P>
<P>
"The use of a test, which has not been approved either in Holland or
in any other EU country is a time-bomb", Roumen Petkov, director of
the state's food veterinary control service told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can keep their eyes shut anymore about such a serious
problem. We are now awaiting the results of a police investigation of
the case in order to find out who should be held responsible", deputy
agriculture minister Boiko Boev told 168 hours.
</P>
<P>
In the mid 1990s the British government announced a probable link
between BSE and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), the human
form of mad cow disease, which can cause personality change, loss of
body function, and eventually death.
</P>
<P>
No cases of mad cow disease have been registered in Bulgaria, where
beef meat began to be closely examined for the disease in 2001.
