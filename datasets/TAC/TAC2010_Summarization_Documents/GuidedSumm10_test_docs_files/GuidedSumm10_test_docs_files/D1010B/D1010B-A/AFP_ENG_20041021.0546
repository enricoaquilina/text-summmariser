Blood donor diagnosed with mad cow disease in France

PARIS, Oct 21 (AFP)

<P>
A person who donated blood several times over the past 10 years has
been diagnosed as the eighth case of the human form of mad cow
disease in France since the invariably fatal illness was declared a
public health risk in 1996, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The person, was not identified publicly, was discovered to have
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), which causes personality
change, loss of body function, brain deterioration and eventually
death, officials from the health ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, public health authorities have warned that people may
catch vCJD from eating meat infected with mad cow disease, also known
as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or from infected blood
transfusions.
</P>
<P>
The first signs of mad cow disease emerged in Britain 10 years
earlier, in 1986, but the government there denied there was any
danger until the evidence became impossible to ignore. The likely
vector of contamination for livestock was brain and nerve tissue
mixed in animal feed.
</P>
<P>
An EU ban on British beef and widespread cattle culls followed the
1996 alert, but by then the disease had spread to other countries.
</P>
<P>
Some 141 people are known to have died of vCJD in Britain.
</P>
<P>
EU embargoes on British beef from animals aged over 30 months could
be lifted from next year following a 95 percent fall in the number of
cases of mad cow disease recorded in Britain over the past three and
a half years, according to a European Commission report released
Monday.
