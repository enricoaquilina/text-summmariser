<P>
The Japanese government announced 
Friday mad cow disease was behind the death of man in December, 
the first confirmed human death case in Japan as a result of the 
deadly infection.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare suspects the patient 
in his 50s was infected with the variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease
in Britain where he had stayed for about a month in around 1989.
</P>
<P>
The man first showed symptoms of the disease in December 2001.
</P>
<P>
Mad cow disease, or formally known as bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy, was first diagnosed in Britain in 1986, and spread
through countries in Europe, Asia and North America.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, more than 150 people have died of the brain-wasting
disease, which can be contracted by human being through eating 
infected beef product.
</P>
<P>
Japan found its first mad cow case in 2001, and imposed a 
sweeping ban on US beef in December 2003 when the disease debuted 
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said people will not get infected with the 
human variant of mad cow disease by eating domestically produced 
beef in Japan because Japan tests all cattle for mad cow disease 
and requires meat producers to remove all the dangerous cow parts.
