Cow from diseased Canadian animal's herd traced to U.S.

<P>
U.S. government officials were trying to trace a cow shipped to the United
States from the same Canadian herd as an animal infected with mad cow disease,
yet officials said it was unlikely the imported cow had been
infected.
</P>
<P>
Canada announced a case of mad cow disease on Sunday, days after the Bush
administration said it would lift a U.S. ban on Canadian cattle.
</P>
<P>
The infected dairy cow was 8 years old and from Alberta. It was born in the same
herd, within one year, of a cow shipped to the United States in February 2002
for immediate slaughter, the Agriculture Department said.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, investigators identified 93 dairy and 48 beef animals that were born
in the year before through the year after the infected cow was delivered in
October 1996. Investigators are trying to trace all 141 animals, including the
one shipped to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"USDA believes it is extremely unlikely that this imported cow would have been
infected," said Ron DeHaven, administrator for the agency's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, DeHaven said, the department is making "every reasonable effort to
obtain and provide information about the disposition of this animal as well as
any other birth cohorts that are traced to the United States through Canada's
epidemiological investigation."
</P>
<P>
In May 2003, when the first Canadian cow tested positive for mad cow disease,
officials traced a small number of animals from the same herd to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
American cattle producers said the government's announcement confirms their
belief that Canadian cattle imports should not resume as scheduled on March
7.
</P>
<P>
"It further demonstrates that USDA is dangerously premature in issuing this
final rule," said Bill Bullard, chief executive officer of R-CALF United
Stockgrowers of America.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota, questioned whether Canada is
enforcing a ban on use of cattle remains in cattle feed, which regulators say is
the best way of preventing the disease's spread.
</P>
<P>
"All of us have to hope that this animal is not contaminated, it's not sick, and
it's not entered the food chain," Conrad said. "But what this is telling us is
that there's a real risk. We've got a series of red flags. We ought to pay
attention. The consequences of a failure to get this right are just too
great."
</P>
<P>
Mad cow disease is the common name for bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE.
People who eat tainted meat can contract a fatal brain disease called variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
</P>
<P>
More than 170,000 U.S. animals have been tested for the disease since officials
discovered the lone U.S. case of mad cow disease in Washington state in December
2003. That animal also was imported from Canada.
