The U.S. government will spend an additional $2 million on research into mad cow
disease, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The money will pay for collaboration with laboratories in Britain, Italy and
Spain. Funds will also go toward a facility being built in Ames, Iowa, for
long-term study spanning at least the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The funding comes on top of the $4.7 million the Agriculture Department will
spend this year to research the disease. President Bush has proposed increasing
funding to $12 million in 2006.

<P>
Boosting research to better understand mad cow and other infections will make
the nation's food supply more secure, Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns said in
a speech to the National Restaurant Association's Food Safety Summit in
Washington.

Commonly called mad cow disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy is a
brain-wasting ailment that, in humans, causes a variant form of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. That disease is a degenerative, fatal brain disorder
that has killed more than 150 people, mostly in Britain, where there was an
outbreak in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In North America, four cows tested positive in 2003 and 2005 for mad cow
disease. Three were in Canada; one was in the United States, although it had
been imported from Canada.
