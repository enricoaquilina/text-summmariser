Gene shields some from human version of mad cow disease: report

A gene may protect some people from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the
human brain wasting form of mad cow disease, researchers said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Transgenic experiments on mice show that substitution of an aminoacid
in the "prion" proteins will produce symptoms different from variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), according to the study by British
scientists to be published in Science magazine on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is the misfolded prions that cause the brain-wasting disease in
cattle and humans.
</P>
<P>
So far, vCJD has only been found in persons whose genetic code has
been programmed to allow a specific spot in the prions to contain
methionine amino acid, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Transmission from cow to human is limited by a barrier that usually
disappears when the disease is passed from one animal to another of
the same species, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
The experiments found that the barrier persists in mice expressing a
human valine amino acid in the place of the methionine.
</P>
<P>
The valine hindered vCJD, as well as mad cow, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE).
</P>
<P>
The researchers, led by Jonathan D. F. Wadsworth at University
College London, concluded that some persons will be more resistant to
vCJD, and that those persons who do get it, will have different
symptoms.
