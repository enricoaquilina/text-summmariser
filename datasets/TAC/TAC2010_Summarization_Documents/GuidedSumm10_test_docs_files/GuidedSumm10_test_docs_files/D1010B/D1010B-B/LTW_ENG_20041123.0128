No Disease in Suspected Mad Cow

<P>
Definitive testing has ruled out mad cow disease in an
animal that federal officials had identified last week as a potential
carrier, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The result cheered the beef industry, which had braced itself to
hear that a second case of mad cow disease had been discovered in the
United States. The first case was discovered last December in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Agriculture said scientists had carried out a the
test at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa --
and repeated it the test a second time to be sure.
</P>
<P>
In a statement late Tuesday afternoon, John Clifford, Deputy
Administrator at USDA's Animal &amp; Plant Health Inspection Service, said
the negative result first became known on Monday. But because two
preliminary tests had raised a suspicion of mad cow infection,
scientists asked to run a second immunohistochemistry test, he said.
The result from that test became available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
``We feel very confident that it is negative,'' said Clifford in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
``Negative? I'm surprised,'' commented David Ropeik, who has
closely followed the case as director of Risk Communication at the
Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, which has studied the potential
impact of mad cow disease in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Ropeik had previously said that the fact that two preliminary tests
had raised red flags about the meat sample suggested it was likely to
be positive for mad cow. ``It is going to be a quieter Thanksgiving,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
The news is certain to relieve the beef industry, which is still
recovering following the discovery of the first U.S. case of mad cow
disease, in an animal that came originally from Canada. American beef
exports came to a virtual standstill, and many of the resulting trade
barriers have yet to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Clifford said he did not expect the negative finding to have any
impact on trade. In conversations with countries that import U.S.
beef, he said, foreign officials had made clear that the discovery of
one or two cases of mad cow disease in the United States would not
lead them to conclude that U.S. beef was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
Mad cow disease is known to cause a brain wasting disease in some
people who eat infected beef, but various experts argue that even if
there are a few diseased animals in America, the public health is not
at risk because of safety measures that prevent potentially infectious
tissue from reaching consumers and or being added to the feed given to
other cattle.
</P>
<P>
When the Ames lab in Iowa found evidence of mad cow disease last
year in a tissue sample from a Holstein in Washington state, Ropeik
noted, officials sent tissue samples for confirmatory tests to a
reference lab in the United Kingdom, which he called ``the 24 carat
gold standard.'' He described the Iowa lab as ``reliable ... the 18
carat gold standard.''
</P>
<P>
Ropeik said he saw no reason for additional testing this time, and
Clifford said USDA has no plans to conduct further tests.
</P>
<P>
The USDA official said the cow in question had been incinerated and
none of its tissues had entered the human food supply or the animal
feed chain. Apart from identifying the animal as a cow, officials did
not provide any details, such as its location or age.
</P>
<P>
Carol Tucker Foreman of the nonprofit consumer advocacy group,
Consumer Federation of America, said that while the good news was a
relief, USDA ``rules don't cover all potentially hazardous tissues,
don't protect against cross contamination and aren't adequately
enforced.'' She called on the agency and the Food and Drug
Administration to step up tougher safety policies and enforcement.
