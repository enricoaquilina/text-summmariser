U.S. checking possible new case of mad cow disease

<P>
The government is checking a possible case of mad cow disease, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The susected case, in a beef cow, had tested negative for mad cow disease.
Initial tests have shown the disease three times since an infected cow turned up
in December 2003 in Washington state. The department decided this week to
perform additional tests, and one of the three turned up positive.
</P>
<P>
The sample is being subjected to additional tests, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to require additional testing before we can confirm one way or
another whether this is BSE (mad cow disease)," said Dr. John Clifford, chief
veterinary officer of the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service.
</P>
<P>
Clifford could not say whether the cow was born in the United States. The
Washington state animal had been imported from Canada, which has had three other
cases of mad cow disease. Investigators never located all 80 of the cattle that
crossed the border into the United States with the infected animal.
</P>
<P>
Commonly called mad cow disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, is a
brain-wasting ailment. In humans, it can cause a variant of the degenerative,
fatal brain disorder known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It has killed more than
150 people, mostly in Britain, where there was an outbreak in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
"This animal did not enter the food supply or the feed supply," Agriculture
Secretary Mike Johanns said on a telephone conference call with reporters. "The
firewalls we have in place do work."
</P>
<P>
Johanns said the new test result should not interfere with efforts to reopen
foreign beef markets. Dozens of countries banned U.S. beef imports after the
Washington state case. Japan, once the biggest customer of U.S. beef, has not
yet lifted its ban despite agreeing to do so last fall.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the department has been trying to lift a U.S. ban on Canadian
cattle that was imposed after Canada's first BSE case in May 2003. The border
was scheduled to reopen in March, but a federal judge in Billings, Montana,
ordered it be kept closed at the request of ranchers suing to block Canadian
cattle imports.
</P>
<P>
"I don't anticipate problems with our trading partners," Johanns said. "They'll
want to know what the issues are and what we have done. We want to assure them,
and to assure the public, that what we are doing here is transparent."
</P>
<P>
Johanns said he received the test result 10 minutes before announcing
it.
