	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government will require fuller reports  
from industry about toxic chemicals released into the environment 
so the public can learn more about companies' potential to pollute, 
President Clinton said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tighter rules, effective Jan. 1., apply to 27 substances  
and, for the first time, cover the industrial byproduct dioxin. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his weekly radio address, also announced two other  
executive actions, both land acquisitions: 14,000 acres in a 
California desert national park and a 95,000-acre ranch in New 
Mexico where one of the world's largest herds of elk roams free. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also repeated a threat to veto the Interior Department  
spending bill if the Republican-controlled Congress does not remove 
provisions on logging in national forests, oil production, and 
toxic-waste mining rules on federal lands. The president also wants 
more money for voluntary community river restorations. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP believes the bill is friendly to the environment while  
protecting Social Security, Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., chairman of 
the House Republican Conference, said in a statement responding to 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chemical rules from the Environmental Protection Agency  
will apply to a company based on the amount of ``persistent 
bioaccumulative toxics'' it uses. Those are chemicals that do not 
break down easily and build up in the environment to the point 
where they are passed through the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the simplest but most potent tools in our fight against  
pollution is public information,'' Clinton said. ``By requiring 
industries to tell communities how much they pollute the air and 
water, we empower citizens to fight back and create a powerful 
incentive for industry to pollute less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proof, he said, is that industry's toxic pollution has fallen  
almost 50 percent in the decades since reporting requirements took 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Current rules require release reports by companies that  
manufacture or process more than 25,000 pounds or use more than 
10,000 pounds of toxic chemicals a year. The new rules will require 
reports by companies that use 100 pounds a year, or, for some 
especially dangerous chemicals, 10 pounds a year. 
</P>
<P>
	For dioxin, companies using as little as one-tenth of a gram  
must announce releases. Dioxin is produced by the burning of waste, 
especially plastics and chlorine-based chemicals. It has been 
linked to cancer and birth defects and was an ingredient of the 
defoliant Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sierra Club welcomed the rules as ``a major step in assuring  
Americans of a clean, healthy environment.'' The U.S. Public 
Interest Research Group found some ``some serious flaws'' that 
``will still allow a significant amount of pollution to go 
unreported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The land acquisitions followed Clinton's order to the Forest  
Service two weeks ago to protect more than 40 million acres of 
roadless areas in national forests. The White House said almost 150 
million public and private acres across the nation have been 
protected or enhanced in the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton linked the acquisitions with Saturday's fifth  
anniversary of his signing of the California Desert Act in 1994 to 
preserve that fragile environment. Saturday's donation of 14,000 
acres in the Joshua Tree National Park came from the nonprofit 
Wildlands Conservancy to mark the anniversary, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also has agreed to preserve New Mexico's Baca  
Ranch, which Washington is to buy from its Texas owners for $101 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., introduced legislation in 1997 to  
allow the Forest Service to buy the property. Congress approved $40 
million last week as a down payment on the purchase, but the money 
is in the Interior bill that Clinton says he will veto. The money 
is expected to be in whatever compromise bill finally reaches the 
president's desk.
