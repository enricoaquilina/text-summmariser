<HEADLINE> Declassified Document Reveals U.S. Use of Defoliants in S. Korea </HEADLINE>

SEOUL, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Forces Korea sprayed
more than 21,000 gallons of toxic defoliants in 1968-1969 along
the south of the Demilitarized Zone, South Korean media reports
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
None of some 7,000 South Korean soldiers knew they were
spraying three kinds of toxic materials -- Agent Orange, Agent
Blue and Monuron, and they were not given any warnings, masks or
proper protective gears, the media reports said, quoting a
declassified document of the U.S. Department of the Army.
</P>
<P>
The document said that under the "Vegetation Control Program
1968," the toxic defoliants were sprayed in the area some 100
meters wide and 155 miles long along the south of buffer zone to "
deny hostile forces the concealment provided by vegetation."
</P>
<P>
C.H. Bonesteel, then commander of the U.S. Forces Korea,
recommended spraying defoliants and got approval from then U.S.
Secretary of State Dean Rusk and South Korean Prime Minister Chung
Il-kwon.
</P>
<P>
The media reports accused both the U.S. and South Korean
governments of covering up the fact in the past 30 years, saying
many South Korean soldiers might have suffered cancers from the
sprayed defoliants.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Defense Ministry said Tuesday its has not
confirmed whether defoliants were used in the country.
</P>
<P>
The United States has denied use of defoliants in any other
country except Vietnam.
