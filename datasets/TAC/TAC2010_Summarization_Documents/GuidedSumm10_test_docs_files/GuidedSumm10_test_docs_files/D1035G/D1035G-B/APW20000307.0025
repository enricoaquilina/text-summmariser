<HEADLINE> Defense Chief Cohen To Tour Vietnam  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost 27 years after the last American troops
left South Vietnam, Defense Secretary William Cohen is preparing to
visit unified communist Vietnam next week to discuss closer
military relations.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who did not serve in the military, will be the first
American defense chief to visit Vietnam since the war, which cost
the lives of more than 58,000 U.S. servicemen and killed an
estimated 3 million Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the trip Monday, the Pentagon released no details.
Cohen is expected go to Hanoi, the capital, and Ho Chi Minh City,
known as Saigon before it fell to the North Vietnamese in April
1975.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States and Vietnam normalized relations in
June 1995, there has been almost no military-to-military
relationship other than cooperation in recovering remains of
American servicemen. About 1,500 U.S. servicemen are unaccounted
for in Vietnam, another 500 in Laos and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   During his two-day stay, Cohen is expected to visit a site in
northern Vietnam where U.S. and Vietnamese forensics specialists
are attempting to recover remains. The U.S. portion of the recovery
operation is run by Joint Task Force-Full Accounting, an arm of the
U.S. Pacific Command based in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. veterans groups have generally been supportive of the
Pentagon's efforts to maintain Vietnamese cooperation on the
recovery of war remains and to work with Hanoi on other war-related
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think this is just great,'' Scott Campbell, spokesman for
Vietnam Veterans of America, said when told of Cohen's planned
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League
of POW/MIA Families, called it a ''positive step'' that can serve
to reinforce the seriousness of resolving the remaining cases of
missing servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   The last visit by an American defense secretary was in the early
1970s by Melvin Laird, who was in Saigon before the last American
troops were withdrawn and U.S. prisoners of war released in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Military-to-military cooperation between communist Vietnam and
the United States began in 1988 when the first joint field
investigations on American MIAs were held. In 1991 the United
States opened a military compound in Hanoi, known as ''The Ranch,''
to house U.S. officials involved in remains recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's visit will coincide with a period of national
celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the communist victory
over the U.S.-backed South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goals for this trip are to try to make our
military-to-military relations with Vietnam more regular and
routine,'' a senior official said Monday. He discussed the trip on
condition that he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has been pushing for the United States to help resolve
the legacy of Agent Orange, the herbicide sprayed by U.S. Air Force
planes in a defoliation operation from 1962 to 1970. Vice President
Nguyen Thi Binh said last week an estimated 1 million Vietnamese
suffer effects of Agent Orange's highly toxic component dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   During his talks in Vietnam, Cohen is expected to say the
Clinton administration is prepared to conduct joint research on
Agent Orange, the U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is to visit Hong Kong this weekend before flying to
Vietnam. He also will visit Tokyo and Seoul.
