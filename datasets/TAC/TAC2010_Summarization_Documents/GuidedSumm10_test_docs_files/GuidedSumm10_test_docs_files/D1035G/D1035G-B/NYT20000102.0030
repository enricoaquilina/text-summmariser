<P>
   Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., who as chief of naval operations in
the early 1970s ordered the Navy to end racial discrimination and
demeaning restrictions on sailors, then faced a haunting personal
tragedy that he related to ordering the deployment of the defoliate
Agent Orange in Vietnam, died Sunday at the Duke University Medical
Center in Durham, N.C. He was 79 and lived in McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from surgery for a cancerous chest
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1970, when Zumwalt, at 49, became the youngest man to
serve as the Navy's top-ranking uniformed officer, re-enlistments
were plunging in the face of an unpopular war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to make naval service an appealing career again, Zumwalt
issued 121 directives over the next four years, highly publicized
Z-Grams (Z for Zumwalt) that sought to change the way the Navy had
done things for almost two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including many retired admirals, asserted that Zumwalt
had created a permissive atmosphere endangering shipboard
discipline, and these accusations were fueled by racial incidents
on the aircraft carriers Kitty Hawk and Constellation in 1972.
Zumwalt believed that the antipathy toward his changes reflected
racial prejudice, and in November 1972 he summoned senior officers
to the Pentagon and accused them of ignoring his directives on race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite resistance, he made progress as chief of naval
operations. Re-enlistments by first-term sailors rose sharply, the
number of black personnel increased, and the first black admiral,
Samuel L. Gravely Jr., was appointed.
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt retired in 1974, but a decade later he was back in the
public eye, enmeshed in family anguish arising from the Vietnam
War. While serving as commander of American naval forces in Vietnam
from 1968 to 1970, he had ordered the spraying of the defoliant
Agent Orange in the Mekong Delta, seeking to deny cover to enemy
snipers on the river banks where his patrol boats operated. One
boat commander was Lt. Elmo Zumwalt III, his son.
</P>
<P>
   The two wrote a book, ``My Father, My Son'' (Macmillan, 1986),
telling of the younger Zumwalt's battle against cancer that both
men attributed to Agent Orange's toxic byproduct, dioxin. The story
was made into a CBS television dramatic production with the same
title, which was broadcast in May 1988. Three months later, Elmo
Zumwalt III died of cancer at age 42, leaving a wife and two
children.
</P>
<P>
   Elmo Russell Zumwalt Jr. was born in San Francisco on Nov. 29,
1920, the son of doctors, and was reared in Tulare, Calif., where
he was given the nickname Bud. He would carry it throughout his
career.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1942, won a Bronze
Star on a destroyer in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines
in 1944 and served on the battleship Wisconsin in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, he came to the attention of Paul H. Nitze,
the veteran Washington foreign-policy adviser, after writing a
paper on Soviet politics at the National War College. During the
Cuban missile crisis he was an aide to Nitze, who was assistant
secretary of defense for international security affairs, and when
Nitze became secretary of the Navy in 1963, he was his executive
assistant. On Nitze's recommendation, he was named a rear admiral
in 1965, at age 44 the youngest officer ever to attain that rank.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 he was promoted to the three-star rank of vice admiral,
ahead of 130 flag officers, and was named the commander of American
naval forces in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt, who had opposed American ground involvement in Vietnam
since the early 1960s and would later write how ``I thought it was
the wrong war, in the wrong place, at the wrong time,'' oversaw the
``brown water Navy.'' That was a flotilla of more than 1,000 armed
small boats deployed in the Mekong Delta to deny Vietcong and North
Vietnamese soldiers use of thousands of miles of waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Washington, Zumwalt took on another formidable task
_ remaking the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I became chief of naval operations, racism and sexism
were still an integral part of the Navy tradition,'' he recalled.
There had never been a black admiral, black officers had few
prospects for advancement, and women were not permitted to serve on
ships.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1970, Zumwalt issued what he would call his most
important directive, ``Equal Opportunity in the Navy.'' It required
ship, base and aircraft commanders to appoint a minority-group
member as a special assistant for minority affairs, demanded that
the Navy fight housing discrimination against black sailors in
cities where they were based, ordered that suitable cosmetics and
food for black personnel be stocked in Navy exchanges and required
that books by and about black Americans be made available in Navy
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no black Navy, no white Navy _ just one Navy _ the
United States Navy,'' Zumwalt declared.
</P>
<P>
   Another Z-Gram permitted women to serve on ships. Because women
were barred by law from ships that could be engaged in combat, a
hospital ship, the Sanctuary, was designated in 1972 to break
tradition, but not without some protests from wives of career
enlisted men.
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt also drew up a Z-Gram he first called ``Mickey Mouse,
Elimination of,'' but eventually renamed ``Demeaning and Abrasive
Regulations, Elimination of,'' an effort to remove some of the
restrictions on sailors' personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   He gave a go-ahead for beards and mustaches, which were already
permitted but generally frowned upon, and he allowed sailors to
have sideburns, which he himself wore to maximum authorized length,
the middle of the ear lobe. He permitted sailors to wear civilian
clothes on base when not on duty, authorized liquor in officers'
quarters and beer in senior enlisted men's barracks, liberalized
overnight liberty policies and set 15 minutes as the maximum time a
sailor should have to wait in line for anything. And he made
recruitment advertisements peppier, in a 1970s sort of way _ one
described the Navy as the place ``where the mod look began.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   While his changes gained wide public attention, Zumwalt spent
most of his time as chief of naval operations and a member of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff dealing with matters related to the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Playboy in June 1974, shortly before his
retirement, he remarked, ``There's a good deal of indecision as to
whether I am a drooling-fang militarist or a bleeding-heart
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters the previous month, Zumwalt said the
Soviet Union had the capacity to control sea lanes in a crisis and
foresaw a reversal of that situation only if Congress adequately
financed a multibillion-dollar naval construction program that he
had instituted.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoir ``On Watch'' (Quadrangle, 1976) he contended that
the Russians had gained more from limitations on strategic weapons
than the United States had.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt ran as a Democrat for the Senate in Virginia in 1976 but
was defeated by Sen. Harry F. Byrd Jr., an independent. The admiral
later served on many corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   His son Elmo III left the Navy in 1970 and became a lawyer in
North Carolina. In 1983, he was stricken with lymphoma, a cancer of
the lymphatic system, and in 1985 he was found to have Hodgkin's
disease, an unrelated form of lymph-node cancer. Elmo III's son,
Elmo IV, known as Russell, was born in 1977, with a severe learning
disability.
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt and his son attributed the cancers and the boy's brain
disorder to the Agent Orange defoliant, deployed by Zumwalt in the
Mekong Delta. Many Vietnam veterans had told of suffering from
nervous disorders, cancers and skin problems and of having had
children with serious birth defects, attributing these to the
herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   In ``My Father, My Son,'' Elmo Zumwalt III wrote: ``I do not
second-guess the decisions Dad made in Vietnam, nor do I doubt for
a minute that the saving of human life was always his first
priority in his conduct of the war. I have the greatest love and
admiration for him as a man, and the deepest respect for him as a
military leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Zumwalt wrote: ``Knowing what I know now, I still would have
ordered the defoliation to achieve the objectives it did. But that
does not ease the sorrow I feel for Elmo, or the anguish his
illness, and Russell's disability, give me. It is the first thing I
think of when I awake in the morning, and the last thing I remember
when I go to sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Mouza, a son, James, two daughters,
Ann and Mouza, a sister, a brother, and six grandchildren.

<P>
   In January 1998, President Clinton presented Zumwalt the Medal
of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award. He was cited for
fighting discrimination against minorities and women in the Navy
and for his work on behalf of a foundation seeking bone-marrow
donors for cancer patients.
