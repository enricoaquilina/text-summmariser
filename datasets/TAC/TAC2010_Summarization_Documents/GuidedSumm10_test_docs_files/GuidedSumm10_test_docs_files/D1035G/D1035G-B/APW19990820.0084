<HEADLINE> Report: Agent Orange in Panama </HEADLINE>

	DALLAS (AP) -- Secret U.S. tests of Agent Orange in Panama during  
the Vietnam War may have exposed many residents and military 
personnel to potentially lethal chemicals, The Dallas Morning News 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of barrels of the toxic herbicide were shipped to  
Panama during the 1960s and 1970s, then sprayed on jungles in an 
effort to simulate the battlefield conditions of Southeast Asia, 
the newspaper reported, citing documents and witness accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Panamanians and Americans may have been exposed.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Southern Command, the operational authority in Panama,  
said it was unaware of any tests involving Agent Orange there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our bottom line on our side is that we have no knowledge that  
it happened,'' said Raul Duany, a Southern Command spokesman. ``We 
have no evidence that Agent Orange was actually sprayed in 
Panama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If it was, he said, ``it wouldn't pose a threat today because it  
should have dissipated by now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defoliant contains the highly toxic chemical dioxin.  
</P>
<P>
	No one knows how many people suffer from the effects of Agent  
Orange, which was sprayed by U.S. planes during a 10-year period to 
strip away cover from North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops and 
their convoys. 
</P>
<P>
	One American veteran who served in Panama from 1968 to 1971 told  
the Morning News he witnessed the spraying at a test site close to 
the Panama Canal and near a popular beach, a recreation center, a 
sporting club and a lake that supplied Panama City's drinking 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	Government leaders in Panama have long suspected that lethal  
chemical weapons and herbicides were used there. The country is 
already seeking as much as $500 million from the U.S. military in 
damages and cleanup costs following years of ammunition and weapons 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Use of toxic herbicides has been identified by the Department of  
Veterans Affairs as a factor in the deaths of at least three U.S. 
servicemen stationed in Panama in the 1960s and 1970s, said Bill 
Russo, an attorney for the Washington-based Vietnam Veterans of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors of the servicemen are receiving service-related  
benefits as a result of their husbands' exposure, the newspaper 
said.
