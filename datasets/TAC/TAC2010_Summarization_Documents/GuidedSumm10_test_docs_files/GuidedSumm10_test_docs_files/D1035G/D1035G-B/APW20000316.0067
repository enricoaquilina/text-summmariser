<HEADLINE> U.S. Agent Orange Study Said Slow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Critics says the Air Force has been too slow
and too secretive in studying whether the herbicide Agent Orange
sickened Vietnam veterans, keeping them from getting compensation
in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior investigator of the military's study, Joe
Michalck, told a House panel Wednesday that the Agent Orange matter
''one of the best epidemiological studies ever conducted.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has surrounded the Ranch Hand study, a project
started in 1981 to determine whether exposure to defoliants in
Vietnam caused the health problems of veterans who served there.
</P>
<P>
   It has cost an estimated $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy resurfaced Wednesday as a House Government Reform
Committee panel reviewed a separate report by the General
Accounting Office that found veterans needing health compensation
have benefitted little from the study, which was named after the
herbicide spraying operation in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Ranch Hand study has had limited impact on decisions
affecting veterans' compensation,'' Kwai-Cheung Chan of the GAO,
Congress' investigative arm, said in prepared testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Chan said the GAO report found the Air Force has only made a
small portion of its findings available to scientists and veterans,
though it was mandated to release information periodically over the
course of the 25-year study.
</P>
<P>
   Chan noted that congressional critics and news reports have
previously touched on some of the study's problems, adding that
some have been corrected while others persist.
</P>
<P>
   The Ranch Hand study will follow until 2006 the health of 1,300
Air Force personnel who sprayed Agent Orange in Vietnam to
defoliate swaths of Vietnam's jungles and deprive North Vietnamese
troops of cover.
</P>
<P>
   The study contrasts the health of U.S. troops involved in the
spraying to a group not involved but matched by age, race and
military occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The failure to communicate an honest scientific appraisal of
its own work is, in part, responsible for the fact that Vietnam
veterans are being compensated for so few diseases they or their
offspring may have developed as a result of their exposure to
herbicides during the Vietnam War,'' John F. Sommer, Jr., executive
director of the American Legion, said in a statement prepared for
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Veterans' Affairs says it provides
compensation for 8,000 veterans with some dozen diseases believed
associated with Agent Orange, including chloracne skin disorder,
some nerve disorders and several types of cancer in addition to
providing benefits for children with the birth defect spina bifida.
