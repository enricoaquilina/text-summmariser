AIR FORCE REPORT LINKS AGENT ORANGE TO DIABETES

   WASHINGTON _ In its most clear-cut acknowledgment that there is
evidence linking Agent Orange to illness among Vietnam veterans,
the Air Force said in a new report that there was ``particularly
strong evidence'' tying the defoliant to the onset of diabetes in
veterans who were involved in spraying it over the Vietnamese
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 1,000 Air Force veterans who participated in the
aerial spraying operation, known during the war as Operation Ranch
Hand, found that there were 47 percent more diabetes cases among
those who had the highest level of exposure to the herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   The rates of illness among the 1,000 veterans were compared to
those of 1,300 other Air Force veterans who also served in the war
but had no involvement in the spraying of agent orange, a herbicide
that was used to defoliate trees and remove cover for North
Vietnamese soldiers and Communist guerrillas in the south.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter attached to the report, which was sent Tuesday to
Capitol Hill, the Air Force's surgeon general, Lt. Gen. Paul K.
Carlton Jr., said the results offered ``the strongest evidence to
date that Agent Orange is associated with adult-onset diabetes and
some of its known complications.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is expected to be made public by the Pentagon on
Wednesday, and it will doubtless lead to a new effort by veterans
groups and some lawmakers to secure additional disability payments
to veterans who have long complained of health problems they
attribute to Agent Orange exposure.
</P>
<P>
   It will also fuel the longstanding scientific debate over
whether Agent Orange is linked to a variety of other diseases,
including cancer. The Air Force study found that there was ``no
consistent evidence'' that the herbicide causes cancer, a finding
backed by other studies.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the executive summary of the report was made available
to The New York Times by a government official who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The executive summary does not provide the exact numbers of
veterans in the study who were diagnosed with diabetes, and it
cautioned against trying to extrapolate the findings to all 3
million veterans of the Vietnam War. According to the American
Diabetes Association, 15.7 million Americans, or about 6 percent of
the population, have diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results cannot be generalized to other groups, such as all
Vietnam veterans or Vietnamese civilians, who have been exposed in
different ways or to different levels of herbicide,'' Carlton said
in his letter. ``The Air Force cannot determine what effect
herbicides or dioxin have at levels other than those found in the
Ranch Hand group, or from other sources such as contaminated
food.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was welcomed by lawmakers who in the past have accused
the Defense Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs of
trying to ignore health problems linked to Agent Orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is that Agent Orange has caused many more health
problems than the DOD and the VA have acknowledged in the past,''
said Rep. Bernard Sanders, a Vermont independent who has been
harshly critical of the Pentagon for its handling of the Agent
Orange issue.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that, to date, only 7,600 Vietnam veterans have been
awarded special compensation payments as a result of health
problems that may be linked to Agent Orange. ``That says to me that
there are hundreds of thousands of veterans who haven't a clue
about what they are entitled to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes is not among the nine diseases, including Hodgkin's
disease and respiratory cancers, that the Department of Veterans
Affairs has listed as being possibly linked to Agent Orange
exposure, based on research studies.
</P>
<P>
   The government also provides special benefits to the children of
Vietnam veterans who suffer from spina bifida, a congenital birth
defect of the spine that has been tentatively linked to the
herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   In a program that began in 1962, about 19 million gallons of
Agent Orange, named for the orange-striped barrels in which it was
transported, and other herbicides were sprayed over South Vietnam
to destroy the camouflage the jungle provided Communist supply
routes and base camps. In 1969, studies linked the herbicide to
birth defects, and use of all defoliants was stopped by 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force study began in 1982, comparing the health records
of veterans involved in Operation Ranch Hand with the records of
Air Force personnel of roughly the same age, race and military
occupation whose jobs in the war had nothing to do with the aerial
spraying operation.
</P>
<P>
   Initial findings of the study released in 1992 suggested, but
did not confirm, a link between the herbicide and diabetes, a
disease in which the body does not produce or properly use insulin,
a hormone needed to convert sugar and other food into energy.
