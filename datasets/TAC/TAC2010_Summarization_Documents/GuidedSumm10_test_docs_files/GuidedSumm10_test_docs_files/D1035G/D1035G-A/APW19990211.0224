<HEADLINE> VA Must Review Agent Orange Cases </HEADLINE>

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Veterans Administration must review all  
benefit claims denied to hundreds of Vietnam veterans who failed to 
say their illnesses resulted from exposure to Agent Orange, a 
federal judge ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government has paid some benefits to about 6,000  
Vietnam veterans who developed cancer and other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But an estimated 1,000 veterans were denied back payments under  
strict language that required applicants to state that Agent Orange 
or herbicides were linked to the cause of the disability or death, 
a hurdle ruled illegal Thursday in the class-action lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under VA regulations, veterans do not have to prove they were  
exposed to Agent Orange or other herbicides containing the toxic 
substance dioxin. In fact, anyone who served in the war is 
automatically presumed to have been exposed to it. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1989 court ruling in the case voided all VA benefit decisions  
it had made based on the agency's assertion that only the skin 
disease chloracne was linked to Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the VA has since recognized that a variety of cancers  
are connected to the defoliant, it has failed to review claims made 
prior to the 1989 ruling and continued to insist that benefit 
applicants state that their disability resulted from exposure to 
Agent Orange, the court found. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agree with plaintiffs that the VA's approach is  
inconsistent with both the spirit and intent of this court's 
decision, as well as the liberal nature of the VA's own claims 
process,'' U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court expected that the VA would revisit those benefit  
decisions that had been erroneously decided under the invalidated 
regulations,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs wanted the VA ordered to pay the benefits, but  
Henderson ruled that the agency should revisit the denied claims. 
With benefits denied as far back as 1985, retroactive payments 
would average $70,000 per person, plaintiffs' attorney Bart 
Stichman said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows how many people suffer from the effects of Agent  
Orange, which was sprayed over wide swaths of jungle by U.S. planes 
during a 10-year period to strip away cover from enemy troops and 
their convoys. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to U.S. Justice Department attorney Karen Richardson  
seeking comment Thursday evening was not returned.
