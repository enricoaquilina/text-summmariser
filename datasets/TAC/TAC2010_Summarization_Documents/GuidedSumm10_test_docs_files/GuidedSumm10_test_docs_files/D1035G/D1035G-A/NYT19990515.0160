VIETNAM SEES WAR'S LEGACY IN ITS YOUNG

   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam _ In what amounted to a chance
second-generation reunion from the war years, five teen-age girls
laughed and chattered at a lunch table the other day, all of them
patients in a hospital for severely deformed or mentally retarded
children.
</P>
<P>
   Their fathers had been soldiers from different parts of North
Vietnam who fought in the same area of Tay Ninh province in the
south and dispersed to their homes when the war ended in 1975. Then
they had children. The area where they fought had been heavily
sprayed with the herbicide Agent Orange in a wide-ranging,
decade-long campaign by the United States to deprive its enemy of
forest cover and food crops.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here are convinced that the five teen-agers _ along
with tens of thousands of other deformed children of war veterans
and exposed civilians _ are the victims of the herbicide and its
poisonous residue, dioxin. Reunions like the one in the hospital
are not uncommon, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But Vietnam's scientific studies have been sketchy and its
evidence is often anecdotal. Until there is firm proof that
chemical herbicides are to blame, the United States says it cannot
take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has raised the issue only glancingly in talks with the
United States, said Ambassador Douglas Peterson. But it arises
repeatedly among people here who say it is one of the most painful
remnants of a war that ended 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where Americans are generally welcomed with
friendship, the absence of aid from the United States for deformed
children is one issue that still rankles.
</P>
<P>
   It is a subject that the government-controlled press keeps alive
with occasional reports and that is sometimes placed on the agendas
of foreign delegations, who are shown shelves full of glass bottles
with labels like ``Deformed baby with two heads, one body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk so much about human rights and humanity,'' said Dr.
Le Cao Dai, who runs the Agent Orange program of the Vietnamese Red
Cross. ``No human rights in China. No human rights in Vietnam. So
why, these children, are they not eligible for human rights?''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials and many independent researchers caution that
there is no certainty that Agent Orange is responsible for the
illnesses and birth defects, which can have other causes and can be
found in other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Veterans Association in Washington now offers compensation
for 10 diseases, as well as for the birth defect spina bifida, that
have been determined to be linked, or possibly linked, to the
spraying in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says more accurate tests are needed to confirm
the Vietnamese assertion that there are victims here as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Agent Orange issue in this country is driven by
propaganda,'' said a diplomat. ``They would have you believe that
every deformed baby is a result of Agent Orange. And the same with
American GIs.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1962 to 1971, the United States sprayed 12 million gallons
of defoliant over more than 10 percent of what was then South
Vietnam. Some 14 percent of the area's forests were destroyed,
according to U.S. figures, and broad stretches of the landscape are
still bare of trees.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest evidence so far that some areas are still
contaminated was published last October by a Canadian environmental
research group, Hatfield Consultants.
</P>
<P>
   In a five-year study of the Aluoi Valley in central Quang Tri
province, the researchers found high levels of dioxin in the soil,
in fish and animal tissue, and in the blood of people born after
the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If such data were collected in most Western jurisdictions,
based on similar sampling levels, major environmental cleanup and
more extensive studies would be implemented,'' the report said.
``As Western-based scientists, we can hardly recommend less be done
in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was careful not to draw conclusions about the
contentious question of human victims of the chemical spraying. But
David Levy, vice president and senior scientist of Hatfield, said
in an interview that logic would suggest that there were victims.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, tests conducted by Vietnamese and foreign
researchers in certain localities here have documented high levels
of contamination of breast milk and blood. Though the methodology
may not be as rigorous as that in more-developed nations, the
findings are often striking.
</P>
<P>
   Dai said sharp contrasts are evident between the south, which
was sprayed, and the north, which was not, and between northern
residents who fought in the south and those who did not.

<P>
   ``Of course, to be very accurate, we need to have more medical
study to confirm the causes,'' said Dr. Nguyen Thi My Hien, the
director of the hospital here, the Thanh Xuan Peace Village, that
cares for deformed children. But she said she believed that about
80 of her 100 patients were victims of chemical spraying.
</P>
<P>
   One of these is Nguyen Cong Nang, 11, the severely retarded son
of a former soldier who is himself disabled, with metal shrapnel
lodged behind his right eye. Now the father, Nguyen Van Hien, 45,
spends his days at the hospital, feeding and bathing his son and
rocking him to sleep at nap times.
</P>
<P>
   He said that all three of his sons had birth defects and that
friends from the war also had children who were born deformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us it was OK,'' he said of his fellow soldiers. ``We were
happy to sacrifice on behalf of the next generation. But these
children are innocent of the war. They are a generation of victims
who are the children of victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The chance reunion of the children of battlefield comrades
included Nguyen Thi Thoa, 15, whose body is covered with black
blotches and whose younger brother died of heart disease. Hien
described the blotches simply as a melanin disorder and said: ``It
is a very serious case. We are confused about how to treat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting by her were two sisters, Nguyen Thi Thuong, 15, and
Nguyen Thi Khuyen, 13, both of whom have mild mental retardation
and whose growth has been severely stunted.
</P>
<P>
   Hien said the sisters' father had been unable to bear their
ailments and had fled their home. After their mother brought them
to live at the hospital, the doctor said, the parents reunited and
had another baby, who was also born deformed.
</P>
<P>
   That story is not unusual, said Dai of the Red Cross. Parents
often consider such births to be punishments for their sins and
keep trying for healthy children, only to produce more sick ones.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the parents are ostracized by fellow villagers
for these presumed sins and exiled to live at the edges of rice
fields.
</P>
<P>
   In a final humiliation for these unlucky veterans, he said,
``People sometimes say, `This is happening to you because you
killed too many people when you fought in the war.'''
