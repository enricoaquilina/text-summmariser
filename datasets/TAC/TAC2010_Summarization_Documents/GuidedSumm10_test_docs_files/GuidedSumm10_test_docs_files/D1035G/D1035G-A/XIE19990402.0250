<HEADLINE> Thai, U.S. Experts Cooperate Over Toxic Chemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Thai and U.S. experts would
cooperate in an operation to identify the toxic chemicals recently
discovered under an airport in Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south
of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The United States has dispatched a team of experts from the
Joint United States Military Assistance Group to inspect the site
with Thai experts, sources close to the U.S. Embassy here said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The strong-smelling hazardous waste was unearthed last week
under the Bor Fai airport runway in Hua Hin of Prachuab Khiri Khan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The waste, suspected of being the deadly "Agent Orange"
chemical used by the U.S. Army to denude forests to deny
Vietnamese fighters ground cover during the Vietnam War, has
caused several Thai villagers to fall sick.
</P>
<P>
However, there is conflicting information over who brought the
substance into Thailand. Thailand's Foreign Ministry confirmed
that the six Thai military facilities known to have been used by
Washington during the Vietnam War excluded Bor Fai airbase, which
had long been owned by the Thai Civil Aviation Department.
</P>
<P>
"It had been used as a pilot training ground years before the
war and is still used for that purpose," an official said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy has refused to disclose any further details
concerning the possibility that Washington had secretly used the
airbase during the Vietnam War, saying the information currently
available does not go back that far.
</P>
<P>
Washington sent the inspection team at the request of Bangkok.
Jarupong Bunlong, deputy director-general of Thailand's Pollution
Control Department, said the chemicals should be identified by
next week. All he could confirm for now is that the five 15-liter
barrels and one 200-liter barrel that have been found originated
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Thai experts had earlier discovered the toxic barrels had a
code designating their origin, but had not said what the substance
was. The code names "Delaware" ( a U.S. state) as the place of
origin.
</P>
<P>
Jarupong said his department has built a shelter around the
area to prevent rainfall from dissolving the substance
underground.
