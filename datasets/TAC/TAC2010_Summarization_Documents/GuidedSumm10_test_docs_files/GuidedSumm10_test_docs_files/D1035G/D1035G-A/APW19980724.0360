Red Cross launches fund for victims

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Vietnamese Red Cross launched a
special fund Friday for victims of Agent Orange, saying the toxic
defoliant is starting to claim its third generation of victims a
quarter-century after the end of the Vietnam War.
	   ``With Agent Orange, the land mines were planted deep in the
very essence of life _ in the genes of the men and women,'' said
John Geoghegan, the country head for the International Federation
of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
	   ``That this war is being fought again with their grandchildren
is a horrific thought.''
	   No one knows how many people suffer from the effects of Agent
Orange, which was sprayed over wide swaths of jungle by U.S. planes
during a 10-year period to strip away cover for North Vietnamese
troops and their resupply convoys. Estimates range from tens of
thousands to 2 million Vietnamese.
	   In April, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai ordered the first
nationwide survey, to be completed next year.
	   In addition, veterans from at least four countries who fought on
the side of the former U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government sued
the chemical's manufacturers in the United States, saying exposure
caused chronic illness, deaths and birth defects.
	   According to U.S. records, the United States sprayed about 12
million gallons (45 million liters) of Agent Orange over parts of
southern and central Vietnam in 1961-71.
	   The total included about 375 pounds (170 kilograms) of dioxin, a
mere trace of which can cause cancer.
	   The spraying was stopped in 1971 _ four years before the end of
the war _ after laboratory tests showed that dioxin can cause
cancers and birth defects.
	   It's virtually impossible to determine which birth defects or
ailments are directly related to Agent Orange.
	   But the Vietnamese Red Cross says there appear to be common
threads: brothers and sisters suffering from the same deformities,
which is otherwise fairly uncommon; arms and legs that are twisted
in a certain way; and eyes without pupils.
	   Hoang Dinh Cau, chairman of the National Committee for
Investigation of Defects from Toxic Chemicals Used During the
Vietnam War, said recent studies show dioxin levels are dropping,
along with high rates of birth defects, in the affected areas.
	   But some still have high toxicity levels in both the soil and
the oil of fish that were checked.
	   Cau, 81, dismissed concerns that dioxin has and will continue to
leech into the food supply. However, some foreign scientists worry
that ongoing demining efforts are stirring up buried dioxin and
allowing it to be carried into the water system by erosion.
	   Vietnam estimates 16.5 percent of the 70,391 square miles
(182,299 square kilometers) in the former South Vietnam were
sprayed, some areas four times or more. Nearly 2 million people
lived in the affected areas.
	   In most of the country, the deformity rates peaked in the late
1970s and have fallen sharply since 1985, Cau said. But in the most
heavily sprayed areas, the declines didn't start until the '90s.
	   ``Initially, we did not think the chemicals would have an impact
on the second generation,'' Cau said. ``But dioxin can stay in the
soil very long.''
	   He pulled out a stack of case studies. One showed a couple who
had two healthy children before the father went to fight in the
south. Four miscarriages followed his return. Another couple had
eight deformed children.
	   He said recently developed treatments have improved the lives of
some victims. Those children who have the most serious deformities
are cared for at 11 ``peace villages'' scattered across the country
that can handle a total of 500 patients. More villages are planned.
