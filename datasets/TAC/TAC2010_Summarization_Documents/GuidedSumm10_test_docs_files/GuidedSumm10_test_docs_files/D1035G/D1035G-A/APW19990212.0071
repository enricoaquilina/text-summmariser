	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A review of what has been done to determine  
how Agent Orange and other herbicides affected Vietnam veterans 
confirms earlier studies linking them with several diseases but 
leaves unanswered painful medical questions of the war that ended 
24 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's independent report by the Institute of Medicine  
appears to offer no new evidence that would affect benefits for 
Vietnam War veterans or their offspring, although the Department of 
Veterans Affairs said the study will be valuable for further 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite continuing investigation into possible links to birth  
defects, diabetes and a list of other illnesses, no scientific 
studies over the last two years has provided enough information to 
draw significant new conclusions about whether herbicides are 
linked to any condition, study director Dr. David Tollerud said. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans Affairs, which issued a statement praising the  
``thorough and impartial work of the committee,'' offers special 
compensation for 10 diseases listed as linked or possibly linked to 
herbicide used in Vietnam whether veterans can prove exposure or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	Children of veterans also may receive benefits for the birth  
defect spina bifida, whose link is listed as ``limited or 
suggestive,'' but diabetes is not included. Evidence of a diabetes 
link to herbicides or dioxin is listed as still ``inadequate or 
insufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot more research is being done, which we are very  
optimistic will continue to provide useful information to answer 
the questions that remain,'' said Tollerud, director of the Center 
for Environmental and Occupation Health at Philadelphia's Hahnemann 
University School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The review keeps four diseases on the list of those for which  
evidence establishes links with exposure to herbicides widely used 
as defoliants in Vietnam: soft-tissue sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and cholaracne. The first three are 
forms of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the institute's last review of scientific research in 1996,  
six other diseases were listed with ``limited or suggestive 
evidence of association'' to Agent Orange, other herbicides or the 
contaminant dioxin. Added to the list then was spina bifida, the 
spinal birth defect found in the children of some Vietnam veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the recent literature, there are no additional  
diseases that satisfy this category's criteria,'' the new report 
said. Nor did it find enough evidence to move diseases to a 
category of higher or lower certainty. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Tollerud said new research was conducted on  
diabetes and on spina bifida as well as other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the most serious medical questions still being studied  
from the war involve the relationship between herbicides and cases 
of diabetes and birth defects among veterans and their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's review is the third in a series of reports. A law  
passed in 1991 calls for the National Academy of Sciences to review 
new Agent Orange and herbicide studies every two years to determine 
if the fresh research finds an added connection between the 
chemicals and disease. The Institute of Medicine is an affiliate of 
the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	About 19 million gallons of Agent Orange and other chemicals  
were used to defoliate trees in the jungles of Vietnam, beginning 
in 1962. Their use was stopped in 1971, two years after studies 
first linked Agent Orange to birth defects in laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Veterans Affairs has received more than 92,000  
claims and treated more than 50,000 cases of service-related 
conditions, spokesman Ken McKinnon said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Vietnam veterans are presumed to have been exposed to  
Agent Orange, and veterans with any of the 10 diseases is presumed 
to have contracted it from the exposure, without individual proof.
