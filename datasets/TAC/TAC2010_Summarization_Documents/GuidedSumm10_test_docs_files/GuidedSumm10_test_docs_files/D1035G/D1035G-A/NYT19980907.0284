EDITORIAL OBSERVER: AGENT ORANGE IN VIETNAM, 30 YEARS LATER

   Dr. Le Cao Dai, one of Vietnam's top experts on the health
effects of Agent Orange, first encountered American military
herbicides when he ran a field hospital for the North Vietnamese
army along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. American planes would fly low
over the forest canopy and release a cloud of chemicals. Within
days, the leaves would begin to fall, forcing Dai to move his
hospital deeper into the forest for concealment. Only later did he
come to believe that the spraying had done long-term health damage
to Vietnamese soldiers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   That belief is shared by leading Vietnamese doctors who were
interviewed on a recent trip through Vietnam. None would hazard a
guess to this writer as to how extensive the damage had been, but
one was later quoted in the Vietnamese press as asserting that some
70,000 Vietnamese are now suffering from illnesses caused by Agent
Orange.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence to support these beliefs is weak, for it is a sad
irony of the Vietnam War that those most likely to have been
affected by the spraying _ the Vietnamese themselves _ have been
the least effectively studied. The United States has put enormous
effort into assessing possible harm to American soldiers but found
only limited damage, perhaps because most soldiers had relatively
little contact with the chemicals during their short tours of duty.
Meanwhile, the Vietnamese troops directly under the spray and
civilians who lived in the sprayed areas for years or moved in
later, have been studied primarily by Vietnamese scientists whose
results are not generally accepted by scientists from more advanced
nations.

   American herbicides, of which the most prominent was Agent
Orange, were widely dispersed to defoliate trees over supply
routes, clear away brush from roadsides, riverbanks and base camps,
and kill food crops that sustained guerrilla bands. More than 10
percent of the land area of South Vietnam was sprayed at least
once, and some areas were sprayed repeatedly. The herbicides
themselves would generally dissipate within weeks but would leave
behind a toxic contaminant, dioxin, that was inadvertently created
during the manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists who inquire about Agent Orange are routinely taken
to ``peace villages'' to see malformed children, to an exhibit on
health consequences at the medical school in Hanoi or to a
collection of malformed fetuses at an obstetrical hospital in Ho
Chi Minh City. All three sites make a powerful case that there is
appalling illness in Vietnam, but all fall short of demonstrating
that Agent Orange was the culprit. The birth defects, cancers and
other illnesses that the Vietnamese attribute to Agent Orange can
be caused by a wide range of factors, and Agent Orange may not be
prominent among them.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemiological and laboratory studies that offer the best
hope of teasing out answers are difficult for even the most
advanced scientific countries to perform. Vietnamese studies that
purport to find excess cancers, birth defects and other illnesses
in soldiers and civilians from areas that were sprayed are
discounted by Western experts for lack of stringent methodology.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese and American scientists once started a collaborative
research effort, but it fell apart three years ago when Vietnamese
authorities confiscated research samples before they could leave
the country. Now, however, the Vietnamese and the American Embassy
in Hanoi are both suggesting a joint study of the effects of the
herbicides. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has been asked to
consider whether it is feasible to do a study so long after the
spraying, in a nation where health records and disease measures are
notoriously incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   The research seems well worth doing, if it is technically
feasible. An authoritative study would add to the growing
literature on the health effects of herbicides and dioxin, could
help the Vietnamese decide how to allocate scarce health resources
and might shed additional light on the effects of Agent Orange in
American veterans. Most compelling of all, it might finally close
one of the festering wounds from the Vietnam War.
