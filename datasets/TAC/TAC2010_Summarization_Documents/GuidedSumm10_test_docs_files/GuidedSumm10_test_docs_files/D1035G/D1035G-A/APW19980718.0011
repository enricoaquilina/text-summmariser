Vietnam to launch fund for victims of war-era defoliant
</HEADLINE>

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam is launching a support fund for
victims of the defoliant Agent Orange, more than two decades after
its use by U.S. forces in the Vietnam War, the Labor newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   The paper quoted Nguyen Trong Nhan, chairman of the Vietnam Red
Cross, as saying those affected by the toxic chemical will receive
assistance from the fund by the year 2000 after a survey on Agent
Orange victims is completed next year.
	   The fund, which primarily will rely on donations from domestic
and foreign organizations and individuals, will be inaugurated next
Friday.
	   It will be managed by the Red Cross, which will provide loans
and training to victims. They include former soldiers who fought in
areas sprayed with Agent Orange by U.S. aircraft and children who
were later born with deformities.
	   Nhan said the government's strained budget might have delayed
assistance, pointing out that a laboratory test of a sample for
Agent Orange costs dlrs 3,000.
	   Prime Minister Phan Van Khai in April assigned the Ministry of
Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs to conduct a survey on the
estimated 300,000 Agent Orange victims in Vietnam.
