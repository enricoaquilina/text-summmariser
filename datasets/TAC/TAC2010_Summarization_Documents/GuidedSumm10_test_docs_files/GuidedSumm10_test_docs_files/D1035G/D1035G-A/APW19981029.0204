	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The symbolism was lost on the children,
all born with birth defects that often are the result of contact by
parents with dioxin, a toxic component of the war-era defoliant
Agent Orange.
	   They represent both the long-term casualties of war and hope for
the future.
	   Veterans groups from the United States, France, Germany,
Britain, Japan and Vietnam turned out Thursday to dedicate the
Vietnam Friendship Village, which is testimony that old enemies can
work together.
	   The result of a decade of corporate donations, bake sales and
other grassroots fund-raising that brought in more than dlrs 1
million, the cluster of eight buildings 11 kilometers (seven miles)
north of Hanoi will be home to young and old who still suffer a
quarter-century after the Vietnam War ended.
	   ``This is about the possibility of average people making a
difference,'' said George Mizo, a Vietnam War veteran who became a
high-profile anti-war activist. ``We cannot change the past, but we
can change the present and the future.''
	   Vietnam Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh, other government
officials, foreign diplomats and veterans gathered at the reclaimed
swampland to dedicate the first phase of the village, which
currently houses 30 children and 20 adults.
	   By spring, the number is expected to total 100, with a goal of
providing housing and support for another 50.
	   No one knows how many people suffer from the effects of Agent
Orange, which was sprayed over wide swaths of jungle by U.S. planes
during a 10-year period to strip away cover from North Vietnamese
troops and their resupply convoys.
	   Estimates range from tens of thousands to 2 million Vietnamese.
In April, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai ordered the first nationwide
survey, to be completed next year.
	   It's virtually impossible to determine which birth defects or
ailments are directly related to Agent Orange. But the Vietnamese
Red Cross says there appear to be common threads, and a research
facility at the village will study the links.
	   Mizo, a Boston native who now lives in Stuttgart, Germany, was a
sergeant in an artillery unit when he was injured in a rocket
attack in January 1968 in the buildup to the Tet offensive.
	   Redeployed back home, he spoke out against the war and was in
and out of military jails for two years. In the mid-1980s, he was
among a group of four veterans who staged a hunger strike on the
steps of the U.S. Capitol in solidarity with Nicaragua.
	   Shortly after his son Michael's birth in 1988, Mizo became
involved in a project by American veterans to build a pagoda in
Vietnam. It developed instead into the Friendship Village.
	   On Thursday, his son handed out drawings done by his fellow
students in Stuttgart to the Friendship Village children.
	   ``This represents healing and reconstruction,'' the elder Mizo
said moments earlier. ``Those who have experienced the horrors of
war know how precious life is.''
