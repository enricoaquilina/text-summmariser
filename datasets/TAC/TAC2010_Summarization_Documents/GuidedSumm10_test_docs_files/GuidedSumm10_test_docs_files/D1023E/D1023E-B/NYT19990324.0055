   PARIS _ Both skiers and ski resort operators in the Alps live
for snow, but some of the heaviest snowfalls this century turned
deadly this winter, setting off a series of avalanches in February.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For all but the hardest-hit resort, in Galtuer, Austria, where
32 ski vacationers and 6 villagers died in a devastating slide Feb.
23, fear of more tragedies has gradually receded as warmer weather
has packed down the snow.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the higher resorts in France, Switzerland, Italy and Austria,
tourism officials expect the slopes to remain open through the end
of April, even into May in some cases, with some of the best
late-season skiing in years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In German-speaking Switzerland, skiers in Davos, Klosters and
St. Moritz are going back home with reports of excellent conditions
that are expected to last. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a good amount of snow this winter, not a record
amount, and the season will continue through to April 25,'' said
Hubert Schwarzler, a hotel owner and tourism official in the
Vorarlberg resort of Lech in western Austria, a couple of mountain
ridges away from Galtuer.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lech, nearby Zuers and St. Anton were all cut off for nearly two
weeks by the heavy February snowfall when authorities closed roads
and even the rail line from Zurich to Innsbruck because of the
danger of avalanches. ``From the end of February until March 6,
hotels in Lech were only about half full, because people were
afraid and canceled their reservations,'' Schwarzler said, ``but by
mid-March we were back up to about 95 percent capacity.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case in Galtuer. ``March is usually the best
month of the year, but hardly anybody came this year after the
avalanche,'' said Walter Gerhard, tourism spokesman for the
village. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland, where an avalanche Feb. 21 in the village of
Evolene in the French-speaking Valais region killed seven people,
was also hard hit. ``The fear didn't go away,'' said one tour
operator in the Valais region. Hundreds of thousands of people were
stuck in Swiss ski resorts for days when roads were closed because
of the danger of avalanches. Others couldn't get in to occupy the
rooms they had reserved, or changed their minds about coming. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the Valais spent generously on publicity trying
to reassure skiers that the slopes were as safe as ever. That never
means 100 percent safe in any ski resort, and avalanches in the
Alps remain possible as the weather warms up, authorities warn,
particularly if skiers disregard warnings and wander off piste. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three skiers who did that in Val di Roia in the Alto Adige
region of the Italian Dolomites on March 11 died in an avalanche
they set off themselves, according to tourism officials there.
Another avalanche, in Morgex, in northern Italy, on Feb. 23 killed
a 52-year-old village woman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The French Alps were also struck by an avalanche at Montroc,
near Chamonix on the slopes of Mont-Blanc, that took 12 lives on
Feb. 9. For three weeks after that, Montroc was practically
deserted, according to officials in that hamlet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When French school vacations started later in February few
people canceled their reservations in Chamonix, according to
Delphine Rey, a village tourism official who said hotels reported
less than 3 percent cancellations for the month as a whole. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Chamonix Web site (www.chamonix.com) was reporting more than
10 feet of snow on higher slopes and nearly 3 feet even in the
village in mid-March. Similar conditions at Courchevel lured Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin there for a ski weekend with his wife just
before St. Patrick's Day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Estelle Jouand, a tourism official for the Savoie region,
said that resorts there were at only three-quarters capacity in the
last week of February, when avalanches were big news in Switzerland
and Austria. Normally at that time, she said, 85 to 90 percent of
the 423,500 hotel beds in Savoie would be occupied. Lingering fears
about avalanches in the Alps, she added, could have an adverse
effect on next ski season, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Di Giandomenico, the head of the tourist board in
Abruzzo, said that the immediate effect of the avalanches in Italy
was a short-lived, slight dip in hotel bookings. But the tourist
flow quickly returned to normal, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The heavy snow cover in many resorts bears watching in the warm
weather, however, and when the thaw really gets started, serious
flooding is expected in Alpine valleys and major waterways like the
Rhine that have been running high since February.
