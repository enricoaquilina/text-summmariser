<P>
VIENNA, February 24 (Xinhua) -- Three avalanches hit the
village of Galtuer in Tirol, western Austria, within two days. To
date, more than 18 people have been killed, more than 10 injured
and 21 are still missing, Austrian television reported Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
The third avalanche, which left two dead, struck the village on
Wednesday and followed two deadly avalanches a day before.
</P>
<P>
Austrian military helicopters have flown rescuers, medicine and
supplies to the site and transported some of the injured to
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
German and American armies have also provided helicopters for
the rescue operation. Due to the bad weather, only a few
helicopters have been able to reach the area.
</P>
<P>
The rescuers are still digging in the snow in the hope of
finding survivors.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima and Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schueels both flew to the region to help coordinate rescue efforts.
The Austrian National Council has offered condolences to the
families of victims.

<P>
Authorities say the avalanches were five meters high, 800
meters wide and with speeds of nearly 200 kilometers per hour.
Because of the amount of snow involved, the avalanches were
considered some of the most dangerous in 400 years, said Tyrol's
provincial governor, Wendelin Weingartner.
