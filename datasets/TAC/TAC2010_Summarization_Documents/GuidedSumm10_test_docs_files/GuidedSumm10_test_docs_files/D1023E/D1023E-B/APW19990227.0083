	Kosovo Monitors Tail Yugoslav Army

	SUVA REKA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- International monitors in Kosovo  
are riding in trucks to tail Yugoslav army tanks and armored 
personnel carriers to prevent attacks against ethnic Albanians. 
Violence between the two sides has been increasing in the weeks 
before U.S.-led peace talks resume March 15. Observers said the 
police and army of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic were 
trying to provoke fighting with ethnic Albanian rebels to sabotage 
a potential peace deal. Ethnic Albanian sources said Yugoslav army 
troops targeted rebel positions in at least five villages about 20 
miles northwest of the capital of Pristina.

	LARGO, Fla. (AP) -- The head of one of the nation's most  
influential black denominations was found guilty today on charges 
of swindling millions of dollars from companies seeking to do 
business with his followers. The Rev. Henry Lyons, president of the 
National Baptist Convention USA, also was found guilty of grand 
theft in the disappearance of almost $250,000 from the 
Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith, money intended to rebuild 
burned black churches in the South. Prosecutors accused Lyons of 
stealing more than $4 million from corporations wanting to sell 
cemetery products, life insurance policies and credit cards to the 
convention's touted 8.5 million black members.

	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- More than 1,000 nurses and other union  
workers at Women &AMP; Infants Hospital held a one-day walkout today, 
causing doctors to postpone some non-emergency surgeries. It was 
the second such action in two months in protest of stalled contract 
talks. After the first incident in December, the hospital locked 
the nurses out for 29 days. Despite calling in temporary workers, 
the hospital had to cancel some non-emergency procedures. The 
nurses' union wants more pay and protection from layoffs.

	Clinton Seeks New Child Seat Rules  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton today announced new federal  
rules to make child car seats safer. The new measure establishes a 
single standardized system for anchoring child safety seats in new 
cars and light trucks by the end of this year. Clinton cited 
government estimates that more than 70 percent of children who ride 
in car seats are at risk of injury because their seats are 
improperly installed. All new child seats will have three standard 
attachments, one on top and two at the base. And all new cars and 
trucks will have standard anchors in the back seats to link to the 
seat attachments.

	Iraq Seeks Oil 'Compensation'  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- An Iraqi official says his country wants  
compensation from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for profits they have 
reaped from increased oil sales while Iraq was under U.N. trade 
sanctions. In recent weeks, Iraq has threatened to retaliate 
against Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey for allowing U.S. and 
British jets to use their territories for patrols over ``no-fly'' 
zones in northern and southern Iraq. The U.N. Security Council 
imposed trade sanctions on Iraq in 1990 to punish it for invading 
Kuwait. The sanctions limit Iraq's sale of oil, its economic 
mainstay.

	GALTUER, Austria (AP) -- Officials today surveyed the damage done  
by a massive avalanche that hit this village, killing more than 30 
people. Crews continued to dig out the town, which was buried by 
the snow slide last week. Scraps of building were visible atop the 
mounds of snow, and a pile of twisted automobiles had already been 
recovered. Roads leading to the region are passable for the first 
time in more than a week. The Galtuer avalanche was the most severe 
Europe has seen this winter.
