	Iranians Vote in Local Elections  
</P>
<P>
	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iranians cast ballots today in the nation's  
first election of local officials in 20 years. Reformists are 
hoping to gain the upper hand in a power struggle against 
hard-liners in the Islamic government. About 330,000 candidates, 
including 5,000 women, are contesting the elections for Islamic 
Councils. Council members manage local government in cities, towns 
and villages. Nationwide, more than 200,000 seats are at stake. The 
vote is a contest between supporters of popular President Mohammad 
Khatami and hard-line rivals who are trying to stymie his attempts 
at reform.

	BOSTON (AP) -- A Nor'easter dumped heavy snow across coastal New  
England yesterday, forcing the cancellation of thousands of 
flights. Plows couldn't keep up on Cape Cod and the coast south of 
Boston as the storm dumped up to 16 inches along the Cape. Fourteen 
inches fell in parts of Rhode Island, and an inch in Portland, 
Maine. By nightfall, snow was also falling as far south as New 
Jersey, New York City and Long Island, and Connecticut.

	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- Convicted murderer John William King on  
Friday will be spending his first day on Texas' death row. 
Yesterday, eleven white jurors and their elected black foreman 
sentenced the white supremacist to death by lethal injection for 
chaining James Byrd Jr. to a pickup truck and dragging him to 
death. King becomes the first white sent to death row in Texas for 
killing a black person since 1854.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno plans to meet with  
civil rights representatives concerned about police misconduct. 
Reno told reporters at her weekly news conference yesterday that 
she would hold such a meeting after she returns from a scheduled 
trip to South America next week. Also yesterday, black, Asian, 
Latino and Jewish civil rights advocates called for a meeting with 
President Clinton to help ``stem this national epidemic of 
brutality and abuse,'' Hugh B. Price, president of the National 
Urban League, said at a news conference.

	Senate Lashes Out at China  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate urged the Clinton administration to  
sponsor a resolution condemning China for human rights abuses when 
the U.N. Human Rights Commission meets next month in Geneva. 
Sponsors of the measure said yesterday's 99-0 vote, although not 
legally binding, would send a powerful message to the Beijing 
government as well as to democracy advocates in China in advance of 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit next week.

	Austria Avalanches Leave 33 Dead  
</P>

	LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Scores of rescuers used long metal  
probes to search for people still believed buried beneath tons of 
snow in the village of Galtuer following a deadly avalanche. 
Earlier yesterday, in Valzur, rescuers found a 4-year-old boy who 
survived 100 minutes under the snow. But the death toll from two 
avalanches continued to rise, climbing to 33. Meanwhile, dozens of 
helicopters ferried food and supplies into the stricken area, and 
brought out tourists.

	ATLANTA (AP) -- Physical activity tends to be lower among people  
-- particularly older adults -- who perceive their neighborhoods to 
be unsafe, according to a new federal study of five states. The 
survey released yesterday by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention found that 39.3 percent of people ages 18 to 64 living 
in neighborhoods they characterize as ``not at all safe'' reported 
no physical activity or exercise in the preceding month. That 
compared to 30.5 percent for people living in areas they deemed to 
be ``extremely safe.''

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frequent audits and open books will be part of  
the plan to soothe critics of the Olympics' worst scandal, 
according to the IOC's chief investigator. Vice president Dick 
Pound said yesterday that those concerned about the image and 
idealism of the games, from commercial sponsors to U.S. senators, 
should wait to see what the International Olympic Committee does at 
a special assembly next month.
