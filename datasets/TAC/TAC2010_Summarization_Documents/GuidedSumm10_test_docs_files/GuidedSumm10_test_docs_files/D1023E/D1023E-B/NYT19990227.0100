   Taking Hostages in the War on Drunken Driving
</P>
<P>
   Having chased away (or at least forced underground) murderers,
burglars, robbers, drug traffickers, car thieves, muggers,
panhandlers and squeegee men, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
has turned his attention to drunken drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has seldom met a crime pattern he thinks he cannot
smash, ordered police to begin seizing the cars of nearly anyone
arrested for drunken driving, whether hard-core repeaters or
first-time offenders. And to make sure that New Yorkers understood
that he was very, very serious, the Mayor said that even for those
acquitted in criminal court of driving while intoxicated, the city
might still pursue the permanent confiscation of their cars in
civil court.
</P>
<P>
   That led The Financial Times, hardly a journal of the left, to
say that New York was ``fast becoming the Singapore of the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's goal, of course, was to shock people into changing
their behavior. If you want to drink, he said, just make sure you
don't drive. Have a sober friend drive you home, take a cab or try
out New York's subways.
</P>
<P>
   While the political impact of the move was unclear, its legal
underpinning seemed firm. The Supreme Court has generally upheld
the use of forfeiture by federal and state prosecutors, who have
tried to inhibit the drug trade by charging traffickers with
criminal violations while also seizing their assets in civil
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are legal questions. Is it appropriate to
confiscate a car upon arrest rather than conviction? Is it fair to
seize the cars of drivers with unblemished records? Is the
punishment too varied, since one motorist could lose a car worth
$40,000 while another might forfeit one worth $1,000?
</P>
<P>
   Questions like these will no doubt keep the courts busy over the
next few months.

   The Pro Wrestling Sleazometer
</P>
<P>
   On television, wrestling sells, sells big. Monday night's ``WWF
Raw'' on the USA Network is a top-rated cable program with millions
of viewers each week. But are viewers drawn to precision maneuvers,
artful pins, athletic excellence? Uh, not exactly. Turn on the show
for 30 seconds and you'll see behavior far more, well, indelicate:
crotch-grabbing, obscene gestures and on down the ladder of taste.
</P>
<P>
   Far too indelicate, it would seem, to be a fit subject for
statistical analysis. But as living, gut-crunching proof that
nothing is safe from scholarly probing, the small-screen tabloid
``Inside Edition'' commissioned an Indiana University study of a
year's worth of ``WWF Raw.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you're titillated by pro wrestling, gape on. If you're
disgusted, keep surfing. If you're a parent, worry. A third of
viewers are 17 and under, and many schoolchildren imitate the
obscene behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're a data freak, a feast awaits, including the exact
number of times a crotch was grabbed, incidences of satanic
activity, scenes of wrestlers appearing to urinate as well as
categories too offensive to list. Plus the number of minutes out of
a two-hour telecast typically devoted to wrestling: 36.
</P>
<P>
   The study does not, by the way, say how many former pro
wrestlers have been elected governor (1) or how many times Garrison
Keillor, on his weekly radio show, ``Prairie Home Companion,'' has
poked fun at that governor, Jesse Ventura of Minnesota.

   A Guilty Verdict In Texas Dragging Death
</P>
<P>
   John William King helped write himself onto Death Row. Until the
24-year-old white supremacist from Jasper, Texas, wrote a letter to
a local newspaper claiming that he had been in the pickup truck
with two other white men charged with dragging a black man to his
death in 1998, authorities had no direct evidence linking King to
the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Then police found a trove of King's racist writings at his
apartment. Several young Jasper women stepped forward with letters
King wrote them while in prison on a burglary charge. And finally,
while awaiting trial, King tried to smuggle out a letter to another
defendant in which, prosecutors said, he all but confessed to the
murder of the man, James Byrd, a 49-year-old Jasper resident.
</P>
<P>
   King's weeklong trial ended with a rapid guilty verdict, and
three days later the jury wrote the final line: death by lethal
injection. The two other defendants are awaiting trial.

   A Lift for Clinton Fund
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's legal defense fund raised nearly $4.6
million in its first year, slicing in half the Clintons' mountain
of legal bills. Nearly 55,000 donors have given money to the
Clinton Legal Expense Trust, Clinton's supporters announced last
week. Some contributors, like the president's friends in Hollywood
and corporate America, gave the maximum amount of $10,000, but many
wrote smaller checks of $10 and $20.

   The Military Gets a Raise
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to stem an exodus of top-quality troops, the Senate
approved the largest military pay and pension increases in nearly
20 years. The bill, which passed 91-8, offers a bigger pay package
than what President Clinton proposed two months ago. It would give
the nation's 1.4 million troops a 4.8 percent pay raise next
January, and provide bonuses to selected mid-career personnel.

   Fatal Avalanches in Austria
</P>
<P>
   Avalanches struck the ski villages of Galtuer and Valzuer in the
Austrian Alps, and the bodies of nearly 40 victims were recovered
by the weekend. There have been record snowfalls this month in
western Austria and Switzerland, and with roads closed, hundreds of
thousands of European ski vacationers remain trapped in resorts,
some isolated for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian authorities flew thousands out from Galtuer and nearby
areas by helicopter and continued the search for victims.

   China Satellite Deal Blocked
</P>
<P>
   Selling goods to China is never easy. It's a lot harder these
days for Hughes Electronics, which for years has been trying to
sell the Chinese a $450 million communications satellite. Hughes
has been accused of being too helpful to the Chinese about how to
make their rockets more accurate _ a technology that could be
applied to missiles as well. So the Clinton administration reversed
itself and blocked Hughes from selling the communications
satellite, saying the risk of aiding the Chinese military was too
great.

   Cervical Cancer Hope
</P>
<P>
   The National Cancer Institute recommended changes in the
treatment of invasive cervical cancer, which kills 5,000 women a
year in the United States. Until now treatment included only
surgery and radiation, but five new studies have shown that adding
chemotherapy with the drug cisplatin can lower death rates by 30
percent to 50 percent. To succeed, the chemotherapy and radiation
must be given simultaneously.

   Ruling Out a Run
</P>
<P>
   Pete Wilson has never made a secret of his desire to be
president, but he has acknowledged, in the words of a fellow
Republican, former President George Bush, that he has more will
than wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 65, the two-term former governor of California whose
1996 presidential bid collapsed after throat surgery left him
unable to speak for three months, said it was now too late to raise
the $15 million he would need to seek the Republican nomination
next year.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts also
withdrew his name, citing the time and money required to mount a
campaign.

   Indians Win Ruling on Funds
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge weighed in on behalf of American Indians who
have filed a lawsuit to find out what happened to billions of
dollars in trust funds managed by the government for nearly a
century. Holding Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt in contempt of court, Judge Royce Lamberth
said he had never seen worse misconduct by the government.

   Guatemalan `Genocide'
</P>
<P>
   A truth commission set up at the end of Guatemala's 36-year
civil war in 1996 concluded that the United States gave support to
a military that committed ``acts of genocide'' against the Mayans
that resulted in the deaths of more than 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued by the commission described the role of American
money and training in helping the military wage a brutal campaign
that included kidnapping, torture and execution.

   Women Dominate Grammys
</P>
<P>
   Lauryn Hill, a 23-year-old singer who released her first solo
album last year, walked away from the 41st Annual Grammy Awards a
bigger winner than any other rapper or female performer before her.
Ms. Hill swept up five Grammys, including album of the year for
``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   The other big winners were also women, including Celine Dion and
Madonna.
