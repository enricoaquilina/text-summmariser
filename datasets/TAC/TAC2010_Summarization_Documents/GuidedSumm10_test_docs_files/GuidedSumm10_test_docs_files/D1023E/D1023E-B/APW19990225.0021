	Israeli Courts Blocks Extradition  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court today ruled that an  
18-year-old Maryland youth cannot be extradited to the United 
States to stand trial for murder. Samuel Sheinbein fled to Israel 
two days after the mutilated and burned body of his acquaintance, 
Alfredo Tello Jr., was discovered in Maryland last September. 
Shortly after arriving, Sheinbein was picked up by police. To 
prevent extradition back to Maryland, where he was charged with 
Tello's murder, Sheinbein claimed Israeli citizenship through his 
father, who was born in pre-state Israel. Under Israeli law, 
citizens cannot be extradited for trial abroad.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Marcos family and Philippine government  
have agreed to pay $150 million to settle a lawsuit filed by 
thousands of people who were tortured and abused under the late 
dictator Ferdinand Marcos. U.S. District Judge Manuel Real, based 
in Los Angeles, gave preliminary approval to the settlement 
yesterday. A final hearing is scheduled April 14 in Hawaii. The 
lawsuit was filed in Honolulu on behalf of 9,539 Filipinos who in

executions and disappearances.

Valzur, where two people were killed. The Austrian army said five 
people were missing. Seven miles away, in Galtuer, the death toll 
rose to 25 and rescuers searched for six others missing and still 
believed buried by an avalanche on Tuesday. Twenty-three had been

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a live demonstration of the promise of a  
superfast Internet, a physician in Washington collaborated last 
night over a special high-speed network with surgeons working on a 
patient at a hospital in Ohio. The remote ``operation'' took place 
over the $500 million Abilene Network, a new data pipeline that 
links more than three dozen research universities nationwide. It 
works at speeds 45,000 times faster than the best telephone modems 
that people now use to surf the Web.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon.com took another step yesterday toward  
building an online retail empire with the purchase of a 46 percent

	Rodman Upstaged on First Day  
</P>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- On his first day with the Los Angeles  
Lakers, Dennis Rodman was actually upstaged. It took the firing of 
coach Del Harris to push the flamboyant, controversial Rodman into 
the background. ``Already problems,'' Rodman joked during a news 
conference. Rodman, who finally signed a contract with the Lakers 
on Tuesday, showed up for a voluntary practice yesterday at the 
Forum, but met only a few of his teammates. Harris, in what may 
have been his last official act as coach, gave the regulars the day 
off.
