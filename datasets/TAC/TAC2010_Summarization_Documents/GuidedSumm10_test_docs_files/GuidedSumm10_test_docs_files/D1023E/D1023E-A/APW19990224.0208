</P>
<P>
	LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Another killer avalanche brought new  
heartache to Western Austria today, striking just miles from where 
rescuers were digging for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this 
winter. The latest torrent of snow smashed into the town of Valzur, 
where two people were killed and two survivors were pulled from the 
snow and debris. Seven miles away, in Galtuer, the death toll rose 
to 16, with 15 still missing.

	Military Pay Hike OK'd by Senate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted overwhelmingly today to give  
the nation's military the biggest benefits increase since the early 
1980s. The legislation includes an across-the-board 4.8 percent pay 
increase with further boosts in future years. The nation has 1.4 
million active-duty military members. Republican leaders said they 
wanted the first Senate bill passed this year to telegraph support 
for U.S. troops, particularly in light of a possible new deployment 
to Kosovo

	2000 Budget Might Exceed Limits  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new House speaker signaled today that  
Republicans might exceed spending limits enacted two years ago with 
President Clinton, placing the GOP in the ticklish position of 
evading strictures aimed at shrinking government. ``I'm not saying 
we're going to bust them or not bust them,'' Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., told reporters. Some top Republican aides went 
further, saying that in private consultations, the House GOP seemed 
to be moving toward surpassing the spending limits for fiscal 2000 
by billions of dollars.

	GOP Energized Over N.Y. Senate Race  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican fund-raisers seized on ``Hillary  
Clinton for Senate'' as their own rallying cry today as the first 
lady, undecided about a candidacy, summoned advice-givers to the 
White House family quarters. Whether she does or doesn't, the sheer 
specter of a run by Mrs. Clinton is enough to galvanize Republican 
donors, said Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, chairman of the 
National Republican Senatorial Committee. Mrs. Clinton met in the 
White House family quarters today with New York Sen. Charles 
Schumer, New York Rep. Nita Lowey and New Jersey Sen. Robert 
Torricelli.

	Mexican Cartels Said Penetrating US  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Drug Enforcement Administration official  
said today the Mexican narcotics cartels' penetration of the United 
States has increased dramatically. The statement by DEA 
Administrator Thomas Constantine comes just ahead of President 
Clinton's expected certification of Mexico's counter-drug effort. 
But Constantine, testifying to the Senate Caucus on International 
Narcotics Control, stopped short of saying Mexico should be 
decertified.

	Va. Bill Targets Some 'Junk' E-Mail  
</P>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Virginia is making criminals out of  
flagrant junk e-mailers with a new law to protect computer users 
from getting ``spammed.'' The legislation passed yesterday makes 
Virginia the fourth state in the country to pass an anti-spamming 
law and 18 others are considering them, said the National 
Conference of State Legislatures. Like Virginia, California's law 
allows for the jailing of some spammers while laws in Washington 
and Nevada impose civil fines.

</P>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. AP) -- The slumping Los Angeles Lakers fired  
coach Del Harris today. The move was announced while Dennis Rodman 
was participating in his first practice session with the team after 
signing a contract yesterday. Jerry West, the team's vice president 
of basketball operations, said that one of two assistants -- Kurt 
Rambis or Larry Drew -- will succeed Harris for at least the rest of 
the season.
