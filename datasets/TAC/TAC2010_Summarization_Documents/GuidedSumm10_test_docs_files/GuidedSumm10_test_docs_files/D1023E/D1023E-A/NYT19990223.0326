   ROME _ An avalanche crashed through a small Austrian resort on
Tuesday, killing at least eight people and leaving dozens missing,
in what officials feared could turn out to be Austria's worst snow
disaster in years.
</P>
<P>
   Driving snow and deadly winds prevented emergency helicopters
from flying into the ski village of Galtuer, near the Swiss border,
where local rescue workers spent the night digging through walls of
snow and rubble for survivors. At least 30 people, some of them
critically injured, were dug out by evening, Austrian television
said.
</P>
<P>
   The fiercest snowstorms in 50 years set off massive avalanches
all across the Alps in recent weeks, killing dozens of residents
and ski vacationers in France, Switzerland, Italy and Austria. In
Switzerland, officials said the death toll over the weekend had
risen to seven. Houses, railroads and highways were buried by
avalanches. Tens of thousands of tourists were stranded in some of
northern Europe's most fashionable resorts.
</P>
<P>
   In Galtuer, a town of 700 year-round inhabitants and about 3,000
tourists in Tyrol Province's Paznaun Valley, the avalanche
thundered though the heart of town near the village church at 4:00
p.m. instantly crushing four houses.
</P>
<P>
   The village, which has no hospital, had been cut off from the
outside world by heavy snows and high winds for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were drinking hot mulled wine, when suddenly it started''
Franz Wenko, a hotel operator in Galtuer, told Austrian television.
``he lights went out. It was dark. There was only dust and snow. We
got out of there as fast as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Thomas Schoenherr of the Austrian army, told Austrian radio
on Tuesday evening that about 55 people were feared missing in
Galtuer. Other estimates varied. Some officials said 20 to 30
people were still missing. Another government spokesman said that
only ``a few'' were unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian army helicopters remained grounded in the town of
Landeck, about 20 miles from Galtuer, overnight. Schoenherr said,
``We will meet again at 6 a.m. to assess what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the village, witnesses said the residents were digging
for survivors. ``Some 300 people are looking for buried people in
the mass of snow,'' Lufwig Walter, a ski instructor, told the
Austrian Press Agency. Walter said that in some parts of the
village, snow was 17 feet high. ``There's no let-up,'' he said,
referring to the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor, who is believed to be the only one in the village,
told an APA reporter by telephone, ``We are working in very basic
conditions.'' Snow fell heavily overnight, and the news agency
reported that another 20 inches were expected by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   All over Europe, the avalanches took lives and destroyed homes.
A 35-year-old German woman was killed when a snowslide ploughed
into a chalet in Sportsgastein, near Salzburg, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   In the ski village of Morgex, in northern Italy, a 52-year-old
woman was killed when her house collapsed under an avalanche before
daylight. Three others in the house survived, but she was killed
when a steel beam pierced her chest.
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, teams of rescue workers searching for survivors
found five more bodies on Tuesday, after an avalanche that crushed
chalets near Evolene on Sunday. Four of the victims _ one a child _
were French tourists. The other was a 28-year-old local man. Three
people were still missing as of Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In France, blizzards hampered rescuers seeking French skiers and
hikers missing in the Alps and the Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   In western Austria alone, about 20,000 tourists have been unable
to leave their hotels since last Wednesday. So much snow had fallen
over the last week that the Austrian Motoring Association
complained that its density monitors had been buried, making it
impossible to measure the snow fall. Swiss television reported that
as many as 60,000 people were snowbound in the resorts of Davos and
Klosters.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of Europe, driving snow caused trains to be
canceled. Highways were blocked or traffic was backed up for hours.
</P>
<P>
   The recent avalanches, labeled by some newspapers as ``the white
death,'' were described as the largest and most terrifying in
recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   `'I've seen many avalanches, but not the type that come into
your house and blow it away,'' said Nathan Wallace, 28, from
Mammoth Lakes, Calif., whose chalet near Chamonix was destroyed by
an avalanche on Feb. 9. `'It was more like a California
earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and his girlfriend, Alicia Boice, 21, were rescued two
hours after the roof of their chalet collapsed.
