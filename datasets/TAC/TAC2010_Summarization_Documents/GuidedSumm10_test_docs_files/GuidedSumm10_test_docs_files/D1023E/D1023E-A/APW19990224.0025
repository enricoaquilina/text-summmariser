	LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Austrian soldiers took advantage of a  
break in heavy snowfall today to mount a rescue of avalanche 
victims from a stricken Alpine town, joining villagers who dug with 
their bare hands in a frantic effort to reach those buried below. 
</P>
<P>
	The confirmed death toll from Tuesday's avalanche at Galtuer  
stood at 10 early today, but was expected to rise, provincial 
governor Wendelin Weingartner told reporters. He said 31 people 
were still missing in the village in the Tyrol province, near the 
Swiss border. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers have recovered at least 17 injured, seven of whom  
required intensive care. They were being flown in by helicopter to 
the hospital in nearby Landeck, where rescue operations were 
headquartered 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing everything humanly possible to rescue people,''  
said Austrian army spokesman Maj. Thomas Schoenherr in Landeck. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that soon after daybreak, about a dozen helicopters  
ferried some 200 troops to the avalanche site and also carried some 
of the injured back to hospitals in Landeck, 25 miles away. The 
main road into Galtuer was blocked by an earlier avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Children, some of whom had been playing in the streets when the  
snow rumbled over them, were among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters, tourists and residents joined in the search for  
survivors, some digging in the snow with their bare hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrible day for Tyrol,'' Weingartner said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Schoenherr said that people caught in the open by the slide had  
little chance of surviving more than a few minutes but those 
trapped in their homes, where they had air to breathe, had a chance 
of surviving considerably longer. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the United States, Germany and Switzerland had all  
offered to lend helicopters to the rescue efforts, and officials 
were evaluating how best to use them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galtuer avalanche was one of the worst to strike Central  
Europe this winter as the region continues to endure its heaviest 
snowfall in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of travelers were stranded in train stations,  
traffic jams and isolated resort towns across France, Italy 
Switzerland and Austria as the avalanches buried homes, roads and 
railways. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 60 people have died in avalanches in Europe this year.  
</P>
<P>
	In Austria's western Vorarlberg province, rescuers near  
Gargellen found a man and a woman Tuesday who were buried a day 
earlier when an avalanche swallowed a mountain restaurant, APA 
reported. The man was still alive, but bad weather prevented an 
emergency flight to a hospital, and he died later of his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Where helicopters could fly, rescuers flew in food and tons of  
mail to entire valleys that had been cut off by heavy snow. Some 
20,000 tourists were stranded in Tyrol province, and thousands of 
others in Vorarlberg. 
</P>
<P>
	In northwestern Italy, a mass of snow and debris tore through  
the small village of Morgex on Tuesday, killing a 52-year-old woman 
in her home and injuring three others. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the border in the Swiss state of Valais, avalanches  
thundered down repeatedly into a mountain valley Tuesday, propelled 
by fresh snow and winds gusting up to 95 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers in Evolene, Switzerland, found five more bodies Tuesday  
from avalanches on Sunday. Three people were still missing.
