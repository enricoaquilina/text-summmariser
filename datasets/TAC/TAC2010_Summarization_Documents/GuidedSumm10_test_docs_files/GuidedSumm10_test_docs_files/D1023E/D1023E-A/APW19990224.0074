	Broaddrick Details Alleged Assault  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At times tearful, Juanita Broaddrick appeared  
on NBC's ``Dateline'' tonight describing an alleged sexual assault 
by Bill Clinton 21 years ago. In the interview, taped Jan. 20 but 
held by the network until tonight, Mrs. Broaddrick cried briefly as 
she detailed the alleged assault. She said of Clinton, ``my hatred 
for him is overwhelming.'' Clinton, who was attorney general of 
Arkansas in 1978, refused comment earlier today on Mrs. 
Broaddrick's allegations, saying he stood by the statement of his 
attorney, David Kendall, who called the accusations ``absolutely 
false.''

	LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Another killer avalanche struck Western  
Austria today, striking just miles from where rescuers were digging 
for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this winter. The latest 
torrent of snow smashed into the town of Valzur, where two people

still missing.

	Violence Ahead of Iran Elections

	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A gunman opened fire on a moderate party's  
election headquarters today as reformers and hard-liners bickered 
over candidates in Iran's first local elections in 20 years. 
Witnesses said there were no casualties in the attack, in which a 
passenger on a motor scooter sprayed bullets. The shooting 
highlighted the tensions before Friday's polls, which pit 
supporters of reformist President Mohammad Khatami against his 
hard-line rivals in the Islamic government.

	Simpson Faces Custody Retrial  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The California Supreme Court rejected O.J.  
Simpson's appeal for custody of his two children today, and he 
faces a new custody trial that would include evidence on whether he 
killed their mother. The court unanimously denied review of a 
lower-court ruling that set aside a judge's order giving Simpson 
legal custody of his daughter Sydney, 13, and son, Justin, 10. 
Simpson, reached at home, said he was prepared to face another 
trial against his ex-wife's parents.

	Report: Net Increases Hate Groups  
</P>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The Internet is to blame for a dramatic  
increase in the number of hate groups operating in the United 
States, the Southern Poverty Law Center said. Their ranks swelled 
to 537 last year, up from 474 in 1997, the center said in its 
annual Intelligence Project report. ``The Internet is allowing the 
white supremacy movement to reach places it has never reached 
before -- middle- and upper-middle class, college-bound teens,'' 
said Mark Potok, a researcher for the center.
