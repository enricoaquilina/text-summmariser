	Independent Counsel Hearings Open  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress should just let the independent  
counsel law expire since almost any effort to revise it so soon 
after President Clinton's impeachment acquittal ``is likely to be a 
mistake,'' former White House chief of staff Howard Baker told a 
Senate committee today. He spoke to the Governmental Affairs 
Committee at its opening hearing on whether to renew, rewrite or 
let the law die. The 1978 statute is due to expire June 30. 
President Clinton, meanwhile, declined to comment on the issue but 
told reporters that White House lawyers will testify on the matter 
next week.

	Kosovo's Ethnic Albanians Unite  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo's rival ethnic Albanian  
factions today formed a coalition to push harder to secede from 
Serbia. The surprise announcement came a day after Kosovo peace 
talks concluded without any breakthrough on a deal to end a year of 
fighting in the southern Serbian province. The announcement spelled 
success for a long-term American and European goal -- getting ethnic 
Albanians to speak with one voice.

	Clinton: U.S. Has Stake in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today the United States  
has an interest in resolving the Kosovo conflict. ``I would argue 
we have a humanitarian interest,'' he said. ``The United States 
does have a direct interest in whether there is instability in the 
Balkans,'' Clinton said. Clinton is considering sending up to 4,000 
U.S. troops as part of a 28,000-strong NATO force that would go to 
Kosovo for at least three years if a peace plan were implemented.

	1 Dead in Avalanche in Austria  
</P>
<P>
	LANDECK, Austria (AP) -- Helicopters rescued stranded tourists in  
western Austria and another killer avalanche brought new heartache 
today. The new avalanche struck just miles from where rescuers were 
digging for victims of Europe's worst snowslide this winter. The 
latest torrent of snow smashed into the town of Valzur, where a 
dead woman and three survivors were pulled from the snow and 
debris. Five people remained missing, the Austria Press Agency 
said. Seven miles away the death toll rose to 16 from an avalanche 
yesterday.

	Prejudice May Be Heart Care Factor  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Subconscious prejudices among doctors may help  
explain why women and blacks complaining of chest pain are less 
likely than men and whites to receive the best cardiac testing, a 
study suggests. A new study of 720 physicians found that, with all 
symptoms being equal, doctors were only 60 percent as likely to 
order cardiac catheterization for women and blacks as for men and 
whites. For black women, the doctors were only 40 percent as likely 
to order catheterization.

	Greenspan Warns About Minimum Wage  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Raising the minimum wage could deny some  
teen-agers their chance at entry-level jobs, Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan said today. Delivering the Fed's semiannual 
economic report to Congress, Greenspan said increasing the wage 
probably would push inflation higher. President Clinton, in his 
State of the Union address last month, proposed raising the wage by 
$1 to $6.15 by September 2000.

	8th-Grader Takes Principal Hostage  
</P>
<P>
	MARYVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- An eighth-grade boy with a gun took his  
principal hostage this afternoon, apparently after the principal 
tried to discipline him for carrying the weapon in school. Montvale 
Elementary School Principal Jim Ratledge was taken hostage in his 
office shortly after 2 p.m., a spokeswoman for the school system 
said. No shots had been fired and no one was reported hurt, she 
said.

	Calif. Man Convicted of 11 Murders  
</P>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Ng was convicted today of 11  
counts of first-degree murder in a series of sex slavery killings 
dating to 1984 and 1985. The jury also found special circumstances 
of multiple murder that make Ng, a 38-year-old from Hong Kong, 
eligible for the death penalty, to be determined in a separate 
penalty phase of the trial.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed lower today after bond prices slid  
and pushed interest rates higher. The Dow Jones industrial average 
closed down 144.75 at 9,399.67. NYSE decliners led advancers 
1,782-1,202. The Nasdaq was higher most of the day but ended 36.95 
lower at 2,339.40.

	Lakers Fire Coach Del Harris  
</P>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers, mired at .500 12  
games through the abbreviated NBA season, fired coach Del Harris 
today. Jerry West, the team's vice president of basketball 
operations, said that one of two assistants -- Kurt Rambis or Larry 
Drew -- will handle the coaching duties for the rest of the season. 
The team made the announcement as it was adding Dennis Rodman to 
what on paper is one of the more talented teams in the league.
