<HEADLINE>  NYC Cops Charged in Shooting Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four white police officers were charged with  
murder Wednesday for killing an unarmed African immigrant in a hail 
of 41 bullets -- a shooting that has led to months of protests and a 
painful examination of police tactics and race relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard  
Murphy pleaded innocent in a Bronx courtroom to second-degree 
murder. They could get 25 years to life in prison on the murder 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Amadou Diallo, a 22-year-old street vendor from Guinea with no  
criminal record, was shot 19 times Feb. 4 in his vestibule by 
members of an elite street-crime unit looking for a rape suspect. 
Through their lawyers, the officers have said they thought Diallo 
had a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The slaying has frayed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's already strained  
relationship with the black community, and many have accused him of 
failing to understand the depth of New Yorkers' anger. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said Wednesday: ``We should allow the criminal justice  
system to now operate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John P. Collins set bail at $100,000 for each officer,  
even though District Attorney Robert Johnson had asked that they be 
held without bail. The officers left the courthouse together 
shortly after the arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson told the judge: ``On Feb. 4 in the vestibule in his own  
building, Amadou Diallo stood blameless, unarmed and defenseless 
when 19 of 41 shots were fired at him, struck him and killed him. 
... These four defendants intended to take his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving court, one of the officers, Carroll, shook hands  
with supporters and said in a quivering voice, ``I want to thank 
the New York City police officers and the Street Crime Unit for 
their undaunted support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The officers were immediately suspended from their jobs.  
</P>
<P>
	Marvyn Kornberg, Carroll's lawyer, called the intentional murder  
count ``ludicrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the district attorney saying? That they had nothing to  
do that night but roll up on an individual and attempt to kill him 
because he's black?'' the lawyer asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Brounstein, Boss's attorney, said in court that Johnson  
had ``succumbed to a political agenda. My client is innocent of all 
charges. There was no crime on February 4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the two months since Diallo was killed, 1,203 people have  
been arrested in demonstrations over Diallo's death, the alleged 
police torture of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in 1997 and the 
perception that law-abiding minorities are routinely humiliated by 
police stop-and-search tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Off-duty police officers and more than 25 of Diallo's friends  
and relatives packed the small courtroom for the 45-minute 
arraignment. About 1,000 demonstrators stood outside the 
courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the slaying, the street-crime unit has been ordered to  
wear uniforms instead of plainclothes, and 50 slots at the 
predominantly white division will be reassigned to minority police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The case also reflects tension over police attitudes and tactics  
nationally. Earlier this month, President Clinton said he was 
worried that recent charges of police misconduct could undermine 
the fight against crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers in the Diallo case did not testify before the grand  
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Brounstein and Culleton both said their clients began firing  
because they saw one officer on the ground. McMellon supposedly 
slipped and fell as he and the other officers confronted Diallo. 
</P>
<P>
	James Culleton, Murphy's lawyer, said his client ``had a sick  
feeling inside of him, believing that he was going to be shot, and 
he reacted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir  
attended a tribute to a police officer killed in the line of duty 
in 1996. Safir called Diallo's death a tragedy but urged critics of 
the Police Department to ``acknowledge the tragedies that befall 
our family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We grieve for Amadou Diallo and the four officers involved and  
pray they get a fair trial,'' Safir said.
