   NEW YORK _ With the indictments barely unsealed against four
police officers in the Amadou Diallo shooting, a battle is already
taking shape over physical evidence in the case, as lawyers and
experts seek to buttress their own versions of what happened based
on entrance wounds, bullet trajectories and other forensic details.
</P>
<P>
   Since there were apparently no eyewitnesses who saw the whole
incident except for the officers, such evidence _ and the often
fuzzy or conflicting interpretations it can yield _ could be a
crucial element in the officers' trial on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides hope to use forensic evidence to answer vexing
questions that have loomed since Feb. 4, when Diallo was killed in
fusillade of 41 bullets fired into the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   Where was he when the four plainclothes officers began shooting?
How quickly did he fall? Is there anything at the crime scene to
explain why the officers unleashed such firepower at an unarmed
man?
</P>
<P>
   The potential significance of the forensic evidence is apparent
in the efforts being expended by all sides to collect it:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau has done an
extensive re-enactment of the shooting at the department's firing
range.
</P>
<P>
   _ The FBI dispatched a team of ballistic experts from Washington
who spent days making measurements of the crime scene and traced
bullet trajectories with lasers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defense lawyers have employed their own set of crime-scene
specialists who may be called to rebut whatever theories the
prosecution's experts propose.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Diallo family has employed a pathologist whose autopsy has
led to charges by their lawyers that the West African immigrant was
shot repeatedly, even after he had collapsed, paralyzed, from his
initial wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forensic evidence is critical to the case because it is
the forensic evidence that offers the best challenge to the
credibility of the four police officers,'' said Peter Neufeld, a
lawyer for the Diallo family, which is planning to bring a civil
suit in the case. ``You can question their story based on common
sense and logic and what passersby might have seen or heard. But
none of that can be as devastating an impeachment as objective,
irrefutable scientific evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the officers' lawyers embrace the same
irrefutable science to argue a opposite position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not afraid of the forensic evidence,'' said Stephen
Worth, the attorney for Officer Edward McMellon, one of the four
accused of second-degree murder. ``What the forensic evidence will
not show is that these officers fired repeatedly into a prone body.
Quite the contrary, I expect it to show the opposite, that, namely,
the vast majority of the shots, if not all of the shots, were fired
at a standing person.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is far from certain that a verdict in the case
will hinge on forensic evidence. Assuming the officers testify,
their credibility in asserting that they feared for their lives in
the mistaken belief that Diallo was armed could also be a decisive
factor.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems likely that a dizzying parade of expert witnesses
will take the stand at the trial to debate the trigonometric
calculation of bullet trajectories, and more importantly, to
contradict one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, the physical evidence should support one
conclusion,'' said Peter R. De Forest, a professor at John Jay
College of Criminal Justice. ``But what often happens is that one
side or the other pays someone to dispute it and the science gets
polluted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx district attorney's office has declined to comment on
details of the evidence or how it might be used in the trial. But
the Diallo family lawyers have shown no such reticence, virtually
constructing a criminal case against the officers while preparing
the civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   One of the central disputes will likely focus on the officers'
assertion that Diallo continued to stand upright, even after he had
been hit by many of the 19 bullets that struck him. There are
apparently no eyewitnesses to confirm or rebut that account,
although several of Diallo's neighbors on Wheeler Avenue have said
they saw a portion of the incident and heard the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But the Diallo family's lawyers dismissed the officers' version
as ``absurd,'' pointing to an autopsy by their pathologist, Dr.
Cyril H. Wecht of Pennsylvania, that suggests that Diallo was
knocked down and paralyzed quite early in the barrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amadou Diallo was already on the ground with his spinal cord
severed,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a family adviser, ``so the
alibi they have put on the court record will devastate the
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The official autopsy by the city Medical Examiner's office does
not discuss the sequence of shots, the position of Diallo's body
when he was hit or whether he was paralyzed at any point, people
who have reviewed the report have said.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy report does indicate that two shots, one from the
front and one from the back, perforated Diallo's spine at separate
points. Those perforations are the primary basis for the family's
conclusion that he was paralyzed. Wecht's analysis that those shots
came early in the sequence is based, in part, on the amount of
blood from those wounds that filled his chest cavity.
</P>
<P>
   But Marvyn Kornberg, who represents Officer Sean Carroll, said
the officers' semiautomatic weapons fired so fast that it is
impossible to determine with any precision when the shots to the
chest were fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are talking about a matter of eight seconds,'' he said.
``You can't tell which is first and which is second. Any medical
examiner who testifies to that can expect some rigorous cross
examination.''
</P>
<P>
   A second set of bullets that struck Diallo's right leg and foot
also figure to be a source of debate. The city's autopsy indicates
that one shot struck Diallo just above the heel and traveled up the
calf before lodging behind the knee, people who reviewed the report
have said.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo family's lawyers believe this bullet, as well as a
second bullet that the autopsy says hit Diallo's middle toe
``adjacent to the front of the nail,'' indicate that Diallo was
shot after he had fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers dispute that conclusion and argue that the
incident took so little time that the officers most likely had no
chance to gauge the impact of their initial shots as they fired
subsequent rounds.
</P>
<P>
   There could also be a dispute over just how much time elapsed as
the 41 shots were fired, especially since witnesses have said they
heard a pause in the firing, apparently caused when Officer Edward
McMellon fell down while firing.
