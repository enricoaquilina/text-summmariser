SETTING A SCHEDULE IS THE NEXT LEGAL STEP

   NEW YORK _ Now that the four police officers charged with
killing Amadou Diallo have been arraigned, the next step in the
legal process will come at the end of the month, when their lawyers
and Bronx prosecutors are to appear before a judge to set a
schedule for the pretrial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   That meeting is set for April 30 at the state Supreme Court in
the Bronx, before Acting Justice Patricia Anne Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers will be given a timetable in which to make their
motions, or requests to the court. Prosecutors will be given
deadlines to respond to those motions. If the matters are likely to
be contested, the judge might set dates for hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Marvyn M. Kornberg, the lawyer representing Officer Sean
Carroll, said Thursday that in addition to standard motions like
those for discovery _ in which lawyers ask prosecutors to hand over
the information they have collected _ he expected defense lawyers
to ask the judge to review the grand jury minutes to decide if the
indictments were supported by the evidence. A request for a change
of venue is also possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg also said he plans to ask the court to review grand
jury attendance records to make sure that a quorum were present
each day, and that the grand jurors who voted to indict the
officers were present to hear all the evidence presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they weren't present, or there wasn't a quorum, these
indictments may be dismissed on motions,'' Kornberg said.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial motions, other issues may arise, including
whether any of the defendants ask for separate trials and whether
the officers waive their right to a jury trial. Police officers in
criminal trials have often asked for a judge to decide their case,
fearing that juries would be unsympathetic.
