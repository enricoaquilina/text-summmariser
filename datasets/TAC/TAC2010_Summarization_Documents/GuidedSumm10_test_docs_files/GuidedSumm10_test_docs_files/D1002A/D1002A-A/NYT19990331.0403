   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Al Sharpton stepped to the microphone
outside the Bronx County Couthouse and bellowed: ``The police in
there have just been charged with murder in the second degree,''
and the crowd of hundreds whooped and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time ever that a New York City police officer
has been indicted for murder, according to prosecutors and police
spokesmen, though a few have faced manslaughter charges.
</P>
<P>
   The three-count indictment _ two for second-degree murder, one
for reckless endangerment _ applied to all four of the white
officers who fired 41 bullets at African immigrant Amadou Diallo in
the wee hours of Feb. 4, as he stood, unarmed, in the vestibule of
his Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   The officers _ Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, and
Richard Murphy _ pleaded not guilty to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Judge John P. Collins set bail at $100,000
for each officer, which was expected to be met.
</P>
<P>
   Police commissioner Howard Safir suspended the officers from the
force immediately after announcement of the indictment, which was
returned by a grand jury last week but officially unsealed just
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next could intensify, rather than quell, the racial
tensions that have been simmering in the two months since the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's indictment coincided with the start of jury
selection in the trial of the five officers in Brooklyn who were
indicted in last year's torture and sodomy, inside a stationhouse
bathroom, of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The Louima trial, too, is bound to be perceived _ and treated _
as a showcase of the dark underbelly of the N.Y.P.D. Potential
jurors have been instructed to fill out a 42-page questionnaire,
asking 128 questions, such as ``Do you think there is a prospect of
social unrest following a verdict in this case?'' and ``Have you
ever been exposed to persons who show, or who have shown, racial,
sexual, religious, or ethnic prejudice?'' and ``How would you rate
the job the New York City Police Department is doing in dealing
with crime?''
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo case has spawned three official investigations _ by
the US Justice Department, federal prosecutors, and the New York
state attorney general _ into a possible pattern of racial
discrimination in the department's practices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some police are shouting back. A few hundred off-duty
officers rallied outside the Bronx courthouse Wednesday, as well,
some shouting, ``No justice, no police'' _ a threatening play on
Sharpton's chant, ``No justice, no peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the courtroom, though, the atmosphere was solemn. The
four officers, wearing suits, sat stonefaced. Among the spectators,
on one side of the aisle were Diallo's parents, who had flown in
from Guinea for the occasion, along with friens and relatives. On
the other side were friends of the officers. There were no
outbursts. Diallo's mother, Kadiadou Diallo, had tears in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, lawyer Johnnie Cochran, who is representing
Diallo's parents, announced he will sue the city for civil damages,
saying, ``We will be relentless in our pursuit of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo shooting has set off the largest protests the city
has seen in years _ and cast a serious blemish on the pride of
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's five years as mayor. Crime has
dramatically declined, with murders down by over 70 percent, to the
lowest point since the early 1960s. But many people are now
wondering if the social cost _ white officers behaving too
aggressively and intrusively in minority neighborhoods _ might be
too high.
</P>
<P>
   In a 15 days leading up to Wednesday's indictment, 1,203 people
_ including prominent officials, lawyers and other professionals of
all races and religions _ were arrested in Sharpton-led
civil-disobedience protests outside police department headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Those protests are now over, but Sharpton promised Wednesday,
``We will keep on marching, we will keep the pressure on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides Wednesday offered previews of the cases
they will argue when the trial starts April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson noted New York law does
not require him to prove premeditation on the part of the four
officers. Rather, he need only show that they shot Diallo ``with
intent to cause'' Diallo's death, acted with ``a depraved
indifference to human life,'' and ``did recklessly engage in
conduct which created a grave risk of death.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers called their clients ``political
prisoners,'' and said they would show the incident was ``a tragedy,
not a crime,'' because the officers had ``reasonable'' cause to
believe Diallo was reaching for a gun when they fired. One lawyer
said his client, Richard Murphy, did not fire until he saw McMellon
fall. McMellon had slipped on the sidewalk, but Murphy thought, his
lawyer said, that he had been shot.
