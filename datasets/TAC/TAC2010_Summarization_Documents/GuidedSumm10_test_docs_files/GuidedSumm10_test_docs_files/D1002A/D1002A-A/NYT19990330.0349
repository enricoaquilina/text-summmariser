   NEW YORK _ The parents of Amadou Diallo plan to meet with the
Bronx district attorney on Wednesday to receive a preview of the
criminal charges that the grand jury voted to bring against the
four New York City police officers who killed their son seven weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's father, Saikou Amad Diallo, arrived here Wednesday from
the West African nation of Guinea and said he was anxious to see
the officers not only charged, but brought to trial. ``We are
waiting for this, for justice,'' he said, ``and we feel strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother, Kadiadou Diallo, and two of her children, are
expected to arrive at Newark International Airport from Guinea on
Thursday morning. She had been expected Tuesday, but had to cancel
her flight because the U.S. Embassy in the Guinean capital of
Conakry was unexpectedly closed Monday and she was not able to pick
up her visas.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, who are divorced, were last in New York in early
February, when they came to collect their son's body for burial in
Guinea and found that his death had set off a storm of political
protest that has yet to abate.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, a 22-year-old immigrant who worked as a street peddler
in Manhattan and attended computer classes, was shot in the
vestibule of his Bronx apartment building Feb. 4. He was unarmed.
The four officers fired 41 shots, hitting Diallo 19 times.
</P>
<P>
   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson plans to meet with the
Diallos shortly before 2 p.m., when the grand jury indictments are
scheduled to be unsealed in open court. Johnson has refused to
confirm reports, based on people familiar with the case, that the
officers will be charged with second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized the daily protests over the
Diallo shooting and is an adviser to the family, also is expected
to attend the meeting, said Steven Reed, Johnson's spokesman.
Sharpton's National Action Network in Harlem has helped finance the
Diallo family's trips to and from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer representing one of the officers in the shooting,
Stuart London, has criticized the delays in unsealing the
indictments against the officers, particularly since the grand jury
voted on the charges last Thursday. Asked if the timing of the
arraignment was scheduled to accommodate the Diallo family's travel
plans, Reed said he would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for a prosecutor to brief a victim's family on
criminal charges, he added, even in cases far less publicized than
the Diallo case. ``It is the district attorney's practice to have
families of the deceased hear about grand jury results in
advance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During their stay in New York City, Diallo's parents will have a
packed schedule of meetings and rallies, organized by Sharpton,
that will keep them in the spotlight. When they came in February,
shortly after their son's killing, they attained near-celebrity
status _ trailed by television cameras, greeted by crowds and
transported from place to place by motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, both parents are expected to meet with many of the
people who were arrested for civil disobedience during protests at
Police Headquarters over the last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barron, an organizer of the protests, said the Diallos
would speak at rallies organized around other high-profile cases in
which the police are accused of brutality against young black men.
</P>
<P>
   He said they would be taken to U.S. District Court in Brooklyn,
for example, where a jury is being selected to hear the case
against police officers charged with brutalizing a Haitian
immigrant, Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, according to Sharpton, will stay in New York City
for about 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also plans to be in the Bronx on
Wednesday. The mayor is scheduled to rename the block in front of
the 50th Precinct station house, on Kingsbridge Avenue at West
236th Street. The block will named for Officer Vincent Guidice, who
died in May 1996 after he fell on the shards of a broken mirror
while responding to a domestic dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Bronx Supreme Court on Tuesday, about 400 off-duty
police officers chanting ``No Justice, No Police'' and ``Its a
Tragedy, Not a Crime'' rallied to show support for the four police
officers before their expected arraignment.
