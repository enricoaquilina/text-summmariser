	NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge ordered four police officers Wednesday  
to stand trial for the fatal shooting of an unarmed West African 
immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard  
Murphy left the courthouse without comment. They have all pleaded 
innocent to second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge rejected defense arguments that public outcry and  
intense media coverage following the shooting put undue pressure on 
the grand jury to issue the murder indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers were indicted in March. They are accused of firing  
41 times at Amadou Diallo while searching for a rape suspect on 
Feb. 4. Diallo was hit 19 times. Attorneys for the officers said 
their clients mistakenly believed Diallo was reaching for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants remain on restricted duty pending the outcome of  
the trial, which is scheduled for January.
