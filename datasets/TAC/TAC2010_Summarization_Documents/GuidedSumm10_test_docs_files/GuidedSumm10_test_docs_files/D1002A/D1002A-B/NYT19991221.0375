COLUMN: WELCOMING DIALLO CASE TO ALBANY

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Since last week, when Albany was named the future
site of the trial of four officers charged with murdering Amadou
Diallo, most analysis has focused on whether a jury drawn from an
overwhelmingly white county will be more sympathetic to the
officers than a Bronx jury would have been.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the city of Albany, where about 20 percent of the
104,000 residents are members of minority groups, residents wonder
how the trial and the inevitable protests surrounding it will
affect a debate over how to deal with allegations of homegrown
police abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders and politicians in this city's minority
neighborhoods have tried for years to focus attention on what they
say is police abuse of African-Americans. Last month, police
officers searching for a suspect in the shooting of two fellow
officers were accused of manhandling a poor neighborhood, using
racist language and roughing up residents on the street. A grocery
store surveillance camera appeared to have captured police officers
shoving and kicking one person and pushing a man in handcuffs
against a store window. The tape was broadcast repeatedly on local
television.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about the search in the neighborhood, Arbor Hill,
drew quick responses. Four officers face disciplinary charges and
support has grown for the formation of a civilian board to
investigate allegations of police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Albany's neighborhood leaders and minority politicians had
gotten the attention they wanted on police conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, with the Diallo decision, they had much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is perfect for the city of Albany,'' said Carolyn
McLaughlin, a city councilwoman who sponsored a civilian review
board proposal. It's unfortunate that Diallo's family will have to
travel here for the trial, she said, but added, ``I think we're
going to see things, hear some things that will wake up this whole
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Mair, president of an Arbor Hill neighborhood group,
called the Diallo case ``an object lesson of what we can expect if
we don't correct the current situation.'' Yet, he said, he's
concerned that blurring of the local debate and the Diallo road
show led by the Rev. Al Sharpton could hurt. ``If they do the New
York City rant and rave, you're going to lose the whole
community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world, Albany is the last outpost before New
York's North Country, a city where lobbyists and legislators swarm
around a castle-like Capitol and all other signs of life are frozen
in the stories of William Kennedy and the lore of the Corning
dynasty. But inside the ornate chamber of the Common Council on
Monday night, at a hearing on the police proposals, a side of
Albany was on display that echoes the angry rhetoric heard in many
cities and towns with significant minority populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of Albany Police Department's relationship with
African-Americans is replete with stories, incidents and events
that indicate a clear pattern of disrespect, misunderstanding,
discrimination and racism,'' the Rev. H. Ward Greer, of the
African-American Clergy United for Empowerment, told the council.
Speakers invoked past cases, including the 1984 police killing of
an unarmed, mentally handicapped black man, which remains a
rallying point for critics.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals for a civilian complaint board have come and gone over
the years, but now the possibility seems greater. It is not lost on
officials here that New York City has both a civilian board and the
Diallo case, but they say a well-designed board can be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Gerald D. Jennings, who previously opposed the idea, set
up a panel to review proposals. He said citizens need to feel their
complaints about the police would be heard, although he said he did
not favor the proposal to give a civilian board subpoena power.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor defended the police, both in general, and in their
behavior in Arbor Hill. ``We had two officers shot,'' he said.
``They had to sweep a neighborhood and look for an unarmed man.''
But he said officers who are overly aggressive will be punished.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped for little overlap between the Diallo trial and
the local debate. He said he thought Albany would stay focused on
its concerns. As for the Diallo protests, he said he called
Sharpton last week and was reassured. ``He said, `I have nothing
against your city,''' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday Sharpton said he was eager to know more about the
debate in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably one of the first things we'll look at,'' he
said.
