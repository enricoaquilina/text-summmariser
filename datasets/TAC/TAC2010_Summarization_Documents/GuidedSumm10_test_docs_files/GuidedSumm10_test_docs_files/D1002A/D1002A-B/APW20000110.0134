<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, activists call for feds to monitor Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Further questioning the change in venue from the
Bronx to Albany, lawmakers and activists called on the U.S. Justice Department
Monday to monitor the upcoming murder trial of four police officers.
<P>
	   The New York State Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative Caucus
argued that moving the trial to Albany is an attempt by the defendants to avoid
facing a predominately black and Hispanic jury pool and constitutes special
treatment for the police.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers are accused of killing West African immigrant Amadou
Diallo in a hail of bullets after mistaking him for a rape suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Diallo incident is another example that something is wrong with the
relationship between communities of color and law enforcement agencies,"
Democrat Assemblyman Keith Wright of Manhattan, chairman of the caucus, said.
"Now more than ever there is a need to take a look at how our police officers
are trained and prepared for the communities in which they perform their
duties."
</P>
<P>
	   Wright expressed particular concern that the percentage of black and
Hispanic jurors be representative of the community. The caucus is also
requesting that New York City and Albany residents be given access and seats in
the court room to monitor the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawmakers also called Monday for the Justice Department to monitor the
trial to make sure there are no violations of civil rights.
</P>
<P>
	   "There will be a lot of anger in the streets of Albany and in New York City
if justice is not served and that's the primary reason that we have requested
that the Justice Department monitor the trial," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
	   A grand jury indicted the plain clothes officers in March after they fired
41 bullets at Diallo, an unarmed street vender, while searching a Bronx
neighborhood for a rape suspect on Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the officers - Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy - have said their clients mistakenly believed the victim was
reaching for a gun. The four officers were charged with second-degree murder and
all pleaded innocent. Jury selection in their trial is scheduled to begin on
Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting touched off weeks of angry protests leading to more than 1,100
arrests. Activists had planned to demonstrate outside the Bronx courthouse once
the officers went on trial.
</P>
<P>
	   But in an extraordinary decision, a state appeals court moved the trial of
the officers to Albany. In its 11-page ruling, the court said it would be
impossible for the officers to get a fair trial in the Bronx because of media
treatment of the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one is saying that justice won't be served, but we've asked the Justice
Department to monitor the trial just the same," state Sen. David Paterson, a
Manhattan Democrat and another member of the caucus, said. "Because if things do
go awry and there are problems, the Justice Department will be able to put into
process items that might prevent a similar incident occurring again,"
</P>
<P>
	   Anne Pope, president of the Albany branch of the NAACP, compared the Diallo
trial to a recent incident in which 33-year-old Tracy Grady allegedly wrested a
gun from two Albany police officers and shot them before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the incident, police swarmed through a black neighborhood dressed
in combat fatigues and helmets, allegedly using excessive force and brutalizing
residents in their search for the gunman.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are concerned to make sure that no one thinks Albany is a safe have for
police who have acted brutally and irresponsibly, whether in New York City or
right here in our own neighborhoods," Pope said.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo supporters in Albany Monday announced the formation of a Capital
Region Justice for Diallo Committee. Its members said they will "monitor" the
trial, provide support for members of Diallo family when they are in Albany for
the proceedings and to continue pushing for formation of a civilian review board
to oversee the activities of Albany police.
