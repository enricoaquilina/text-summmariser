NEWS ANALYSIS: MOVING OF DIALLO TRIAL COMES UNDER FIRE
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ On the seesaw that is political life in New York, the
Rev. Al Sharpton was up last March, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was
down. Sharpton was leading demonstrations and a civil disobedience
campaign to protest the police shooting of Amadou Diallo. Giuliani
was on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court
ruled that the trial of the four officers charged with
second-degree murder in Diallo's death should be moved from the
Bronx to Albany, specifically citing the demonstrations and more
than 1,000 arrests that accompanied them.
</P>
<P>
   In embracing the decision, Giuliani did not mention Sharpton by
name, but there was no question where his finger was pointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened is, there was a concerted effort on the part of
numerous people to make it impossible to have a fair trial in New
York,'' the mayor said Sunday. ``When you start marching, demanding
that people be indicted _ you get out in front of courthouses and
demand that people be indicted, that's like the Old West. I mean
the reality is that the judge, the judges, five judges unanimously
decided that, rendered a very, very wise decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, of course, rejected the implication that his strategy
had backfired. None of the orchestrated arrests had taken place in
the Bronx, he said, and the demonstrations had stopped after the
indictments.
</P>
<P>
   But the court's decision, by five appointees of Gov. George
Pataki, did not just move the trial: it validated Giuliani's
worldview, whether of the protesters or what he considered biased
news media coverage. It also moved a potentially troublesome trial
from the city to a conservative county where further protests are
only likely to burnish Giuliani's reputation as a tough sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   David Meyer, an associate professor of sociology at the
University of California at Irvine, who observed the Diallo
protests while teaching at City College, said: ``There's a
political angle _ protecting Giuliani. If demonstrators are in the
street every day talking about police brutality'' during a Bronx
trial, he said, ``it's something he has to respond to every day in
an election year.''
</P>
<P>
   So inevitably, perhaps, some saw a decision intended to remove
the case from politics as being steeped in it. Norman Siegel,
executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said that
in the Abner Louima case, in which thousands marched over the
Brooklyn Bridge in protest, the judge, Eugene M. Nickerson, said he
would keep looking for jurors until he found an impartial jury.
</P>
<P>
   In the Diallo case, the Appellate Division said any attempt to
impanel a jury would be ``fruitless.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference, Siegel asserted, is the judiciary. Federal
judges like Nickerson are appointed for life, and thus are
independent of any political influence. In the state court system,
judges are appointed by politically elected officials and must be
reappointed. ``The judges are very ambitious,'' he said. ``In the
middle level of the court system any good judge who's not near
retirement is thinking in the back of their mind, wouldn't it be
nice to be on the New York Court of Appeals?''
</P>
<P>
   Deliberately or not, Siegel said, the decision also meant that
five white male judges were removing the case from the jurisdiction
of a black woman, Justice Patricia Anne Williams, who was scheduled
to preside over the case in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hearing in the last 48 hours that at least the result, if
not the intention, was to take her out,'' he said. ``You don't want
to have that as the backdrop to a potentially polarizing and
racially charged trial. This gives material to people who don't
believe in the legal system or want to undermine the legal
system.''
</P>
<P>
   G. Michael Bellinger, a former prosecutor now in private law
practice, agreed. Bellinger, who is black, spent Sunday researching
similar decisions, he said Sunday night, and concluded that no
black criminal defendant had had his or her trial moved before a
judge had even tried to impanel an impartial jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cops in the Bronx usually opt for a bench trial,'' he said.
``We know the judge in this case is black, and it just so happens
that the appellate court rushes in and saves them.''
</P>
<P>
   Would the man accused of attacking Nicole Barrett with a brick
be granted a change of venue at a similar stage in his legal
proceedings, he asked, noting the torrent of news coverage that
case had received?
</P>
<P>
   Steven Zeidman, executive director for the Fund for the Modern
Courts, agreed that ``with African-American defendants, those
motions are made and denied in a heartbeat.'' But, he said, that
did not mean it was wrong to move the Diallo case; rather, it meant
too few previous cases had been given a change of venue. ``It makes
sense under the law,'' he said of the decision, ``but I think
people rightly look at it and say why this case as opposed to all
the others.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he defended the decision _ if not the choice of Albany
_ he said he was worried that it could have a ``chilling effect''
on community activity. ``Will this case be used as a bellwether
from now on in a criminal case if there is a hue and cry in
public?''
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Siegel, a history professor at Cooper Union, defended
the court's response to the protests, although he, too, wondered,
``why Albany?'' In trying to use protest to influence judicial
proceedings, he contended, Sharpton had brought ``Southern
politics'' north.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are looking at the South of 40 years ago,'' he said,
``this is the kind of thing that liberals are supposed to be
opposed to _ that mobs could sway the courts.''
