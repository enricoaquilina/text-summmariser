   NEW YORK _ The four police officers accused of murder in the
shooting death of Amadou Diallo plan to testify in their own
defense at their trial next month and are leaning toward choosing a
trial by a judge instead of a jury, according to their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of the officers, and its credibility, will be
focal points of the trial because there were no other witnesses to
the initial encounter in February between Diallo, a West African
immigrant, and the plainclothes officers who killed him in a
fusillade of 41 bullets. The shooting came to crystallize the
debate over the Police Department's aggressive tactics in cracking
down on crime, especially in minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The officers have said through their lawyers that they
mistakenly thought that Diallo, an unarmed street peddler with no
criminal record, was reaching for a gun. But they have not spoken
publicly about the incident, they declined to appear before the
grand jury and they were not debriefed by their superiors. So even
after weeks of protests and months of often angry argument, the
only version of what the officers say happened in the vestibule of
Diallo's Bronx apartment building last Feb. 4 has been the largely
generic account offered by their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx district attorney's office has also had little to say
about the case since the officers were indicted on second-degree
murder charges in March. But prosecutors and the defense have spent
months compiling evidence for the trial, which is scheduled to
begin Jan. 3, as well as debating whether an impartial jury can be
picked in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   A review of much of that evidence, including witness statements,
crime- scene videotapes and forensic analyses, reveals a much more
sharply defined picture of the incident and underscores what are
likely to be the critical contested issues at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence also includes details of the early-morning shooting
and the investigation that were not previously known, including
these:
</P>
<P>
   One witness to the end of the shooting told investigators that
one of the officers was ducking as if he thought he was being fired
upon.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness said that after the shooting, she heard an
unidentified officer remark, ``This is what we are going to say,''
a statement that could be used to undermine the credibility of the
officers' accounts at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for one of the officers said there was no evidence that
the witness was referring to one of the four officers.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence also shows that investigators spent weeks
unsuccessfully pursuing a tip that Diallo may have been unusually
fearful on the night he was shot because he had been told about
another peddler who was robbed by men in plainclothes with shields
around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   And the medical examiner who did the autopsy told investigators
he believed Diallo was felled by one of the first of the 19 shots
that hit him, a conclusion the defense will try to rebut.
</P>
<P>
   Although the course of the trial remains undetermined,
interviews and the evidence reviewed by The New York Times indicate
that the case will largely focus on three unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   One issue will be the question of when Diallo was incapacitated
by his wounds. The defense and the prosecution are expected to
present conflicting analyses of whether Diallo was felled by one of
the earlier bullets that hit him.
</P>
<P>
   Another will be the question of how long it took the officers to
fire 41 shots. The shorter the duration, the easier it will be for
the officers to argue that the encounter happened too fast for them
to recognize their mistake.
</P>
<P>
   And then there will be the matter of whether there was a pause
in the firing. Seven witnesses have told investigators that they
heard a pause after the initial shots. Prosecutors are expected to
argue that the pause gave the officers a clear opportunity to
realize that Diallo did not pose a threat.
</P>
<P>
   If the prosecution were to show that Diallo was felled by an
early shot, or that the officers continued to fire after a
significant pause when it was clear he was not a threat, it would
help the argument that the officers had shown a depraved
indifference to human life, as outlined in the charge of
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo case is already the most closely watched police
shooting of the decade because the debate has gone beyond the
question of whether the officers, all members of an elite Street
Crime Unit known for its aggressive tactics, committed a crime.
Instead, the debate has evolved into an argument between those who
applaud the obvious success of the city's gung-ho crime-fighting
strategies and those who say the success was obtained through a
reckless trampling of civil rights, especially those of minorities.

   Defense lawyers cited the politically charged atmosphere of the
case in court papers last month, when they indicated they were
likely to select a bench trial because they said it might be
impossible to pick an impartial jury. ``We are not afraid of the
law, we are not afraid of the facts, but we are afraid of the
politics,'' said Stephen Worth, the lawyer for Officer Edward
McMellon.
</P>
<P>
   The Street Crime Unit, which searches thousands of unarmed
people a year as part of its mission to seize illegal guns, is at
the heart of the controversy. Many officers say they believe they
are expected to seize at least one gun a month, although police
officials say the unit does not have a quota.
</P>
<P>
   Citywide, during the 15-month period that ended in March, police
officers stopped 56,499 people on suspicion of carrying a weapon
but found a weapon only 2.6 percent of the time, according to the
state attorney general's office. How the propensity by officers to
suspect a weapon, even when none exists, colors their judgment
during potentially deadly, split-second encounters is likely to
become an issue at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, records filled out by several of the officers in the
Diallo case show they had often stopped people on the mistaken
assumption they were carrying a gun. Officer Sean Carroll, for
example, in the six weeks before the shooting, stopped men in six
separate encounters who had no weapon, according to documents from
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's perceptions are particularly critical because it is
he, according to his lawyers, who mistakenly yelled ``gun'' when,
the lawyers say, Diallo pulled out his wallet. One witness has said
she also heard an officer yell ``gun'' as the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strongest evidence I have is my client and his
testimony,'' said Carroll's lawyer, John Patten. ``He will tell
exactly what he observed, what he reacted to and what he felt.''
</P>
<P>
   If the officers' stated belief that Diallo had a gun _ although
mistaken _ is held to be reasonable, then, under the law, their use
of deadly force could have been justified. But there are many
facets to such a finding, including the question of whether the
belief of danger they might have held as the shooting began was
still a reasonable one by the time the 41st bullet was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers say that the fact that most of the police
force's encounters with suspected gun holders do not end in gunfire
bolsters their contention that in the Diallo incident the victim
did several things that contributed to the shooting, like ignoring
a command to freeze. The lawyers, however, have refused to provide
a detailed description of what they say were Diallo's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what was taking place in front of him, what he heard
and what he saw,'' said James Culleton, the lawyer for Officer
Richard Murphy, ``his actions seemed completely reasonable. He
thought he was about to be shot.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the shooting, Diallo started home from 14th
Street in Manhattan, where he sold videos, at 11 p.m., according to
a Metrocard found in his wallet. At 11:55, when one of his
roommates came home, Diallo was on the couch in his apartment at
1157 Wheeler Avenue, watching television.
</P>
<P>
   Eight minutes later, another witness mentioned seeing Diallo
walking down the block. About 12:20 a.m., another witness reported
seeing a man standing in the doorway of Diallo's building, peering
up and down the street suspiciously. But he said the man wore a
green hat. Diallo wore a red knit Yankees hat that night.
</P>
<P>
   The officers pulled onto that block of Wheeler Avenue about
12:40 a.m. Many accounts have had them searching for a rapist that
night, but a commander told investigators that their primary
mission was to look for suspects in a pattern of robberies and
homicides.
</P>
<P>
   The officers have said through their lawyers that they spotted
Diallo, 22, in the doorway of his building as their unmarked red
Ford Taurus passed by. According to the officers' account, Diallo
receded into the shadows, then peered out after them, suspiciously,
so the officers backed up the car to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll and McMellon got out first and approached. Witness
accounts differ on whether the vestibule, with its two overhead
fixtures, was well lighted or dark that night, and what happened
next remains unclear. The officers _ their shields dangling from
their necks, according to one witness _ have said they identified
themselves and told Diallo to freeze, but that he made a sudden
movement toward his waist and they fired. The officers, who are
waging a joint defense, have not indicated who fired the first
shot.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner who performed the autopsy, Dr. Joseph
Cohen, concluded that one of first shots hit Diallo in the aorta,
critically wounding and felling him. ``The victim was definitely
rendered incapacitated, possibly after the first or the first
several shots,'' Cohen told Detective Mark Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he believed that Diallo ``was down or going down
before the end of the first several rounds fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambulance personnel noted a slight loss of blood when they
arrived, a fact that the medical examiner considered in concluding
that the aorta had been hit by an early shot, thereby reducing
Diallo's blood pressure. Investigators have not determined who
fired that shot.
</P>
<P>
   The defense team has said that any suggestion about the sequence
of shots is unfounded speculation. Officers are trained to shoot
until they have stopped a potentially deadly suspect. The officers
have maintained, through their lawyers, that Diallo stayed upright
as most of the 19 bullets hit him.
</P>
<P>
   According to the officers' account, Murphy and Officer Kenneth
Boss followed McMellon and Carroll toward the stoop. At one point,
the officers' lawyers have said, McMellon slipped and fell back,
creating the impression he had been shot. Carroll told a doctor
that night that he, too, fell while scrambling away from Diallo,
who he believed had a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Seven witnesses have told investigators there was a pause in the
firing. Edward Martinez said he was watching TV when he heard the
shots. ``Three shots and then a pause,'' he recounted, ``and then
there was a barrage of firing.'' He estimated the pause lasted two
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The defense contends there was no pause, citing accounts of
other witnesses who did not hear one. The defense has argued that
the semiautomatic pistols the officers used can fire so fast _ 16
rounds in less than six seconds _ that the officers had no chance
to catch themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some elements of the time line for the shooting are known. The
first 911 call came in at 12:41 a.m., from a woman who reported
hearing gunshots. Thirty seconds later the shooting is clearly
over, as Boss gets on the radio to request ``a bus and a boss,''
police parlance for an ambulance and a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   When the supervisors arrived they found Diallo sprawled on the
vestibule floor. He had never said a word, according to the
officers' account.
</P>
<P>
   The crime scene video made by investigators shows Diallo on the
floor, his left leg crossed over his right, wearing a blue and
white windbreaker, black jeans and sneakers without socks. His
beeper and wallet are near his outstretched right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses reported a sad, stunned aftermath. Two recalled how
one officer just kept pacing back and forth. Then, one of the
witnesses said, ``he threw his cap to the ground and was shaking in
the street.''
