   NEW YORK _ Jamie H. Hughes stood outside his building on Wheeler
Avenue on Thursday, across the street from where Amadou Diallo was
shot at 41 times, and said words that were echoing throughout his
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he said, he had heard that the four police officers who
opened fire on Diallo would be tried in Albany County, and not in
the Bronx. And yes, he said, he was angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair,'' Hughes said, standing near his car in the
cold evening, hands wedged deep into the pockets of his leather
jacket. ``If justice is what we are seeking, and if justice is
working, then I think everybody should be treated equally. A normal
person who gets arrested in the Bronx would not get a trial outside
the Bronx. So why should they?''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, 29, a building superintendent, might as well have been
speaking for most of those in his neighborhood, where bewilderment
and disappointment greeted the news that a state appellate court
had ordered the police officers' murder trial to be moved upstate.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate panel said the change of venue would ensure that
the officers would receive a fair trial, and that jurors would be
less likely to be influenced by the intense pretrial publicity. But
among residents of Wheeler Avenue, and passers-by on the streets
nearby, the feeling was much different.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they recalled details: Diallo, a street vendor with
no criminal record, was struck by 19 of the 41 police bullets. He
was unarmed. He died on his own doorstep, where the bullet holes
still mark the hallway, and the door's wooden frame shows splinters
where the bullets passed through.
</P>
<P>
   All of this happened in the Bronx, they said, and that's where
the trial belongs: where concerned residents could attend the
trial, and where local jurors could hear the facts, one by one, as
the case unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel strong about everything that happened,'' said Omar
D. Jackson, 25, a cable wireman who lives two doors down from where
the shooting occurred. ``Once they move the trial out of the Bronx,
I think some slack will be cut.''
</P>
<P>
   A few houses farther up the street, Allison Boodram, 18, stood
on her doorstep with her 5-year-old sister, Vada, and said she was
disappointed. She knew Diallo, and had been eager to see the police
officers in the courtroom, and to hear an explanation _ any
explanation _ for why so many shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping that when it started in January, that I would be
able to go to the courthouse,'' Ms. Boodram said. ``But Albany? Who
can go there?''
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the street, Diallo's friends and neighbors had
questions, some for the appellate panel, some for the police
officers. Did the appellate judges think the people of the Bronx
could not be fair? Would the jury in Albany be racially diverse?
Would the prosecutors be aggressive if they were far from the local
scene, working in a climate with less political tension?
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the ultimate question, the one that almost
everybody had. Lou Guzman, 25, a Rite-Aid stock clerk who lives on
Wheeler Avenue, put it simply: ``I would like to know, I would like
to hear it myself: Why did it take 41 shots?''
</P>
<P>
   Then he framed another: ``Did they honestly think they could get
away with it?''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a police cruiser eased down the street, and the
officers inside fixed their views stonily ahead. They did not stop,
avoiding contact with the reporters and the residents who had taken
up station on the street.
</P>
<P>
   But later, after the cold had chased most of the residents
inside and the reporters away, a few police officers offered their
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the intense feelings on Wheeler Avenue underscored the
soundness of the judges' decision. The depth of the divide between
the police and the residents of the Bronx is too great, they said,
for a case like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that was me on trial, and I had a choice, I'd rather be out
of the borough,'' one officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Another officer, standing on Westchester Avenue, less than a
block from where Diallo died, said the move to Albany was the four
officers' best chance for a fair hearing. Whatever the facts of the
case, and the tactics of the officers' defense, the people of the
Bronx, he said, would hear nothing of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is known throughout the department that you can't get a
fair trial here,'' he said. ``You have to get a change of venue or
a judge trial. Either that, or you go to jail _ and then you close
the cell door behind you.''
