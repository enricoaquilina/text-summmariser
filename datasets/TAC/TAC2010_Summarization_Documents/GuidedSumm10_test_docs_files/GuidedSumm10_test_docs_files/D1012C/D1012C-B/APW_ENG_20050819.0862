Greek authorities rule out carbon monoxide poisoning in Cypriot airliner crash
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ATHENS, Greece
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greek coroners investigating the crash of a Cypriot airliner that killed all 121
people on board ruled out Friday that some may have been made unconscious by
carbon monoxide, but were still examining whether other fumes knocked out the
crew and passengers.
</P>
<P>
Tests were carried out on the co-pilot, three female flight attendants, an
infant, and a random adult, Athens' chief coroner Fillipos Koutsaftis
said.
</P>
<P>
"This was the fastest test and the most secure," Koutsaftis said after meeting
Justice Minister Anastasios Papaligouras. "We are still doing tests for other
gases, poisons, drugs and alcohol."
</P>
<P>
He said it would be another few days before the completion of more toxicology
tests that may determine if something else could have left passengers and crew
unconscious before the Helios Airways Boeing 737-300 slammed into a mountainside
north of Athens on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that an electrical fire or some other cause could
have flooded the cabin with carbon monoxide, or another gas, causing those on
board to lose consciousness.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know and can't rule out" that something else could have been
responsible, Koutsaftis said.
</P>
<P>
Crews recovered 118 bodies from the crash site and were still searching for the
remaining three.
</P>
<P>
Parts of a voice recorder were found near the burned wreckage, Greece's deputy
fire chief Andreas Kois said. They were sent to France's Inquiry and Analysis
Bureau in Paris for examination. It was uncertain if the data on the voice
recorder was salvageable, officials have said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have already sent the other black box _ the flight data recorder _
to France for analysis. During their initial search of the wreckage,
investigators had only found the cover and some parts of the voice recorder,
which tapes the last 30 minutes of conversation in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
Chief investigator Akrivis Tsolakis declined to comment Friday on Greek media
reports that preliminary data from the flight data recorder showed that the
plane _ flying from Larnaca, Cyprus _ ran out of fuel minutes before the
crash.
</P>
<P>
Autopsy results on 26 bodies identified so far have shown that some passengers
and at least four crew members _ including the co-pilot _ were alive, but not
necessarily conscious, when the plane went down. The body of the plane's German
pilot has not been identified, and it is unclear whether he is one of the three
still missing.
</P>
<P>
An air traffic control diagram showed the plane had flown on automatic pilot to
the Greek capital's international airport, Tsolakis said Thursday. But it was
flying at 34,000 feet (10,360 meters) and turned south into a holding pattern
over the island of Kea after passing over the airport. More than an hour later,
it changed course again before crashing near the capital.
</P>
<P>
Tsolakis said the automatic pilot had been programmed to fly the plane to Athens
airport, and it was unclear how or why it was disengaged.
</P>
<P>
The strange circumstances of the flight _ and disturbing scenes witnessed by the
F-16 pilots scrambled to intercept the flight _ have baffled authorities.
Officials have said there are no indications of sabotage or terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The two F-16 fighter pilots, who first established visual contact with the plane
while it was flying above Kea, reported seeing the co-pilot slumped over the
controls, apparently unconscious.
</P>
<P>
They said the pilot was not in his seat, and they also later saw what appeared
to be two people trying to regain control of the plane. Oxygen masks were seen
dangling from the ceiling of the passenger cabin, the government said, citing
the F-16 pilots.
</P>
<P>
Tsolakis said investigators were still examining the possibility that those on
board were knocked unconscious by sudden cabin decompression.
</P>
<P>
Separately, a Helios Airways flight with 177 passengers aboard made an unplanned
landing at London's Stansted Airport on Friday after the pilot reported a
mechanical problem, said Jane Johnston, a spokeswoman for Britain's National Air
Traffic Service. The Boeing 737 landed without incident.
</P>
<P>
Helios Airways announced in Nicosia, Cyprus, Friday that it would have its two
Boeing 737s subjected to a full technical inspection from Aug. 21 to
24.
