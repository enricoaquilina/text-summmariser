LAST MINUTES OF CYPRIOT FLIGHT DESCRIBED IN GREEK REPORT

An exhausted-sounding man apparently worked to take control of
a Cypriot jetliner in the last 10 minutes of its
flight, trying to radio in a final distress call just
two seconds before the plane crashed last week in the
mountains north of Athens, a preliminary report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report, by a chief Greek investigator, said there were indications
that the Helios Airways plane had suffered a problem in
its pressurization system that possibly incapacitated the two pilots. But
the final cause of the crash, on Aug. 14, was
that the Boeing 737-300 ran out of fuel after flying
nearly three hours, double the planned duration from Larnaca, Cyprus,
to Athens.
</P>
<P>
"There is proof that the engines of the plane stopped working
because the fuel supply was exhausted, and that this was
the final cause of the crash," the report said.
</P>
<P>
There were no survivors among the 115 passengers and six crew
members on the flight, bound for Prague, Czech Republic, after
a stop in Athens.

After a string of major air crashes in the last month,
136 French tourists refused Monday to board a charter flight
in Crete flying to Paris because of safety concerns. Agence
France-Presse quoted a passenger as saying that passengers were worried
because the jet had made a recent emergency landing in
Milan, Italy, and had been delayed two times for technical
reasons and that one of the pilots was 21.
</P>
<P>
In the Greek crash, the man believed to have tried to
take control of the plane was a flight attendant, Andreas
Prodromou, who was learning how to fly small airplanes.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was read on Greek television on Monday, said
there were indications that someone had tried to take control
of the plane toward the end of its flight. The
plane's voice recorder, recovered after the crash, picked up the
sound of a man, sounding "distressed or suffering from exhaustion,"
yelling out "Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!" 10 minutes before the crash,
then again two seconds before impact.
</P>
<P>
The radio was set to the wrong frequency, the report said,
and the call was not heard on the ground.
</P>
<P>
About 30 minutes into the flight, the pilot reported problems with
the air-conditioning. Autopsies on bodies from the flight did not
show any intoxication from fumes, adding to the theory that
decompression and a resulting loss of oxygen incapacitated those on
the plane.
</P>
<P>
A former chief mechanic of Helios recently acknowledged that the same
plane lost cabin pressure on a flight in December because
a door was not properly closed. Helios, a low-cost airline,
maintains that its operations are safe.
