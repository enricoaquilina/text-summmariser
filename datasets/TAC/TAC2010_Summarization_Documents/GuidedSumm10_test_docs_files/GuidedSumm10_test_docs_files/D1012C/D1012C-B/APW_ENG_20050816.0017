First autopsies show at least six people were alive when Cypriot airliner crashed in Greece

ATHENS, Greece
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least half a dozen people aboard a Cypriot plane were alive when the jetliner
carrying 121 people slammed into a hillside north of Athens, Athens' chief
coroner said Monday after conducting the first autopsies from the
crash.
</P>
<P>
But Fillipos Koutsaftis could not rule out that the six people were unconscious
when the Helios Airways Boeing 737-300, with six crew and 115 passengers,
plunged 10,400 meters (34,000 feet) Sunday into a mountainous area near the
village of Grammatiko, 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Athens. There were no
survivors.
</P>
<P>
"We have performed autopsies on six people. Our conclusion is they had
circulation and were breathing at the time of death," Koutsaftis said, but
stressed: "I cannot rule out that they were unconscious."
</P>
<P>
Investigators, to be joined by U.S. experts, were sending the plane's data and
cockpit voice recorders to France for expert examinations that could shed light
on what happened.
</P>
<P>
But the head of the Greek airline safety committee, Akrivos Tsolakis, said the
voice recorder was damaged. "It's in a bad state and, possibly, it won't give us
the information we need," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Cyprus, police raided the offices of Helios Airways in the coastal city of
Larnaca, near the international airport.
</P>
<P>
A search warrant was issued "to secure ... documents and other evidence which
could be useful for the investigation into possible criminal acts," Cyprus'
deputy presidential spokesman Marios Karoyian said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators also were trying to determine why the pilot was not in his seat
shortly before the crash.
</P>
<P>
The pilots of two Greek air force F-16 fighter planes scrambled to intercept the
plane after it lost contact with air traffic control shortly after entering
Greek airspace said they saw the co-pilot slumped over the controls. The pilot
did not appear to be in the cockpit, and oxygen masks were seen dangling in the
cabin.
</P>
<P>
The fighter jet pilots also saw two people possibly trying to take control of
the plane; it was unclear if they were crew members or passengers.
</P>
<P>
The plane might have run out of fuel after flying on autopilot, air force
officials said, asking not to be named in line with Greek practice.
</P>
<P>
After the crash, authorities said it appeared to have been caused by a technical
failure _ resulting in high-altitude decompression. A Cypriot transport official
had said Sunday the passengers and crew may have been dead before the plane
crashed.
</P>
<P>
"They had circulation and were breathing _ so they were alive _ but of course
that only concerns the people that have been examined. The others, according to
a preliminary observation, show the same signs, but the autopsies must be
carried out to confirm this," Koutsaftis said late Monday outside Athens' main
morgue.
</P>
<P>
He added that there were "80 passengers who cannot be recognized and that we are
not examining at the moment. We are only talking about a certain number of
people at this point. The tissue examinations on those who cannot be recognized
will help us draw more clear conclusions."
</P>
<P>
Koutsaftis also dismissed reports that those aboard may have frozen to
death.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, police in northern Greece arrested a man who claimed
to have received a telephone text message from a passenger. The man _ identified
as Nektarios-Sotirios Voutas, 32 _ told Greek television stations that his
cousin on board the plane sent him a cell-phone text message minutes before the
crash saying: "Farewell, cousin, here we're frozen."
</P>
<P>
But authorities determined he was lying, and arrested him on charges of
dissemination of false information.
</P>
<P>
The airliner's pilots had reported air conditioning system problems to Cyprus
air traffic control about a half-hour after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
Searchers were still looking for three bodies, including the plane's German
pilot, fire officials said. Cypriot authorities identified him as Marten Hans
Jurgen, 50, from Berlin.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity
in line with German practice, identified one of the pilots as a 58-year-old
German but would not give his full name. It was unclear why there was a
discrepancy in his age. Greek and Cypriot authorities often list surnames before
given names, and Hans-Juergen would likely be the pilot's first
name.
</P>
<P>
In Berlin, police were guarding the house at the address where the Cypriot
government said the pilot lived _ a gray stucco house surrounded by a tidy,
tree-filled garden in a quiet Berlin neighborhood near the Schoenefeld
airport.
</P>
<P>
The name on the mailbox said Merten. Neighbors confirmed his first name was
Hans-Juergen and said he was a pilot in his 50s, but refused to provide any
other details.
</P>
<P>
There were other unanswered questions about the pilot, including how long he had
worked for Helios.
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember the exact date of his employment," Helios General Manager
Andreas Drakos said when asked at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
A passenger list showed there had been 20 children under the age of 16 on board.
At least 10 families with children were among the dead. The passengers and crew
included at least 12 Greeks and the German pilot, and a four-member family of
Armenian origin. The rest were Cypriot.
</P>
<P>
The body of the Cypriot co-pilot, Pambos Haralambous, was found in the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
The airliner's pilots had reported air conditioning system problems to Cyprus
air traffic control about a half-hour after takeoff, and Greek state TV quoted
Cyprus' transport minister as saying the plane had decompression problems in the
past.
</P>
<P>
But a Helios representative said the plane had "no problems and was serviced
just last week."
</P>
<P>
Helios said the Boeing 737-300 was manufactured in 1998 and was previously
operated by Deutsche BA. It entered the Helios fleet in April 2004, the company
said.
