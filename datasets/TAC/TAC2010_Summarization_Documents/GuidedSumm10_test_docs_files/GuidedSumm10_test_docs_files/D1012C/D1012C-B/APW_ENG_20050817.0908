Reports describe last-minute attempt to save Cypriot passenger plane

ATHENS, Greece
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A crew member or passenger may have made a last, desperate attempt to save a
Cypriot passenger jet before it crashed into a mountainside north of Athens,
killing all 121 people aboard, Greek media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But Greece's government and military officials refused to comment on the reports
until the end of an investigation into Sunday's crash of the Helios Airways
flight from Larnaca to Athens.
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pilots' union urged Greek authorities to release
preliminary findings.
</P>
<P>
"There have been several apparently conflicting reports and a number of
statements that just don't add up," Captain Mervyn Granshaw, head of the British
Airline Pilots' Association, said without elaborating. "There is a concern in
our industry to learn, as quickly as possible, what happened. ... If there is
too much delay, the speculation will increase."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Tassos Papadopoulos, in Athens on a previously scheduled visit,
promised "the truth will come out." Papadopoulos was briefed on the crash by
Greece's transport and interior ministers, who refused to take questions from
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has said the pilots of two Greek air force F-16s scrambled
to intercept the plane when it lost contact with air traffic control, saw the
pilot's seat empty and the co-pilot slumped over the controls, possibly
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
It also said the fighter pilots later saw two unidentified people in the cockpit
trying to regain control of the plane. But authorities have not released the
fighter pilots' account of the passenger jet's final 23 minutes of flight or how
it crashed.
</P>
<P>
Greek state-run and private media, quoting anonymous defense ministry officials,
have said the F-16 pilots saw a man take control of the aircraft and attempt to
fly it.
</P>
<P>
According to the media reports, the person _ likely to have been 25-year-old
flight attendant Andreas Prodromou _ took control of the plane as it flew in a
gradually descending holding pattern, apparently on automatic pilot, at about
37,000 feet (11,300 meters) near Athens airport, northeast of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
He then turned the plane away from Athens, lowering it first to 2,000 feet (600
meters) and then flying back up to 7,000 feet (2,100 meters) before the plane
apparently ran out of fuel and crashed.
</P>
<P>
According to the media accounts, he made a last-ditch effort to land the plane
in the mountainous terrain, but failed. By that time, the plane had been flying
for about an hour and a half beyond its scheduled arrival time _ and twice as
long as a normal flight from Cyprus to Athens.
</P>
<P>
Prodromou's relatives have said he had a pilot's license. Chief investigator
Akrivos Tsolakis has confirmed someone apart from the pilot and co-pilot on
board was qualified to fly an aircraft, but would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The Helios Airways flight was declared "renegade" when it failed to respond to
radio calls shortly after entering Greek airspace, government spokesman
Theodoros Roussopoulos has said _ clearing the way for Prime Minister Costas
Caramanlis to order the F-16s to shoot it down if it was deemed a threat to
populated areas.
</P>
<P>
But Roussopoulos insisted there was no such threat, and that Caramanlis did not
consider that option.
</P>
<P>
Magnus Ranstorp, director of the Center for the Study of Terrorism and Political
Violence at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said it was a close
call.
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been any situation like we saw recently with the Greek case where
you were so close to taking this decision," Ranstorp said.
</P>
<P>
"Caramanlis went through the worst moments of his life," the Athens daily
Eleftherotypia reported.
</P>
<P>
Ranstorp said the 2004 Olympics held in Athens "without question have left a
security architecture in place for them to deal with the most adverse conditions
... all governments should take a lesson from this incident, to have scenarios
to deal with renegade aircraft on the loose."
</P>
<P>
A team of six medical examiners has been trying to determine whether anything on
board the plane made the passengers and crew lose consciousness before the
crash.
</P>
<P>
Autopsy results on 26 bodies identified have shown passengers and at least two
crew members _ including the co-pilot _ were alive, but not necessarily
conscious, when the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are also looking into claims that the plane had suffered technical
problems in the past.
</P>
<P>
Tsolakis, the chief investigator, said he had never seen a case such as the
Helios jet crash.
</P>
<P>
"In my career, going back 50 years as an airman and as a safety officer, I have
never seen anything that resembles this," Tsolakis said.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the case was similar to that of a 1999 twin-engine jet
crash in the U.S. _ in which the plane flew halfway across the country on
autopilot with everyone on board unconscious after losing cabin pressure _ that
case involved only five people.
</P>
<P>
Tsolakis said the Helios plane's flight data recorder, which has been sent to
Paris for decoding, could provide essential clues.
