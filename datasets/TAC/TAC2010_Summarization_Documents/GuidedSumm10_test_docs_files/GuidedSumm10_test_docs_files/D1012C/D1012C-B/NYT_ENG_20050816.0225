ONE OF PLANE'S BLACK BOXES WAS DESTROYED IN CRASH

ATHENS, Greece

<P>
Greek investigators struggling to unravel the events that
led to the country's deadliest airline disaster said Tuesday that
one of the two black boxes recovered from the wreckage
was "gutted" and probably rendered useless from the severe crash.
</P>
<P>
The setback came as coroners confirmed that at least 24 people
on board the Cypriot passenger plane, including its co-pilot and
a flight attendant, were alive when the Boeing 737 aircraft
crashed on a hillside north of Athens on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the troubled flight, two F-16 fighters shadowed
the plane and saw the co-pilot slumped over the controls,
leading to speculation that he and others aboard may have
passed out because of lack of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
The medical findings on Tuesday, officials said, reinforced the theory that
a problem in the plane's oxygen system might have precipitated
the crash, because a sudden loss of cabin pressure would
probably have killed those aboard before impact.
</P>
<P>
Yet with an additional 96 charred and mangled bodies waiting to
be examined, coroners appeared reluctant to draw any definitive conclusion
on the causes of the crash.
</P>
<P>
"The results of these initial autopsies show, so far, that the
passengers died as a result of multiple fractures and injuries
sustained as a result of the crash," said Nikos Kalogrias,
one of seven coroners conducting autopsies of the recovered bodies.
</P>
<P>
In all, 120 bodies, including that of the plane's youngest passenger,
a 4-year-old girl, have been recovered from debris of the
Cypriot aircraft scattered across a hillside about 15 miles north
of Athens.
</P>
<P>
The pilot's body, considered vital for investigators, is still missing.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 737 Helios Aircraft smashed into a mountainous area north
of Athens on Sunday, an hour and a half after
reporting problems with its air-conditioning system, then losing contact with
air traffic controllers in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Greek investigators, who have teamed up with American aviation experts, said
Tuesday that the impact of the crash was so great
that one of the black boxes critical for understanding what
happened before the plane crashed was damaged. It was situated
in the rear of the aircraft and was designed to
survive severe conditions, including temperatures of 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
Yet all that was left was the box's steel shell; the
cockpit voice recorder that should have been inside was missing.
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately," said Akrivos Tsolakis, the head of the Greek airline safety
committee, "we have the second black box with the flight
data recorder."
</P>
<P>
Tsolakis said the box would be sent to France, where aviation
experts would decode its records.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, American aviation experts from the National Transportation Safety Board
inspected the site of the crash but declined to make
any comment.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, the board has expressed concern about pilots'
ability to get their oxygen masks on quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
Investigators and Greek Air Force officials say a failure of the
oxygen supply in the doomed Helios plane could explain why
the pilots did not follow standard depressurization procedures, or else
steer the plane to lower altitudes, where oxygen levels are
greater.
</P>
<P>
Kalogrias, one of the coroners, said no traces of asphyxiation or
poisoning had been noted in the 24 autopsies performed by
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Toxicological exams, however, had been ordered to determine whether passengers and
crew members had inhaled fumes from a faulty oxygen system.
</P>
<P>
"Even if such traces are found," the coroner said in telephone
interview, "it would simply explain why some of the passengers
may have passed out or had delayed reactions."
