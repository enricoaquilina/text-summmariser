Experts: Cypriot flight may have lost cabin pressure, robbing pilots, passengers of oxygen

The Cypriot airliner that crashed in Greece may have suffered a sudden loss of
cabin pressure at high altitude, causing temperatures and oxygen levels to
plummet and leaving everyone aboard suffocating and freezing to death, experts
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
If that happened, the Helios Airways jet may have been flying on autopilot long
before it crashed, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government said the crews of two F-16 fighter jets that flew beside
the jetliner before it went down Sunday saw its co-pilot slumped over the
controls and its pilot missing from the cockpit. Oxygen masks dangled from the
ceiling at 34,000 feet (10,200 meters).
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the crash apparently was caused by technical failure that led
to a high-altitude decompression. The plane went down in a mountainous region
north of Athens, killing 115 passengers and six crew members.
</P>
<P>
Some media have reported that the victims froze in their seats before the crash,
but Greek officials said the bodies were not cold when they were
found.
</P>
<P>
Chief Athens coroner Fillipos Koutsaftis said Monday that tests conducted on the
remains showed that at least six victims were alive at the time of the crash.
Those six could have been unconscious before impact, he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. aviation experts said they could not understand the flight crew's behavior
during the disaster.
</P>
<P>
"It's odd," said Terry McVenes, executive air safety chairman for the Air Line
Pilots Association, International. "It's a very rare event to even have a
pressurization problem and, in general, crews are very well trained to deal with
it."
</P>
<P>
Warnings should go off if an airliner suddenly loses pressure, and pilots are
trained to put their oxygen masks on immediately and dive to about 12,000 feet
(3,600 meters), where there's enough oxygen to breathe, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
Paul Czysz, emeritus professor of aerospace engineering at St. Louis University,
said the pilot and co-pilot would have had five times as much oxygen as the
passengers.
</P>
<P>
If a cabin loses pressure suddenly, passengers and flight crew have only seconds
to put on oxygen masks before losing consciousness. Death would follow
quickly.
</P>
<P>
Bill Waldock, an aviation safety professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University in Arizona, said one clue to a sudden pressure loss would have been
frost on the windows because it's so cold at 34,000 feet (10,200
meters).
</P>
<P>
If the fighter pilots could see into the cockpit, the windows could not have
been iced over, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Chris Yates, an aviation analyst at Jane's Transport, said he was not
surprised by suggestions that those on board the Helios flight may have frozen.
Temperatures at the altitude a passenger jet flies at can drop to 58 below, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Yates said it was likely the aircraft "was flying essentially on a ghost flight
for a chunk of its journey. The aircraft could have been flying itself for an
hour, an hour-and-a-half while people were freezing to death."
</P>
<P>
David Kaminski Morrow, deputy news editor of the British-based Air Transport
Intelligence magazine, said any dramatic drop in temperature likely would have
been caused by depressurization.
</P>
<P>
The systems that maintain cabin pressure and keep the cabin heated rely on hot
air passing through the engines. Any loss of pressurized air also would cause a
temperature drop, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the cabin depressurized, you would be left with very thin oxygen inside the
cabin, and thin oxygen at that altitude is very cold," Kaminski Morrow
said.
</P>
<P>
A sudden decompression could be caused by a window being blown out or a fuselage
rupture, resulting in pressurized, warm air rushing out of the aircraft, he
said.
</P>
<P>
But Kaminski Morrow said the loss of oxygen likely was the main reason the
pilots appeared unable to control the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"If you tried to breathe the outside air at cruising altitude, you would pass
out through lack of oxygen very quickly, much faster than you would freeze," he
said. "The cabin temperature is probably just a side effect of whatever has gone
wrong."
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Health Minister Andreas Gavrielides, standing outside a morgue in
Athens, Greece, said an official determination of how the passengers and crew
died would be made after the plane's "black box" voice and data recorders are
examined and autopsies are conducted on victims.
