One month after deadly crash of Cypriot plane, causes remain in question

<P>
One month after Greece's worst air accident, a conclusive explanation of what
caused a Cypriot Helios Airways airliner to crash killing all 121 people on
board still eludes investigators, but recent reports suggest pilots may have
failed to respond to a cabin pressure warning.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary report last month said Helios Flight 522 lost cabin pressure and
ran out of fuel before crashing into a hillside near Grammatiko, some 40
kilometers (25 miles) north of Athens, on the sunny and clear morning of Aug.
14.
</P>
<P>
It also said there were signs the pilot and co-pilot were incapacitated and that
a third man _ believed to be a flight attendant _ had attempted to steer the
Boeing 737-300.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are tightlipped about more recent findings. But there are
indications that pilot error is suspected in connection with a cabin pressure
alert.
</P>
<P>
Chief investigator Akrivos Tsolakis refused to comment on media reports that
engineers may have left a switch controlling cabin pressure in the wrong
position after a safety check. Once the plane became airborne and pressure
dropped, slowly incapacitating the pilots, a warning horn would normally have
gone off.
</P>
<P>
"That is part of the investigation which I cannot discuss at this point,"
Tsolakis, head of Greece's Air Accident Investigation and Aviation Security
Board, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
He also declined to discuss whether language problems may have hampered
communication between the airliner's German pilot and Cypriot co-pilot as the
emergency developed.
</P>
<P>
But Boeing Co. spokeswoman Elizabeth Verdier confirmed to The Associated Press
that Greek authorities asked the company, after the accident, to issue a special
reminder on the warning horn to 737 operators.
</P>
<P>
That may indicate that investigators suspect Flight 522's aircrew failed to
correctly identify the warning horn, squandering valuable time during which the
plane could have been brought down to a safe altitude where its crew and
passengers could have breathed normally.
</P>
<P>
As the plane continued to gain altitude, the pilots would eventually have passed
out from lack of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
Although Boeing intends to update its manual in October, the company duly sent
out the message to specify that when the horn is heard in the air, pilots must
check cabin pressure.
</P>
<P>
The pilots of two Greek air force F-16 fighters scrambled to intercept the
Helios jet shortly before it crashed reported seeing the co-pilot slumped over
the controls, apparently unconscious, and the pilot not in his seat. In a second
pass, they reported seeing an unidentified man in the cockpit and oxygen masks
dangling in the plane's passenger cabin.
</P>
<P>
The airliner _ heading from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Athens with 115 Cypriot and
Greek passengers and six crew _ flew on automatic pilot to Athens' international
airport.
</P>
<P>
After flying over the airport at 34,000 feet (10,400 meters), the automatic
pilot then apparently placed the plane in a circular holding pattern over the
island of Kea after passing over the airport. More than an hour later, it
changed course again shortly before crashing when it ran out of
fuel.
</P>
<P>
Autopsies showed passengers were still alive when the plane struck, but it is
unclear whether they were conscious.
</P>
<P>
Tsolakis visited Britain earlier in the week to interview two British flight
engineers who inspected the seven-year-old jet before its last flight, as well
as representatives of ATC Lasham LTD, a British company contracted to carry out
the maintenance of Helios' planes. Launched in 1999, the budget airline was
Cyprus' first private carrier.
</P>
<P>
"We may issue a second preliminary report within days," he said. A full report
is expected in about five months.
</P>
<P>
A senior Cypriot air accident investigation official _ who asked not to be named
because of his close involvement in the probe _ told The AP that the part of the
cockpit containing the pressure switch has been recovered. But he could not
comment on whether the switch was in the correct position.
</P>
<P>
"You realize that with the speed the plane hit the ground, we cannot be
certain," he said. "We want to be 100 percent sure before pinning the blame on
something."
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the crash victims are demanding that the Cypriot Cabinet appoint
independent investigators who will apportion blame on those responsible for the
accident _ based on the Greek committee's findings.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting with agony," said Nicos Yiasoumis, head of a group formed by the
relatives. "We hope that those responsible will be held accountable
eventually."
</P>
<P>
Adding to the families' grief, rescuers at the crash site failed to locate any
trace of three of the bodies. In their place, relatives buried ash from the
charred hillside at Grammatiko _ a site Greek authorities have earmarked for a
new landfill.
