Grieving relatives struggle to identify victims of Greece's worst plane crash

ATHENS, Greece

<P>
Grieving relatives, many black-clad and weeping, arrived at a central Athens
morgue by bus, taxi or on foot to try to identify the remains of some of the 121
people _ including 10 families _ killed in Greece's worst plane
crash.
</P>
<P>
A young woman, eyes shaded by dark sunglasses, slumped to the ground outside the
building in the hospital complex, her head in her hands. An elderly couple
clutched each other and embraced as they got off the bus that took them straight
from Athens airport to the morgue. Two men supported a woman, helping her toward
an area set aside for the victims' relatives as her cries echoed around the
hospital courtyard.
</P>
<P>
"What can I say? I have no words to say because I lost my whole brother's
family, two kids and my brother and ... his wife," said Albert Toutounzian at
Larnaca Airport on Monday before boarding a flight for Athens.
</P>
<P>
Hagop Toutounzian, 51, his 45-year-old wife Hilda and their two sons,
12-year-old Bariet and 16-year-old Ara, were on the Cypriot government's
official list of victims.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ambulances ferried more bodies from another morgue in an eastern
Athens suburb, where the remains were taken after they were recovered from the
slopes of a mountainous region north of Athens, where Helios Airways flight
ZU522 crashed early Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Orderlies could be seen dragging body bags, some bloodstained, from the
ambulances and into the morgue.
</P>
<P>
Only 47 of the bodies were at the central Athens morgue, Cyprus Health Minister
Andreas Gabrielides said outside the hospital complex. A massive brush fire
sparked by the crash burned through much of the wreckage and debris scattered
across two valleys and surrounding hills, reducing many of the bodies to
blackened remains.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the bodies could only be identified by DNA tests and other forensic
methods, and would remain in the mortuary in eastern Athens, Greece's Deputy
Health Minister Thanassis Yiannopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the hardest part of the tragedy," Yiannopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
Later, Yiannopoulos said that by Monday evening, 24 bodies had been identified.
He said coroners would carry out autopsies on those remains before the bodies
were flown to Cyprus on board a C-130 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot coroner Eleni Antoniou was part of a Cypriot medical delegation that
traveled to Athens.
</P>
<P>
"Identification is very difficult because of the state of the bodies," she told
Cyprus Antenna TV.
</P>
<P>
The room in which the identification was taking place was small, and it was
taking time for the relatives to file through, she said. "Only five or six
relatives enter the room at a time and this is a very slow process."
</P>
<P>
At the crash site near the village of Grammatiko, north of Athens, a firefighter
described a scene of devastation.
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty grim down there," said the firefighter, who would not give his
name because he was not authorized to speak to the press. "There were lots of
body parts and I saw a severed head by itself."
</P>
<P>
Some angry relatives blamed the airline for the crash.
</P>
<P>
"Those who put profit above the lives of people must be punished," said Takis
Mavris, whose brother, Andreas Christodoulou Mavris _ a soccer player well-known
in Cyprus in the late 1970s and early 1980s _ was killed along with his wife.
"They must sit in court."
</P>
<P>
"If these people from Helios come here and see what we have seen," he said
outside the morgue, his sentence trailing off. He said he had been unable to
identify his brother among the bodies he saw.
</P>
<P>
The Helios Airways flight had been heading from Larnaca to Athens and was to
have continued on to Prague, Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
The airliner's pilots had reported air conditioning system problems to Cyprus
air traffic control about a half-hour after takeoff. Shortly after entering
Greek air space over the Aegean, the Boeing 737 lost all radio
contact.
</P>
<P>
Two Greek air force F-16s intercepted the plane at 10,400 meters (34,000 feet),
and the fighter jet pilots could see the co-pilot slumped over his seat. The
captain was not in the cockpit, and oxygen masks dangled inside the cabin,
government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos said.
