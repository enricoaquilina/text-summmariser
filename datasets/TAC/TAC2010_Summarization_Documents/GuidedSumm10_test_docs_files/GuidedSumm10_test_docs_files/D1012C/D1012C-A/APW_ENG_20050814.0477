Angry relatives swarmed the counters at Larnaca airport, hurling curses at the
managers of an airline whose plane crashed in Greece earlier Sunday, killing all
passengers and crew on board.
</P>
<P>
Shouting "murderers," and "You deserve lynching," the crowd demanded to know
whether their relatives were actually on board the Helios Airways flight ZU522
that left Larnaca for Athens International Airport when it crashed at about
12:20 p.m. (0920GMT) near Grammatiko, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of
the Greek capital.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 737-300 was due to fly onto Prague, Czech Republic, after stopping in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greek fire chief Christos Smetis said there were no survivors among the 115
passengers and six crew on board the plane. "The fire is still burning and there
are no survivors."
</P>
<P>
Fueling the relatives' anger were reports that the plane may have crashed due to
a technical fault that had affected Helios planes in the past.
</P>
<P>
Officials were also citing decompression in the cabin and cockpit as a possible
cause, and said the plane's two black boxes had been located.
</P>
<P>
Sotiris Voutas, a cousin of one of the passengers on the plane, told Greece's
Alpha television that he received a text message from the cousin on his mobile
phone minutes before the crash.
</P>
<P>
"He told me the pilots were unconscious ... he said: "Farewell, cousin, here
we're frozen."
</P>
<P>
Voutas said his cousin also told him he went to the cockpit to check what was
wrong and saw the pilot "all blackened."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' radio and television stations cancelled their daily programs to relay
uninterrupted coverage on the crash as people telephoned to seek news or
speculate over what might have caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
Suspicions of a technical fault as the cause of the crash grew through the day
as several of the callers said that they had experienced severe air conditioning
problems when flying similar Helios jets in recent months. Some said the cabin
was freezing and the crew had to provide them with blankets while others said it
became unbearably hot.
</P>
<P>
Greek state television quoted Cyprus Transport Minister Haris Thrasou as saying
the plane had problems with decompression in the past.
