Decompression suspected as cause of fatal airline crash in Greece

The Cypriot airliner that crashed Sunday in Greece, killing all 121 people on
board, may have experienced a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure that rapidly
starved the pilots of oxygen, aviation experts said.
</P>
<P>
The co-pilot of the Helios Airways flight from Larnaca, Cyprus, was slumped over
the controls and the captain was not in the cockpit, the Greek air force said
after sending two F-16 jets to intercept the airliner after it failed to respond
to radio calls. Oxygen masks were seen hanging in the cabin, a Greek government
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"If the aircraft lost cabin pressure, either in the cockpit or the cabin,
effectively everybody would be doomed within a short space of time," said Chris
Yates, an aviation analyst at Jane's Transport.
</P>
<P>
"If the aircraft went into depressurization very quickly you only have a few
seconds before you lose consciousness because you don't have any air to breathe
at that altitude," Yates said.
</P>
<P>
Airplane cabins are pressurized so that the air remains breathable even at very
high altitudes. If a plane suffers a loss of air pressure, the crew typically
has enough warning to try to get to a lower altitude.
</P>
<P>
"It is one of these things that can be serious ... but if it occurs, there
should be an automatic deployment of oxygen masks," said David Kaminski Morrow,
deputy news editor of the British-based magazine Air Transport
Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
"The crew get oxygen, passengers will be on oxygen and there is enough in the
tanks to get the aircraft to an altitude where you don't need the oxygen masks
anymore," he added.
</P>
<P>
The crew would attempt to bring the plane down to an altitude of about 10,000
feet (3,050 meters), where the air is breathable. This would typically be done
over the sea rather than a mountainous area, Kaminski Morrow
said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Greek air force said the F-16s intercepted the plane at an
altitude of 10,360 meters (34,000 feet).
</P>
<P>
Eric Moody, a former pilot, told Sky television that the crew's failure to bring
the plane down in altitude suggested they were overwhelmed by the situation,
hinting at a major problem with the oxygen system.
</P>
<P>
"If the aircraft is at 30,000 feet (9,150 meters), you don't stay conscious for
long, maybe 15 to 30 seconds. It is like standing on top of Mount Everest,"
Kaminski Morrow said.
</P>
<P>
Gerard Feldzer, the head of France's Air and Space Museum, said many questions
remained unanswered.
</P>
<P>
"An explosive depressurization with damage. ... There are procedures for rapid
descent. Did the pilots not have the time to equip themselves?" Feldzer, a
former Air France pilot, said on France-Info radio.
</P>
<P>
"Was there a general poisoning (of some kind)? That seems rather improbable
because a passenger sent a text message" to a relative after the pilots
apparently lost consciousness, he said.
</P>
<P>
Even if the pilots somehow had become incapacitated by a drop in pressure, there
would be no reason for the plane to crash straight away, the experts
said.
</P>
<P>
"The pressurizing system is totally independent from the flying controls," Moody
told Sky. "If it was on automatic pilot at the time, as it probably would have
been, there's no reason why it would have crashed immediately due to lack of
pressure."
</P>
<P>
In a case with possible parallels, a lack of oxygen apparently caused the 1999
crash that killed golfer Payne Stewart and four others aboard Stewart's
twin-engined jet. The plane went down in a pasture in South Dakota after flying
halfway across the United States on autopilot, as the five apparently became
unconscious after the plane lost cabin pressure.
</P>
<P>
Experts were puzzled by reports that passengers may have remained conscious
longer than the pilots.
</P>
<P>
One passenger reportedly sent a text message before the crash to say that the
pilots were unconscious and "we are all frozen."
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos said that when the F-16 pilots
flew by the Helios Airways plane a second time, they saw two people apparently
trying to take control of the Boeing 737. It was unclear whether they were
passengers or pilots.
</P>
<P>
"The cabin pressure and the cockpit pressure are the same," said Yates, noting
that a failure should affect both equally.
</P>
<P>
"It's possible some of the passengers on board, because of their age, because of
their health or whatever, may have been able to last a bit longer," he
said.
