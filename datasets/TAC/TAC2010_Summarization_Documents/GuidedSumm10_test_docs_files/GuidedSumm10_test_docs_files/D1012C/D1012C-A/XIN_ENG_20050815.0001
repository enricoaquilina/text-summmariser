ATHENS, Aug. 15 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Greek government on Sunday 
ruled out the possibility of a terror attack after a Cypriot 
Boeing 737 operated by the private Helios Airways crashed Sunday 
north of Athens, killing all 115 passengers and six crew members 
on board.
</P>
<P>
PLANE CRASHES AFTER LOSING CONTACT
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed to a mountain at about 12:20 p.m. (0920 GMT) 
near the coastal town of Grammatikos, about 40 km north of Athens,
just a few minutes before its scheduled landing time on a flight 
from Larnaca International Airport of Cyprus to Prague via Athens.
</P>
<P>
Police and firefighters at the crash site reportedly said there
were no immediate signs of survivors. Among the passengers on the 
flight were 48 children, a spokesman for Helios Airways was quoted
by Athens News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the crew notified Cypriot authorities of a fault 
in the aircraft's air conditioning unit on approaching Greek 
airspace, but made no contact with Greek air traffic controllers 
on entry.
</P>
<P>
Greek civil aviation authorities alerted the air force in line 
with anti-terrorism measures. Two F-16 fighter jets sent from a 
military base in Crete located the aircraft a few minutes later in
the southern Aegean, but calls for identification went unheeded 
and the plane appeared to be out of control, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Flying at close quarters, air force officers reported that the 
aircraft's co-pilot appeared to have collapsed over his controls 
but no captain was visible through the cockpit window. Overhead 
oxygen masks in the cabin section had dropped into place.
</P>
<P>
After reporting the aircraft as "renegade," or unidentified, 
the pilots tracked the airliner at about 38,000 feet until it 
began to lose height and crashed sparking a blaze.
</P>
<P>
GREEK GOVERNMENT RULES OUT TERRORISM
</P>
<P>
The Greek government said on Sunday that no evidence of 
terrorism or foul play had emerged after the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos flatly rejected 
media speculation that two air force fighter jets, which were sent
to track the aircraft after its crew failed to communicate with 
Greece's air traffic control on its entry, had been ordered to 
shoot down the plane on fears of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"There was no such thought," he told reporters after a lengthy 
cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, who 
cut short his  long weekend holiday and returned to Athens.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cypriot officials said there is no evidence of 
terrorism so far.
</P>
<P>
"The first indications, in Cyprus and in Greece, are that it 
was not caused by a terrorist act," said Marios Karoyian, a 
spokesman for Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
GREEK GOVERNMENT, EU OFFER CONDOLENCES
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis cut short a long holiday 
weekend and called an emergency mini-cabinet meeting. He called 
Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos by telephone and expressed 
his condolences.
</P>
<P>
European Union (EU) Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot also 
expressed his condolences to victims of the crash.
</P>
<P>
"It is with great sadness that I have learned of today's 
airliner crash near Athens, which has cost the lives of all on 
board. My sympathies go out to the families and friends of the 
victims and all those affected by this tragic event," said Barrot 
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This latest incident shows that in spite of all that has 
already been done to improve the safety of Europe's skies, we must
intensify our joint efforts to ensure the very highest safety 
standards for all Europe's air passengers and crew," he added.
</P>
<P>
MYSTERY REMAINS OVER DOOMED PLANE
</P>
<P>
Though official sources suspected that an apparently technical 
problem could have caused the tragedy, accident investigators 
still faced a mystery over the last minutes of the doomed plane.
</P>
<P>
The crash, the worst air disaster in Greece and the worst 
involving a Cypriot airline, perplexed aviation experts astounded 
by what appeared to have been a catastrophic failure of cabin 
pressure or oxygen supply at 10 km up.
</P>
<P>
Experts were also looking into what might have happened in the 
last minutes of the plane which was declared "renegade" when it 
entered Greek air space and failed to make radio contact, causing 
two F-16 air force jets planes to scramble to investigate.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Roussopoulos said the pilots sent 
to investigate reported that with the pilots out of action there 
may have been a last-gasp effort by two others on the plane to 
bring the craft back under control.
</P>
<P>
The pilots also saw oxygen masks down when they got close to 
the aircraft. The plane was making continuous right-hand turns to 
show it had lost radio contact, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports also disclosed that passengers aboard the flight had 
sent text messages to relatives complaining of an "Arctic chill" 
in the cabin with people starting to turn blue from the cold.
</P>
<P>
A senior official at the Public Order Ministry speculated that 
a sudden drop in cabin pressure could have caused the disaster. He
said the pilot had mentioned a problem with the plane's 
air-conditioning system before losing contact.
</P>
<P>
But other experts said a sudden loss of pressurization would 
not have caused an airplane to crash, nor would it have made the 
pilots immediately unconscious, as the pilots would have had their
own oxygen supply.
</P>
<P>
Roussopoulos said the black box of the plane had been found and
investigation of the cause had been under way. US investigators 
were on their way to Athens as US law requires them to help with 
the investigation whenever a US-made aircraft is involved.
