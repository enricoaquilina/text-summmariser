A Cypriot Boeing 737 operated by a 
private jetliner Helios Airways crashed Sunday north of Athens, 
with 115 passengers including 48 children and six crew members on 
board, Greek news media reported.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Ministry and fire department said that the plane 
crashed to a mountain at about 12:20 p.m. (0920 GMT) near the 
coastal town of Grammatikos, about 40 kilometers north of Athens, 
just a few minutes before its scheduled landing time on a flight 
from Larnaca International Airport of Cyprus to Prague via Athens.
</P>
<P>
Police and firefighters at the crash site reportedly said there
were no immediate signs of survivors. Among the passengers on the 
flight were 48 children, said a spokesman for Helios Airways 
quoted by Athens News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis cut short a long holiday
weekend and called an emergency mini-cabinet meeting. He called 
Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos by telephone and expressed 
his condolences.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that crew notified Cypriot authorities of a fault 
in the aircraft's air conditioning unit on approaching Greek 
airspace, but made no contact with Greek air traffic controllers 
on entry.
</P>
<P>
Greek civil aviation authorities alerted the air force in line 
with anti-terrorism measures. Two F-16 fighter jets sent from a 
military base in Crete located the aircraft a few minutes later in
the southern Aegean, but calls for identification went unheeded 
and the plane appeared to be out of control, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Flying at close quarters, air force officers reported that the 
aircraft's co-pilot appeared to have collapsed over his controls 
but no captain was visible through the cockpit window. Overhead 
oxygen masks in the cabin section had dropped into place.
</P>
<P>
After reporting the aircraft as "renegade", or unidentified, 
the pilots tracked the airliner at about 38,000 feet until it 
began to lose height and crashed sparking a blaze.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and rescue workers sped to the wreckage as 
military helicopters patrolled overhead.
</P>
<P>
Through scenes aired by Greek television stations, plane 
wreckage was scattered widely about the mountain.
</P>
<P>
"The most likely thing is that a technical fault was involved, 
but we are looking into all possible causes and details. It would 
not be responsible to say anything yet about the cause of the 
descent," said Greek Government Spokesman Theodoros Roussopoulos.
</P>
<P>
Reports also disclosed that passengers aboard the flight had 
sent text messages to relatives complaining of an "Artic chill" in
the cabin with people starting to turn blue from the cold.
</P>
<P>
However, Greek media and Cypriot President's spokesman Marios 
Karogian said that terrorism had been ruled out in the incident on
the basis of collected information.
