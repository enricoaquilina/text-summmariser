121 ARE KILLED AS JETLINER CRASHES NORTH OF ATHENS Anthee Carassava
reported from Athens, Greece, for this article, and Ian Fisher
from Prague, Czech Republic, and Rome. Matthew L. Wald contributed
reporting from Washington. ATHENS, Greece -- A Cypriot passenger plane
with 121 people on board crashed Sunday just north of
the Greek capital, after being shadowed for 43 helpless minutes
by fighter jets reporting that the co-pilot was slumped over
the controls and that there was no sign of the
pilot.
</P>
<P>
Two Greek fighter pilots, peering into the plane, saw "a lifeless
cockpit," according to a Greek air force spokesman, even though
the Helios Air Boeing 737 continued flying, apparently on autopilot,
for nearly three-quarters of an hour before it slammed into
a wooded, uninhabited gorge near the town of Grammatikos at
12:03 p.m.
</P>
<P>
There were no survivors in what officials called Greece's worst airline
accident. Helios airline officials refused to release the passenger list
but said 48 of the passengers were "youth travelers" bound
for Prague, Czech Republic, after a stopover in Athens. The
flight, a charter, had taken off from Larnaka in Cyprus
on its way to Prague via Athens. Greek Defense Ministry
officials said no chain of events could be ruled out
in a crash that baffled many aviation experts, though by
late afternoon terrorism was being discounted.
</P>
<P>
State-run news media reported that a malfunction in the aircraft's oxygen
system might have precipitated the crash and that the cabin
might have rapidly lost pressure. Many of the victims found
in the sheared and burning wreckage were still wearing oxygen
masks.
</P>
<P>
Airport officials in Larnaka said the pilot of the airliner reported
problems with the air-conditioning system minutes before losing contact with
Greek and Cypriot traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
Though the plane was out of radio contact with the ground
for more than an hour after that, it appeared that
at least some passengers remained conscious. Before the plane crashed,
the Greek fighter pilots reported seeing two people trying to
take the controls in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
"The pilots have turned blue. Farewell cousin -- we're frozen," one
passenger wrote in a text message from a cell phone,
according to an interview with a relative on Greece's Alpha
television.
</P>
<P>
Bereaved and angry relatives flooded the airport in Larnaka, some collapsing
in grief, as senior Greek ministers, including the country's prime
minister, Kostas Karamanlis, broke off from their vacations to attend
crisis talks in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Teams of rescue workers, firefighters and ambulances, meanwhile, scrambled to the
wooded crash site as authorities evacuated a nearby monastery threatened
by a brush fire started by the crash.
</P>
<P>
"I ran to help, but on arrival I found dead bodies,
human parts and clothing scattered everywhere," one witness at the
site of the crash said, according to television reports.
</P>
<P>
Live television broadcasts from the disaster area showed firefighting aircraft dousing
the wreckage site with water as rescue workers and volunteers
combed the region, collecting corpses.
</P>
<P>
Dense black smoke billowed from several small fires.
</P>
<P>
One witness told Reuters that the plane's tail was cut off
and that the remaining parts of the plane rolled down
a hillside about 500 yards away from the tail.
</P>
<P>
Aviation experts were baffled, saying it was rare for a plane
to crash because of depressurization.
</P>
<P>
"Although there are precedents for both pilots losing consciousness at the
controls of the aircraft in the past, for it to
happen on a large airliner like a Boeing 737, with
all the backup systems they have there, does seem to
be really quite extraordinary," said Kieran Daly, editor of Air
Transport Intelligence, a news agency that covers the industry.
</P>
<P>
"It really is all very peculiar," he added. "I rather suspect
we're heading for a very complicated investigation."
</P>
<P>
Late on Sunday, rescue teams said they had located one of
the plane's "black boxes," two orange-colored devices that record flight
data and voices of the pilots.
</P>
<P>
In December 2004, three passengers were hospitalized after a Helios plane
lost cabin pressure and made an emergency landing at the
Larnaka airport. A year earlier, another Helios plane suffered engine
problems, diverting to the Greek holiday island of Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
Airliners are pressurized by a system that draws air from the
engines, which compress air for internal use. A valve at
the back of the plane determines how fast air is
let out of the fuselage.
</P>
<P>
Aviation experts say that depressurization is rare, and that when it
occurs, a warning horn sounds in the cockpit, and crew
members are supposed to put on oxygen masks and descend
to 10,000 feet, where there is enough oxygen for humans
to function even in a depressurized aircraft.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
In October 1999, a Learjet carrying the golfer Payne Stewart and
four other people crashed in South Dakota after flying hundreds
of miles on autopilot. Fighter planes observed the cockpit windows
iced over, a sign of depressurization.
</P>
<P>
After the investigation of that crash, a doctor with the National
Transportation Safety Board said pilots' cognitive ability could fade away
quickly when oxygen was limited, often faster than they realized.
</P>
<P>
Another source of incapacitation can be smoke or fumes in the
cockpit. If the problem is not obvious from the wreckage,
it may be discerned from tests on the blood of
the victims, which will show what they were breathing before
they died.
</P>
<P>
The cockpit voice recorder is likely to capture the sound of
the warning horn, if it sounded, and conversation between the
pilots about the problem.
</P>
<P>
The plane that crashed Sunday was built in 1998, a year
before the airline was established. Planes of that vintage commonly
carry autopilots capable of climbing to a pre-assigned altitude, and
even following a predetermined course from point to point, without
pilot intervention, once the course has been entered.
</P>
<P>
Company officials denied reports news reports out of Cyprus that the
plane had been withdrawn last year for technical problems.
</P>
<P>
Flight 522 left the Larnaka airport at 9 a.m. carrying 115
passengers and six crew members. After the plane lost contact
with air traffic controllers "for more than an hour," said
Ioannis Pantazaratos, head of the air traffic control tower at
Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, "we had no idea who was
flying the plane."
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry officials said two F-16 fighter jets were ordered to
an urgent reconnaissance flight at 10:55 a.m.
</P>
<P>
By 11:20 a.m., said the Greek air force spokesman, Yiannis Papageorgiou,
"the fighter pilots had visual contact of the aircraft."
</P>
<P>
The two Greek jet fighters that shadowed the passenger plane spotted
the co-pilot slouched over the controls. He was wearing an
oxygen mask, apparently unconscious, Greece's government spokesman, Theodore Roussopoulos, said
after a marathon crisis meeting led by the Greek prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
From then on, Papageorgiou said, "The two fighter jets escorted the
passenger plane, watching it crash into the mountain at 12:03."
</P>
<P>
By Sunday afternoon, senior Greek and Cypriot officials began minimizing the
likelihood of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The first indications," said Marios Karoyian, a spokesman for the Cyprus
president, Tassos Papadopoulos, "are that it was not caused by
a terrorist act."
</P>
<P>
In Athens, a senior Defense Ministry official said: "We're not ruling
out anything. But that the plane was not shot down
by armed F-16 jet fighters suggests that this may not
have been a terrorist attack."
</P>
<P>
Helios, Cyprus' first private carrier, was established in 1999. It flies
to Dublin, Ireland; Sofia, Bulgaria; Warsaw, Poland; Prague; Strasbourg, France;
and several British airports.
