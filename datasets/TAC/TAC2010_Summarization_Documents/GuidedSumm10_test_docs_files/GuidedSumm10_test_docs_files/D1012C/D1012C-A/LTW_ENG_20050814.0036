With Pilot Disabled, Airliner Crashes, Killing 121

<P>
High in the skies above the Aegean Sea, two Greek fighter
pilots nudged their F-16s to either side of a Cypriot passenger jet
and quickly discerned the disaster that was unfolding.
</P>
<P>
They saw a cockpit in turmoil. One of the Cypriot pilots sat
slumped over the instrument panel. The other was not visible at all.
Two other people desperately tried to gain control of the plane.
Oxygen masks dangled in the cabin.
</P>
<P>
Less than an hour later, Helios Airways Flight 522 bound for Athens
slammed into the side of a wooded Greek hill Sunday, killing all 121
people aboard. About one-third of the dead were children.
</P>
<P>
The worst airline crash in Greek history is also one of the most
mysterious. Incapacitation of both pilots on a commercial jetliner is
extremely rare. It suggests multiple malfunctions that happened either
too quickly or too subtly for the pilots to be aware of them or to act
in time to remedy them, aviation experts said.
</P>
<P>
Greek and Cypriot officials said Sunday that, while nothing could
be ruled out, it appeared unlikely that terrorism was involved. In
addition, there were no signs of a hijacking, such as a distress call,
the officials said. ``We have no indication whatsoever that this was a
terrorist act,'' Cypriot Transport Minister Harris Thrassou said in a
televised news conference at the Lanarca Airport, where the flight
originated.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the leading theory about what went wrong on the Boeing 737
was a catastrophic loss of cabin pressure that would have starved the
pilots and passengers of oxygen. One pilot reportedly had complained
of trouble with the plane's air-conditioning system early in the
flight.
</P>
<P>
At altitudes above 30,000 feet, a sudden decompression could plunge
the temperature inside the plane below zero, and those aboard could
begin to experience hypoxia and loss of consciousness within 10 to 30
seconds unless they were able to put on emergency oxygen masks,
aviation experts say.
</P>
<P>
The F-16s intercepted the Helios flight at 34,000 feet, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
If this is what happened, it still does not explain how or why
these systems failed, and whether the pilots were alerted by alarms
that are standard equipment on jetliners.
</P>
<P>
Most of the people on board may have been dead or unconscious for
the last hour or so that the plane traveled, on automatic pilot, until
crashing, a civil aviation official in Athens said. The two who
entered the cockpit to attempt to control the plane may have been crew
or passengers, a government official said. Their identity was not
clear, nor how long they were able to sustain their efforts.
</P>
<P>
The decompression scenario was reminiscent of the 1999 crash that
killed U.S. golfer Payne Stewart, whose plane flew for nearly five
hours after a sudden loss of cabin pressure killed or disabled all on
board. With its windows iced over, the plane finally plummeted into a
field in South Dakota. But that aircraft was a small Learjet, not a
commercial airliner, which has numerous back-up systems.
</P>
<P>
``Although there are precedents for both pilots losing
consciousness, for it to happen on a large airliner like a Boeing 737
with all the back-up systems they have does seem to be really quite
extraordinary,'' Kieran Daly, editor of Air Transport Intelligence,
said in an interview with CNN. ``If the crew had any indication at all
of any problem (with air systems) they would immediately be on very
robust emergency systems. How that did not happen (with the Helios
flight) is extremely strange.''
</P>
<P>
Sudden loss of cabin pressure would trigger a loud horn and caution
lights, said John J. Nance, an air safety analyst and former Air Force
and commercial pilot. ``You're not going to miss this anyway because
you're ears are going to start popping,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
``There's a lot here that doesn't make sense,'' said Nance, who
added: ``Provided the information from the fighter pilot is right,
then we have a high, high probability that we had a malfunctioning
crew oxygen system, that the crew didn't know it in time.''
</P>
<P>
He noted that drop-down oxygen masks provided in the passenger
cabin are not powerful enough to sustain consciousness for very long.
</P>
<P>
It also was unclear whether why the Helios plane eventually lost
altitude and crashed; one possibility was that it ran out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's crash, scorched debris, suitcases and bodies were
scattered down the side of a hill and across a ravine 25 miles north
of Athens. A piece of the tail and a wheel from the landing gear were
intact and recognizable. The impact ignited fires in the dry brush.
One report from the scene said some of the bodies were wearing orange
oxygen masks.
</P>
<P>
A man who said his cousin was on board reported receiving a mobile
telephone text message from him shortly before the crash, saying the
captain had ``turned blue'' and temperatures in the cabin had
plummeted.
</P>
<P>
''Cousin farewell, we're freezing,`` the passenger messaged,
according to Alpha TV, a Greek network. The authenticity of the
message could not be verified, but the description would be in keeping
with drastic loss of cabin pressure.
</P>
<P>
By Sunday afternoon, rescue workers at the site of the crash had
recovered the so-called black boxes that contain recordings of flight
data and the pilots' voices, said Akrivos Tsolakis, head of the Greek
airline safety commission.
</P>
<P>
At airports in Lanarca, Athens and Prague, the flight's final
destination, distraught families spent long hours with little
information and rising anxiety. Especially at Lanarca, angry relatives
blasted Helios for providing information too slowly and scuffled with
police while trying to storm the airline's offices.
</P>
<P>
The dead included 48 Greek Cypriot children and youths on a holiday
school trip to Prague, a spokesman for Helios said. Most of the
passengers and crew were Greek Cypriot, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing Co. spokeswoman said the company had dispatched a team of
experts to join the investigation. The plane that went down was
manufactured seven years ago and delivered to Helios in April 2004.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after takeoff Sunday morning, the Helios pilot radioed to
ground control in Lanarca that he was having trouble with the air
conditioning, Greek officials said. That was the last contact.
</P>
<P>
The plane crossed into Greek airspace about half an hour later,
around 9:30 a.m. Athens air traffic controllers began attempting to
contact the plane at 10:07 a.m. to initiate landing procedures, but
received no response. The attempts continued until 10:55, when the
lack of communication triggered Greek emergency procedures known as
''renegade alert``: the Greek air force scrambled two F-16 fighters to
escort the plane to its landing.
</P>
<P>
The F-16 pilots, flanking the Helios aircraft, saw an unconscious
co-pilot and no captain in the cockpit, Greek government spokesman
Theodoros Roussopoulos said in a briefing for reporters in Athens.
They noticed that the oxygen masks had deployed inside the cabin and,
a few minutes later, saw two people enter the cockpit to attempt to
gain control of the doomed flight, Roussopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
The presence of these two was especially mysterious, since by all
appearances most of the other occupants of Flight 522 were
incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
''When a pilot has no communication with the control tower, the
procedure dictates that other planes must accompany and help the plane
land,`` Thrassou, the Cypriot transport minister, said.
''Unfortunately, it appeared that the pilot was already dead, as was,
possibly, everyone else on the plane.``
