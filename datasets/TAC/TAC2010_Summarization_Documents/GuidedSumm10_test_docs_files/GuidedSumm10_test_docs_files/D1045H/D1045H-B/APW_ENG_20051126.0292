China made a rare public apology to Moscow Saturday for any harm that might be
caused by a massive swathe of polluted river water expected to enter Russia
early next month, state media reported.
</P>
<P>
The apology follows repeated demands from Russia for more information about the
chemical spill and its threat to the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Central Television's nightly news broadcast showed Foreign Minister Li
Zhaoxing meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergei Razov and paraphrased his
apology.

<P>
"Li Zhaoxing expressed his sincere apology on behalf of the Chinese government
for the possible harm that this major environmental pollution incident could
bring to the Russian people downstream," the news report said.
</P>
<P>
The government says a chemical plant explosion in Jilin province on Nov. 13
dumped about 100 tons of benzene and related chemicals into the Songhua
River.
</P>
<P>
The Songhua flows into the Heilong River, which crosses the border and becomes
the Amur in Russia, flowing through the far eastern Russian city of
Khabarovsk.
</P>
<P>
Razov urged Beijing to provide full information about the toxic spill, according
to the ITAR-Tass and RIA Novosti news agencies. Razov said the response to the
accident would have been more efficient if China had informed Russia about it
sooner, the Russian reports said, adding that Li offered China's assistance to
help deal with the spill's consequences.
