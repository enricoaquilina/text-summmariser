The Chinese Ministry of Water 
Resources has ordered two reservoirs along the Songhua River to 
discharge more water downward to dilute the benzene slick on the 
river in northeast China, a ministry source said Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, discharged water flux of the Fengman reservoir at
the upstream of the Songhua River reached 600 cubic meters per 
second, which was increased to 1,000 cubic meter on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The discharged water flux from a reservoir at the upstream of 
Nenjiang River, tributary of the Songhua River, was increased from
20 cubic meters per second to 120 cubic meters per second.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Water Resources said the water
flow of the mainstream of the Songhua River is quite slow, as the 
river is in a dry and frozen season. Releasing more water from 
reservoirs will be very helpful for increasing the speed of water 
flow and diluting the benzene in the river.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that around 100 tons of pollutants containing 
benzene has flown into the Songhua River, caused by a Nov. 13 
explosion at an upstream chemical plant of the Jilin Petrochemical
Company under the China National Petroleum Corp.
</P>
<P>
A benzene slick, stretching around 80 kilometers long, is now 
flowing downward along the Songhua River.
</P>
<P>
It has compelled cities along the river to suspend taking water
from the river for various periods. Harbin, a city of more than 3 
million residents, has stopped drawing water from the Songhua 
River for four days starting Wednesday.
