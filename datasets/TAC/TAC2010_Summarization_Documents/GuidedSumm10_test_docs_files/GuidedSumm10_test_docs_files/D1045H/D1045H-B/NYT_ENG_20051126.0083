CHINA WATER WORRIES PERSIST AFTER CHEMICAL SPILL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
SIFANTAI VILLAGE, China
</DATELINE>

<P>
Liu Shiying lifted the metal cover off
the clay cistern in a corner of the bare kitchen
and lowered a tin ladle into what remained of her
water supply. Then she raised a scoop to her mouth.
</P>
<P>
"Do you think it smells?" she asked on Saturday, not taking
a sip. "We're still drinking this. It is our only
choice."
</P>
<P>
Liu lives in one of the dingy villages on the outskirts
of Harbin, the provincial capital whose municipal water supply had
been shut off for four days to prevent contamination from
a chemical spill that dumped a huge tide of pollution
into the city's main water source, the Songhua River.
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday, as Harbin's 4 million residents learned that water
would be restored by Sunday night, rural residents like Liu
in the villages beside the Songhua got no such good
news. Isolated and reachable only by rugged dirt roads, these
villages depend on wells or the river itself for drinking
water. And as the pollution passed by, many villages never
got the boxes of bottled water delivered to major cities
like Harbin.
</P>
<P>
The pollution slick started on Nov. 13 after a petrochemical plant
explosion spilled 100 tons of deadly benzene and nitrobenzene into
the Songhua River. The factory is located in Jilin City,
more than 200 miles upstream from Harbin, and the dangerous
slick began steadily moving downstream.
</P>
<P>
Environmental monitoring posts around Harbin found that pollution levels in the
Songhua had dropped almost to normal Saturday as the slick
moved past the city. But it is unclear whether the
government plans extensive testing and cleanup efforts for the wells
that supply the villages beside the river. Liu said the
main well in Sifantai was about 100 yards from the
Songhua. Several villagers said they were worried about contamination.
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned that we are so close to the river," said
Tao Yunzhi, who lives in the village. "The polluted water
gets in the well."
