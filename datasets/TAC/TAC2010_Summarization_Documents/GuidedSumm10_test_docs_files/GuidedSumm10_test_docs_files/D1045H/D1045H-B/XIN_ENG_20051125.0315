The concentration of nitrobenzene, 
the prime pollutant in the contaminated Songhua River following 
explosion of a petrochemical plant near the river earlier this 
month, has kept falling, said local environmental protection 
bureau on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang Provincial Bureau of Environmental Protection said
in a press release that by 6 a.m. on Saturday, concentration of 
nitrobenzene monitored at Sujiatun upstream Sifangtai, one major 
water intake spot of Harbin, capital of northeast China's 
Heilongjiang Province, fell to 0.0793 mg per liter, but still 
above the state safety standard of 0.017 mg per liter, but the 
density of benzene stood at 0.0011 mg per liter, which is within 
the state safety benchmark.

<P>
A spokesman with the bureau said though urban districts of 
Harbin were still under the grip of the highly polluted stretch on
Saturday, the end of the polluted stretch passed Sifangtai spot 
around 9 a.m., with its front approaching Bayan County, also 
inside Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Other environmental monitoring stations downstream Harbin have 
stepped up monitoring efforts as the polluted stretch moves on, 
said the spokesman, who said their workers had monitored the air 
quality from three urban sites on Songhua River but didn't spot 
any toxic substance in the air.
</P>
<P>
Benzene and nitrobenzene flew into the river following a blast 
at China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) Jilin Petrochemical
company, a petrochemical plant in Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
China's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) 
said Songhua River suffered a major water pollution incident, 
which led to a four-day water supply system shutdown as of the wee
hours Wednesday in Harbin.
