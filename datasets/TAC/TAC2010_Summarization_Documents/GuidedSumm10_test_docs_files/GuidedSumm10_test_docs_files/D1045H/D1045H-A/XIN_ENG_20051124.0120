The massive floating pollutants 
traversing the Harbin section of northeast China's Songhua River 
is unlikely to cause big troubles to the city's rural areas,  
according to a senior hydrologist.
</P>
<P>
Yin Fazhang, deputy chief engineer of the Heilongjiang 
Provincial Hydrological Bureau, said that nearly 90 percent of 
residents living along the downstream section in Harbin rely on 
underground water as their source of drinking water.
</P>
<P>
The drifting polluted block is unlikely to cause too much 
inconvenience in their daily life, he added.
</P>
<P>
A petrochemical plant blast that occurred two weeks ago 
spilled large amount of benzene liquids into the Songhua River, 
resulting in heavy pollution in the section of Harbin, capital of 
the Heilongjiang province.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the current flowing speed, it would take four days
for the polluted block to flow out of the urban area of Harbin, 
where tap water supply has been suspended.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the province Zhang Zuoji on Thursday warned locals 
as well as animal husbandry against using water from the polluted 
Songhua River.
</P>
<P>
So far, local officials have dispatched work groups to patrol 
along the river to enforce the governor's order.
</P>
<P>
Huo Yinlong, a monitor at the river, told Xinhua that the water
pollution can not be distinguished by sight and there is no 
irritating smell emanating from the pollution.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring staff can only take samples to test the pollution 
density, he said.
