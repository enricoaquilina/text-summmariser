A top official with China's environmental watchdog said Thursday that the
company overseeing a chemical plant where an explosion spewed lethal chemicals
into a river in the country's northeast should be held responsible for the
pollution.

The Nov. 13 blast in Jilin, a city in Jilin province, caused massive amounts of
benzene, a toxic, flammable liquid to flow into the Songhua River. The
80-kilometer-long (50-mile-long) swathe of chemicals moved downstream into
Harbin, a city of 3.8 million people in neighboring Heilongjiang province, on
Thursday, prompting officials to shut down water supplies.

<P>
The plant was run by the Jilin Petroleum and Chemical Company, which is under
the state-owned China National Petroleum Corp. _ the country's largest oil
company.

"We will be very clear about who's responsible," Zhang Lijun, deputy director of
the State Environmental Protection Administration, said at a press conference.
"It is the chemical plant of the CNPC in Jilin province."
</P>
<P>
Zhang did not give any more details but said investigators were looking into
criminal responsibility.

Residents in Harbin cleared shelves of water, soft drinks and milk this week
after the water system was shut down on Tuesday. Families also stocked up by
filling bathtubs and buckets.
