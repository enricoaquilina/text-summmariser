Songhua River will carry poisonous 
substances to Harbin, a major city in northeast China, at round 
5:00 a.m. Thursday, an official said at a press conference 
Wednesday afternoon.

A spokesman for the Heilongjiang provincial government said 
that the poisonous organic substances, mainly high-density benzene
and nitrobenzene flowing down the Songhua River, will arrive in 
this provincial capital early Thursday.

Several river monitoring stations reported that benzene density
in the front strip of the pollutants was 28.56 times of the 
national standard as of 4:00 p.m. Wednesday, the spokesman said.

He said the pollutant strip will flow out of Harbin Saturday 
morning.

The blast at the Jilin Petroleum and Chemical Company, which is
located by the bank of the Songhua River, set off a series of 
explosions that leveled two of the plant's fuel towers where 
highly flammable gas benzene was being processed on Nov. 13.

<P>
The river is the main source of drinking water supply to Harbin,
a city of more than 3 million people.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government of Harbin has notified local residents
about the coming pollution so that people have enough time to 
store water.
