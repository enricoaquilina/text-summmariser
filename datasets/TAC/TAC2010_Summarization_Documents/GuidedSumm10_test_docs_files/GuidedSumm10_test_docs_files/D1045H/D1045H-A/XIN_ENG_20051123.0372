China has informed Russia of the

River, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said here 
on Thursday.

Russia expressed appreciation of China's information, said Liu,

The Songhua River suffered a major water pollution incident as 
a result of an explosion on Nov. 13 at a petrochemical plant in 
Jilin Province, where the river originates. Benzene-like organic 
pollutants, harmful to human health, had flown into the river 
after the blast, with the swath of polluted water stretching about
80 kilometers by Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
The blast of the petrochemical plant happened about 350 
kilometer away from the China-Russia boundary. The Songhua River 
is a tributary of the Heilong River (called Amur River in Russia) 
on the border between the Russian far east and China.
