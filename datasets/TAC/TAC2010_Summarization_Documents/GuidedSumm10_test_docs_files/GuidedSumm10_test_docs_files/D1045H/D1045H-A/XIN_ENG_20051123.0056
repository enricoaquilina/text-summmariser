China's State Environmental 
Protection Administration (SEPA) said here on Wednesday that the 
Songhua River in northeast China suffered a major water pollution 
incident owing to the explosion of a petrochemical plant at the 
upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
"After the explosion at the Jilin Petrochemical Company under 
China National Petroleum Corporation, our observation showed 
pollutants containing benzene had flown into the Songhua River and
caused water pollution," said an official with SEPA.
</P>
<P>
Benzene is a substance harmful to human health.

<P>
The official said upon receiving the report, the administration
immediately sent experts to Heilongjiang Province to assist local 
pollution-control efforts. Quality of the river water is under 
close observation for 24 hours every day.
</P>
<P>
The Jilin and Heilongjiang provincial governments have 
activated their contingency programs for environmental incidents, 
and have taken measures to ensure the safety of potable water, 
said the official.
</P>
<P>
He said Jilin had quickly blocked entry of the pollutants into 
the river and discharged water from a reservoir to dilute 
pollutants in the river. It also organized environmental, water 
conservancy and chemical experts to discuss pollution control 
plans, and beefed up monitoring work.
</P>
<P>
The finance department of the Heilongjiang provincial 
government has  allocated 10 million yuan (approximately 1.23 
million US dollars) specially for handling the pollution incident,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, observation data shows the degree of
river water pollution has been declining.
