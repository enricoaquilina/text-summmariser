HARBIN, Nov. 24 (Xinhua)
</DATELINE>

<P>
The front of the polluted water of 
Songhua River in northeast China reached Harbin, capital of 
Heilongjiang Province, on early Thursday morning, local 
environment authority said.
</P>
<P>
The toxic benzene-contaminated water, flowing down from the 
upper reaches of Songhua, arrived at the local water supply inlet 
at about 5 a.m., and has now entered river sections across the 
city's urban areas, according to the Heilongjiang provincial 
environment protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
Since the river was contaminated in a chemical plant explosion 
in the neighboring Jilin Province on November 13, the benzene and 
nitrobenzene density in the water is declining gradually after 
days of sedimentation and adsorption, and the Harbin city 
government has added a large amount of active carbon powders into 
the river to help clean up the water.
</P>
<P>
Harbin, home to nine million population including 3.8 million 
in the urban districts, has cut off water supply in the urban 
areas since early Wednesday, an emergency action taken to ensure 
public safety.
</P>
<P>
The operation of the city's water supply system was temporarily
resumed on Wednesday afternoon following a forecast by China's 
State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) that the 
polluted water will not reach the city until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The SEPA confirmed the "major pollution" of the Songhua River 
on Wednesday. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said
in Beijing on Thursday that China has informed Russia of the water
pollution situation in the river, a tributary of the Heilong River
(called Amur River in Russia) on the border between the Russian 
far east and China.
