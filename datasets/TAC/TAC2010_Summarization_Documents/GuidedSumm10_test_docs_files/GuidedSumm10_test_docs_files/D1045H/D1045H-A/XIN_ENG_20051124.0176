China shut down 2,682 companies 
discharging liquid waste among 420,000 inspected between last May 
and September, Zhang Lijun, deputy director of the State 
Environmental Protection Administration(SEPA) told a press 
conference held here Thursday.

<P>
Within this period, China put 23,000 cases on file, closed 
2,682 companies and asked 1,750 to stop production for treatment. 
163 people responsible for major environment pollution events 
received punishment, Zhang said.

Zhang, asked at the meeting to respond to the public concern 
over the water poison accident that occurred in northeast China's 
Songhua River, vowed to take tougher measures to reduce the 
emission of pollutants.
</P>
<P>
A major chemical explosion at Jilin Petrochemical Company 380 
kilometers up the Songhua river on November 13 had sent massive 
amounts of benzene into the waterway.
</P>
<P>
An 80-kilometer chemical slick has been slowly moving 
downstream along the Songhua River and reached Harbin on Thursday 
morning.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the water supply has been cut off in Harbin, capital
of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, as the city's water 
source, Songhua River, has been heavily polluted.
</P>
<P>
SEPA has incorporated the pollution-reduction measures China's 
major rivers, including the Songhua and Huanghe rivers, into the 
country's eleventh five-year economic and social development 
program, which means putting the task as one of the country's top 
concerns, said Zhang.
