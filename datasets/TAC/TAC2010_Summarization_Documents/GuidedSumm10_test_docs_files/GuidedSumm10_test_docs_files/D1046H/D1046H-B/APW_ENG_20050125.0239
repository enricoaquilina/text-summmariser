Indonesia hopes to dispel concerns about official corruption in relief
operations by announcing each month the amount of money it receives in foreign
donations and where the funds are being spent, the government said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is one of the world's most graft-ridden nations. Aid for disaster
relief elsewhere in the country has regularly gone missing in the past,
allegedly into the hands of corrupt local officials.
</P>
<P>
"We will announce every month, on the 26th, the money we receive," said Welfare
Minister Alwi Shihab, who is in charge of the country's relief effort. "We will
list down all contributions and where it is going to avoid any suspicion (of
graft)."

<P>
Indonesia was the worst affected of 11 Indian Ocean nations that were hit by the
Dec. 26 tsunami. More than 110,000 people were killed in the country and tens of
thousands are still missing.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to receive the bulk of over US$4 billion in aid, loans and debt
relief that rich nations have pledged to tsunami relief efforts in southern
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Small-scale graft has already been reported in Indonesia. Aid workers say some
soldiers and government officials are charging relief agencies "administrative
fees" to escort convoys of trucks in Aceh.
