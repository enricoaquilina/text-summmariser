<P>
The earthquake and tsunami that shattered Indonesia's Aceh province caused
damage and losses worth US$4.5 billion (euro3.45 billion), the government said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The damage bill represents 2.3 percent of Indonesia's gross domestic product and
97 percent of resource-rich Aceh's GDP, said Minister of National Development
Planning Sri Mulyani Indrawati.
</P>
<P>
Indrawati was addressing delegates from international lenders grouped under the
Consultative Group on Indonesia, which was holding its regular annual meeting
Wednesday and Thursday to pledge new loans to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The group was expected to focus on how best to help Aceh recover from the Dec.
26 catastrophe. Jakarta has said that the disaster won't stop the government
from achieving its 5.5 percent economic growth target this year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's death toll stands at almost 115,000, with thousands more still
missing and hundreds of thousands left homeless after entire towns and villages
were swept away or reduced to rubble by the quake and waves.
</P>
<P>
Governments, international institutions and private citizens from around the
world have pledged about US$4 billion (euro3 billion) to help all countries hit
by the tsunami.
</P>
<P>
In a report prepared for the meeting in Jakarta, the World Bank said recent
economic reforms by Jakarta have "boosted Indonesia's economic resilience and
positioned it better to absorb massive shocks, such as the natural disaster in
Aceh and North Sumatra."
</P>
<P>
In the report, Jemal-ud-din Kassum, World Bank Vice President for East Asia and
the Pacific, described 2004 as a turning point for Indonesia in its recovery
from the Asian economic crisis of 1998-9.
</P>
<P>
"Confidence hit post-crisis highs as an historic series of elections resulted in
Indonesia's first directly elected president, economic growth picked up, and
investment demand rose sharply," Kassum said in the report.
</P>
<P>
"However, 2004 will also be remembered for the tragic tsunami. The nation is
still struggling to come to terms with the enormity of the tragedy, the massive
challenge of rebuilding lives and livelihoods, and the longer term task of
healing the psychological wounds."
