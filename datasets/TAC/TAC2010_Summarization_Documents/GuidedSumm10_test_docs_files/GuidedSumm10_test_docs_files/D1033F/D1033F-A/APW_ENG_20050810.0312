Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was
hospitalized Wednesday, his office said.
</P>
<P>
Kim, 79, had been feeling weak and had a mild fever for a few days, Kim's
secretary Choi Gyung-hwan said in a statement. Concerned about the possibility
of an infection, Kim's doctor recommended an examination at Seoul's Severance
Hospital, Choi said.
</P>
<P>
Kim won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his "sunshine" policy of engaging
North Korea. He also held an unprecedented summit with North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il that year.
</P>
<P>
But his legacy has been tarnished over the scandal that the government made
secret payments ahead of the 2000 summit, and also this year over revelations
that the intelligence agency engaged in illegal wiretapping during much of his
administration. Kim has denied of any knowledge of the wiretapping.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, Kim underwent an operation to expand his coronary artery as well as
hemodialysis, a treatment for kidney disorders.
