South Korea's spy agency apologized Friday for illegally recording phone
conversations involving influential figures and admitted that wiretapping
continued long after former President Kim Dae-jung ordered an end to it in
1998.
</P>
<P>
"I ask for the forgiveness of the Korean people for past illegal wiretapping,"
National Intelligence Service chief Kim Seung-kew said, reading a statement to
reporters. He also apologized for "causing anxiety and disappointment to the
Korean people" by leaking the recorded information.
</P>
<P>
President Roh Moo-hyun ordered an investigation into wiretapping last month
after a scandal broke over a recording of an alleged conversation in 1997
between a major newspaper publisher and an influential company executive. The
two allegedly discussed channeling slush funds to candidates in that year's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The scandal, dubbed the "X-files" by local media, struck a raw nerve in a
society barely a generation removed from an oppressive military-backed
government in which serious curbs on civil liberties and collusive ties between
big business and political figures were the norm.
</P>
<P>
Rampant spy agency wiretapping was believed to have ended after Kim Dae-jung,
who won the 1997 election, ordered the practice terminated. Kim, who served from
1998 until 2003, had himself been subject to such monitoring in his days as a
leading dissident.
</P>
<P>
As it released interim results from its ongoing investigation into the wiretaps
Friday, the agency admitted that "minimal wiretapping" continued until March
2002, well into Kim's tenure as president, reversing an earlier position that it
stopped with the presidential order.
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of anguish and hesitation internally on whether to confess to
the Korean people our past wiretapping activities, but we reached the agreement
that we must report the truth," the intelligence service chief
said.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung's office expressed "profound regret" over the spy agency's
admission of wiretapping during his government. Kim "never received any report
of such illegal activities" during his presidency, Choi Gyung-hwan, Kim's
secretary, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Roh's office reacted harshly to the admission. "The past abuse of authority
revealed today is shocking," it said in a statement. "Illegal actions of
national agencies should never again occur."
</P>
<P>
During the investigation, prosecutors discovered 274 wiretapped recordings at
the home of one former NIS agent.
</P>
<P>
Last month, television network MBC said it had acquired a spy agency recording
of a 1997 conversation between Hong Seok-hyun, then publisher of the
mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo, and Lee Hak-soo, a top executive with Samsung
Group, the country's biggest industrial conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
Hong and Lee obtained a court order preventing the network from broadcasting the
tape so it reported the contents based on a transcript of the alleged
conversation instead.
</P>
<P>
Hong has since announced he will step down from his current position as South
Korean Ambassador to the United States. Samsung apologized to the nation,
expressing regret that "social confusion was fostered and anxiety caused to the
Korean people" over the report of the tape.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors on Friday began questioning Lee Sang-ho, the MBC reporter who
obtained the tape, said Sun Dong-kyu, the network's editor in charge of
political coverage. It was unclear how he obtained the recording.
