<P>
South Korea's spy agency publicly 
apologized Friday for illegally wiretapping telephone calls years 
ago, revealed by the leakage of a taped 1997 conversation of an 
alleged payment by the Samsung Group to presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors meanwhile raided the house of a former head of the 
spy agency, the National Intelligence Service (NIS), late Thursday 
and seized documents and computer discs believed to be related to 
the unlawful bugging.
</P>
<P>
In an apology broadcast live across the country, NIS director 
Kim Seung-Gyu said the agency had tapped conversations of 
influential figures until as late as March 2002 when ex-president 
Kim Dae-Jung was in office.
</P>
<P>
"Forgive us for the past illegal bugging ... We are now 
determined to start from scratch and write a new history of NIS," he 
said.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that without an honest confession, the NIS 
cannot get rid of its dark past in order to be born again and fulfil 
its original mission," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kim said there had been no illicit wiretapping under the 
government of President Roh Moo-Hyun.
</P>
<P>
"Now we don't need to conduct illegal bugging, and we don't have 
the intention of doing so," he said.
</P>
<P>
A former NIS official who headed a wiretapping team was arrested 
Thursday for leaking the taped 1997 conversation between Hong 
Seok-Hyun, a brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee, and 
a top official of the group.
</P>
<P>
The conversation sparked suspicions that Hong, who later became 
South Korea's envoy to the United States, acted as a courier for 
Samsung to dole out slush funds to presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
The arrested former NIS official, 58-year-old Gong Un-Yong, is 
accused of handing over an audio tape containing the conversation to 
a Korean-American businessman who was arrested last week.
</P>
<P>
The businessman is suspected of leaking the conversation to the 
media after his attempt to blackmail Samsung for ransom in return 
for the tape failed.
</P>
<P>
Hong has offered to resign as the US ambassadorship since the 
scandal emerged.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors investigating the illegal wiretapping scandal on 
Friday raided the home of Chun Yong-Taek who served as the NIS head 
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Yonhap news agency said prosecutors would summon Lee Hak-Soo, a 
powerful vice chairman of Samsung, early next week to question him 
over the wiretapping and allegations that Samsung provided illicit 
campaign funds to politicians.
