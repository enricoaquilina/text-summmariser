South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun 
on Monday ordered the National Intelligence Service (NIS) to 
thoroughly investigate the allegation that one of the nation's 
biggest conglomerates provided huge slush funds to presidential 
candidates in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Roh made the remarks while presiding over a weekly meeting with
senior presidential aides in earlier Monday, Roh's spokesman Kim 
Man-soo said.
</P>
<P>
However, the South Korean president did not mention the fate of
the country's Ambassador to the United States Hong Seok-hyun, who 
was allegedly involved in the slush funds scandal, according to 
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Hong was president of JoongAng Daily, one of three most 
influential newspapers in South Korea, at that time.
</P>
<P>
MBC, a major local broadcasting company, released parts of an 
eavesdropped conversation in which Hong allegedly discussed with a
senior Samsung Group official to donate slush fund to candidate of
the Grand National Party (GNP) Lee Hoi-chang in the 1997 
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
But Lee was defeated by Kim Dae-jung, candidate of the National
Congress for New Politics which later turned to the Millennium 
Democratic Party (MDP).
</P>
<P>
The taped conversation, allegedly made by a team from the 
nation's top intelligence agency in 1997, was leaked to the media 
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both ruling and opposition political parties urged Hong to 
resign to take responsibility for the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, on Monday, the Samsung Group expressed an apology for
the slush fund scandal.
</P>
<P>
"We offer a sincere apology to the public for causing concerns,
regardless of the truth of a series of media reports on the matter,
" the group said in a statement. "Some of earlier media reports 
are totally groundless and distorted."
</P>
<P>
Samsung Group also said it will decide later whether to take 
legal action against MBC and other media outlets after a further 
review of their coverage.
