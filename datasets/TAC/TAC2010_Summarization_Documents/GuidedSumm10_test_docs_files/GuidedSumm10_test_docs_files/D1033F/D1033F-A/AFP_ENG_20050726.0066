<P>
South Korea's envoy to the United States 
has offered his resignation, bowing to pressure over his alleged 
involvement in a major political slush fund scandal, officials said 
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Hong Seok-Hyun called the office of President Roh 
Moo-Hyun late Monday and offered to resign, presidential spokesman 
Kim Man-Soo said, indicating Hong's resignation would be accepted.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable as the ambassador has performed his job well 
at an important time," Roh was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hong, however, will be allowed to continue his job for the time 
being until Roh officially accepts his resignation, the spokesman 
said.
</P>
<P>
"The timing of his official resignation will depend on the 
settlement of his job," he said.
</P>
<P>
Roh has been concerned that Hong's resignation could hurt 
cooperation with the United States about ending a standoff over 
North Korea's nuclear weapons drive, Yonhap news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Hong came under pressure to resign as suspicions arose that he 
might have acted as an intermediary between the country's largest 
conglomerate Samsung and politicians and handed out Samsung's slush 
funds to presidential candidates in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The potentially explosive case came to light when a tape of a 
wiretapped conversation in 1997 between Hong and a top Samsung 
official was leaked to the press last week.
</P>
<P>
Hong, the publisher of leading newspaper Joongang Ilbo, was 
named as ambassador to the United States in February. He is a 
brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee.
</P>
<P>
The recordings reportedly contain discussions about a proposal 
to give three billion won (2.9 million dollars) to the then-ruling 
party chief Lee Hoi-Chang.    Kim Dae-Jung beat Lee in a 
presidential election in late 1997. Lee retired from politics after 
he failed in his second presidential bid in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Roh has asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the 
country's main spy agency, to launch a "thorough" investigation into 
the case.
</P>
<P>
Former NIS officials have told newspapers the taped conversation 
was authentic. They said the intelligence agency had maintained a 
special wiretapping unit.
</P>
<P>
Civic groups have urged state prosecutors to investigate Lee, 
Hong and the Samsung chief.
</P>
<P>
Samsung apologized Monday over the issue but threatened to file 
a libel suit, accusing some media outlets of distorting and 
exaggerating the case.
</P>
<P>
South Korea was rattled by widespread corruption scandals last 
year after prosecutors launched a probe into illegal donations by 
businesses to politicians during the presidential poll in 2002.
</P>
<P>
A Samsung executive was accused of donating illicit funds to 
political parties while dozens of lawmakers, politicians and aides 
to Roh were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Businesses told investigators that they had donated illicit 
campaign funds for fear of reprisal from politicians if they did 
not.
