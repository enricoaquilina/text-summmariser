President Roh Moo-Hyun called Monday for 
a probe into allegations that intelligence officials had illegally 
taped conversations between South Korea's ambassador to the United 
States and a Samsung Group executive.
</P>
<P>
Roh asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's 
main spy agency, to launch a "thorough" investigation into the case, 
his spokesman Kim Man-Soo said.
</P>
<P>
"It is shameful and deplorable that a state organization was 
involved in illegal wiretapping," Roh was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
South Korean television and newspapers have released what they 
called a taped private conversation between ambassador Hong 
Seok-Hyun and a top official of the country's largest conglomerate 
Samsung in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong, the publisher of leading newspaper Joongang Ilbo, was 
named as the country's top envoy in Washington in February. He is a 
brother-in-law of Samsung Group chief Lee Kun-Hee.
</P>
<P>
The recordings reportedly contain discussions about a proposal 
to give three billion won (2.9 million dollars) to the then-ruling 
party chief Lee Hoi-Chang.    Kim Dae-Jung beat Lee in a 
presidential election in late 1997. Lee retired from politics after 
he failed in his second presidential bid in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Ruling and opposition party lawmakers have urged Hong to step 
down, but Roh did not comment on his fate, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Former NIS officials told newspapers Monday that the taped 
conversation was authentic. They said the intelligence agency had 
maintained a special wiretapping unit.
</P>
<P>
The People's Solidarity of Participatory Democracy filed a 
petition Monday with state prosecutors against Lee, Hong and the 
Samsung chief.
</P>
<P>
The influential civic group also called for criminal charges 
against former government officials suspected of having received 
bribes from Samsung.
</P>
<P>
South Korea was rattled by widespread corruption scandals last 
year after prosecutors launched a probe into illegal donations by 
businesses to politicians during the presidential poll in 2002.
</P>
<P>
A Samsung executive was accused of donating illicit funds to 
political parties while dozens of lawmakers, politicians and aides 
to Roh were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Businesses told investigators that they had donated illicit 
campaign funds for fear of reprisal from politicians if they did 
not.
