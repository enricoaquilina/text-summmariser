<P>
President Roh Moo-hyun on Tuesday said he will accept the resignation of South
Korea's ambassador to the United States, who is stepping down over a burgeoning
scandal surrounding the East Asian country's 1997 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Hong Seok-hyun called the presidential chief of staff, Kim Woo-sik,
late Monday to say that he would resign. In offering to quit, Hong offered an
apology to Roh for "causing concern over this incident," according to Roh's
office.
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry because he has been doing a good job as ambassador to the United
States at a crucial period," Roh was quoted as saying by Kim Man-soo, the
presidential spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Roh's office indicated it may take time before Hong officially leaves his post
because of "pending issues" that need to be taken care of. It didn't
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
News of the resignation came on the same day that six-nation talks in Beijing,
aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program, resumed
after a 13-month hiatus. The two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United
States are taking part.
</P>
<P>
The president named Hong, formerly a prominent newspaper publisher, to South
Korea's most important diplomatic post in December. The United States is Seoul's
closest ally, with about 32,500 U.S. troops stationed here.
</P>
<P>
Hong had assumed his duties in Washington in February.
</P>
<P>
He has come under intense pressure to step down over a purportedly wiretapped
conversation in which he is said to have discussed a slush fund for candidates
in the 1997 election.
</P>
<P>
MBC TV reported last week that the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's
spy agency, secretly recorded a conversation between Hong _ then publisher of
the mass-circulation newspaper JoongAng Ilbo _ and Lee Hak-soo, a high-ranking
official with the Samsung Group, South Korea's largest business
conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
Hong and Lee quickly won a court injunction against the broadcast of the
recording, but that didn't stop the network from divulging the subject of their
alleged conversation: channeling Samsung funds to candidates ahead of the 1997
election.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office on Tuesday began investigating a
complaint filed by a civic group against 20 people including Hong and Lee,
alleging the illegal distribution of political funds and bribery.
</P>
<P>
President Roh has called for the National Intelligence Service to conduct a
thorough investigation into the alleged illegal wiretapping.
</P>
<P>
Samsung, preparing legal action against the network, apologized to the nation on
Monday, expressing regret that "social confusion was fostered and anxiety caused
to the Korean people" over the reports of the tape.
</P>
<P>
Opposition presidential candidate Kim Dae-jung defeated governing party
candidate Lee Hoi-chang in the 1997 election.
