The Seoul Central District Court on 
Tuesday issued arrest warrants for two former intelligence chiefs 
who had alleged involvement in the spy agency's illegal 
wiretapping operations years ago, reported South Korean English 
newspaper The Korea Times on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The court charged former Unification Minister Lim Dong-won, 71,
who directed the National Intelligence Service (NIS) from 1999 to 
2001, and Shin Gunn, 64, who succeeded Lim as director through 
2003, for directing intelligence agents to spy on high-profile 
figures such as politicians, businessmen and journalists during 
their tenures.
</P>
<P>
The decision to arrest the two former spy chiefs indicates that
the prosecution's three-month investigation of the spy agency's 
wiretapping scandal is nearing its close, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution requested the arrest warrants Monday shortly 
after former NIS deputy chief Kim Un-sung, who led the spy agency'
s domestic operations from 2000 to 2001, testified in court that 
the former directors had influential roles in directing the 
illegal wiretapping operations.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-year-old Kim last month became the first spy agency 
official, retired or incumbent, to be indicted on criminal charges
during the investigation of the wiretapping scandal.
</P>
<P>
In Kim's indictment, the prosecution confirmed seven 
wiretapping operations on politicians, businessmen and other high-
profile figures conducted by NIS agents.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution also claimed that the spy agency's wiretapping
unit, under Kim's direction, had reported summaries of seven to 
eight wiretapped conversations per day to the former NIS directors.
</P>
<P>
During the court review of the warrant requests earlier Tuesday,
both Lim and Shin denied that they had directed or approved the 
illegal eavesdropping operations on civilians during their tenures.
