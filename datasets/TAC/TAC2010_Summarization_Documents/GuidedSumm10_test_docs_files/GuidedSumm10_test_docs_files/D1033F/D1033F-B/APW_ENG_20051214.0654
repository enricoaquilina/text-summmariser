Prosecutors on Wednesday cleared the chairman of South Korea's largest
industrial conglomerate and two other prominent figures of suspected involvement
in a presidential campaign finance scandal.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came at the end of months-long investigation into the National
Intelligence Service's illegal wiretapping of mobile phone conversations of
about 1,800 of South Korea's political, corporate and media elite.
</P>
<P>
Cleared were Lee Kun-hee, the head of Samsung Group, Lee Hak-soo, a top Samsung
executive, and Hong Seok-hyun, the former publisher of the mass-circulation
JoongAng Ilbo newspaper, the Seoul District Prosecutors' Office said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The three, who will not be indicted, were suspected of colluding to embezzle 10
billion won (US$9.8 million; euro8.1 million) from Samsung affiliates to provide
illicit campaign funds to candidates in South Korea's 1997 presidential race, as
well as for bribes to prosecutors at the time.
</P>
<P>
The statement said there was insufficient evidence of embezzlement and that the
statute of limitations on any bribery charges against the three had
expired.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, however, have indicted the television journalist who broke the
story on the extensive wiretappings, for allegedly violating privacy laws in
revealing some of the taped conversations. The journalist, Lee Sang-ho, says he
was acting in the public's interest by revealing the tapes' contents.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our investigation will help to eradicate any other illegal wiretapping
in our country," Hwang Kyo-an, the prosecutor leading the investigation, said in
a nationally televised news conference.
</P>
<P>
Also facing trial are Lim Dong-won and Shin Gunn, who headed the National
Intelligence Service successively between December 1999 and April 2003, for
allegedly supervising illegal mobile phone taps of the country's leading
figures.
</P>
<P>
Both Lee and Shin denied the charges at court appearances Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The scandal, dubbed the "X-files" by South Korean media, surfaced in July after
revelations of a 1997 wiretapped phone conversation between Hong and Lee
Hak-soo, who purportedly discussed providing illicit campaign funds to
candidates in the presidential race, won by former dissident Kim
Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
Hong, the brother-in-law of Lee Kun-hee, stepped down as South Korea's
ambassador to the United States in September amid the scandal. Samsung Chairman
Lee went to the United States in September for medical treatment and is believed
to still be there.
</P>
<P>
The extensive wiretappings revealed not only problems with the spy agency, but
also brought back memories of collusion between top conglomerates and
politicians _ one of the inveterate ills of South Korean politics.
</P>
<P>
Family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebol, used to give large and illegal sums
of money, described as "insurance," to both ruling and opposition
candidates.
