 The patriarch of South Korea's 
largest family-run conglomerate, Samsung Group, offered 825 million 
dollars to charity on Tuesday and apologised for a spate of scandals 
which engulfed his company.
</P>
<P>
"We feel sorry for causing the concerns to the people, with 
issues such as political donations," Samsung vice chairman Lee 
Hak-Soo said from a statement on behalf of the group and chief Lee 
Kun-Hee.
</P>
<P>
The unconditional donation was part of efforts by the group and 
the family which controls Samsung to redeem themselves from the 
"wrongful practices of the past," he said. It was the country's 
largest donation to charity ever.
</P>
<P>
The vice chairman also said Samsung would drop legal battles 
with tax authorities amid charges of tax evasion and with anti-trust 
regulators over new rules which will curb the power of the giant 
business group.
</P>
<P>
The surprise move came two days after the business tycoon 
returned home after five-months abroad when allegations snowballed 
that he and his group had illegally funded politicians.
</P>
<P>
The scandal erupted as an illegal wiretapping by the country's 
main spy agency showed that Lee's top Samsung aide and 
brother-in-law had discussed the illicit funding for the 1997 
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In November, the youngest daughter of Lee Kun-Hee committed 
suicide in her home in the United States. She had reportedly 
suffered from severe depression after a plan to marry her boyfriend 
was opposed by her parents.
</P>
<P>
Other troubles linger over the group owner's family-run empire.
