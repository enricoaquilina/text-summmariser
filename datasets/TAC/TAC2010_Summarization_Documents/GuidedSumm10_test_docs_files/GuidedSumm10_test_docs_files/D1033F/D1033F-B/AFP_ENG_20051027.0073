<P>
South Korea's conservative opposition, 
helped by public resentment over a prolonged economic slowdown, won 
a clean sweep in Wednesday's by-elections, dealing a blow to 
President Roh Moo-Hyun.
</P>
<P>
The Grand National Party (GNP) bagged all four seats up for 
grabs, increasing the number of its seats in the 299-seat National 
Assembly to 127.
</P>
<P>
Roh issued a disappointed statement on the outcome of the 
elections, which followed a ruling party defeat in by-elections in 
April.
</P>
<P>
"I accept the outcome of elections as a public assessment of my 
management," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Uri Party now holds 144 seats, six short of a 
majority and down eight from the 152 seats it won at last year's 
elections.
</P>
<P>
"Voters meted out stern punishment to the government for policy 
failures, corruption and incompetence," the GNP said in a 
statement.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers and analysts said the government and ruling party 
have seen their support base being eroded by an economic slowdown 
and an ideological dispute over North Korea.
</P>
<P>
"The key reason for the ruling party's defeat reflects public 
feelings about a delayed economic recovery," Chun In-Yong, a Seoul 
National University politics professor, said.
</P>
<P>
"A wave of ideological debate prompted conservative voters to 
vote for the opposition, but there is a general consensus here that 
economic activity has fallen short of expectations."
</P>
<P>
The government has struggled to get the economy moving by 
front-loading its budget spending and offering tax breaks. But the 
economy remained sluggish, with three percent growth in the first 
half.
</P>
<P>
Roh had frequently blamed the opposition for stalling his reform 
agenda, while GNP lawmakers have criticised his confrontational 
approach to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Roh, who took office in early 2003, was reinstated in May last 
year after two months of political paralysis triggered by an 
opposition-led impeachment which sparked a public backlash.
</P>
<P>
This year, Roh has been at odds with the opposition over a 
special inquiry into illegal wiretapping by the intelligence 
agency.
</P>
<P>
The scandal erupted in August when intelligence service 
audiotapes containing wiretapped conversations between business and 
political leaders were made public.
</P>
<P>
Roh also faces a fresh battle in parliament over the resignation 
of a chief prosecutor who stepped down this month in a dispute over 
government intervention in a prosecution case.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Chun Jung-Bae, one of Roh's close confidants, 
was accused to instructing state prosecutors not to seek the arrest 
of a professor under investigation for pro-North Korean statements.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors ordered the arrest of Kang Jeong-Koo, a sociology 
professor at Seoul's Dongguk University, on charges of supporting 
North Korea in violation of the South's anti-communist national 
security law.
</P>
<P>
But the justice minister overruled the order, citing human 
rights and freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
GNP head Park Geun-Hye has accused Roh's progressive government 
of undermining South Korea's anti-communist national identity by 
opposing the arrest order.
</P>
<P>
The two Koreas are still technically at war after the 1950-53 
conflict ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Roh and his progressive supporters are seeking to scrap or 
revise the decades-old national security law, which they dismiss as 
a Cold War relic.
