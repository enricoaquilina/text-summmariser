<P>
State prosecutors raided telephone offices 
across the capital on Monday to seize records and data related to 
illegal wiretapping by South Korea's spy agency, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Fixed-line operator KT Corp said its seven branches in Seoul 
were under investigation by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
"Prosecutors are looking into records of wiretapping using our 
communication system," KT spokesman Koo Ja-Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Yonhap news agency said the prosecution office had dispatched 
more than 40 investigators to the telephone offices.
</P>
<P>
The raid was part of a probe into an illegal bugging team run by 
the National Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
The scandal erupted last month when some of 274 intelligence 
service audiotapes containing wiretapped conversations between 
business and political leaders were made public.
</P>
<P>
One of them concerned a 1997 conversation between businessman 
Hong Seok-Hyun and a top Samsung official on plans for payoffs to 
presidential candidates in that year's election.
</P>
<P>
Hong later became ambassador to Washington but quit over the 
scandal.
</P>
<P>
South Korea was rattled by widespread corruption scandals last 
year after prosecutors launched a probe into illegal donations by 
businesses to politicians during 2002 presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
Businesses told investigators that they had made cash donations 
through for fear of reprisals from politicians.
