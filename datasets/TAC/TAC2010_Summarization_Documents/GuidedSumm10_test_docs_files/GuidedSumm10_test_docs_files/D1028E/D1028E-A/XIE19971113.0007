<HEADLINE> Jury Selection Begins in Mail Bomb Terrorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The UNABOMber trial is
getting under way today with jury selection in Sacramento,
California.
</P>
<P>
FBI agents arrested Theodore Kaczynski 19 months ago at his
cabin in rural Montana following one of the most intensive
manhunts in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say they have a great deal of evidence against the
55-year-old former math professor, who's charged with four of the
16 bombings blamed on the notorious UNABOMber, according to news
reports.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers are expected to try to raise reasonable doubt
in the minds of jurors that the hermit is the same man who placed
or mailed bombs that killed Sacramento computer store owner Hugh
Scrutton in 1985, and timber industry lobbyist Gilbert Murray 10
years later.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts say Kaczynski's best hope is escaping the death
penalty in the second phase of the trial, if he's convicted, on
grounds that he has had lifelong mental problems.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, jurors must determine if Kaczynski is the
bomber who terrorized the country for 17 years, beginning in 1978.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. plans to call one dozen
prospective jurors a day, beginning today, until he has a pool of
at least 64.
</P>
<P>
At that point, attorneys will question juror candidates and use
dozens of preemptory challenges to exclude those they consider
unfit. Burrell said he'll form the panel when he has 12 jurors
and six alternates.
