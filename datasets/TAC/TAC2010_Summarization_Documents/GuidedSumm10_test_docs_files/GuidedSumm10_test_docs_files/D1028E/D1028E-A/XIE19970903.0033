<HEADLINE> Judge Rejects Most Unabomber Suspect Defense's Requests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The judge in the trial of
Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski turned down a series of
defense requests for revisions in jury selection.
</P>
<P>
In an order filed late Friday afternoon and distributed by a
court document service today, U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell
Jr. in Sacramento, California, said defense lawyers Quin Denvir
and Judy Clarke had failed to prove the necessity of expanding the
jury pool beyond the list of registered voters, media reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski, 55, is awaiting trial on November 12 on a 10-count
federal indictment charging him with four of the 16 bombings
attributed to the Unabomber -- a name stemming from the bomber's
early victims, which included universities, airlines and other
technology-related targets. The mail bomb terrorist killed three
people and injured 23 others in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
The former college math instructor is charged separately in New
Jersey in connection with a fifth bombing.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski, who was arrested in April last year, has pleaded
innocent to all charges. If convicted, he could receive the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
The defense had asked that lists of licensed drivers, as well
as lists of registered voters, be used to broaden the pool of
ury.
</P>
<P>
Burrell said the request had to be rejected because the defense
had failed to show that using the voter rolls the impact of
pretrial news coverage.
