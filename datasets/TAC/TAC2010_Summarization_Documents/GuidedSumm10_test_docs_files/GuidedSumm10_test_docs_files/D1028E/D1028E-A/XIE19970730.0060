<HEADLINE> Defense Motion Rejected in UNABOM Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge has rejected a
motion to exclude key evidence from the Sacramento, California
trial in November of UNABOMber suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski is the suspect of the mailing-bomb terrorist who has
killed three people and injured 23 others in the 18 years. He was
arrested April last year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. says Kaczynski's
constitutional rights wouldn't be violated if his potentially
incriminating journals, notes and other private writing are used
against him.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old former mathematics instructor's defense team
argued that admitting the documents would infringe on his rights
of privacy and protection from self-incrimination. Burrell
rejected a motion on the same issue earlier.
</P>
<P>
In his latest ruling Monday, he said the defense argument
applies only "when the government compels an individual to
incriminate himself," which he says didn't happen in Kaczynski's
case, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
The evidence includes journals that prosecutors say contain
admissions to all 16 bombings attributed to the UNABOMber during a
18-year reign of terror that began in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski is charged in Sacramento with four of those bombings,
which killed two men and wounded others. He also is charged with a
third fatal bombing in New Jersey.
