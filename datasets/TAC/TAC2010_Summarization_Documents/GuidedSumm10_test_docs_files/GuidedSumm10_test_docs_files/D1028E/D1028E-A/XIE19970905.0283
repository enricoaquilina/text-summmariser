<HEADLINE> UNABOMber Suspect Moved to Federal Prison </HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Authorities have moved
UNABOMber suspect Theodore Kaczynski from Sacramento County Jail
to a federal prison 20 miles southeast of Oakland in California.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said Kaczynski's lawyers requested the transfer,
which was completed Wednesday, 10 weeks before his trial begins in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the 55-year-old former college mathematics
instructor had complained of noise in the jail, although they
declined to say if that was the reason for the transfer.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Dan Lewis, the jail's executive director, said the Federal
Correctional Institution near Pleasanton holds a higher number of
white collar criminals and may be quieter.
</P>
<P>
Kacznski is expected to be returned to Sacramento for his trial
on November 12. He is charged in four bombings that killed two men
and wounded two others.
</P>
<P>
Explosive devices placed or mailed by the notorious UNABOMber
killed three people and injured 23 during a 17-year reign of
terror that began in 1978. The terrorist is so dubbed because his
first targets included universities and airlines.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski was arrested in a cabin in Montana in April last
year.
