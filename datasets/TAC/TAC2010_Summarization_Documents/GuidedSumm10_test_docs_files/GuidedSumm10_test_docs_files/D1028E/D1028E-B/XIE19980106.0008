<HEADLINE> Mail-bomber Trial to Begin in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The trial of former math
professor Theodore Kaczynski, accused of serial killings with
mail-bombs over an 18-year period, is set to open Monday in
Sacramento, California, where police say the suspect killed two
people.
</P>
<P>
In the Sacramento trial Kaczynski is charged in a 10-count
indictment covering only four of the 16 bombings attributed to the
Unabomber -- so named by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
because his first victims were from universities and airlines.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to present evidence trying to link
the defendant to all the bombings, which killed three people and
injured 29, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
At the height of the bombing campaign in 1995, the mysterious
terrorist held the nation hostage, disrupting air travel and
postal deliveries.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996, alerted by Kaczynski's brother, federal
authorities arrested the suspect in a Montana cabin.
