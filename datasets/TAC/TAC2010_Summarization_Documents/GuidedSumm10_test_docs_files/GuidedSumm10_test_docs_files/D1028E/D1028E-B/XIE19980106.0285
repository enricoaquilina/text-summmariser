<HEADLINE> Mail-bomber Suspect's Trial on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The trial of Unabomber
suspect Theodore Kaczynski in Sacramento, California, is on hold
following a surprise meeting with the judge and his lawyers,
reportedly to air complaints about his defense, media reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The former math professor is accused of serial killings with
mail-bomb across the nation over 18 years. In the Sacramento trial
Kaczynski, 55, is charged in a 10-count indictment covering only
four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber -- so named by
the FBI because his first victims were from universities and
airlines
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Kaczynski for nearly four hours, U.S.
District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. told marshals to send the jury
of eight women and four men home until Thursday, news reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Burrell scheduled a hearing with lawyers Wednesday afternoon
and rescheduled opening statements in the high-profile case for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Details of the private meeting weren't disclosed, but such
conferences typically allow defendants to express complaints about
federal defenders. Kaczynski also may have objected to the
presence of his brother, David, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
David Kaczynski, whose tips led to his brother's arrest, was
sitting with their mother, Wanda, behind the defense table when
Theodore Kaczynski strode into the courtroom today without
acknowledging them.
</P>
<P>
He then told the judge that he wished to make a statement.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts say Kaczysnki can ask Burrell to approve new
counsel if he believes he can no longer work with them, or even to
affirm his right to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he forced his highly-regarded defense team to abandon
their plans to portray him as a paranoid schizophrenic after he
refused to undergo a psychiatric exam.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski has pleaded not guilty to charges related to four of
the serial attacks attributed to the Unabomber. The government is
reportedly seeking the death penalty.
