Grizzly bears around Yellowstone to lose status as endangered species

<P>
Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park should be removed from the
endangered species list after 30 years of federal protection, the U.S.
Department of Interior said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of grizzlies in the Yellowstone area has grown at a rate of 4 to 7
percent per year since the bear was listed under the Endangered Species Act in
1975, Interior Secretary Gale Norton said. Federal wildlife officials estimate
that more than 600 grizzly bears now live in the region, which includes parts of
Wyoming, Montana and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
Stripping the bears of protection could eventually clear the way for limited
hunting of the massive bears. These three states would assume management
responsibilities from federal wildlife officials and have greater flexibility in
dealing with the animals.
</P>
<P>
The department's proposed delisting could go into effect as early as 2006, but
litigation could delay any ultimate effort to remove federal
protections.
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups are split on the move. The National Wildlife Federation
supports delisting, saying it highlights the success of the endangered species
law. The Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club and other groups say
that too many threats still exist for the bears.
</P>
<P>
Three senators who attended the Interior news conference Tuesday used the
delisting as an opportunity to call for reform of the endangered species law.
The House passed a bill in September that would lessen the government's role in
protecting plant and animal habitat.
</P>
<P>
"This is the exception not the rule to the Endangered Species Act," said Sen.
Larry Craig, R-Idaho.
</P>
<P>
Sens. Mike Enzi and Craig Thomas, both Republicans, also called for reform of
the law. Less than 20 species have been delisted since the law was signed by
President Richard Nixon was signed in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Norton said grizzly bear recovery has been a success story because of
cooperation between state and federal governments, along with biologists and
conservation groups. She said the administration would like to see the law more
focused on recovery efforts than penalizing landowners who find species on their
land.
</P>
<P>
Four other grizzly populations in the lower 48 states will continue to be
protected as threatened species under the act. These bears live in the same
three states and Washington.
</P>
<P>
Alaskan grizzly bears, which number around 30,000, were never listed under the
act.
