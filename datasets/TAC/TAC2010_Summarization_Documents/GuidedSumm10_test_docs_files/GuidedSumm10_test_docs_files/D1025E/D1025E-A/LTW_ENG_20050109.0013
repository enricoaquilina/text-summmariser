Possible Delisting as Endangered Is a Bear of an Issue
</HEADLINE>

CODY, Wyo.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On April 12 of last year, state Game and Fish
officers shot dead a dangerous nuisance known as Bear #G92, after the
grizzly repeatedly broke into buildings searching for food on a ranch
near here.
</P>
<P>
The 5-year-old male was the first of 19 grizzly bears to die in the
region surrounding Yellowstone National Park and one of 50 killed in
the lower 48 states, making 2004 the worst year for grizzly mortality
since the animal was added to the endangered species list in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The death rate here, where the grizzly population is estimated at
600, was 2 1/2 half times greater than the 15-year average. Most
worrying to wildlife biologists was the fact that females made up 60
percent of the dead.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to
remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list
later this year. Moreover, new management plans might allow hunting of
the bears outside the park.
</P>
<P>
The Yellowstone contingent is the largest of a handful of remnant
grizzly populations in the lower 48 states and the only one facing
imminent removal from the endangered species list. Their range
encompasses Yellowstone, Grand Teton National Park and nearby lands in
Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. The law protects the bears in Yellowstone,
part of Grand Teton and in a circle of land outside, known as the
``primary recovery area.''
</P>
<P>
A formidable symbol of American wilderness, and a hugely popular
public attraction in Yellowstone, the grizzly bear would be the
biggest animal to come off the endangered species list since the
California gray whale was delisted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Despite the record number of dead bears last year, the Fish and
Wildlife Service believes the grizzlies, whose population has more
than doubled in the three decades it has been on the list, no longer
need the special protection afforded by the law.
</P>
<P>
``We're victims of our own success,'' said Chris Servheen, Fish and
Wildlife's grizzly bear coordinator. ``The bears are expanding their
numbers and their range. They are now in places they haven't been in
80 or 100 years. These mortality rates are to be expected when bears
punch out into areas where there are more people.''
</P>
<P>
But Servheen stresses the bears will be monitored closely after
they are delisted. If their numbers drop below 500, a management
review will be triggered. An overall decline of more than 4 percent or
a 1.2 percent annual drop in the female population will trigger a
review, Servheen said, and that could lead to an emergency
re-lisiting.
</P>
<P>
Bear experts believe that an isolated population of fewer than 500
is in danger of losing its genetic diversity and becoming vulnerable
to disease and birth defects.
</P>
<P>
Some biologists, notably Dave Mattson, a specialist on population
assessment who has been studying the Yellowstone grizzlies since 1979,
are wary of managing by numbers. ``We really don't have any precise
ways to count bears or track their growth and decline,'' Mattson said.
</P>
<P>
``Even if you start with 500 bears, an annual decline of 2 percent
to 5 percent over 15 to 30 years could take them down to 200.''
</P>
<P>
According to estimates at the time, there were between 150 and 220
Yellowstone grizzlies when they were placed on the endangered species
list.
</P>
<P>
Mattson, who works for the U.S. Geological Survey, said he has not
taken a position on delisting, but he worries that not enough is known
about comparatively new threats such as climate change and the
proliferation of non-native species that could deplete some of the
bears' food sources by 90 percent in the future.
</P>
<P>
Some opponents of delisting contend that last year's mortality rate
underscores the bear's vulnerability to encroaching development. They
contend that once exempt from the highest level of federal protection,
the bears will be safe only inside Yellowstone and Grand Teton
national parks, areas too small to sustain a viable population of
grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
In 2001, the Bush administration shelved a plan to reintroduce
grizzlies in a wilderness area along the Idaho-Montana border, despite
strong public sentiment in favor of the move. Many experts believed it
would have been a major step in assuring the long-term survival of
grizzlies because the isolated Yellowstone bears would have been able
to intermingle with the introduced population.
</P>
<P>
How the Yellowstone bears fare could well be the most conspicuous
test case of the Bush administration's policy toward endangered
species.
</P>
<P>
The administration wants to reform the Endangered Species Act to
make it harder to add to the list and easier to remove species from
it. It also wants to make it harder to set aside ``critical habitat''
-- in effect, wildlife sanctuaries covering millions of acres where
commercial and industrial development is restricted.
</P>
<P>
Even if the Yellowstone grizzlies are delisted, federal and state
officials point out that protections will remain in place on more than
9,200 square miles of the grizzlies' core habitat in the parks and
adjacent federal lands. But about 2 million acres of federal and
private land where about one-third of the bears are believed to live
will be more open to logging, recreation and development.
</P>
<P>
That concerns Louisa Willcox, who heads the Montana-based Wild Bear
Project for the Natural Resources Defense Council. The new plans don't
allow for a fallback when food sources in bear habitat diminish or
change, said Wilcox who has worked for conservation causes in Wyoming
and Montana for more than 20 years.

</P>
<P>
In the 19th century, an estimated 50,000 grizzlies roamed across
one-third of the Continental United States. Now, an estimated 1,200
bears occupy 2 percent of their original land base.
</P>
<P>
Wandering grizzlies can terrorize rural neighborhoods, chew up a
rancher's calves and occasionally maul people. In Yellowstone Park,
about 30 people have been injured and two killed in bear attacks since
1975.
</P>
<P>
Much has changed in the mountains and forested valleys of the
Yellowstone region since the bears were placed on the endangered
species. Some counties bordering the park have grown by nearly 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Traditional conflicts between bears and livestock are compounded by
exurban sprawl creeping up open valleys across the intermountain West.
Today, when a grizzly fords a stream to forage, it can find itself
confronted with an obstacle course of swing sets and patio furniture. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
The burgeoning ranchettes outside of Cody along the North and South
Fork of the Shoshone River are in prime bear habitat. One, a high-end
development of about 150 homes, will be the county's first gated
community.
</P>
<P>
Charles Preston, the curator of Cody's Buffalo Bill Historic
Center, is developing educational programs that teach about bear-human
conflicts. Preston, an ornithologist, says folks here are not quite at
the ``torch and pitchfork stage'' in response to the grizzly, but
there is concern.
</P>
<P>
''We happen to live in the last great place. It's a cliche, but its
true,`` he said. ''The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is the last
intact predator ecosystem in the world, with the full complement of
wildlife that existed at the time of Christopher Columbus. It's a
vignette of pristine America.''
</P>
<P>
Preston envisions a program that helps residents to embrace the
region and all of its wildlife, enough to be moved to protect it.
</P>
<P>
It will be a tough sell in some places, especially in counties
where the bears have been scarce until recent years.
</P>
<P>
Last month, commissioners in Fremont County, southeast of
Yellowstone declared the bears ``socially unacceptable.'' In all, four
Wyoming county commissions have passed anti-grizzly resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Servheen of the Fish and Wildlife Service who is a strong advocate
of delisting the Yellowstone grizzlies dismissed the resolutions as
''colorful but meaningless,`` saying that ''a majority of people want
bears around.``
</P>
<P>
But Wilcox pointed out that in Wyoming county resolutions have the
force of law and could trigger a rash of grizzly killings once the
federal government has ceded authority over the animals to the states.
</P>
<P>
Before delisting can occur, state and federal agencies in Wyoming,
Montana and Idaho must establish bear management plans. While the
plans are in various stages of development, the states are expected to
authorize grizzly hunting for the fist time in decades, although it
would not be allowed in the national parks.
</P>
<P>
Even with the strict protections now afforded by the Endangered
Species Act, grizzlies can be destroyed if they kill domestic
livestock or make a nuisance of themselves in areas where people live.
Bears also have died after being shot by hunters claiming self-defense
or saying they mistook a grizzly for a black bear.
</P>
<P>
Some experts make the case that legal hunting will bolster support
for the grizzlies' survival.
</P>
<P>
''In some ways I see hunting of grizzly bears in the future as
positive tool,`` said Kim Barber, the U.S. Forest Service's grizzly
bear and wolf coordinator for the Rocky Mountain region. ''The only
way the bear is going to survive in the Yellowstone Ecosystem is to
have public support for it. Hunting will help.``
</P>
<P>
But Chuck Neal, an ecologist and bear expert retired from the U.S.
Bureau of Land Management in Wyoming, said an anti-bear hysteria
drives the hunting discussion He's particularly concerned that state
and local officials -- susceptible to citizen pressure -- will
establish bear management plans that permit bear killing in a broad
array of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
''They are the kind of people whose idea of wildlife management is
to kill anything that looks at them crossways. It's a 19th-century
approach,`` Neal said. ''I don't support state control of the grizz. I
fear bears are headed into a wall of lead.``
