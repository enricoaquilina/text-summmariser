Who's killing the great bears of Montana?
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one grizzlies have been illegally killed here in northwest
Montana in the past two years, a record pace for poaching since the
bears were listed 30 years ago as threatened under the Endangered
Species Act, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
The rising death toll alarms federal law enforcement officials, as
well as government biologists supervising the otherwise successful
comeback of the big bears. And it comes at a delicate moment in the
politics of environmentalism, with the Bush administration poised,
despite the objections of many conservation groups, to remove
grizzlies farther south in Yellowstone National Park from the
endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
The spike in grizzly killing is concentrated here in a rapidly
growing, spectacularly scenic but culturally disjointed corner of the
West. Affluent outsiders have overrun Flathead County in the past 15
years, fueling 37 percent population growth and creating a
service-based economy that needs grizzlies as toothsome symbols of an
eco-friendly western lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
Some longtime residents, though, are seething over a decades-long
regional decline in logging and mining. They see protection of the
bears as part of a loathsome New World Order that is closing roads in
federal forests and marginalizing their lives.
</P>
<P>
``The government's doggedness in protecting the grizzlies has
brought on tremendous polarization and anger in our community,'' said
Fred Hodgeboom, president of Montanans for Multiple Use, a local group
that advocates increased logging, mining and grazing on federal land.
</P>
<P>
As for who is killing the grizzlies, investigators say they are
making little or no progress in their search for suspects or
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason, they say, is the hugeness and remoteness of the
crime scene, which is nearly the size of Switzerland and just as
mountainous. The grizzly bear recovery zone in what is called the
Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem now covers 8 million acres. It
has expanded from 6 million acres in the 1980s as the comeback of the
grizzlies, estimated at between 500 and 800 bears, has gained
momentum. Grizzlies now frequent areas where they had not been seen
for at least two decades.
</P>
<P>
Lack of investigative traction is also the result of widespread
local animosity toward the Endangered Species Act, said Dominic
Domenici, resident agent in charge of law enforcement for Fish and
Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
``It makes people who have information on the kills not want to
come forward,'' Domenici said. ``Sentiment against the bears and the
government is the biggest handicap to investigation.''
</P>
<P>
To coax local residents to provide leads, Fish and Wildlife is
about to offer rewards of between $1,000 and $5,000 for information
leading to successful prosecution of individuals who illegally kill
grizzlies, Domenici said, but the service has not yet decided on a
reward amount. Knowingly killing a grizzly is a federal misdemeanor
punishable by as much as six months in jail and a $25,000 fine, as
well as restitution payments as high as $15,000.
</P>
<P>
The human context for the recent jump in illegal grizzly kills (11
so far this year and 10 last year, after 13 years during which the
poaching number averaged about three) is one of head-spinning
demographic, economic and cultural change.
</P>
<P>
Flathead County is part of a slice of western Montana that is
rapidly getting richer, better educated and more crowded, even as it
turns away from the state's traditional reliance on resource
extraction industries.
</P>
<P>
Retirement money and revenue from stock investments now dwarfs, by
more than 3 to 1, the combined earnings of timber, mining, farming and
oil drilling, according to a recent study. More people live here
because they want to look at the scenery or play in the out-of-doors --
not because they want to work out there.
</P>
<P>
Cultural incongruities abound. Rich newcomers build palatial homes
on steep mountain slopes (many in areas thick with grizzlies),
frequent organic dry cleaners and insist on fresh seafood at pricey
restaurants. But the Flathead Valley also incubates far right-wing
militants, many of whom are angry about how this once-remote corner of
Montana has tarted itself up as part of the New West, while leaving
them behind.
</P>
<P>
A large weapons cache was found near here three years ago, property
of a citizen's militia group called Project 7. It plotted, rather
feebly, to assassinate local officials and then go to war with the
National Guard and NATO. A leader of the group, David Burgert, a
former snowmobile salesman now in prison, was a sometime caller to
Z-600 talk radio, a Kalispell station owned by John Stokes.
</P>
<P>
Stokes presides over a splenetic midday show in which he and his
callers rail against Mexican immigrants, socialism and the sins of the
federal government. In an interview about the recent rise in bear
killings, Stokes said that his listeners certainly are not
anti-grizzly, but they are justifiably furious about bear-protection
rules that for years have closed roads in federal forests.
</P>
<P>
``The idea that they are endangered or there is a shortage of them
is a crock,'' said Stokes, who added that he and many of his listeners
``enjoy watching grizzles'' and that he has never heard talk about
harming them. As for the feds, Stokes said, that is a different story.
</P>
<P>
``To say that there is a local agenda against bears is to be
paranoid,'' Stokes said, while quickly adding that federal law
enforcement officials ``have good reason to be paranoid because nobody
likes them around here anyway, and it is their own doing.''
</P>
<P>
The federal official most alarmed about the recent spike in illegal
bear killings is Chris Servheen, grizzly-bear recovery coordinator for
Fish and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Servheen, who has been supervising the comeback of the bears for 25
years, said there is a strong possibility that the actual number of
illegal kills in the past two years is significantly higher than what
game wardens have been able to count.
</P>
<P>
``It is easy to kill and leave them, and the bodies are never
found,'' he said. ``It doesn't take very many people who want to kill
bears to really make a big difference.''
