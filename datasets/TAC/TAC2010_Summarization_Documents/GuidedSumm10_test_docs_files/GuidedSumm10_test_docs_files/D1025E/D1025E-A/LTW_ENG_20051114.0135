The Bush administration on Tuesday is to take the
first step toward removing Yellowstone's grizzly bears, a living icon
of the American West, from the nation's endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to de-list grizzly bears in the area surrounding
Yellowstone National Park, which has alarmed some environmentalists,
highlights the contrasting views of the 32-year-old Endangered Species
Act. Proponents of the government's move say the grizzly's recovery
marks a rare victory for the controversial law; others say the
decision may undermine protections for a still-vulnerable group of
animals.
</P>
<P>
If the administration goes ahead with dropping the bears' current
``threatened'' status -- a move that would not take place until the end
of 2006 at the earliest -- officials in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming
would be free to allow limited hunting of grizzlies and would not have
to maintain the same level of protection on the grizzlies' habitat.
The government would continue to monitor how state and federal
authorities manage the land where the bears live to ensure their
survival.
</P>
<P>
Craig Manson, assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks
at the Interior Department, said the agency considers Yellowstone's
grizzly population, which has rebounded from a low of roughly 200 in
1982 to more than 600 today, ``recovered.'' He added that federal
biologists have informed him ``adequate habitat and adequate habitat
protections are in place'' for the bears.
</P>
<P>
``We know more about this population of grizzly bears than any
population of grizzly bears anywhere,'' Manson said, adding the
department will monitor the animals' health for five years after they
come off the list. ``We're going to have an excellent picture of the
health of this population well into the future.''
</P>
<P>
But Louisa Wilcox, who directs the Natural Resources Defense
Council's wild bears project, said de-listing would jeopardize the
grizzlies' critical habitat. The bears range over nearly 9 million
acres in and around the national park, she said, but the
administration's proposal only covers a six million-acre habitat.
</P>
<P>
``We would love to see the grizzly bear de-listed, but it's not
ready,'' Wilcox said, adding that one-third of the bears' current
habitat could be opened to drilling, logging and human development.
``If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to
protect the habitat they need. This plan doesn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
The public will have 90 days to comment on the proposal. If the
administration goes ahead with taking Yellowstone's grizzlies off the
list, it will become the 18th endangered species to recover under the
Endangered Species Act. Nine endangered species have gone extinct, and
the government has de-listed 13 species that were listed erroneously.
</P>
<P>
Yellowstone boasts the largest grizzly population in the lower 48
states, though a few smaller groups live in areas such as the Northern
Continental Divide Ecosystem near Canada, Montana's Cabinet Yaak
wilderness and Idaho's Selkirk Mountains. Grizzlies are thriving in
Alaska, where more than 30,000 of them live.
</P>
<P>
No one questions that Yellowstone's grizzlies have rebounded over
the past three decades since they were listed -- the population has
been growing at a rate of 4 to 7 percent a year for several years -- in
part because state and federal officials abolished trash dumps that
used to lure bears and bring them into dangerous contact with humans.
</P>
<P>
But the recent revival has also sparked conflict with nearby
residents as the bears venture out of the national park. Dominic
Domenici, the Fish and Wildlife Service resident agent in charge of
enforcement for Montana and Wyoming, said there ``are more conflicts
now between elk hunters and bears,'' in part because the whitebark
pine seeds grizzlies need are in shorter supply now due to a beetle
infestation induced by warming climate.
</P>
<P>
Some environmentalists say the decline of whitebark pine is yet
another reason why the grizzlies should remain listed as threatened,
since the seeds are closely linked to female bears' fecundity.
</P>
<P>
But National Wildlife Federation senior wildlife biologist Sterling
Miller, who spent 21 years studying grizzlies in Alaska, said the time
has come to take Yellowstone's bears off the list.
</P>
<P>
``You can't immunize them against everything bad that can possibly
happen,'' Miller said. ``That's a prescription for a permanent
listing.''
</P>
<P>
John Emmerich, assistant wildlife division chief at Wyoming's Game
and Fish Department, said environmentalists aren't showing enough
faith in state officials who have spent years and millions of dollars
helping promote the bears' recovery. While the state plans to allow
hunting ``as a management tool,'' he added, officials would ensure it
does not hurt the grizzly population, and hunting would not begin for
at least a year.
</P>
<P>
``People will see in time the states will do a good job with
de-listing the grizzly bears,'' Emmerich said. ``We're one of the
primary reasons we've got a recovered population.''
