Environmental Groups Split Over Yellowstone's Grizzlies

As the Bush administration prepares to remove
Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list, a schism
has emerged in the environmental movement over whether the bears
remain at risk.
</P>
<P>
The nation's largest environmental group, the National Wildlife
Federation, supports delisting the bears, whose numbers have bounced
back impressively after three decades of federal protection.
</P>
<P>
But other powerful organizations, including the Sierra Club, the
Natural Resources Defense Council and Earthjustice, are threatening to
sue the Bush administration if, as expected, it removes Yellowstone
grizzlies from the list.
</P>
<P>
``The recovery has been a huge success, but removing federal
protection now is too risky,'' said Heidi Godwin, regional
representative for the Sierra Club in Montana. ``You don't go from
emergency room to the parking lot. The bears still need intensive
care.''
</P>
<P>
The National Wildlife Federation, though, says it is time for
environmentalists to rethink how to manage Yellowstone's grizzlies --
both as a matter of science and as a political tactic in an era of
Republican rule.
</P>
<P>
``We think we should embrace success when it happens,'' said
Sterling D. Miller, a grizzly bear specialist and senior wildlife
biologist here in the federation's Northern Rockies office. ``If we
don't, we play right into the hands of the people who are trying to
kill the Endangered Species Act by reforming it.''
</P>
<P>
A draft proposal to take the grizzlies off the endangered species
list went out this summer from field offices of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service in Montana to Interior Department headquarters, said
Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery coordinator for Fish and
Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials at Interior are reviewing the plan, Servheen said.
</P>
<P>
The delisting plan reaches Washington as the White House,
Republicans in Congress, land rights groups and many industry
lobbyists are pressing to limit the scope and power of the Endangered
Species Act, which was enacted in 1973 and which many conservatives
scorn as costly, clumsy and ineffective.
</P>
<P>
Given this political reality, officials from the National Wildlife
Federation say they have concluded that the long effort to rescue
grizzlies in and around Yellowstone National Park should be publicized
for what it is: a resounding success and a perfect example of how the
Endangered Species Act can work.
</P>
<P>
When grizzlies were listed as threatened in 1975, there were about
200 to 250 of them in the Yellowstone area. Now their population is
estimated to be about 600, and growing about 4 to 7 percent a year,
according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
``The public should understand that the Endangered Species Act is
not an overnight cure,'' said Thomas M. France, director and counsel
for the federation's Northern Rockies office. ``But you will have
success when there is proper funding and real cooperation. What has
happened with the grizzlies is a model for how to take an animal off
the list.''
</P>
<P>
France said Montana, Wyoming and Idaho -- working with federal
agencies -- are well prepared to guarantee the long-term health of
Yellowstone's grizzlies. The plan for delisting does not apply to
other clusters of grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
If the Yellowstone grizzlies are delisted, Servheen said a Forest
Service protection plan in six national forests that surround the
national park would sharply limit road building, camping, and oil and
gas exploration, while retiring existing leases for livestock grazing.
</P>
<P>
The grizzlies would continue to be monitored by federal scientists,
with 10 percent of the bears always wearing radio collars. ``They
would be fairly intensively taken care of from now on,'' Servheen
said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from several environmental organizations, however, said
they do not trust the White House to follow through.
</P>
<P>
``The Bush administration has tried to gut forest management plans,
and yet the primary enforcement mechanism for protecting these bears
is through forest plans,'' said Douglas Honnold, managing attorney for
the Northern Rockies office of Earthjustice.
</P>
<P>
He said Yellowstone grizzlies represent a relatively small genetic
pool. Until separated clusters of grizzlies can be reconnected through
land corridors, Honnold said, it is much too early to delist them.
