YELLOWSTONE GRIZZLY, ONCE ENDANGERED, NOW RECOVERED

<P>
The Yellowstone grizzly bear, one of the first
and most controversial animals to be protected by the Endangered
Species Act, is fully recovered, and it is time to
remove the stringent safeguards it has had for nearly three
decades, federal officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of bears has gone from a low of between
200 and 300 in the 1970s to more than 600
in the wild landscape that has Yellowstone National Park at
its core.
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very long process," Interior Secretary Gale A.
Norton said after the department announced it would publish a
proposed delisting of the animal in the Federal Register on
Thursday. "People involved in the effort felt strongly the time
had come to acknowledge recovery of the bear."
</P>
<P>
The Interior Department plans to issue a decision after a 90-day
public comment period. If delisting occurs, it will probably happen
no sooner than mid- to late 2006, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The job of managing an unlisted bear would fall to state
wildlife agencies and the Park Service. It is considered likely
that the states would allow the animal to be hunted,
but in terms of management, Norton said, "the reality is
there's very little change. "
</P>
<P>
Federal grizzly bear biologists in Montana say that years of research
shows that the bear population around Yellowstone is robust and
recovered.
</P>
<P>
"It's probably one of the most studied mammals in the world,"
said Chuck Schwartz, head of the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study
Team, in Bozeman, Mont., which has primary responsibility for studying
the Yellowstone bear.
</P>
<P>
Conservation groups are divided. The delisting is supported by the National
Wildlife Federation, the nation's largest conservation group. "We have reached
all of the recovery targets and exceeded them for a
number of years," said Thomas M. France, head of the
organization's Northern Rockies office, in Missoula, Mont.
</P>
<P>
One of the main goals in the recovery plan required that
there be a minimum of 15 sows, or female bears,
with cubs each year to assure successful reproduction. "We're now
seeing more than 40 sows with cubs," France said.
</P>
<P>
Other conservation groups, however, including the Sierra Club and the Natural
Resources Defense Council, oppose delisting. While the number of bears
is healthy, they say, some of the bears' critical food
sources, like the white bark pine nut, are in steep
decline, which could force the bear to leave the park
in search of food.
</P>
<P>
And removing protection, they say, would not allow the federal Fish
and Wildlife Service to halt development in a crucial grizzly
habitat.
</P>
<P>
"If you don't protect the habitat, it doesn't matter how many
bears you have -- you'll lose them," said Lance F.
Craighead, executive director of the Craighead Environmental Research Institute, in
Bozeman, who maps grizzly bear habitat.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, the Yellowstone bears were hurt by habitat loss.
But they were driven to the brink of extinction when
the National Park Service closed garbage dumps where bears fed.
Bears that refused to return to a natural regimen were
shot, and from 1969 to 1971, the Park Service killed
more than 200 bears, reducing them to perilously low levels
and resulting in their listing as a threatened species.
</P>
<P>
The only other large population of grizzlies in the United States
is in and around Glacier National Park. Small populations of
bears live in the Selkirk Mountains of Idaho, the Cabinet
Mountains of Montana and the Cascades of northwest Washington.
