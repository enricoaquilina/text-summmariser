Canada unveil huge park to protect grizzlies, salmon, wolves
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VANCOUVER, British Columbia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canada unveiled a 16-million acre (6.5 hectare) preserve, including parkland
teeming with grizzly bears, wolves and wild salmon in the ancestral home of many
native tribes.
</P>
<P>
Closing another chapter of the wars between environmentalists and loggers, the
Great Bear Rainforest is the result of an accord between governments, aboriginal
First Nations, the logging industry and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
It will stretch 250 miles (402 kilometers) along British Columbia's rugged
Pacific coastline _ the ancestral home of groups whose cultures date back
thousands of years. The area also sustains a rare white bear found only in
British Columbia. First Nations _ as native Indians are called in Canada _
believe their creator, the Raven, created the white bear as a reminder of the
last ice age.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement on these areas represents an unprecedented collaboration between
First Nations, industry, local governments and many other stakeholders in how we
manage the vast richness of B.C.'s coast for the benefit of all British
Columbians," said Premier Gordon Campbell, who was accompanied by native dancers
and drummers for the announcement and formal First Nations blessing.
</P>
<P>
"The result is a strong marriage that balances the needs of the environment with
the need for sustainable jobs and a strong economic future for coastal
communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said 4.4 million acres (1.8 hectares) would be protected outright and
managed as parkland, with another 11.6 million (4.7 hectares) run under an
ecosystem management plan to ensure sustainable forestry with minimal impact on
the environment.
</P>
<P>
The new preserve dwarfs the famed 2.2-million-acre (890,327-hectare) Yellowstone
National Park in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Full implementation of the project is not expected until 2009.
</P>
<P>
British Columbia's lush evergreen forests have been the scene of decades of
confrontation between environmentalists and loggers. Successful boycott
campaigns in the 1990s led to large international companies turning away from
British Columbia paper and wood products, forcing the government to find a
negotiated solution.
</P>
<P>
"British Columbians are showing that it is possible to protect the environment
and provide the economic foundation for healthy communities," said Lisa
Matthaus, coast campaign co-ordinator for the Sierra Club of Canada's British
Columbia chapter. "This innovative rainforest agreement provides a real world
example of how people and wilderness can prosper together."
</P>
<P>
The region is home to hundreds of species, including grizzlies, black bears, the
so-called spirit bear, wolves, cougars, mountain goats, moose and deer. The
spirit bear is a rare white species and is also called the kermode
bear.
</P>
<P>
A central component of the Great Bear Rainforest project will be a $104 million
(euro86.9 million) conservation financing package to support the land-use
agreements.
</P>
<P>
To date, Greenpeace Canada, the Sierra Club of Canada and ForestEthics, the
Nature Conservancy, Tides Canada Foundation and several private U.S. and
Canadian foundations have raised $52 million (euro43.4 million) to help
establish the financing package.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has committed $26 million and project partners are
working to secure the rest from Canada's federal government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the 25 aboriginal groups involved in the project, Art
Sterritt of the North Coast First Nations said the agreement would allow for
controlled use of the land and let natives continue their traditional
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't an easy job," he said. "Everyone had to make compromises here and
there."
