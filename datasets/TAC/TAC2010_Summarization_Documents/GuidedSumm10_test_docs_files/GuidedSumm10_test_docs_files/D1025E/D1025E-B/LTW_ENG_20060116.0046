Grizzlies Near Yellowstone May Lose Some Protection
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Federal officials have begun the process of removing
grizzly bears around Yellowstone National Park from the Endangered
Species List, ending 30 years of protection and shifting
responsibility for their management to state officials who may allow
hunting.
</P>
<P>
Seen as a major conservation success story, the Yellowstone
population of grizzlies has increased about fourfold, from 150 to
nearly 600 since going on the endangered list in 1975 and continues to
grow at an annual rate of 4 percent to 6 percent, according to the
U.S. Department of Interior.
</P>
<P>
The federal ``delisting'' plan unveiled here last week calls for
maintaining the existing level of protection for bears within a 9,200
square mile area in and around Yellowstone and Grand Teton national
parks.
</P>
<P>
But special protections will be dropped outside that loose ring of
federal land. Beyond it, where many grizzlies wander and 10 percent to
30 percent of them live, bear habitat will be open to road building,
logging, recreation and development. Under the delisting plans, state
officials in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho will take over management of
the bears and may allow hunting outside the protected areas.
</P>
<P>
The new management plan, which is undergoing final revisions, could
go into effect by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Although conservationists agree that the bears have rebounded, many
say that the decision to strip protections comes at an inauspicious
time for grizzlies. Two of their major food sources -- cutthroat trout
and seeds from white bark pine trees -- are themselves in a steep
decline. And steady population growth is causing new homes and roads
to be built deeper into the bears' habitat.
</P>
<P>
``I think delisting is unwise,'' said Idaho-based grizzly
researcher Troy Merrill with the LTB Institute of Landscape Ecology.
``Food sources are drying up at a faster rate than anticipated. The
picture on habitat is much grimmer. Any bears that get too far away
from Yellowstone will be eliminated. There will be no opportunity for
genetic connectivity (with other grizzly populations) or to spread
into central Idaho, the best quality habitat south of Alaska. The
grizzlies will basically be locked into an open air zoo.''
</P>
<P>
Opponents of delisting also say they fear placing the fate of the
Yellowstone grizzlies in the hands of states where there is pronounced
hostility toward the bears. In Wyoming, for example, a handful of
county commissions have passed resolutions that assert the right of
local officials to shoot grizzlies on sight. In Montana, hunting of
grizzlies was allowed near Glacier National park until 1991.
</P>
<P>
At least one conservation group, the National Wildlife Federation,
heralds delisting as a success story. Sterling Miller, a biologist
with the group, said that since the required population levels have
been met, there's no reason not to delist.
</P>
<P>
``It seems appropriate to us, rather than moving the goalposts in
the last minute of the game, it's appropriate to proceed with the
delisting, absent compelling reason not to,'' Miller said, adding that
he believed states were well equipped to safeguard wildlife.
</P>
<P>
The Yellowstone grizzly population is the largest of five remnant
groups in the lower 48 states. The others are in northern Montana, and
parts of Idaho and Washington and will remain on the endangered list.
The largest grizzly population lives in Alaska and is not endangered.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of grizzlies once roamed across one-third of the
continental United States, but a 19th century campaign of slaughter
and contemporary patterns of growth and development have reduced both
the bear population and habitat crucial for the animal's existence.
</P>
<P>
Today, less than 1 percent of the former population of grizzlies
remain, occupying less than 2 percent of their original land base in
the lower 48.
</P>
<P>
Despite the protection afforded by the Endangered Species Act,
bears die every year from a variety of causes, but the vast majority
of deaths came from interaction with humans. In 2004, 19 grizzly
deaths were recorded in the region, the highest bear mortality in 15
years.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said bears would continue to be closely
monitored, pointing out that the post-delisting guidelines require a
scientific review should the bear population drop below 500, or if
there is a significant loss of habitat. If threats to the grizzly are
deemed severe and immediate, the bears can be re-listed at any time,
officials say, although that has never happened.
</P>
<P>
Since the Endangered Species Act became law in 1973, only 40 plants
and animals have been removed from the list--nine because of
extinction.
</P>
<P>
Grizzly bears have long been among the most popular tourist
attractions in Yellowstone Park. But in surrounding communities, where
the bears are often regarded as a menace, people have applauded the
delisting decision.

Tom Bales, a rancher outside of Cody, recalled an early morning in
1999 when his daughter came screaming into the house. Grizzlies had
killed three of the girl's 4H club sheep.
</P>
<P>
``That was an eye-opener,'' said Bales, a supporter of delisting,
at a public hearing last Tuesday where federal wildlife officials
formally unveiled the delisting plan.
</P>
<P>
The hearing, hosted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the
Cody Auditorium about 50 miles east of Yellowstone Park, kicked off a
public comment period that will last until Feb. 15th.

Chris Servheen, the grizzly bear recovery coordinator for the Fish
and Wildlife Service, said his agency has received more than 60,000
comments on the grizzly delisting plan. All comments, no matter where
they come from, will be equally weighed, he said.
</P>
<P>
``You know how they say all politics is local? All (wildlife)
recovery is local,'' Servheen said. ``You have to involve local people
in the decision. It can't be handed down from afar on gold tablets.
They have to be owners of the process.''
