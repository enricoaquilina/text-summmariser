SCIENTISTS OPPOSE DELISTING PARK'S GRIZZLIES

A group of 269 biologists and other scientists
from around the country asked the Fish and Wildlife Service
on Monday not to lift the protections given to the
Yellowstone grizzly bear by the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
Doing that, they said, could jeopardize its survival.
</P>
<P>
A letter from the scientists came on the last day of
the comment period on the agency's plan to remove protection
for the bear. The service has said that the bear
population, estimated at 500 to 600, is fully recovered and
growing at 4 percent a year. There are safeguards to
restore protection, federal biologists say, if the numbers decline.
</P>
<P>
Some environmental groups, including the National Wildlife Federation, support the move
to remove the bear from the endangered list.
</P>
<P>
The letter from opponents of the move says the Yellowstone grizzly
is cut off from other bears, and therefore new sources
of DNA. Because of that, the population needs to be
2,000 to 3,000, the scientists say, to survive a catastrophic
event, like disease or the loss of a critical food
source.
</P>
<P>
"The Yellowstone grizzly bear population faces significant threats to recovery because
of its small size, significant annual fluctuations in mortality rates,
inadequate habitat protections, major threats to key foods, genetic risks,
and proposed additional human-caused bear mortalities," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Signers of the letter included Jane Goodall, the primate expert; John
Craighead, a long time grizzly bear biologist; and Michael Soule,
a biologist and leading advocate for protection of biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
The Yellowstone grizzly bear has gone from a low of 200
or so bears in the 1970s to its present level
of around 600.
</P>
<P>
The Fish and Wildlife Service expects to make a decision on
removing the grizzly bear from the list sometime this year.
