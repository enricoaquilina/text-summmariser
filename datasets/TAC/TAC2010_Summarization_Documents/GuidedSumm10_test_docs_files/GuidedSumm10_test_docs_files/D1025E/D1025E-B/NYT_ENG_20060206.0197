CANADA TO SHIELD FIVE MILLION FOREST ACRES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
HARTLEY BAY, British Columbia
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this sodden land of glacier-cut
fjords and giant moss-draped cedars, a myth is told by
the Gitga'at people to explain the presence of black bears
with a rare recessive gene that makes them white as
snow.
</P>
<P>
The Raven deity swooped down on the land at the end
of an ice age and decided that one out of
every 10 black bears born from that moment on would
be bleached as "spirit bears." It was to be a
reminder to future generations that the world must be kept
pristine.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, an improbable assemblage of officials from the provincial government,
coastal Native Canadian nations, logging companies, and environmental groups will
announce an agreement that they say will accomplish that mission
in the home of the spirit bear, an area that
is also the world's largest remaining intact temperate coastal rain
forest.
</P>
<P>
A wilderness of close to 5 million acres, almost the size
of New Jersey, in what is commonly called the Great
Bear Rain Forest or the Amazon of the North will
be kept off limits to loggers in an agreement that
the disparate parties describe as a crossroads in their relations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement comes after more than a decade of talks, international
boycott campaigns against Great Bear wood products, and sit-ins in
the forests by Native Canadians and environmentalists, who chained themselves
to logging equipment.
</P>
<P>
The process has already inspired similar efforts to save the Canadian
boreal forest, to the north, and suggestions that the agreement
could be a model for preservation in the Amazon and
other threatened forests.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say the agreement should preserve not only the few hundred
spirit bears and other black bears, but also one of
the highest concentrations of grizzly bears in North America as
well as unique subspecies of goshawks, coastal wolves, Sitka black-tail
deer, and mountain goats.
</P>
<P>
"It's like a revolution," said Merran Smith, director of the British
Columbia Coastal Program of Forest Ethics, an environmental group. "It's
a new way of thinking about how you do forestry.
It's about approaching business with a conservation motive up front,
instead of an industrial approach to the forest."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the loggers will be guaranteed a right to
work in 10 million acres of the forest, which some
environmentalists criticize. But they will be obliged to cut selectively:
away from critical watersheds, bear dens, and fish spawning grounds,
negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
"There's a new era dawning in British Columbia," said Gordon Campbell,
the province's premier. "You have to establish what you value,
and work together. This collaboration is something we have to
take into the future and it is something the world
can learn from."
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
As a sign of new Native power gained in recent court
cases, many areas that will be preserved or selectively logged
have been chosen based on the oral tradition of Native
groups and the opinions of their elders. These include areas
with cultural significance like ancient cemeteries, or areas that contain
medicinal herbs and cedars big enough to make totem poles,
canoes, and long houses.
</P>
<P>
If the federal government agrees, more than $100 million will also
be raised by governments and foundations to start ecotourism lodges,
shellfish aquaculture, and other environmentally sustainable economic activities for the
25,000 people who live in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Now we can manage our destiny," said Ross Wilson, chairman of
the tribal council of the Heiltsuk, one of the Native
nations involved. "Without this agreement, we would be going to
court forever and we would have to put our children
and old ladies dressed in button blankets in the way
of the chainsaws," he added, referring to the ceremonial dress
worn in past protests.
</P>
<P>
Among the supporters of the agreement are some of the biggest
players in Canadian lumber and paper, including Western Forest Products,
Interfor, and Canfor.
</P>
<P>
"It's a cultural shift," said Shawn Kenmuir, an area manager for
Triumph Timber, which has already forsaken old clear-cut practices and
begun consulting with the Gitga'at before cutting on their traditional
lands. "We've started the transition from entitlement to collaboration."
</P>
<P>
The forest represents a quarter of what remains of coastal temperate
rain forests in the world.
</P>
<P>
Because 15 feet of rain can fall in a year, the
Great Bear has never suffered a major forest fire. That
has allowed some of the tallest and oldest trees on
Earth to thrive, including cedars more than a thousand years
old.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 20 percent of the world's remaining wild salmon swim
through the forest's fjords, including coho and sockeye, whose spawning
grounds were threatened by erosion caused by past logging. Largely
intact because of its remoteness, the forest contains an abundance
of wolverines, bats, peregrine falcons, marbled murrelet sea birds, and
coastal tailed frogs.
</P>
<P>
The ecological richness is immediately apparent to the few people who
visit. Within minutes of a recent helicopter visit to Princess
Royal Island, in the heart of the rain forest, a
group of visitors saw a pack of six grey and
black wolves, a seal, and numerous bald eagles and swans.
</P>
<P>
"Look at the forest move," said Marven Robinson, 36, a Gitga'at
guide, as eagles glided through the moist air and the
wolf pack played hide and seek with the visitors along
a channel of diaphanous water. "As long as there is
a spirit bear, we're going the right way."
</P>
<P>
The efforts to save the rain forest began a decade ago,
as lumber companies that had already cut most of the
old-growth forest around British Columbia, by far Canada's richest forestry
province, began moving into the Great Bear.
</P>
<P>
A deluge of postcards and demonstrations by groups like the Sierra
Club and Greenpeace at shareholder meetings and retail outlets pressed
American, Japanese, and European hardware chains to shun products from
the area.
</P>
<P>
By 1999, when Home Depot announced it would phase out sales
of wood from the Great Bear and other endangered old
forests, some lumber companies were shifting their approach, agreeing to
work with the environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
MacMillan Bloedel, before it was acquired by Weyerhaeuser, broke ranks with
the industry and promised in 1998 to phase out clear
cutting on the British Columbia coast. Other companies gradually fell
into line.
</P>
<P>
"The customer doesn't want products with protesters chained to it," said
Patrick Armstrong, a consultant who served as a negotiator for
the lumber companies. "We're dealing with old-growth forests with charismatic
wildlife."
</P>
<P>
Once Armstrong sat at the opposite side of the bargaining table
from the environmentalists, but now he works closely with them.
"This needs to be celebrated -- it's a big, big
deal," he said. "Everyone had a greater interest in resolving
the problems than continuing the conflict."
