<P>
They are called by many names, but considering how
much the government spends to protect them, their name in Alaska and
some other regions -- king salmon -- seems most apt.
</P>
<P>
In 2004, federal and state governments spent more than $160 million
to preserve that salmon species, commonly known as chinook -- listed by
the federal government as endangered in the early 1990s. And that
doesn't include the millions spent on other kinds of salmon, such as
sockeye, coho and chum.
</P>
<P>
In all, according to a recent report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, the government spent more than $1.4 billion protecting
endangered species in 2004 -- 17 percent more than in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the top 10 list of ``most expensive'' species (salmon
take four spots) are the steelhead, Steller sea lion, bull trout,
red-cockaded woodpecker, pallid sturgeon and right whale.
</P>
<P>
The wildlife service report provided expenditures for nearly all of
the 1,340 endangered species. Mammals accounted for $122 million;
birds, $103 million; reptiles, $42 million; amphibians, $8 million;
fish, $475 million; insects, $7.5 million; and flowering plants, $21
million.
</P>
<P>
The report, which regularly invites controversy, provides
information to Congress so lawmakers can make decisions on
conservation spending, according to the service.
</P>
<P>
Species that tallied more than $1 million in protection spending
come from all over the animal kingdom. Some are well known: the
grizzly bear, $7.7 million; Mexican spotted owl, $5.3 million; gray
bat, $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Others are more obscure, such as the West Indian manatee ($9.9
million) and razorback sucker ($7.5 million). No species of snail gets
more than $1 million on its own, but together, the 32 species of snail
brought in well over $2 million.
</P>
<P>
Some endangered species receive little or no protection spending.
Nothing was spent on the Caribbean monk seal, while the St. Croix
ground lizard tallied $500 and the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle nearly
$11,000.
</P>
<P>
After hatching, chinook salmon spend several years roaming hundreds
of miles in the Pacific Ocean, growing in size in preparation for
their return to freshwater to spawn and die.
</P>
<P>
David Patte, a Fish and Wildlife Service official in Portland,
Ore., says chinook salmon have ``quite a unique life in the history of
conservation biology.'' Protecting them involves law enforcement and
large civil construction projects to allow salmon to travel freely
though dams and hydroelectric structures. ``It's quite an
undertaking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Conserving the gray wolf, which cost more than $5 million in 2004,
is easier, according to Ed Bangs, a Helena, Mont., specialist in wolf
recovery for the wildlife agency. It mostly involves tagging the
wolves with radio devices or tracking them from the air and making
sure they don't attack livestock.
