EDITORIAL: AS SPECIES RECOVER, SAFEGUARDS ARE AT RISK

In proposing to lift endangered-species protections from bald
eagles and some grizzly bears, the Bush administration is heralding
two triumphs of resilience and recovery. Fair enough, up to
a point.
</P>
<P>
We're happy to join the applause for these two icons of
American wildlife. But the stories of their restoration also raise
serious questions about the future, not only of these creatures
but of species protection in general.
</P>
<P>
By the numbers, bald eagles have been ready to fly free
of Endangered Species Act listing since at least 1999. Thanks
to ESA and other federal laws, the eagle population in
the lower 48 states has grown from about 400 nesting
pairs in the early 1960s to more than 7,000 pairs
today. But the Clinton administration's "de-listing" proposal spotlighted disagreements over
eagle safeguards in two other federal laws, which will continue
to protect these birds but not necessarily their habitat.
</P>
<P>
For example, developers wanted to know exactly what might "disturb" eagles
sufficiently to offend that provision of the Bald Eagle Protection
Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service responded with guidelines
that are quite precise in warning against activities that would
drive nesting eagles from their homes. But these guidelines are
also voluntary, and that is troubling, considering that habitat loss
-- along with poisoning from DDT and lead shot --
was a major factor in putting bald eagles on the
endangered list.
</P>
<P>
As for the grizzly bears of the Yellowstone region, the numbers
are again impressive: A population that stood at about 200
in 1975 is probably three times that large today. But
these creatures are as fragile collectively as they are fearsome
individually. Their home territory of 9,000 square miles is a
very small island, both geographically and biologically. It subjects them
to the stresses of unstable food supplies -- two dietary
staples, cutthroat trout and white bark pine seeds, are already
in decline -- and also to the risks of inbreeding
and disease.
</P>
<P>
Taking the Yellowstone-area grizzlies off the ESA list as a special
sub-population will expose them to additional dangers. Outside Yellowstone and
Grand Teton National Parks, the bears' habitat stretches over a
patchwork of federal, state and private lands where habitat protection
is balanced -- and often not favorably -- against such
moneymaking uses as logging, mining, grazing and residential development.
</P>
<P>
After de-listing, management questions would be up to state officials in
Montana, Wyoming and Idaho, where ranchers outrank grizzlies in the
political pecking order and, for the most part, resent their
restoration. Continual displacement of the bears is likely, and resumption
of hunting seems a strong possibility.
</P>
<P>
As for the ESA itself, Congress hasn't renewed it since 1993,
and the attacks have only grown sharper in the last
five years of Republican rule. There is room for debate
over the best way to modernize the law, but within
the majority party the argument is chiefly between extremists who
want to gut it and "moderates" who support the Bush
administration preference for simply ignoring it wherever possible.
</P>
<P>
We Americans love our bald eagles and grizzly bears, but our
government's commitment to the bold and noble work of saving
species is more endangered than ever.
