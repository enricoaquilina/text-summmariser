EDITORIAL: ENDANGERING YELLOWSTONE'S GRIZZLIES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Nov.
21:The recovery of the grizzly bear population in the greater
Yellowstone region is a triumph of human restraint. Thirty years
ago, after a long period of mismanagement, the bears were
listed as a threatened species. Now, their numbers have risen
from perhaps as few as 200 to perhaps as many
as 600. That has led the Interior Department to consider
removing them from the endangered species list -- a proposal
that has split the conservation world. The National Wildlife Federation,
for instance, believes that the original goals of protecting the
bears have been met. But other groups -- including the
Natural Resources Defense Council -- believe the bears should still
be protected. We agree.

<P>
If grizzlies are removed from the endangered species list, they will
come under the protection of a management plan developed by
the three states that surround Yellowstone. Given those states' historic
hostility to large predators, the fact that the plan calls
for a resumption of hunting is worrisome. But much more
important is the danger that it might open up a
good deal of the grizzlies' already-diminished range to commercial exploitation.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the grizzlies should remind us all how effective
the Endangered Species Act really is and why it is
worth safeguarding it from legislative assault. But it should also
remind us that there is still no effective legal protection
for animals that have recovered in numbers but are still
threatened by the pressure of human activity.
