 Seven years of talks between 
loggers and environmentalists, amid threats of a boycott of Canadian 
lumber, culminated in a plan to protect a vast natural reserve on 
Canada's Pacific coast, officials announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The accord, disclosed by the British Columbia government, sets 
aside some 1.8 million hectares (4.5 million acres) of temperate 
rainforests along the province's central and northern coast for 
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the most spectacular, ecologically diverse regions in 
the world" will be preserved, including the home of the rare albino 
Spirit Bear, said the province's premier Gordon Campbell in a 
statement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to protect these lands, about half the size of 
Taiwan, from loggers and miners is part of a larger deal to better 
manage 6.4 million hectares (15.8 million acres) of coastal forests 
between Alaska and the northern tip of Vancouver Island.
</P>
<P>
A half dozen forestry companies and a coalition of environmental 
groups, including Forest Ethics, Greenpeace, Sierra Club of Canada, 
agreed on new sustainable logging practices for the region to be 
implemented by 2009.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, indigenous peoples will get more control over 
resources in their traditional lands and receive money from the 
province for economic development.
</P>
<P>
"The result is a strong marriage that balances the needs of the 
environment with the need for sustainable jobs and a strong economic 
future for coastal communities," Premier Gordon Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
The new "adaptive approach" to managing forests and other 
resources in the region requires more detailed planning, innovation 
and flexibility in harvesting trees, said industry sources.
</P>
<P>
However, it will result in more untouched wildlife habitat in 
harvest areas, fewer logging roads built, and less harm to local 
streams and rivers.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a tough process with many stakeholders and many 
tensions along the way," Reynold Hert, president of Western Forest 
Products, said of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"(But) the certainty of knowing where we can operate, the 
certainty of knowing what areas are permanently protected, and the 
certainty for our customers that we will continue to produce forest 
products from the B.C. coast free from the market campaigns of the 
past is important," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a decade ago, environmentalists launched a massive 
campaign in Europe and the United States to boycott Canadian lumber 
cut in the Great Bear Rainforest, named after the mutant white bear 
worshiped by aboriginals and featured in a Hollywood film.
</P>
<P>
In December, environmental groups privately raised 1.35 million 
Canadian dollars (1.17 million US dollars) to purchase a commercial 
hunting license to stop the contentious grizzly bear hunt in the 
area.
</P>
<P>
In lieu of sports hunting, the environmentalists, now suddenly 
owners of one of North America's largest guide outfitters, Bella 
Coola Outfitters Company, told AFP they planned to offer eco-tours, 
arranging travel packages for tourists who want to watch or 
photograph bears and other animals.
</P>
<P>
Wild creatures that live there include carnivores such as the 
grizzly and black bears, the Spirit Bear or Kermode bear, wolves and 
cougars.
</P>
<P>
There are also thousands of hoofed animals, including mountain 
goats, moose and deer.
