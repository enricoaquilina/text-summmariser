Idaho Gov. Nominated as Interior Secretary

<P>
President Bush named Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne as the
new secretary of the interior Thursday, choosing a popular Western
Republican with Washington experience and a disputed environmental
record to oversee the nation's parks and public lands.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed, Kempthorne would succeed Gail Norton, who announced
her resignation this month at a time when her department is tied up in
the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. Kempthorne, 54, a two-term
governor who served in the Senate in the 1990s, presumably should have
little trouble winning the approval of his former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
``Dirk understands that those who live closest to the land know how
to manage it best,'' Bush said as he introduced his nominee to
reporters in the Oval Office late in the day. ``And he will work
closely with state and local leaders to ensure wise stewardship of our
resources.'' Bush said Kempthorne would help ``develop the energy
potential of federal lands and waters in environmentally-sensitive
ways.''
</P>
<P>
But environmental groups immediately assailed the selection,
calling it the latest example of the Bush administration selling out
to development and energy industry interests. Environmentalists
complained that Kempthorne fought to open national forests to logging,
mining and oil and gas drilling and worked to weaken safe water and
endangered species laws.
</P>
<P>
``At a time when these controversial issues need a leader who can
find common ground, the president could not have chosen a more
divisive nominee,'' said Philip Clapp, president of the National
Environmental Trust.
</P>
<P>
The League of Conservation Voters offered a concise, two-sentence
response: ``During his career in Congress, Governor Kempthorne earned
a paltry 1 percent lifetime LCV score. Enough said.''
</P>
<P>
Kempthorne has been a favorite in the Bush White House for years
and was considered at one point three years ago as the likely choice
for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. He may have
cemented his relationship with the president last summer when he and
Bush went bike riding through Idaho trails together. Bush recalled
that day fondly Thursday and noted that Kempthorne married his wife,
Patricia, during a sunrise ceremony atop Idaho's Moscow Mountain.
</P>
<P>
But Kempthorne has also demonstrated independence from the White
House on some issues. Just last month, he led a protest by the
nation's governors against Bush's proposed cuts in Pentagon funding
for the National Guard, calling them ``a formula for disaster.''
</P>
<P>
Kempthorne launched his political career as mayor of Boise and then
won election to the Senate in 1992 before returning home to run for
governor in 1998. His Web site says he has ``worked to develop
consensus on management of Idaho's and the West's natural resources''
and crafted a bipartisan accord with counterparts in Oregon,
Washington and Montana to preserve salmon. It also says he developed
plans to manage wolves and grizzly bears with the goal of removing
them from the list of endangered species and fought to give states the
power to manage land within their borders.
</P>
<P>
Bush's policies may put him in a tough position with some of his
old constituents. ``Is he going to stand with the Bush administration
to sell off land that westerners use to hunt and fish?'' asked Chuck
Oxley of the Idaho Democratic Party. ``If he's going to do that, we'll
oppose him 110 percent.''
</P>
<P>
Kempthorne will face a slew of challenges once he takes over at
Interior, including a shrinking budget and a growing debate over how
to best protect endangered species. The National Park Service is
facing a massive maintenance backlog: a recent Congressional Research
Service report estimated it between $4.5 billion and $9.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
Craig Obey, vice president for government affairs at the National
Parks Conservation Association said he was encouraged by the fact that
as Idaho's governor Kempthorne had lobbied for more money to go into
the state's parks. ``That's something we obviously are hoping will
carry into his efforts in Washington D.C.,'' Obey said.
</P>
<P>
If Kempthorne is confirmed and steps down, Lt. Gov. Jim Risch would
take over. Oxley said Risch has until Friday to file if he wants to
run for the Republican nomination to seek a full term in his own
right.
