<HEADLINE> Attorney General to Summon Soeharto for Third Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JAKARTA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- After failing to examine
Indonesian former President Soeharto on Thursday morning, the
Attorney General's Office admitted to have been fed up by the
former strong man and has decided to summon him again next week.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua Thursday, Director of Corruption
at the Attorney General's Office Chairul Imam said: "We actually
could not accept that Soeharto refuses to appear and we have been
disappointed because he did not show up here to fulfill our second
summoning. But we have decided to summon him again next week."
</P>
<P>
"This evening (Thursday), we will send again a letter to
Soeharto to undergo examination on Monday, next week at 09:00 a.m.
(local time) at the Attorney General's Office," he added.
</P>
<P>
It will be the third summons to him, Imam said, adding the
Attorney General's Office will follow the rule of the country's
crime code under which it stipulates that if a suspect in a crime
case refuses the summon to undergo investigation, the prosecutors
still have opportunity to make the next summon up to three times,
and if the suspect keeps refusing the summoning, they have
authorities to take steps by force to present the suspect.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to reveal what steps will be taken by the
Attorney General's Office, if the 78-year-old strong man fails
again to meet the third summon.
</P>
<P>
"We, of course, already have got plans: A, B and C. But I am
sorry not to tell you about that," the director said.
