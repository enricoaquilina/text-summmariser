<HEADLINE> Soeharto Responsible For Embezzlement Funds: Indonesian Attorney General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General
Andi M. Ghalib said most witnesses in the former president
Soeharto case confirm that Soeharto is responsible for the
embezzlement of foundation funds, and the issuing of the Timor
national car decree.
</P>
<P>
"But we have not yet cross-checked whether Soeharto ordered it,
or the procedure came from lower levels," Ghalib told reporters
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Timor national car project, the government granted
tax breaks to PT Timor Putra Nasional, owned by Soeharto's son
Hutomo 'Tommy' Mandala Putra, to import completely built-up sedans
from South Korean carmaker Kia Motor. The project had caused the
country losses of 1.55 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
During his reign, Soeharto chaired nine charities, which have
been accused of receiving government privileges and facilities as
well as being one of Soeharto's main business vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has handed over the control of seven of the nine
charitable foundations to the government.
</P>
<P>
The Attorney General's Office is questioning some other
officers involved in the decree issue.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib said that the office will not make any careless move to
investigate a corruption case to prevent it from violating human
rights.
</P>
<P>
The investigation for the Soeharto case, he said, will be
finished before the general election in June.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the trial for Soeharto, Ghalib said the attorney
general's official duty is only for prosecution. Furthermore, the
case can go to the court but it is not his authority.
</P>
<P>
He said he only questioned Soeharto from the legal side, not in
political matters.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced down on May 21 last year amid the country's
worst economic and political crisis. An attorney-general team
comprising 13 senior prosecutors has indicated that criminal
elements as well as corruption had taken place in the Timor
national car project, as well as in charitable foundations chaired
by Soeharto.
