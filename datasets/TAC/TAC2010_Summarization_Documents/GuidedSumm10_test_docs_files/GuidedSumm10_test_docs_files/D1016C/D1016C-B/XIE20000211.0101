<HEADLINE> Soeharto Urged to Meet Investigation Summon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Former president Soeharto
should meet his office's summons for undergoing further
investigation on corruption cases, Indonesian Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Former president Soeharto, who now is a suspect in corruption
cases during his rule, should be present to meet the Attorney
General Office's call. But if it is proved later that the suspect
can not be present (due to health reason), it will be considered,"
Darusman was quoted by the Suara Pembaruan daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said that if Soeharto fails to come to the Attorney
General Office, his side may send investigators to Soeharto's
house to continue its investigation.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a real reason from Soeharto's medical team to
explain why Soeharto can't come to meet the Attorney General
Office's call," Darusman stressed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, chief of Soeharto's legal defender team
Juan Felix Tampubolon said that his client will not come to
undergo investigation on Monday due to health reason.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, he said, now still has problems with his
communication skill, both spoken and written, after suffered
stroke and intestinal bleeding last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Speaker of the House of Representatives (DPR) Akbar
Tandjung also expected the Attorney General Office to consider the
health of the former president Soeharto in summoning him.
</P>
<P>
"We should realize that his (Soeharto's) physical condition is
very poor, and he is greatly handicapped in communicating,"
Tandjung was quoted by Antara news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
In further developments, a legal expert J.E. Sahetapy said that
the decision of the Attorney General Office which put Soeharto as
a suspect in corruption case was an answer to public demands.
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning, probably there will be no clarity whether
Soeharto committed corruption practices or not, but at the end,
all will be proved that Soeharto has really committed KKN (a local
acronym for corruption, collusion and nepotistic practices)," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sahetapy, however, suggested that the Attorney General Office
should send a medical team to check the information made by
Soeharto's medical team.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that Soeharto and his family have amassed at
least 15 billion U.S. dollars.
