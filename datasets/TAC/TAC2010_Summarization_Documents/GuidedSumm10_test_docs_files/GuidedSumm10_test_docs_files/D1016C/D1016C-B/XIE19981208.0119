<HEADLINE> Indonesian Embassies Ready to Assist Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian embassies in foreign
countries will provide whatever assistance they can to the
Attorney General's Office in investigating the wealth of former
president Soeharto abroad, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a hearing with a commission of the House of
Representatives (DPR), Alatas said the embassies could not be
expected to do investigative work but they certainly could act as
intermediaries between the Attorney General's Office and the
governments of the countries where they are based.
</P>
<P>
"We will do this after we have received a relevant request from
the Attorney General or the police," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Foreign Ministry had not received any such request
from the Attorney General's Office, Alatas said, adding he was
expecting to see the two offices eventually cooperating in the
probe.

<P>
Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib Monday reaffirmed his intention
to question Soeharto Wednesday, saying his office had already
found a number of things to serve as evidence in the questioning.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has repeatedly said that he has no money stashed
overseas. But he disclosed that he had 22 billion rupiah (3
million U.S. dollars) deposited in three banks in Indonesia, and
that his personal property includes two houses in Jakarta and five
hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said the property of Soeharto and his family has
reached about 20 billion U.S. dollars.
