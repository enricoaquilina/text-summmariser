<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto will not come to the Attorney General Office on Monday to
undergo an investigation on corruption cases due to health reasons,
chief of Soeharto's legal defender team Juan Felix Tampubolon said
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tampubolon said at the Attorney General Office that Soeharto
now still has problems with his communication ability, since the
78-years old man suffered a stroke last year.
</P>
<P>
"Medically, it is impossible for pak (Mr.) Soeharto to undergo
the investigation," Tampubolon told reporters, without elaborating
when is the right time for the investigation.

Director for Corruption Cases at the Attorney General Office
Chairul Imam said Thursday that his office had send a letter to
Soeharto to ask him come to the office next Monday (February 14)
for further investigation on corruption cases. The Office said it
had found new evidences about Soeharto's corruption during his 32
years rule.
</P>
<P>
However Tampubolon declined to reveal in detail on Soeharto's
health condition, adding that ethically such a disclosure is not
proper to be published.
</P>
<P>
Tampubolon added that Soeharto still has problems with
communication skills both written and spoken, but actually
Soeharto really wants to met Attorney General Office's call.
</P>
<P>
"Pak Harto (Mr. Soeharto) talked to us that he actually wants
to come and met the Attorney General Office's call, because he
wants to obey the country's law but his doctor team has said that
it is impossible for Pak Harto to do so," Tampubolon said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced to step down in May 1998, and suffered a
stroke in July 1999 and intestinal bleeding the following month.

<P>
Local reports said Soeharto and his family have amassed at
least 15 billion U.S. dollars.
