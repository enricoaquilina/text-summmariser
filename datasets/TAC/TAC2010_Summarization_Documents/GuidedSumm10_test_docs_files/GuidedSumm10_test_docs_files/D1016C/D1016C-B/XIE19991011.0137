<HEADLINE> Indonesia Stops to Probe Soeharto's Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General's
Office Monday decided to stop its inquiry into alleged acts of
corruption by former president Soeharto, particularly in his past
position as head of a number of charity foundations.
</P>
<P>
"We have not found sufficient evidence to continue the
investigation," Acting Attorney General Ismudjoko told reporters
here after a meeting with President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
He said based on the facts unearthed by investigations on the
possible misuse of state facilities and on Soeharto's policies as
chairman of the charity foundations, as well as based on testimony
from experts and others, no sufficient proof was found to continue
the probe.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he would soon issue a Stop-Investigation Order,
Ismudjoko said.
</P>
<P>
During his reign, Soeharto chaired nine charities, which have
been accused of receiving government privileges and facilities as
well as being one of Soeharto's main business vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has handed over the control of seven of the nine
charitable foundations to the government earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
On other alleged corruption cases such as the national car
project, Ismudjoko said because they were initiated through a
presidential decree, the issue would be included in the report of
the coordinating minister for economic development and
supervision.
</P>
<P>
Under the Timor national car project, the government granted
tax breaks to PT Timor Putra Nasional, owned by Soeharto's son
Hutomo 'Tommy" Mandala Putra, to import completely built-up sedans
from South Korean carmaker Kia Motor. The project had caused the
country losses of 1.55 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was forced down on May 21 last year amid the country's
worst economic and political crisis.
