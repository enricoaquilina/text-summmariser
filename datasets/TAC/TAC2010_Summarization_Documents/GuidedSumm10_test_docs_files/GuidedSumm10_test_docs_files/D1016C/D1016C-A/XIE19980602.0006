Business Data Center which was published here Monday, the assets
of Soeharto's family have reached 200 trillion rupiah (about 20
billion U.S. dollars). However, a foreign media once estimated
Soeharto's and his family's fortune is worth 40 billion U.S.
dollars.

addressing a gathering on Sunday at the Bogor Institute of
Agriculture in Bogor, about 60 kilometers south of the capital,
Indonesian Moslem leader Amien Rais has asked Soeharto to donate
his wealth to the nation and also called on Indonesians to forgive
the former president who had made great contribution to the
country.

Soeharto, who had ruled Indonesia for the last 32 years,
resigned on May 21 under the heavy pressure from the people
demanding for total reforms in political, economic and legal
fields.

The new government led by B.J. Habibie has promised to carry
out the reforms and to be free from corruption, collusion and
nepotism.
