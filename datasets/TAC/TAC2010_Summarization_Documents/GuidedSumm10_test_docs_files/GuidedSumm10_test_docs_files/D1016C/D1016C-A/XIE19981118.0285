<HEADLINE> Indonesia Finds More Evidence of Soeharto's Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian National Land
Agency's Jambi office has uncovered evidence of former President
Soeharto's allegedly ill-gotten wealth in Central Sumatra Province
alone, The Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's fortune, part of which has been sold to his crony
and noted businessman Prayogo Pangestu, reportedly comprised
stocks, land, a plywood factory, a bank, a pineapple cannery and a
TV relay station, worth 122.4 billion rupiah (15.3 million U.S.
dollars) in all.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted State Minister for Land Affairs Hasan Basru
Durin as saying ownership of the property would be canceled and
sanctions applied if charges were proven.
</P>
<P>
The government prosecutor's office would continue a thorough
investigation into the wealth while the land would be seized for
the state or returned to its original owners, Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Prosecutor's Office in Irian Jaya Province T.H.
Sidabutar said they were also investigating thousands of hectares
of land allegedly belonging to Soeharto, his children and cronies.
</P>
<P>
At least five factories were built there, he said, adding that
so far the probe has been focused on Soeharto and his family and
has yet to be directed at cronies.
</P>
<P>
A prominent crony, Bob Hasan, for instance, apparently held a
virtual monopoly on the supply of vegetables, meat, eggs, fruits
and various other necessities for employees of PT Freeport
Indonesia mining firm in Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the National Mandate Party Amien Rais
urged the government to put Soeharto under city arrest and to
confiscate his wealth and that of his family and cronies.
</P>
<P>
"The law should be upheld if we want reform to go on. The time
has come to bring economic and political criminals to court," he
said after installing the executive board of the party's chapter
in Lampung Province on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He cited the new decree of the special session of the People's
Consultative Assembly from November 10 through November 13. The
decree on clean governance included a stipulation that the
government investigate Soeharto's wealth.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible for the government to consider forgiving
Soeharto because of his age but his children and cronies should be
tried and punished if they are proven guilty," Rais added.
