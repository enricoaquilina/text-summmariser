	   JAKARTA (JP): Attorney General Soedjono C. Atmonegoro revealed
here yesterday that former president Soeharto has appointed a
number of lawyers to represent him.
	   ``Yes that's true,'' Soedjono replied hastily when asked by
journalists.
	   When pressed further he revealed that he had also recently met
with them.
	   ``They (lawyers) submitted a letter on their power of
attorney,'' he said.
	   Soedjono refused to divulge further details, saying only that
there were ``several of them''.
	   When pressed if they would be defending the former president,
Soedjono evasively retorted: ``They are conducting their job in
accordance with their code of ethics to defend truth and justice''.
	   He said when asked why he himself was not Soeharto legal council
that: ``Soeharto is now a private citizen so he has the right to be
represented by private lawyers. He's nothing (not a public
official) now.''
	   Since stepping down on May 21, the former president has faced
mounting pressure for an investigation into alleged abuses of power
and illicit accumulation of wealth by Soeharto, his family and
cronies during his 32 years in office.
	   Two committees have been formed by the public to investigate the
Soeharto clan's wealth.
