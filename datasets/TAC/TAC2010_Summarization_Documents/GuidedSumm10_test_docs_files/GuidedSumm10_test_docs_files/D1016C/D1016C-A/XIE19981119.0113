JAKARTA, November 19 (Xinhua) -- Local people and students in
Indonesia's capital Jakarta held an anti-Soeharto mass
demonstration, starting at 14:00 local time on Thursday.

The demonstrators in great number moved toward residence of
the former president at Jalancendana street in Central Jakarta.
But they failed to reach the target point because of tight
security precautions at various intersections that lead to the
spot, official Antara News Agency reported.

This is the first time that demonstrators stage their action
near the residence of Soeharto who resigned on May 21 amid
anti-government demonstrations and bloody rioting in the country.

Students and citizens in the country have held various
demonstrations recently, urging the government to bring Soeharto
to court on the charges of corruption, collusion and nepotism
during his 32-year rule.

Meanwhile, a legislator claimed that President B.J Habibie
needed no new law to start investigation on former president
Soeharto, saying that the existing anti-corruption law would do.

Djuhad Mahja SH of the United Development Party faction made
the statement in the Parliament building here Thursday.

A investigation team set up in September announced on Tuesday
that some evidence of Soeharto's allegedly ill-gotten wealth has
been found in several provinces including land, factories and
others. The team also found Soeharto's personal saving accounts as
much as 2.3 million U.S dollars in 72 domestic banks.
