Watermen Tap Into Oyster Reserve
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Years of paltry oyster harvests have left Bill Beck, a waterman on
Maryland's Eastern Shore for 21 of his 39 years, wondering if the
business will exist by the time his 9-year-old son reaches adulthood.
</P>
<P>
Harvesting oysters, crabs or rockfish for 10 to 15 hours a day
earns Beck just $25,000 a year. The dwindling supply of oysters in the
Chesapeake Bay -- last season's haul was about 24,000 bushels, less
than 1 percent of what it was three decades ago -- has hurt him the
most.
</P>
<P>
``It's getting worse. There's no oysters. There's nothing there,''
Beck said.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, three generations of the Beck family -- Bill, son
Craig and father John, 76 -- boarded their boat with renewed optimism
as nearly 4,000 bushels of disease-free oysters were made available
for harvesting for the first time since they were hatched and planted
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Becks were among two dozen watermen, some scuba-diving and some
using hand tongs, who set out to get their share of the disease-free
oysters from three managed reserves, known as Emory Hollow and Blunts
Bar in the Chester River and Bolingbroke Sands in the Choptank River.
The oysters were spawned at the University of Maryland's Center for
Environmental Science, then planted in the managed reserves, where
they grew under the supervision of scientists. Almost 200 million
oysters have been planted since 2001, officials said.
</P>
<P>
While watermen have been able to harvest oysters elsewhere, they
agreed not to harvest in the managed reserves for several years until
the majority of the oysters grew to four inches, one inch bigger than
the state's legal size. Those oysters command a higher price and have
a better chance of reproducing, organizers said. In return, state
officials promised to open up the oyster bars periodically,
particularly around the holidays when demand is higher. The watermen
will next be able to harvest oysters, which also help filter the
water, at the three sites Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
``It's a beautiful concept in a sense because it's brought
commercial interests and environmental interests together,'' said
William Goldsborough, a senior scientist at the Chesapeake Bay
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Yet not everyone left with big bundles of oysters Saturday. At
Emory Hollow, the seven participating watermen collected just 10 to 15
bushels. The nine watermen at the Blunts Bar site fared better,
collecting 97 bushels.
</P>
<P>
``Terrible,'' Bill Beck said. ``It took us over an hour to catch a
bushel.'' The Becks had worked diligently along the Chester River,
Bill Beck dragging a hand tong through the water as his son and father
sorted and measured their catch.
</P>
<P>
Mathilde Egge, program administrator for the Oyster Recovery
Partnership, one of the project managers, said many Emory Hollow
oysters were smaller than four inches and couldn't be harvested.
Organizers would try to determine how to ensure that oystermen take
home a bigger haul before the next harvesting, Egge said.
</P>
<P>
Several organizations and federal agencies worked together to
manage the project, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and the Oyster Recovery Partnership, a nonprofit group
whose mission is to restore the bay's oyster population.
</P>
<P>
The managed reserve program is one of many efforts to reverse what
scientists have called a disturbing trend. Once the Chesapeake Bay's
premiere species, native oysters have been virtually wiped out due to
over-harvesting and disease. In addition to the managed reserve
program, some researchers have turned to creating sanctuaries filled
with oysters that watermen are barred from harvesting. The Maryland
Department of Natural Resources also is considering introducing a
nonnative -- and, they hope, disease-resistant -- species to the bay.
</P>
<P>
Federal funding for oyster restoration efforts in Maryland and
Virginia exceeded $4 million this year, organizers of Saturday's event
said.
</P>
<P>
The managed reserve method is ``the beginning of a new approach to
managing oysters and oyster disease,'' said Goldsborough of the
Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
</P>
<P>
David Phillips, 42, a waterman from Wittman, Md., said he welcomes
any effort to increase the oyster supply. Phillips drove his boat 20
miles to Emory Hollow, a nearly two-hour trip, to participate.
</P>
<P>
``I think it's a great opportunity,'' said Phillips, who hopes such
efforts will save his profession.
</P>
<P>
``It's a dying breed,'' Phillips said. ``Everybody that was on the
water got off the water because you can't make a living.''
