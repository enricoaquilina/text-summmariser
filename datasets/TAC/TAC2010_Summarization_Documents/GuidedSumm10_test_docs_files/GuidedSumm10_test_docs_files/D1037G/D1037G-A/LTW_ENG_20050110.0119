States Seek U.S. Funds for Bay Cleanup
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leaders of several states in the Chesapeake Bay watershed
agreed Monday to lobby Capitol Hill for about $12 billion for cleaning
up the bay.
</P>
<P>
The Chesapeake Executive Council, a group of state and federal
officials overseeing the bay cleanup, voted to support a new central
financing authority with the power to disperse billions to various
Chesapeake-related projects. The idea is to jump-start the massive
cleanup effort, which critics say has been bogged down because of
excessive bureaucracy and insufficient funding.
</P>
<P>
But supporting the financing authority doesn't make it so: There's
still the matter of persuading Congress to come up with the bulk of
the $15 billion needed to pay for the plan.
</P>
<P>
Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner (D), the Chesapeake executive
council's outgoing chairman, said the lobbying effort would begin
soon.
</P>
<P>
``We will be up in the halls of Congress within the next 45 days to
lobby for the additional federal support,'' Warner said. He said the
Chesapeake officials had been told to wait until after last fall's
national elections to launch their efforts.
</P>
<P>
Monday's annual meeting, at a conference center on the grounds of
Mount Vernon, Va., provided a chance for officials from Virginia,
Maryland, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency to assess the bay's health.
</P>
<P>
All noted some signs of progress: a new ``flush tax'' to improve
sewer facilities in Maryland and rivers in Pennsylvania that have been
reopened to migrating fish.
</P>
<P>
But most also said the cleanup effort was not close to meeting a
self-imposed deadline of a healthy bay by 2010.
</P>
<P>
That goal, set in the landmark Chesapeake 2000 agreement five years
ago, would require huge reductions that have yet to be seen in several
pollutants. In fact, experts say by some measures -- such as the
declining oyster population and large areas of oxygen-poor ``bad
water'' -- the bay seems to be getting worse.
</P>
<P>
``Without major funding, there's no way we're going to meet that
2010 goal,'' said Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell (D), the
council's new chairman.
</P>
<P>
The regional financing authority was proposed late last year by a
panel of experts chaired by former Virginia Gov. Gerald L. Baliles
(D). It called for a central authority with 20 percent of its funding
drawn from state sources and 80 percent from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
As drawn up by the Baliles panel, the federal commitment would be
spread over time, beginning with $1 billion this year and building to
$2.5 billion in 2010.
</P>
<P>
That would be a major increase over current funding for the bay,
which Warner estimated at $230 million annually.
</P>
<P>
As lobbying efforts begin, the executive council voted to create a
panel of experts which would report back by July1 with details on how
the regional financing authority might be created.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation led a rally in
which speakers accused government officials of dragging their feet on
bay cleanup measures.
</P>
<P>
William C. Baker, the environmentalist group's president, spoke
from a podium emblazoned with the slogan ``Stop the Delay. Save the
Bay.''
</P>
<P>
``Solutions are available. The bay can be saved,'' Baker said.
``All that is lacking is the political will to get on with the job.''
