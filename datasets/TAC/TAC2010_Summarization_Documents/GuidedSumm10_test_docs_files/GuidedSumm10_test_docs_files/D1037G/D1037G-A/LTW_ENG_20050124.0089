Rescue Effort Sinking for Chesapeake Bay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Halfway through a 10-year program to save the Chesapeake Bay,
political leaders are acknowledging that the vaunted cleanup is
faltering and are calling for major changes midstream.
</P>
<P>
Once touted as a national model, the cleanup effort has unraveled
into what some environmentalists call a bureaucratic farce. Five years
of planning, they say, have left the bay no cleaner than it was when
the ``Chesapeake 2000'' pact was signed.
</P>
<P>
A Maryland congressman is contemplating legislation to replace the
voluntary cleanup strategy with strict regulatory requirements.
Governors are pledging to walk the halls of Congress lobbying for $12
billion in needed support. And scientists are exploring the mass
introduction of a Chinese oyster to replace the vanishing native
breed.
</P>
<P>
``Business as usual won't work,'' said former Virginia Gov. Gerald
Baliles, who led a committee that studied the bay cleanup last year.
``More of the same is asking for trouble.''
</P>
<P>
The agreement to clean the bay in 10 years promised twice as much
underwater grass, 10 times as many oysters, and water as pristine as
in the 1950s. It was touted as ``America's premier watershed
restoration partnership,'' supported by the Environmental Protection
Agency and representatives from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen years before, the same entities had pledged to reduce the
pollutants nitrogen and phosphorus in the bay by 40 percent. When the
deadline came in 2000, they had fallen short.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement, an attempt to jump-start the effort, made more
sweeping promises.
</P>
<P>
The idea was, ``if we can do this ... nobody else in the world has
an excuse,'' said William Matuszeski, who was then overseeing the bay
cleanup for the EPA.
</P>
<P>
It was a daunting task: to reduce pollution spewing from a
multitude of city sewers, farms and factories across a
64,000-square-mile watershed. The tools were unwieldy, including
several federal agencies and an array of state governments that
eventually included Delaware, West Virginia and New York.
</P>
<P>
Even so, cleanup officials say, they expected to accomplish more by
now than they have.
</P>
<P>
``We've made only modest progress,'' Rebecca Hanmer, head of the
EPA bay program, conceded in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
Consider:
</P>
<P>
-- The 2000 agreement targeted the problem of low dissolved oxygen,
a condition in which fish and crabs can't breathe. This would mean
reducing nitrogen and phosphorus, found in suburban lawn fertilizer,
processed sewage and animal manure. These pollutants, when washed
downstream to the bay, feed algae blooms that suck oxygen out of the
water.
</P>
<P>
But at the current rate, the nitrogen goal won't be met until 2038,
and problems with oxygen-poor areas haven't changed. The summer of
2003 was one of the worst on record, as nearly 40 percent of the
Chesapeake became a suffocating expanse that environmentalists dubbed
the ``dead zone.''
</P>
<P>
-- The agreement promised to increase the number of oysters tenfold.
Instead, their numbers have fallen off sharply because of pollution,
low oxygen and endemic disease. In five years alone, the Maryland
oyster harvest has dropped 92 percent, hitting a record low last year
with 26,000 bushels.
</P>
<P>
-- Underwater grasses are supposed to grow to 185,000 acres by 2010.
But algae and sediment cloud the water, blocking sunlight. A survey of
the bay's grasses in 2003, found about 64,000 acres -- 35 percent of
the goal.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists and watermen say the bay shows few signs that
anybody has spent five years trying to save it.
</P>
<P>
``There really hasn't been a noticeable improvement,'' said Denise
Breitburg, a senior scientist at the Smithsonian Environmental
Research Center in Edgewater, Md. ``The major problems that the
Chesapeake Bay agreement was designed to diminish are still there.''
</P>
<P>
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation assesses the bay's overall health
annually and rates it on a 100-point scale. In 2000, the foundation
rated the bay a 28.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the rating has changed -- to 27.
</P>
<P>
``I wouldn't hold it up as a success story, put it that way,'' said
ecologist Robert Howarth of Cornell University.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The consequences are even more troubling for watermen, for whom the
bay provides both a livelihood and cultural touchstone.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Jenkins Sr., 70, of Virginia's Northern Neck, said he's
seen the signs both on land -- where the number of watermen has dropped
because of low oyster harvests -- and in the water.
</P>
<P>
For instance, boat anchors used to come up with a menagerie of tiny
bottom-dwelling animals crawling on them: sand fleas, worms, snails.
Those animals are gone, and probably dead, Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
``The little shells or carcasses are about all you see,'' Jenkins
said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
How did the bay get to this condition? Experts say the problem was
a desire to plan all pollution efforts in minute detail while keeping
major changes on hold.
</P>
<P>
Matuszeski, the bay program's leader from 1991 to 2001, said
officials knew their work would revolve around renovating sewage
plants and keeping farm manure out of streams.
</P>
<P>
But first, the bay cleanup bureaucracy worked on official water
standards -- figuring out exactly how clean the bay should be. That
process was supposed to take one year. It took three, with Washington,
the states and the federal government spending a combined $1 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
Then individual jurisdictions were to write detailed plans for
cleaning up each tributary. The plans, due by 2002, still aren't
finished.
</P>
<P>
``We could have gotten to work,'' Matuszeski said. ``It didn't
happen because people were afraid that we didn't have the numbers
right.''
</P>
<P>
Some environmentalists say this planning marathon was actually
stalling to allow politicians to avoid changes that would anger
farmers and sewage customers.
</P>
<P>
Hanmer, the EPA's bay director, defended the work, saying it's been
slow but necessary for all the cooperating agencies to buy in. ``Now
people cannot say, 'Rebecca, we don't know what needs to be done,' ''
she said.
</P>
<P>
Hanmer pointed to some recent successes, including Maryland's
passage of a ``flush tax'' to reduce pollution from sewage plants and
the EPA's requirement that plants must further clean the water they
dump into the watershed.
</P>
<P>
But even she wouldn't say the cleanup effort is on pace to meet the
2010 deadline.
</P>
<P>
``I'm certainly not going to tell you that we can't meet it,''
Hanmer said. ``I don't think it's the right message to send.''
</P>
<P>
Rep. Wayne Gilchrest, R-Md., doesn't want to wait for 2010.
Gilchrest wants legislation that would force the cleanup to spend less
time on bureaucracy, as well as stronger regulations and punishment
for those who pollute, he said.
</P>
<P>
``What we want to do is lock in a better bay program that will be a
hundred times more effective,'' Gilchrest said. Still, he said, it
might be two years before the changes go through.
</P>
<P>
State governors from around the watershed have approved a proposal
that would create a massive new pool of funding for the bay, with $12
billion from the federal government. But many observers wonder how the
states will get the money since the federal government is already
tightening budgets.
</P>
<P>
Then there is the Chinese oyster, which governors in Maryland and
Virginia believe might resist disease and provide a natural pollution
filter. Already there is no shortage of opposition to this plan.
Scientists worry it will bring in disease; based on their concerns,
Maryland state legislators are trying to block it.
</P>
<P>
The failures leave a bewildering disconnect for those who are
removed from the nitty-gritty of environmental policy. On paper is the
bay as national treasure, on the way to resurrection. Then there's the
bay they know -- sickly and murky and perhaps getting worse.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
It's made Jenkins, the Northern Neck waterman, skeptical of all
deadlines for the Chesapeake's comeback.
</P>
<P>
``It was going to be the '90s ... then the year 2000, then it was
the year 2010,'' he said. ``When 2010 gets here, I guess it'll be
2020.''
