ON MARYLAND'S SHORE, AN ELEGY, PERHAPS, FOR OYSTER SEASON
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a crystal clear afternoon, the light air hinting of fall, the Miss
Brandy motored up to a dock on the Kent Narrows in Grasonville, Md.,
in front of W.H. Harris Seafood. Heaped like a pile of rocks in the
middle of the boat was the morning's haul -- oysters, the rough and
craggy bottom dwellers that have been the shining jewels of the
Chesapeake Bay for generations.
</P>
<P>
From the dock, Jason Ruth, a worker at Harris', began culling the
pile with an expert's eye, selecting those to keep and shuck and
those to return to the bay. Taking handfuls at a time, Ruth flung the
oysters back into the water. "See," he said, picking up one in a
fluid motion and knocking it with a quick tap against the pile,
making a hollow thunk. "There's nothing there. It's dead. Gone." The
shell landed back in the water with a splash.
</P>
<P>
Similar scenes are unfolding these days up and down the Chesapeake
Bay, where the annual oyster season is becoming an endangered
tradition. For centuries, the Chesapeake has been synonymous with
oysters. For early settlers, oyster reefs were so abundant that they
posed a hazard for navigation, and with the introduction of canning
in the 1800s, the Chesapeake became the source for oysters around the
world.
</P>
<P>
But the annual good cheer surrounding the season is waning. That is
because Chesapeake watermen pulled an all-time low of about 25,000
bushels of oysters from the bay last year, compared with 80,000 in
1993 -- and a staggering 15 million back in the glory days of 1885.
From 1920 to 1970, before the oyster began its rapid decline, the
industry contributed $65 million annually to the state of Maryland, a
figure that didn't include the tourism it attracted. The annual
figure has fallen to $500,000. Overharvesting and pollution have
taken a toll on the native oyster, but far bigger threats to the
species are two parasites that attack them, Dermo and MSX, which were
first detected in the bay in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Harris' is a holdout in a devastated industry; one of the last
oyster-packing companies on the Chesapeake, where once there were
hundreds. Just a few miles across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge from
Annapolis, the waters of Kent Narrows, which leads to the bay, were
home to 13 oyster packing houses at about the time Harris' opened in
1947. Now, it stands alone in the shadow of the Kent Narrows Bridge.
</P>
<P>
But some oysters do survive in the bay. Harris' shucks, packs and
sells them at its packing company and serves them in its dockside
restaurant overlooking the narrows. At the height of oyster season,
which began Oct. 1 and runs through the end of March, Harris' rolls
out an all-you-can-eat buffet, featuring oysters served seven
different ways.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, fall oyster celebrations still abound in bayside communities
on the Chesapeake, where old traditions die hard and the oysters
remain as much a symbol of the season's arrival as cider, apples and
pumpkins. Here, the mighty oyster is toasted in the wood-paneled
oyster bars of Annapolis -- McGarvey's, O'Brien's and the Middleton
Tavern -- and honored along the bay's shores at festivals, shucking
contests and skipjack races.
</P>
<P>
The events spotlighting oysters in October and November unfold like
oysters on the half shell -- by the dozen. There are Tilghman Island
Day, the J. Millard Tawes Oyster and Bull Roast in Crisfield, the St.
Michaels Oysterfest, the Urbanna Oyster Festival, and the biggest
pearl of them all for oyster lovers _the St. Mary's County Oyster
Festival this weekend, home to the National Oyster Shucking
Championship and National Oyster Cook-Off Contest. The festival
features oysters in every imaginable combination: raw, steamed, fried
or Rockefeller; stewed in chowder or mixed with cocktail sauce; or
served with a swig of beer in a shot glass.
</P>
<P>
It is possible, too, to celebrate the season with a quieter sojourn,
steering clear of the crowded festivals and venturing into sleepier
coastal communities. From the Kent Narrows, they are a quick jaunt to
the far side of the Chesapeake, heading south and east on Route 50,
down the thumb print of land dangling between the bay and the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
This route is frequently clogged with traffic headed toward the
Atlantic Coast and Maryland's Eastern Shore in the summer months, but
fewer people stop to explore the other stretch of coast, along the
Chesapeake Bay. The towns along the peninsula's west coast, places
like St. Michaels, Oxford and Crisfield, aren't easy to reach down
twisting two-lane roads that dead end at the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
The small flecks of black that mark them on a map can persuade those
short on time or unwise in the ways of the bay to save the detour for
another day. But if you turn off Route 50 at Easton, and cut west
toward the bay, the road quickly gives way to farmland, brown and
drying corn stalks, pumpkin patches and fields dipped in gold at the
hands of fall before opening onto the water.
</P>
<P>
Past Easton and St. Michaels, Tilghman Island is one of those flecks,
set on the tip of a peninsula connected to the mainland by a
drawbridge across Knapp's Narrows. At the clanging of a bell, every
20 minutes or so, cars stop and the bridge slowly lifts as if raising
a hand in greeting to the boats coming in and out of the harbor. On
one side of the bridge is the Bridge Restaurant, which advertises
oysters with crab imperial, and the Fairbank Tackle store, which
sells tackle, ice and bait. On the other side is Harrison's Oyster
Packing, another of the handful of oyster houses still in operation.
Farther down the road, Captain Buddy Harrison, who owns the company,
also runs the Chesapeake House, offering old-fashioned seafood dining
and lodging overlooking the bay.
</P>
<P>
In Dogwood Harbor on Tilghman, fishing boats still outnumber
sailboats and pleasure craft. On a recent Sunday morning, the harbor
was peaceful, with only a few watermen cleaning and fixing their
boats. In an earlier time, they would have been prepping their
dredges for oyster season, but most won't be dredging this year.
</P>
<P>
Norman Murphy is a middle-aged waterman who grew up on Tilghman
Island working the bay, as his own son does now. "No one here is
oystering anymore," he said, shaking his head before adding a
footnote. "Well, maybe a few."
</P>
<P>
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
Across the harbor from Murphy's slip are a handful of skipjacks -- a
vanishing fleet of traditional oyster dredge boats and the last
commercial sailing fishing fleet in North America. There were once
almost 2,000 of the boats working the bay, but today, they number
near 30, with only about 10 used for oystering.
</P>
<P>
Built at the peak of the oyster rush, in the late 1890s and early
years of the 20th century, skipjacks are light, inexpensive boats
that can navigate the shallow waters of the bay. They were designed
to be agile to make multiple quick passes over an oyster bed,
dragging dredges behind them. Today, oystermen use motorboats more
than skipjacks, and they employ other methods, too, like hand-tonging
and diving.
</P>
<P>
Many of the remaining skipjacks have become museum pieces, like the
Martha Lewis in Baltimore, preserved by the Chesapeake Heritage
Conservancy, and the E.C. Collier, now in the Chesapeake Bay Maritime
Museum in St. Michaels.
</P>
<P>
But lined up in Dogwood Harbor are four majestic skipjacks growing
old very, very gracefully, their massive white sails lashed to the
masts. They, too, are holdouts, though called upon less and less to
dredge.
</P>
<P>
Wade Murphy, a third-generation waterman with 40 years of oystering
behind him, runs charter tours on his skipjack, the Rebecca T. Ruark,
built in 1886. Each year the charter business gets bigger and bigger,
Murphy said. "If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be able to keep
afloat."
</P>
<P>
Nearby, D.K. Bond was cleaning out his skipjack, the Mister Maybe,
with a vision of running his own tours in the summer and hauling down
to Florida come winter. "This boat costs $10,000 a year to keep up,"
Bond said. "If you spend $10,000 and make $5,000, it doesn't take
long for you to get out of it. I'm going to catch tourists instead.
It's easier."
</P>
<P>
(END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
This grim portrait doesn't mean that there are no oysters left in the
Chesapeake. Both Virginia and Maryland have been spending several
million dollars each year to restore native populations, and they are
considering introducing a heartier nonnative species to the bay.
</P>
<P>
In 2005, led by the Army Corps of Engineers, the two states are
expected to release a draft Environmental Impact Statement evaluating
oyster recovery. Also, the Oyster Recovery Partnership, an alliance
of organizations, businesses and individuals, has planted more than
330 million disease-free oyster seeds from the University of
Maryland's Center for Environmental Science in 33 locations in the
bay since 2000. The group aims to harvest the seeded oysters in time
to save them from being attacked by Dermo or MSX, within three years.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the commercial fishery business -- the packing and
shipping that put Chesapeake Bay oysters on the map -- has all but
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
But watermen still bring in salty, succulent oysters every year, and
those are abundant at bay restaurants, raw bars, seafood stores and
festivals. If you ask, you may find the oysters you order are from
Long Island or the Gulf of Mexico, but in the height of oyster
season, when the annual grind is under way, you are just as likely to
get that coveted response, "from a local oyster bed."
</P>
<P>
In places like Tilghman, watermen still motor up to the dock at
Harrison's packing company to deliver their day's haul, just as they
have for generations, and inside, shuckers still wait to crack them
open in record time, as they, too, have done for generations.
</P>
<P>
Like the watermen, shuckers are born into this hearty business more
often than not. Opening a cold, tenacious oyster quickly without
harming or slicing the tender meat within takes skill and gumption.
At the height of the season, shuckers line up in the oyster house,
don rugged work gloves and pry open the shells, shucking hundreds an
hour (they get paid by the pound).
</P>
<P>
Clevon Tilghman, 53, has been working at Harrison's since he was a
boy watching his parents shuck oysters there. "Young people now don't
want to shuck oysters," Tilghman said. "You can tell in the oyster
house. We see the old generation that's passed on, and there's no
younger one to take their place. It's fading out."
</P>
<P>
