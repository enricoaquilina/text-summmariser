Cap on Migrant Workers Hits Seafood Processors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chesapeake Bay seafood processors say they're facing catastrophe
this year because a cap on certain ``guest workers'' is keeping out
immigrants who usually pick crabs and shuck oysters.
</P>
<P>
These migrant workers have come to dominate shellfish processing
over the past decade -- doing dirty, repetitive work that machines
can't and Americans won't, employers say.
</P>
<P>
But this year, the seasonal-work visa program that provides these
laborers hit its limit of 66,000 workers on the earliest date ever,
Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
That has left many businesses empty-handed, including ski resorts
in New England, fish plants in Washington state, and dozens of
processors in Maryland and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
``People suddenly woke up to the fact that they're going to be out
of business this spring,'' said Bill Sieling, executive director of
the Chesapeake Bay Seafood Industries Association, which represents
seafood plants around the bay.
</P>
<P>
In all, Sieling said, about 20 plants -- all on the Eastern Shore --
were unable to get the workers they applied for. Added together, their
requests totaled about 800 workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Now, members of Congress up and down the East Coast are lobbying
for the cap on guest workers to be raised. And seafood processors are
scrambling to find other workers or face shutting down for the season
-- and possibly for good.
</P>
<P>
``When the crabs start running in the summer ... and you don't have
this infrastructure to pick them anymore, it's going to be bad,'' said
Jack Brooks, president of the J.M. Clayton seafood company in
Cambridge, Md. His firm usually has about 30 immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
But some immigration experts say lifting the cap on laborers isn't
the solution.
</P>
<P>
Mark Krikorian, of the Center for Immigration Studies, said that
shellfish processors either should pay wages high enough to attract
American workers or invent a way to mechanize the work.
</P>
<P>
``The presence of these foreign workers creates a dependency''
among employers, Krikorian said. ``It's hard to wean away from it.''
</P>
<P>
The visa program at issue, known as H-2B, allows workers to enter
the country for seasonal work outside of agriculture and then return
home. Before bringing in a worker under this program, an employer must
prove that no U.S. residents are willing to do the job.
</P>
<P>
The program has become more popular across the country in recent
years and has been used to fill jobs from lawn care workers to
lifeguards. It has become particularly valuable around the bay, where
the process of removing crab and oyster meat from shells is still done
largely by hand.
</P>
<P>
The work is unpleasant. Picking crabs, for instance, requires
scraping off the cooked crab's gills, cleaning out its organs,
breaking off the mouth and prying meat out of tiny cavities.
</P>
<P>
All that must be repeated up to 600 times a day, yielding a daily
wage that might reach $120 on a good day, Brooks said. That amounts to
20 cents a crab. Adding to the undesirability in these jobs, experts
say, is the fact that in recent years they have changed from
year-round to seasonal because there no longer are enough shellfish in
the polluted bay to sustain them.
</P>
<P>
As a result, experts say, a once-large labor pool has vanished as
local workers found better jobs.
</P>
<P>
``There's no one else,'' said Karen Oertel, of W.H. Harris Seafood
House in Chester, Md. ``Nobody shucks an oyster anymore.''
</P>
<P>
The shellfish processors turned to the H-2B program, bringing in
hundreds of Mexicans and other immigrants to spend several months in
the plants. About 90 percent of Maryland's crab meat is produced by
plants using H-2B workers, said Douglas Lipton, a professor of
resource management at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
But Chesapeake processors say a quirk of the program puts them at a
disadvantage. The window for applications opens in October, but
employers can apply no more than four months before they need workers.
Seafood plants do not need help until April.
</P>
<P>
When they applied this year, many of the plants were shut out,
officials say. One of them was the Graham and Rollins plant in
Hampton, Va., which asked for 100 guest workers and received none.
</P>
<P>
Without immigrant workers, John Graham said, he has only about 18
local laborers. ``I need at least 80 to open the doors,'' Graham said.
``We are totally dependent on this system,'' he said of the H-2B
program.
