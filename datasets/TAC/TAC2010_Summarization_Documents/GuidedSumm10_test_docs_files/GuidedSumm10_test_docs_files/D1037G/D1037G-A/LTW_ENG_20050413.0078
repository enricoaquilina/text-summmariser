Chesapeake Bay Tributary Tops List of Nation's Threatened Rivers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teeming with raw sewage, animal waste and fertilizer runoff, yet
responsible for half the Chesapeake Bay's fresh water, the Susquehanna
River is the most endangered river in the United States, according to
a report released this week by American Rivers, a national
conservation group.
</P>
<P>
Pennsylvania's massive Susquehanna, the bay's biggest tributary,
tops a list of 10 American rivers with uncertain futures, including
Ohio's Little Miami River, Tennessee's Roan Creek and South Carolina's
Santee River. Most of them, said American Rivers President Rebecca R.
Wodder, are befouled by raw sewage and urban and farm runoff --
problems made worse by population growth and cuts to federal cleanup
money.
</P>
<P>
The Susquehanna exemplifies ``the crisis we're highlighting in this
report, that when it rains in America, raw sewage pours into our
rivers and streams -- in an increasing amount,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Uphill and upstream from the bay, thousands of acres of
Pennsylvania crop- and pastureland abut the banks of the Susquehanna
or the creeks and streams that feed it. The farms are so small and
far-flung that state environmental agencies struggle to bring all of
them into compliance with laws governing pollutant runoff.
</P>
<P>
The report also cites runoff from urban centers and the hundreds of
sewer pipes that overflow in rainy weather, spewing human waste and
garbage into the river.
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer nutrients and filth from the Susquehanna is a chief
cause of the algae blooms and pollution that suck oxygen from the
Chesapeake Bay, decimating crab, oyster, fish and aquatic plant
populations. A University of Maryland consultant has estimated that
the river contributes 40 percent of the nitrogen and 20 percent of the
phosphorus -- two key ingredients in fertilizers -- to the bay.
</P>
<P>
``Pennsylvania is committed to reducing the nutrients and sediments
that flow into our local streams and, in doing that, restoring the
Chesapeake Bay,'' said Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection spokesman Charlie Young. ``But the federal government is
talking about reducing the amount of (water cleanup money) that goes
to Pennsylvania by almost $25 million'' next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among state-funded cleanup efforts has been a $250 million bond
issue last year to pay for sewage treatment plant upgrades, Young
said. This year, Gov. Edward G. Rendell, D, is backing a proposal in
the state legislature to issue another $800 million in bonds for water
and sewage system improvements, to be voted on in coming days.
</P>
<P>
Wodder said federal cuts to Pennsylvania's cleanup budget reflect
the situation nationally. For example, she said, the Bush
administration's proposed 2006 budget calls for cutting spending on
the federal clean-water fund to $730 million, from $1.1 billion last
year.
</P>
<P>
``The feds are not contributing their fair share to solving the
problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Grumbles, assistant administrator for water at the
Environmental Protection Agency, said the pared-back funding of $730
million in the president's budget request ``is part of a multi-year
effort to commit $6.8 billion through 2011'' to the fund, which he
said is intended to provide seed money to state-based loan programs to
improve sewage treatment infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Grumbles said, the EPA favors more state-based water
quality initiatives and ``innovative'' programs to combat pollution,
such as pollution credits, which can be traded among top-polluting
industries.
