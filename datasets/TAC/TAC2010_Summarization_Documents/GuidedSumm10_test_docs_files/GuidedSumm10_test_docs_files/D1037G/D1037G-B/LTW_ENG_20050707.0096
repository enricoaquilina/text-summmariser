The Chesapeake Bay Is Ailing, and This Time It's Serious
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home. I was keenly
anticipating returning to my home waters of Chesapeake Bay recently
after a month crossing the Atlantic and cruising the Adriatic. The
water in both places was clear as Russian vodka but not too
productive. No crabs, no oysters and few fish, at least not that I
could catch.
</P>
<P>
The bay, by contrast, may be murky but it's a veritable font of
life, the natal grounds for a host of tasty marine and river species.
When Capt. John Smith arrived here in the 1600s, he wrote that you
could just about walk across the rivers on the backs of fish.
</P>
<P>
So imagine my disappointment the first day back when I called an
old friend to suggest a little celebratory crab feast. I was licking
my lips. ``We could go,'' he said, ``but you should know in advance
they're $80 a dozen. Crabs are scarce this year.''
</P>
<P>
Eighty bucks a dozen in late June? That doesn't sound like the
Chesapeake I know. Oh, well, there's always rockfish, the delectable,
snow-white Maryland state fish. I called Kevin Kenno, dean of Bay
Bridge anglers, and proposed a foray out to jig for our dinner. We hit
it perfectly on a fast-running flood. We fished hard for four hours in
ideal conditions but never got a tap.
</P>
<P>
Kenno took time to retell a shocking experience from last year,
when he caught a lean, 30-inch rock and brought it home to clean. He
opened the stomach to see what it had been eating and found, to his
horror, a 12-inch rockfish inside. ``They're so hungry they're eating
their own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
All of which adds up to a less-than-cheery picture, which only got
worse when someone pointed to the June issue of National Geographic
magazine, in which Tom Horton, longtime journalistic conscience of the
Chesapeake, writes darkly about the state of his beloved estuary.
</P>
<P>
``The bay scene is changing,'' he writes, ``and there's an air of
finality to it now.'' Adds Horton, ``The bay today has become the
ecological equivalent of a morbidly obese person, force-fed nitrogen
and phosphorus.''
</P>
<P>
Ouch.
</P>
<P>
We've watched beds of bay grasses die off and the oyster catch drop
in a decade from 1 million bushels a year to 26,500. We've seen
once-vast beds of soft clams all but disappear. The big rockfish we
could catch all summer 15 years ago are gone. We saw crabs grow scarce
and watched menhaden, the great forage fish at the bottom of the food
chain, netted by the millions of pounds by Virginia factory boats, and
boiled down for cat food and oil. Many believe rockfish are eating
their own because they can't find any menhaden.
</P>
<P>
But aren't marine species by nature volatile? Could this be just
another cycle? After decades of general decline I no longer think so,
and when no less an authority than Horton, who has covered the bay and
its woes expertly and thoroughly for over 30 years, writes as grimly
as he does, I'm clearly not alone.
</P>
<P>
The dark drumbeat actually started two years ago when Howard Ernst,
a political science professor at the U.S. Naval Academy, concluded
three years of research by writing a worrisome book called
``Chesapeake Bay Blues,'' in which he made the case that almost
nothing in the bay is getting better and all kinds of things are
getting progressively worse.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, he maintained, public agencies and private organizations
in position to change things do little but trumpet nonexistent or
incremental improvements while wasting time and money on reports and
studies to back their claims.
</P>
<P>
That's not entirely fair. I was buoyed last week to hear from the
Coastal Conservation Association, one of the few environmental groups
with the courage to stick its neck out. CCA is urging folks to show up
at public hearings in Maryland and Virginia this month and next to
support a controversial move to cap the massive catch of menhaden in
the bay by the industrial giant Omega Protein.
</P>
<P>
CCA also recently wrote Maryland's Natural Resources secretary Ron
Franks to call for endangered-species status for oysters, with a
subsequent moratorium on oystering to give the beleaguered stocks a
chance to recover.
</P>
<P>
These are unusual positions for an organization basically made up
of sport fishermen. Nobody in CCA goes oystering or menhaden fishing,
but these are tough times, and someone has to step up.
</P>
<P>
CCA reckons the answer to the bay's woes, if there is one, lies in
``ecosystem management,'' meaning a holistic approach to its problems.
``It's like triage at a hospital,'' said CCA's fisheries scientist,
Dick Brame. ``You've got a patient that's dying of arterial bleeding,
but he also has cancer. The arterial bleeding in this case is
over-exploitation of species, the cancer underneath is the continuing
decline of water quality.
</P>
<P>
``If you can't stop the bleeding, the cancer doesn't matter. But if
you do, you still have to deal with the cancer.''
</P>
<P>
So there in a nutshell is the state of our bay: A morbidly obese
patient in the emergency room with IV lines pumping poison in, while
blood spurts from arterial wounds and an underlying cancer lurks.
Meanwhile, the staff runs around insisting everything's fine, all we
need is more tests.
