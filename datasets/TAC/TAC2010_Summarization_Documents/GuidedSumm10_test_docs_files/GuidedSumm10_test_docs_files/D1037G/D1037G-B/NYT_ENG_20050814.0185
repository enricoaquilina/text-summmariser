EDITORIAL: OYSTERS ON THE BRINK

The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Aug.

Efforts to constrain human behavior to protect wildlife inevitably provoke debate
and complaint, never more so than when the wildlife in
question is delicious. Thus the uproar involving a commercially harvested
animal that many people are on slurping terms with --
the plain old Eastern oyster, a humble species that ranges
from New England to the Yucatan. Its remarkable fecundity and
unsophisticated hardiness has allowed it to hang on despite overharvesting,
habitat loss and pollution. Still, it is not doing nearly
as well as it used to, particularly in the Chesapeake
Bay.

<P>
The Eastern oyster's catastrophic decline there has led Wolf-Dieter Busch, a
biologist and environmental consultant in Maryland, to petition the National
Marine Fisheries Service to place it on the endangered species
list.

<P>
Fishermen and politicians from Maine to Louisiana, where oyster populations are
healthier, have erupted. They say Busch wants to destroy an
entire segment of the national seafood industry to solve a
local problem. If listed, the oyster would be as off
limits to seafood lovers as the humpback whale.
</P>
<P>
Busch argues that even though the Chesapeake commercial oyster harvest has
fallen to the tiniest fraction of its historical high, government
agencies have done little to protect oyster habitat or prevent
pollution runoff -- actions that are critical to the species'
long-term survival. He dismisses the quick fix being contemplated by
Maryland and Virginia -- seeding the waters with sturdy Asian
oysters -- as a move that would drive the Eastern
oyster further to the brink through interbreeding and competition.
</P>
<P>
We hope Busch's petition increases the pressure for a comprehensive approach
to the oyster problem -- one that goes beyond harvest
limits to include habitat restoration and stricter compliance with existing
laws, like the Clean Water Act. But he is playing
a risky game. The Endangered Species Act is a landmark
law with wide public support and a record of effectiveness.
But it has many enemies, and the attention it gets
in battles that seem to tilt the balance too far
in favor of nonhuman species only emboldens those who have
fought to undermine and circumvent it. The Eastern oyster should
not become another spotted owl.
