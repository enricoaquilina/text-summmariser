Restoring the Chesapeake Bay's dwindling oyster beds would
accelerate efforts to clean the bay's waters, reducing nitrogen and
algae problems and fostering the growth of underwater plant life,
Maryland researchers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bay's oyster population, a natural filter for pollution, has
been diminished in recent decades by disease and overfishing. If it
were revived to 25 times its current size -- about the level found
between 1920 and 1970 -- excessive nitrogen levels in the bay would
fall by 11 million pounds each year, and underwater grasses would
increase by more than 20 percent, said the researchers, who are
studying the oyster restoration methods for the state Department of
Natural Resources.

``We don't know if it's a 10-year period or 25 years, but if we
could find an oyster that could survive the disease, then we'd be
moving in the right direction,'' said Tom O'Connell, a marine
fisheries restoration manager at the department.

<P>
Reducing disease would not, however, eliminate the need for
improving the region's sewage treatment plants and limiting runoff
from farms, two key sources of pollution. ``Oyster restoration should
be viewed as a supplement to bay restoration activities, not as a
substitute,'' O'Connell said.

The research released Friday was the latest component of an ongoing
environmental impact study that focuses on ways to bring more oysters
to the bay. Once plentiful, oysters have been killed off by parasitic
plagues, pollution and overfishing. Today, their numbers have plunged
to an estimated 1 percent of what they were in the 17th century, when
the region's oyster harvesting industry began.

During the past decade, some scientists, watermen and politicians
have suggested introducing a fast-growing, disease-tolerant Asian
variety, Crassostrea ariakensis, into the Chesapeake's waters. But the
plan has raised fears that releasing a nonnative species might have
unexpected consequences for the bay's fragile ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
In response, Maryland and Virginia have undertaken an environmental
impact study of oyster restoration methods, due to be completed and
released for public comment in January.
</P>
<P>
The section of the study released Friday did not address merits and
drawbacks of native and nonnative species. Rather, it focused on what
effect restoration would have on the ecosystem in general.
</P>
<P>
Oysters filter sediments and eat microscopic algae that cloud the
water and kill off underwater plants, the study said. When oysters are
plentiful, sunlight reaches greater depths in the bay, nurturing sea
grasses and plants, which help improve water quality. Oyster
restoration initiatives have set as their goal a 25-fold increase in
population. Such growth, the study said, would produce a 21 percent
increase in the underwater plant population.
</P>
<P>
Oysters also help rid the bay of excess nitrogen, which robs the
water of oxygen, killing animal and plant life. Maryland is seeking to
reduce the nitrogen dumped into the bay by 19 million pounds a year
before 2010. Increasing the oyster population would reduce nitrogen by
more than half that figure.
