CONSUMERS HAVE RED TIDE JITTERS

Even in the middle of the worst red tide outbreak in
New England in three decades, Walt Averill doesn't worry about
ordering oysters and clams - at least not from the
sleek little B&amp;G Oysters in Boston's South End.
</P>
<P>
"I figure a restaurant like this is going to do whatever
they have to do, and if their oysters and clams
aren't worth serving they're not going to serve them," says
Averill, 37, who was visiting Boston from California's Sonoma County
with his wife, Maire Murphy. "I don't worry about places
that are high-quality."

In restaurants and seafood markets across the area, customers worried about
red tide are asking more questions. So far, demand for
seafood hasn't dropped. State officials say that all seafood currently
on the market is safe to consume, since beds are
closed as soon as samples show that red-tide concentrations are
at or near toxic levels. The shellfish you see on
a menu or in a market comes from sea beds
outside the affected areas, say restaurateurs and retail shop owners,
or was harvested before the beds were closed.
</P>
<P>
But that message doesn't always reach the customer. Manager Janet Kim
says B&amp;G's customers have been "kind of tentative" about ordering.
"They still eat oysters and clams," says the restaurant's chef,
Greg Reeves. "They just ask more questions." In fact, says
Jeff Nace of Neptune Oyster in the North End, people
even question whether lobster, which is not affected by red
tide, is safe to eat.

At Jasper White's Summer Shack in Cambridge, Brian Flagg, executive chef
for both this restaurant and the Boston location, says his
buyer is bringing in shellfish from northern Maine, Canada, and
other waters outside the affected areas, but not raising prices.
"We have to look a little harder for our product,"
he says.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody does anything shady during red tide," says the Summer Shack
chef. "It would be insane."

State fishery authorities began closing shellfish beds in May from central
Maine to Chatham and Nantucket. On Monday, they also closed
the channel between the Cape and Nantucket, and the Nantucket
Sound waters off Martha's Vineyard. As of Tuesday, beds in
Buzzards Bay, Vineyard Sound, and Rhode Island were still open,
according to the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries. This outbreak
of red tide - the result of an explosion, or
bloom, of one-celled organisms that cause toxins in clams, mussels,
and other shellfish - moved north to south, says Dave
Whittaker, senior marine biologist for Massachusetts Division of Fisheries. The
edible part of sea scallops, the adductor muscle, does not
collect the toxin and is safe to eat, he says,
though bay scallops, not now in season, would not be
safe. Because the bloom of algae, which occurs often during
the warmer months, is so large this year, it is
affecting many more beds than usual. Spring nor'easter storms carried
the bloom quickly from Maine to Massachusetts and around the
Cape. Every year, shellfish is monitored closely from March to
November, fishery officials say. Whittaker says the state had been
closing beds even before red tide reaches them. "We want
to get the beds closed prior to any shellfish getting
to the market," says J. Michael Hickey, Massachusetts's chief shellfish
biologist.

Red tide algae can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning. Toxins affect the
nervous system within 30 minutes, with symptoms that include tingling
of the lips and tongue, headaches, dizziness, and nausea. In
severe cases, muscular paralysis and respiratory difficulties may occur, or
even death; there have been no deaths in New England
since red tide was first officially recorded in local waters
in 1972. No cases of shellfish poisoning have been reported
in this red tide explosion, says Donna Rheaume of the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

But those organisms don't actually harm the shellfish, says Pat Woodbury,
who sells his Wellfleet clams and oysters to upscale Boston
restaurants. Shellfish flush water through their systems, ingesting the organisms
that build up toxins. Once the red tide dissipates, the
toxins eventually wash out of the shellfish and they're again
safe to eat, he says. After testing shows the shellfish
to be free of toxins, they can be harvested and
sold. But this year's outbreak, which some experts say may
last 8 to 10 weeks, "will ruin my summer," says
the shellfish farmer. However, he's concentrating on seeding his beds
and keeping his small crew busy until they can sell
again.

Meanwhile, Roger Berkowitz of Legal Sea Foods, which tests all seafood
for contaminants at its own plant, says he's buying steamers
from Nova Scotia, fry clams from Prince Edward Island, littlenecks
and countnecks from Rhode Island, and oysters from PEI and
Maine's Damariscotta River. Nace, co-owner of Neptune Oyster, says he's
been offering a lot of West Coast varieties since the
closing of local beds.

While some restaurants might absorb the higher cost of serving shellfish
flown across country, local fishmongers feel the pinch. George Adams
of Adams Fish Market in Dorchester, which sells retail seafood
and takeout, has Maryland and Canada clams in the case
now. Prices for frying clams that are normally $60 to
$70 a gallon wholesale, Adams says, cost him $100 a
gallon. He calls these "Fourth of July prices." Kim Marden
of Captain Marden's Seafoods of Wellesley, retailers and wholesalers, says
he brings in mussels from Prince Edward Island, and clams
from Canada and Maryland. The clam prices are higher right
now, he says, since the beds off Cape Ann have
been closed.

At Morse Fish Co., which has been selling fresh and fried
seafood for more than a century on the South End's
Washington Street, "everybody comes in with a question about red
tide," says manager John Blacker. "Everybody reads the paper or
listens to the news, and a lot of people are
staying off shellfish."
</P>
<P>
Blacker wasn't sure where Morse would be getting clams and oysters
now that so many local shellfish beds are closed. Owner
George Doherty handles ordering, but he predicted a price increase
next week, particularly for steamer clams, which Morse normally gets
from Ipswich.
</P>
<P>
"It's not just the red tide that will cause the price
increase," he says.
</P>
<P>
"It's demand. Soon as all the beaches open up, everybody wants
steamers. We can't keep them in the place."
