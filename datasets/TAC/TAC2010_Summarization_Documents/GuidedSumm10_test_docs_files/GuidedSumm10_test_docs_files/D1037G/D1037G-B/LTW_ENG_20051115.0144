GAO Denounces Bay Cleanup Efforts

<P>
The government agency leading the cleanup of the
Chesapeake Bay has consistently overstated its progress while
minimizing threats to the bay and its own failures to address them,
according to a federal oversight report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A Government Accountability Office review found that the Chesapeake
Bay Program Office -- an arm of the Environmental Protection Agency --
has no coordinated, comprehensive plan for cutting pollution in the
bay, even after nearly $6 billion in state and federal money has been
devoted to the effort in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The office also does a poor job informing the public of its work,
the GAO report concludes, and its annual State of the Chesapeake Bay
report ``is neither an effective reporting tool nor does it provide
credible information on the bay's current health status.''
</P>
<P>
The criticism comes amid growing angst among policymakers and the
public that an agreement reached five years ago for cleaning the bay
by 2010 could fail without a big political and financial boost. In the
agreement, known as Chesapeake 2000, the region's political and
environmental leaders proposed cutting the amount of major pollutants
that enter the bay nearly in half over a decade.
</P>
<P>
The cleanup, led by Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington
D.C., along with nearly a dozen federal agencies, is known as the
Chesapeake Bay Program.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to President Bush Tuesday, Sens. Barbara Mikulski and
Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., and Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who commissioned
the GAO report, asked Bush to appoint a task force to ``conduct a
top-to-bottom review'' of federal programs and resources aimed at the
bay cleanup.
</P>
<P>
The GAO report ``raises serious concerns about the Bay Program's
ability to achieve the goal of restoring the health of the Bay,'' the
senators wrote. ``We have written to you in the past appealing for
help for the Chesapeake Bay and urge you, once again ... to make the
Bay's restoration a top priority.''
</P>
<P>
The three senators requested the GAO report after a July 2004
Washington Post article, describing problems with the program office,
prompted a congressional inquiry. The office was described in the
article as having boasted of a nearly 40 percent decline in major
pollutants from the bay's biggest tributaries since 1985 -- yet
monitoring data from the same period showed no such decline.
</P>
<P>
The GAO report takes the office to task for mixing monitoring data
with computerized models, which are meant merely as predictions. That
flaw, combined with a ``lack of independence in the Bay Program's
reporting process, has led to ``negative trends being downplayed and a
rosier picture of the bay's health being reported,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
Though the office has more than 100 indicators for measuring bay
restoration progress and guiding decisions to improve it, ``the Bay
Program lacks an integrated approach that would allow it to
collectively determine what the individual measures mean for the
overall health of the bay,'' according to the report. For example, the
report says, although the office tracks crab, oyster and rockfish
populations, it has no means for determining what the measures taken
together say about the progress made toward restoring the bay's
aquatic life.
</P>
<P>
The report recommends that the office improve and revamp its
assessment and reporting approaches and develop a ``comprehensive,
coordinated implementation strategy'' that is achievable, given the
program's limited funding. It also suggests that the office's reports
undergo independent review to verify their accuracy and clarity.
</P>
<P>
``The EPA and all Bay Program partners are in general agreement''
with the recommendations, said Chesapeake Bay Program Director Rebecca
Hanmer. ``The program has been working on these issues for over a year
now.''
</P>
<P>
She said that the office plans to separate reports on the bay's
health from reports on restoration efforts, which use computer
modeling to predict likely outcomes. But she stopped short of
committing to an independent review of the process, saying, ``I think
that scientific peer review is something that is more appropriate for
the indicators themselves.''
</P>
<P>
The report, she said, ``is a communications tool.''
</P>
<P>
At a time when the Bush administration has recommended cuts in
funding for such key bay cleanup proposals as sewage treatment plant
upgrades, the problems at the Chesapeake Bay Program Office ``are
consistent with those policy choices,'' said Roy Hoagland, vice
president for environmental protection and restoration with the
Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a private nonprofit environmental advocacy
organization.
</P>
<P>
The findings ``reflect the fact that absent an increase in
political will and a significant increase in funding,'' Chesapeake
2000 goals won't be met, he said. ``We have the science and the
solutions. All we need is the implementation and the dollars.''
