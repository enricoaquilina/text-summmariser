CHESAPEAKE OYSTERMEN, IN DECLINE, PLACE HOPES IN AN ASIAN IMPORT

Ice glazes the 39-foot Tracie Leigh, the wind
blowing stiff and cold, as Tom Lagana harvests oysters the
old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
Standing on a square of deck covered with rock salt to
keep it from freezing, he clutches 20-foot poles that work
like giant chopsticks, spreading his arms wide, then pulling them
back toward his chest. A winch lifts the poles until
tongs with metal claws open. Mixed in with empty shells,
muck and rocks lies the catch: a few dozen Chesapeake
oysters.
</P>
<P>
For 25 years, Lagana has made a living harvesting Chesapeake Bay.
But on this gray winter morning here on a mile-wide
expanse of the Choptank River, a tributary of the bay,
he fears for the very survival of the native oyster.
"The oyster industry, and our livelihoods, are in serious danger,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
That is a common worry on the Chesapeake, at 64,000 square
miles the nation's largest estuary. For centuries, bountiful harvests sustained
little towns around the bay. But these days the harvest
of native oysters, decimated by disease, pollution and overfishing, is
measured in tens of thousands of bushels a year, a
tiny fraction of the 20 million bushels that were once
taken.
</P>
<P>
Now officials in Maryland and Virginia are considering a radical approach
to saving the oyster fishery and, they say, perhaps the
bay itself: introducing an Asian oyster that appears resistant to
the two parasites that have killed off so many of
its Chesapeake cousins. Indeed, the Asian oyster is one focus
of a three-year study undertaken by federal agencies, working with
state officials and scientists, on ways to revive the harvest.
</P>
<P>
Those who want Asian oysters introduced in the bay say they
grow bigger and faster and, yes, taste as good as
the native variety. But more than that, proponents say, Asian
oysters, like their Chesapeake counterparts, perform a natural filtering function
critical to the bay's health.
</P>
<P>
A century ago, oysters were so abundant that they filtered the
Chesapeake's entire volume of water in three days. Now it
takes at least a year, and some of those who
see a savior in the Asian oyster believe it could
help resuscitate a bay choked by nutrients, algae blooms and
a decline in the level of dissolved oxygen.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian oyster would not only be good for the livelihood
of the watermen," said C. Ronald Franks, secretary of the
Maryland Department of Natural Resources, but also benefit "the entire
bay and all the species there."
</P>
<P>
Like many commercial fishermen, Franks expresses frustration that decades of multimillion-dollar
efforts to restore the native oyster population by seeding the
bay with disease-free baby oysters have yielded paltry results. Some
scientists, however, warn that introducing a foreign species could bring
in disease and entirely displace the native species, wreaking more
havoc on the Chesapeake's ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
"The real issue is that introducing the Asian oyster is unpredictable
and irreversible," said William Goldsborough, a senior research scientist with
the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, who is not involved in the
government study. "It's a real gamble that you can't turn
back from once you've done it."
</P>
<P>
Oystermen, along with seafood processors and environmental officials in the administration
of Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. of Maryland, counter that
without decisive intervention, the Chesapeake oyster industry will disappear.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't do something quick, there won't be any oysters
left to save," said Larry Simns, president of the Maryland
Watermen's Association. "To save the bay, we need oysters to
filter and clean the bay."
</P>
<P>
But some researchers put the issue differently: Would introducing the imports
clean the bay, as proponents hope, or does the bay
need to be cleaner before they can flourish?
</P>
<P>
"It's real misinformation to think that Asian oysters can clean up
the bay, when in fact it's the converse," said Jamie
L. King, a program officer for nonnative oyster research at
the Chesapeake Bay office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. "You need a cleaner bay before you can create
a new population of oysters."
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
However the Asian oysters fare -- a million infertile ones, relatively
few, have been introduced in testing in Virginia waters --
some scientists say it is unrealistic to view the import
as a panacea. "People just assume that if we introduce
this oyster, it would absolutely expand the fishery, and --
bing bang boom -- people would make more money, and
we would have clean water," said Mark Luckenbach of the
Virginia Institute of Marine Science.
</P>
<P>
Luckenbach and others involved in the research say it would take
not years but decades to establish an Asian oyster fishery
substantial enough to improve the fortunes of the seafood industry
or the health of the bay.
</P>
<P>
Some early findings of the study also temper the researchers' enthusiasm.
Tests suggest that the Asian oysters are more vulnerable to
the diminution of the bay's oxygen levels than are their
native counterparts, King said. In addition, she said, Asian and
native oysters would most likely settle together, possibly competing for
space and as a result causing a reduction in the
growth rate of both species. Cross-fertilization would produce a hybrid
that tests suggest would not survive, she said.
</P>
<P>
Even as they consider Asian imports, scientists also say it is
too early to give up on other, native approaches to
restoration. Among the findings of the latest oyster research is
an untapped potential for techniques like genetic altering of native
oysters to create disease-tolerant strains, as well as wider use
of sterile native oysters, which grow faster because they do
not expend energy that would otherwise be used for reproduction.
</P>
<P>
With the bay's harvest so poor, much of the oyster catch
today comes from managed reserves. Lagana and his oystering partner,
Eddie Hayden, fish on one just off the shoreline here.
They both have equipment for the vastly more efficient power
dredging, but they fare better harvesting oysters on the reserve
even though only hand-tonging is allowed.
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, out on a stretch of the Choptank
that James Michener immortalized in his novel "Chesapeake," Lagana recalled
that a few decades ago, 20 oysters boats would have
been bobbing. Now only the Tracie Leigh was out. Lagana
wonders whether there will be any oysters left to catch
in a few years, or oystermen to catch them.
