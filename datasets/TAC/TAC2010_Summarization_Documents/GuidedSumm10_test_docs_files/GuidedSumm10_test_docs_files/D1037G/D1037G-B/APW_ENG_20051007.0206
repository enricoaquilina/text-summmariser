U.S. oyster farmer ponders future as endangered species tag looms

OYSTER BAY, New York

Dave Relyea and a co-worker make sweeping laps up and down a patch of water in
their workboat, dumping a half-million fingernail-sized oyster seedlings out of
plastic buckets into about 9 meters (30 feet) of water.
</P>
<P>
The oysters take about two years to grow large enough for harvesting, but Relyea
wonders if he'll still be in business by then. That's because the National
Marine Fisheries Service is considering adding the Eastern oyster to the federal
list of threatened or endangered species, a move that could devastate oystermen
like Relyea.
</P>
<P>
"Sure the oyster industry is not nearly as big as it used to be, but the oysters
aren't going to become extinct," Relyea says as he plies waters where Theodore
Roosevelt once fished and where Billy Joel's mansion sits near the shore. "And
if we manage them properly, it's going to be a thriving farming
operation."
</P>
<P>
The federal review was prompted in large part by the situation in Maryland's
Chesapeake Bay, which has seen a dramatic dropoff in oyster numbers. Between the
1930s and 1970s, Maryland's annual oyster harvest ranged between 2 and 4 million
bushels a year. Last year, that number dropped to less than 33,000
bushels.
</P>
<P>
But the Chesapeake is not the only concern.
</P>
<P>
The Fisheries Service, which is part of the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric
Administration, said U.S. Atlantic Coast landings of Eastern oysters dropped
from 160.6 million pounds in 1890 to 2.4 million pounds in 2003 _ a trend
believed to be driven by overfishing, lost habitats and disease.
</P>
<P>
Making matters worse, vast areas of the oyster industry in the Gulf of Mexico _
one of the nation's top producers _ were damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and
Rita.
</P>
<P>
"Oysters can tolerate wide variations in the environment, but preliminary data
suggest that their numbers have declined significantly, possibly due to both
harvest and disease," said William T. Hogarth, assistant administrator for NOAA
Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary decision on the designation is due in January, although Fisheries
Service official Marta Nammack said it could be up to two years before anything
becomes final.
</P>
<P>
Another concern is how people at the dinner table would react. "People would
think, 'How can you eat an endangered species?'" Relyea said.
</P>
<P>
At a congressional hearing in July, Long Island Farm Bureau director Joseph
Gergela testified that the federal government might have it all wrong. "Where I
come from, farmers, baymen and fishermen are the endangered species," Gergela
told lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
That was not always the case on Long Island and especially in Oyster Bay, which
got its name in 1639 from a Dutch sea captain who was impressed by the abundance
of the tasty bivalves. The story, according to Gergela, is that when he arrived,
the captain discovered huge mounds of oyster shells, obviously the result of
many years of feasting by Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
At its peak, there were 150 companies working in the Long Island Sound with
hundreds of boats and thousands of workers. But by the 1960s, the number of
boats and companies dwindled to about a dozen; increased pollution from
commercial and residential development were leading causes.
</P>
<P>
Relyea's company, Frank H. Flower &amp; Sons, is now the only oyster company
remaining on Oyster Bay, and accounts for 90 percent of all oysters harvested
statewide annually, Relyea said.
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights in town is the annual Oyster Festival, slated this year
for Oct. 15-16. It attracts as many as 150,000 people and helps boost the local
economy by US$2.4 million (euro2 million), according to festival
organizers.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 oysters will be shucked and served during the event, said
Relyea, who supplies the oysters.
</P>
<P>
"Come on down," he said as he steered his workboat toward shore. "I'll see you
at the shucking contest."
