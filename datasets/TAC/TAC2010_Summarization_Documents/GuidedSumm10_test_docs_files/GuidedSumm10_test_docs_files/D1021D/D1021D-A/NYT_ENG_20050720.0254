TOO PRETTY FOR PRISON? THAT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Griffin, the loutish lead character in the animated TV series
The Family Guy, gets liposuction in one episode and discovers
that beautiful people enjoy a secret and privileged existence. He
learns this waiting in line at the supermarket:
</P>
<P>
HANDSOME STRANGER: Come on up in front.
</P>
<P>
PETER : But people were in front of me.
</P>
<P>
HANDSOME STRANGER: B /BYou haven't been beautiful very long, have you?
Gorgeous guys like us don't have to wait in line.
</P>
<P>
Peter is taken to a luxury mansion where all the beautiful
people in town hang out. Naturally, even in The Family
Guy's twisted application of TV sitcom rules, Peter eventually learns
the error of his ways and goes back to being
his old unattractive self.
</P>
<P>
In general, I do not mind if beautiful people believe they
have a separate set of rules, as long as they
do not expect me to admire them, and do not
ask me to go out of my way for them.
I would not recognize Paris Hilton, who I gather is
a beautiful person of current notoriety, if she marched in
the front door to cancel her subscription.
</P>
<P>
But occasionally even the lives of beautiful people intersect those of
the less beautiful, and in such cases, the common rules
of society must apply.
</P>
<P>
/BThis brings us to Debra Lafave, B /I/Bthe former (definitely former)
instructor at Greco Middle School in Hillsborough County, who faces
felony charges alleging, shall we say, improper conduct (definitely improper)
with a teenage boy.
</P>
<P>
This week, talks over a plea deal between Lafave and prosecutors
broke down, and her trial was rescheduled for December. Lafave's
lawyer, the veteran and able John Fitzgibbons of Tampa, objected
because the state wished her to serve what he considered
an unacceptable amount of prison time.
</P>
<P>
Explained Fitzgibbons:
</P>
<P>
To place an attractive young woman in that kind of hell
hole is like placing a piece of raw meat in
with the lions. I don't think Debbie could survive it.
</P>
<P>
The comment is instructive. The lawyer might have tried to argue
that Lafave's crimes were not worthy of prison (good luck
with that). He might have argued that mitigating factors, whatever
they are, should spare her from incarceration.
</P>
<P>
But whether deliberate or automatic, Fitzgibbons' argument was precisely that Lafave
should not be subjected to prison because she is beautiful.
She would be "raw meat in with the lions." Cue
images of leering prison matrons from Chained Heat.
</P>
<P>
If I were on a jury and a lawyer argued his
client should not go to prison because he or she
was beautiful, I would be offended. Of course, I would
stick by my oath to consider only the facts. But,
like that crazy umpire in Monday night's Devil Rays game,
I would not be inclined to give the tie to
the runner, if you know what I mean.
</P>
<P>
If she is guilty, she should go to prison. She is
accused of the same crime as many a male teacher
who has abused his position of authority and trust. Either
we change our laws to say it's not as bad
when a woman does it, or we need to apply
the law regardless of who the defendant is.
</P>
<P>
Notice I said, "if she is guilty." Fitzgibbons intends to raise
an insanity defense. That is a tough job under Florida
law, since the legal standard for insanity is being so
wacked out that you didn't know what you were doing
was wrong. But he's entitled to try.
</P>
<P>
If that doesn't work, Fitzgibbons still will be entitled to argue
that whatever pressures Lafave felt should be considered as mitigating
circumstances to keep her out of prison. Since I have
not heard all the evidence, and since I am not
employed by a cable television network, I am content to
wait to hear his case.
</P>
<P>
As long as he doesn't try to argue that she's too
pretty.
