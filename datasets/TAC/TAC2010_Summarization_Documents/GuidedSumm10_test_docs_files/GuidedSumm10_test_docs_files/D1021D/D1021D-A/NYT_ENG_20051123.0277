LAFAVE'S LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAMPA - The spotlight will fade, but her neighbors will always
know. People might stop staring, but someone will always be
checking on her.
</P>
<P>
No matter where she goes, life will not be the same
for Debra Lafave.
</P>
<P>
The former middle school teacher achieved instant notoriety when she was
accused of having sex with a 14-year-old student. On Tuesday,
a judge sentenced her to three years of house arrest
and seven years of probation.
</P>
<P>
Now classified as a sex offender, Lafave, 25, avoided prison, but
she won't be living on Easy Street.
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten over one hurdle with this matter in the criminal
justice system, but now the ramification of being a sexual
offender will be with Debbie for 10 years or longer,"
said her attorney, John Fitzgibbons.
</P>
<P>
The biggest complication for Lafave could be a requirement that she
place her name on the state's sex offender registry. The
database contains the names and addresses of sex offenders and
some details of their charges. It is available to the
public on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Many sex offenders manage to remain relatively anonymous. But for a
woman whose image has been beamed around the world and
plastered on the front pages of newspapers, the registry could
prove not just invasive but dangerous.
</P>
<P>
"Debbie and my office have received literally hundreds of letters from
all over the country, and some of these letters are
disturbing," Fitzgibbons said. "I really don't want to get into
the details, but that could be a concern if people
know where she lives."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Fred Berlin, a Johns Hopkins University professor, said reintegrating into
society is always difficult for sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
Founder of the university's Sexual Disorders Clinic, Berlin said that Lafave,
like most female offenders, is unlikely to repeat her behavior,
but her battle with mental illness and the scrutiny of
her case will present extra challenges.
</P>
<P>
"As a society, we try not to have these situations repeat
themselves," he said, "but sometimes we put up so many
obstacles and challenges that it makes it difficult for them
not to repeat this behavior or do other things. It
affects their self-esteem. It affects their ability to earn a
living and find a comfortable place to live."
</P>
<P>
Lafave, who lives in southeast Hillsborough County with her parents, will
soon seek her own place, Fitzgibbons said.
</P>
<P>
As a sex offender, Lafave is barred from living within 1,000
feet of a school, a playground or other areas where
children gather. In a county with nearly 200 parks, 400
day care centers, 240 public schools and 1,200 churches that
may have youth centers, that will make house-hunting tough. There
is an establishment every half a square mile that she
can't be near.
</P>
<P>
Lafave will also be barred from seeking employment in places near
children. And since many employers require applicants to disclose whether
they've been convicted of a felony, Lafave's job search won't
be easy.
</P>
<P>
Then there's her celebrity status.
</P>
<P>
"She goes to the mall, and people point to her, and
people come up to her," Fitzgibbons said. "Now, as she
begins to look for work and a job, that's going
to be a problem because wherever she works, she's going
to be the center of attention."
</P>
<P>
Besides psychological therapy, annual polygraphs and unannounced visits from her probation
officer, she will have to submit to an HIV test.
Lafave must give a blood sample to authorities so that
her DNA can be registered in a statewide database. She
also must abide by a 10 p.m. curfew.
</P>
<P>
Even Hillsborough prosecutor Michael Sinacore said the road ahead for Lafave
will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
"If somebody successfully makes it through sex offender probation, they probably
deserve a break," he said after Tuesday's sentencing. "More often
than not, they do not make it."
