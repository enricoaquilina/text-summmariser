BC-PADILLA-INDICTED (Miami) -- "Dirty Bomb" suspect Jose Padilla, held by the
United States as an enemy combatant for more than three
years, has been indicted on federal charges in Miami. Padilla
is a Brooklyn-born Muslim convert. The Bush administration had resisted
calls to charge and try him in civilian courts. Two
of the other four indicted with him are from Broward
County. Padilla has been moved to federal detention facility in
Miami from South Carolina navy brig. By DAVID ADAMS.

BC-FLA-LAFAVE-DEAL (Tampa) -- Debra Lafave, the former Tampa middle school teacher
accused of having sex with a 14-year-old male student, will
avoid prison under a plea deal announced Tuesday. Lafave, 25,
pleaded guilty to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery,
a felony, in exchange for a sentence of three years
of community control and seven years of probation. The case
attracted national attention, and her lawyer had rejected an earlier
plea arrangement that called for three years in prison, saying
Lafave was too attractive to survive in jail. By CANDACE
RONDEAUX. With photo of Lafave.

BC-FLA-JUSTICE-MEUS (Wachula, Fla.) -- Jean Claude Meus, a Haitian immigrant, is
serving 15 years in prison for vehicular homicide. Four years
ago he was driving a truck that overturned in Hardee
County, killing a woman and her 8-year-old daughter. The Rev.
Al Sharpton, even Geraldo Rivera, are flocking to Meus' side,
saying the punishment doesn't fit the crime. But his most
surprising supporters are the victims' relatives, who think this was
all a tragic accident, not a crime. Meus' supporters note
that he wasn't drunk or on drugs. He wasn't speeding,
either. And he didn't flee the scene. But police say
he fell asleep at the wheel, which is reckless driving.
Did race play a factor in prosecutors' decision to charge
him, and/or the judge's choice of sentence? By ABBIE VANSICKLE.

BC-FLA-LOBBY (Tallahassee) -- The free trip to Canada for four state
legislators as paid guests of a gambling lobbyist has provided
fresh momentum for the Legislature to revisit the problem of
lobbyist influence in a special session in two weeks. The
first try by Senate President Tom Lee flopped last spring,
prompting applause from lobbyists celebrating the triumph of the status
quo, with its weak disclosure provisions. Lee wants to raise
the issue again in the Dec. 5 session, with limits
on acceptance of in-kind donations that permitted Magna Entertainment Corp.
to spend $48,000 on the July trip to Toronto and
launder the expense through the Republican Party of Florida. By

BC-FLA-CITIZENS (Tallahassee) -- A federal grand jury has launched an investigation
into problems at Citizens Property Insurance, state officials confirmed. Among
those receiving subpoenas is Joe Lebrun, who was involved in
the Texas lawsuit accusing Citizens' former chief operating officer Paul
Hulsebush with a bribery scheme. By JONI JAMES.

BC-TECH-DATA (Undated) -- Tech Data, the bay area's largest public company,
has removed its top European chief from power. Its third-quarter
sales beats analysts' estimates but profits fall on more restructuring
charges in Europe. Wall Street likes the aggressive moves, pushes
Tech Data stock up 15 percent. By SCOTT BARANCIK.

BC-RENT-MOVIE-REVIEW (Undated) -- Rent is an indispensable movie because it freeze-frames
a specific American era while preserving Broadway history by proxy.
But it's also frisky and funny, with a streak of
unconditional kindness as wide as the screen. Grade: A. By
STEVE PERSALL.
</P>
<P>
BC-ICE-HARVEST-MOVIE-REVIEW (Undated) -- The Ice Harvest is a frigid film noir
laced with snappy tough-guy talk, plus a sick sense of
humor that some moviegoers won't see any reason for during
the holiday season. The plot is flimsy, but viewers in
the proper frame of mind can enjoy John Cusack's brand
of deadpan affability, Billy Bob Thornton's bantam rooster outbursts and
a supporting cast relishing their amoral characters. Grade: B. By
STEVE PERSALL.
</P>
<P>
BC-BEE-SEASON-MOVIE-REVIEW (Undated) -- Bee Season has enough interesting ideas for three
or four movies, any of which would be an improvement
over this jumble. It's a family drama with three unhinged
characters worth following, and a fourth who's a typically gifted
movie kid - in this case, a spelling bee whiz.
Each personal story is complex, deserving more attention than co-directors
Scott McGehee and David Siegel provide. Grade: C+. By STEVE
PERSALL.
