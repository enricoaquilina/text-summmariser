Prosecutors released Thursday photographs and secretly recorded tapes
to support their accusation that Debra LaFave, formerly a
schoolteacher, had sex with a 14-year-old student.
</P>
<P>
The tapes, broadcast over local television, recorded LaFave, 24,
arranging an encounter with the youth, while expressing concern that
he not lie to his mother, Tampa prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
"Are you sure?" a woman's voice said. "Like, I just don't, I mean, I
don't want you lying to your mom."
</P>
<P>
"Oh, you're being weird," a boy's voice replied.
</P>
<P>
"Promise? Pinkie promise, say: 'pinkie promise'," the woman's voice
on the tape said.
</P>
<P>
In another part of the tape, the boy expressed his concern about
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't want to get you pregnant or anything. I was just
thinking about it, how we've had sex about three times and I
should've used like a condom or something."
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors released photographs taken in a department store where
they said the teacher had taken the youth, supposedly the day his
relatives began to suspect that there was something between the two.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors said they have seven such tape recordings.
</P>
<P>
LaFave was accused of lewd acts with a child in several sexual
encounters in the Hillsborough County school, in her car, and in the
house that she had with her husband, in neighboring Ocala County.
</P>
<P>
LaFave will plead not guilty by reason of insanity to avoid a trial
scheduled for next year, according to her attorney.
</P>
<P>
LaFave was arrested in June and suspended from her job until the
trial is over. Her husband of less than one year filed for divorce in
August.
</P>
<P>
She faces up to 30 years in prison if found guilty on all charges.
