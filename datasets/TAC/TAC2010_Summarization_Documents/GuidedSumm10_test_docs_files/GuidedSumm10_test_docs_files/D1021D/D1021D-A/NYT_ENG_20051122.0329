SEX WITH STUDENT BRINGS NO JAIL TIME FOR LAFAVE
</HEADLINE>

TAMPA - With just a week to go before trial, the
glare of celebrity had not dimmed. Larry King, Matt Lauer,
Greta Van Susteren - they all wanted Debra Lafave, the
former Tampa teacher accused of seducing a teenage boy. Even
a judge's gag order could not put the blue-eyed blonde
and her media magnet lawyer back in the box.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the boy's family could take no more. They pulled the
plug on prosecution, agreeing Tuesday to a plea deal that
will keep the former Greco Middle School teacher out of
prison.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't imagine sitting there and looking at my son and
then looking at him surrounded by the whole courtroom as
well as looking at Lafave talking about things that shouldn't
have happened to him," the mother said. Her name is
being withheld to protect her son's identity.
</P>
<P>
"It would come out and be written about again and again
and again in all of the media. At what point
would he have had a normal life in high school,
much less be tagged with it the rest of his
life?"
</P>
<P>
Nearly 18 months after her case sent the tabloids into a
tizzy, Lafave, 25, pleaded guilty to two counts of lewd
and lascivious battery as part of a plea agreement with
prosecutors in Hillsborough and Marion County.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the deal, Hillsborough Circuit Judge Wayne Timmerman
sentenced her to three years of house arrest and seven
years' probation.
</P>
<P>
The last-minute move spared Lafave the possibility of as much as
30 years in prison and saved her victim, who was
14 when the sexual encounters occurred, from the crush of
a media frenzy.
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, Lafave will also plead guilty to
three sex charges in Marion County, including one count of
lewd and lascivious exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Hillsborough prosecutor Mike Sinacore said media attention played a big part
in the state's decision to head back to the bargaining
table. He reached a deal with Lafave attorney John Fitzgibbons
shortly before the two were due back in court to
argue over a gag order Timmerman imposed last week.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the victim was set to answer attorney questions at
a formal deposition. But early that morning, Sinacore asked a
judge for a meeting in his chambers to discuss a
possible resolution. Several tense minutes later, the plea deal was
announced.
</P>
<P>
"The victim's family indicated they wanted this case over with," Sinacore
said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement sent a ripple through the courtroom as reporters hurriedly
scribbled in note pads and scrambled for cell phones.
</P>
<P>
But the room fell silent as Lafave stepped to the podium
to face her punishment.
</P>
<P>
"I want to apologize to the court and to the young
man involved and his family for my actions. I accept
full responsibility for my actions and I'm very sorry," Lafave
said.
</P>
<P>
Now classified as a sex offender, the former teacher can no
longer work with or near children and cannot live within
1,000 feet of a school, church or playground. She will
have a 10 p.m. curfew. She must undergo psychological therapy
for four years and submit to a polygraph test once
a year to verify that she is abiding by the
rules.
</P>
<P>
If she successfully completes her first two years on house arrest,
also known as community control, a judge could waive her
last year of home confinement.
</P>
<P>
"It allows the young man involved here to go on with
his life, just as Debbie can go on with her
life. He does not have to go through depositions and
a trial," Fitzgibbons said.
</P>
<P>
Sinacore said he had pressed for three years' prison time during
plea negotiations early this year. Those negotiations foundered in October.
For months afterward, the victim's family held fast to the
idea that Lafave should do time.
</P>
<P>
But in the weeks leading up to the high-profile trial, the
fortitude of the family seemed to wane. Although the teenager
had agreed to detail the relationship on the witness stand,
it was unclear how his testimony about his feelings for
Lafave might impact a jury, Sinacore said.
</P>
<P>
"He did not from the get go want to harm Debra
Lafave. This was someone that he liked," Sinacore said.
</P>
<P>
In the end, the boy's mother decided not to gamble on
a trial and to save her son the humiliation.
</P>
<P>
"That's my goal, to keep him whole," the boy's mother said
in an interview with WTVT-Ch. 13. "She (Lafave) has agreed
on this plea deal. I don't think it's a cakewalk
what's been handed to her. She can begin going on
with her life. Most importantly he can go on with
his."
</P>
<P>
Details of Lafave's past and the student's experiences with her became
clearer Tuesday afternoon after the State Attorney's Office released hundreds
of pages of documents that could have been aired at
trial. The papers include interviews with Lafave's former husband, Kristian
Owen Lafave, 27, as well as a woman she dated
in high school and a co-worker.
</P>
<P>
Some supported Fitzgibbons' claims about her battle with mental illness and
the trauma she suffered when she was raped at 13.
</P>
<P>
Lafave's former East Bay High schoolmate and lover, Casie Diana Martinez,
told prosecutors that the teenage Lafave had struggled with her
sexuality and self-image.
</P>
<P>
"Really, that was from her mom pressuring her to a music
career and trying to fit that mold of being thin,
being a star, you know, fitting that role of being
on stage," Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Lafave's attorney said he planned to raise an insanity
defense. A psychologist hired by the state concluded Lafave was
sane when she had sex with the boy. But several
psychiatrists have since evaluated her and several, Fitzgibbons said, determined
that trauma she suffered after she was raped at 13
and her subsequent mental illness may have led her to
actions.
</P>
<P>
"If we were at trial, the doctors would be explaining how
trauma over the years has affected Debbie. These traumatic events
have an effect on her bi-polar illness. It was my
feeling that any juror who listened to the testimony of
all the difficulties Debbie has gone through would have found
it a very sad and compelling story," Fitzgibbons said.
</P>
<P>
As in the case of Mary Kay Letourneau, the Washington state
school teacher who had a baby with a 13-year-old student,
Lafave's case has generated much scrutiny. Pundits and reporters across
the country have picked through every last detail, from her
recent divorce to a judge's decision barring access to police
photos of her genitals.
</P>
<P>
All along her attorney has turned the spotlight to his advantage.
He nearly lost that strategic edge last week when Timmerman
issued a gag order barring attorneys on both sides from
talking publicly about Lafave.
</P>
<P>
But Fitzgibbons said the temporary ruling would not have stopped the
runaway train of attention aimed at the client he once
hinted was too pretty for prison.
</P>
<P>
"If Debbie was not considered attractive by almost every societal standard,"
he said, "no one would have been paying any attention
to this case."
