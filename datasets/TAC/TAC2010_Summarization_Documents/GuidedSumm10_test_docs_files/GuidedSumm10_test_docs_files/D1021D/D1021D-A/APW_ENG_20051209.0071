A hitch has developed in a plea deal agreed to by a former teacher who pleaded
guilty to having sex with a 14-year-old student, a spokesman for the prosecutor
said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was meant to resolve charges against Debra Lafave, 25, in two
counties. But the judge in one of the counties has balked, Ric Ridgeway, a
spokesman for the State Attorney's Office, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lafave was sentenced to three years of house arrest and seven years probation
after pleading guilty last month in Hillsborough County to two counts of lewd
and lascivious battery.
</P>
<P>
That plea agreement was supposed to also cover charges in Marion County, where
Lafave allegedly had sex with the boy in a sport utility vehicle while his
15-year-old cousin drove.
</P>
<P>
But Judge Hale Stancil wasn't happy with an agreement the Marion County
prosecutors reached with defense attorney John Fitzgibbons and asked for some
changes, Ridgeway said.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgibbons said the judge indicated that he wanted to hear expert information
about a trial's potential impact on the two boys involved.
</P>
<P>
Ridgeway said the attorneys would take a new plea deal to the
judge.
</P>
<P>
Lafave's sexual liaisons made tabloid headlines.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Hillsborough judge said she will forever lose her teaching
certificate, must register with the state as a sexual predator, may not have any
contact with children including the victim, and will not be allowed to profit
from the sale of her story or personal appearances.
