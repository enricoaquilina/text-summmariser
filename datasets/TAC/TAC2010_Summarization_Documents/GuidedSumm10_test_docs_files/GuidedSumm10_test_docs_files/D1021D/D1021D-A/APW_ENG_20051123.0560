<P>
A female teacher whose sexual liaisons with a 14-year-old middle school student
made tabloid headlines has avoided prison time by pleading guilty to having sex
with the boy in a classroom and at her home.
</P>
<P>
Debra Lafave, 25, will serve three years of house arrest and seven years of
probation. She pleaded guilty Tuesday to two counts of lewd and lascivious
battery. If convicted at trial in Hillsborough County, Florida, she could have
faced up to 15 years in prison on each count.
</P>
<P>
Lafave's ex-husband, Owen Lafave, said Wednesday that she was being treated for
mental problems when she committed the crime, but it was a double standard that
she avoided prison.
</P>
<P>
"She is a sexual offender and if it were a male she would have definitely gotten
jail time," he told CBS's "The Early Show."
</P>
<P>
The victim's mother said after Tuesday's hearing that the public scrutiny had
taken its toll on the family.
</P>
<P>
"If we had continued along this path, this would have followed him forever,"
said the mother, whose name was being withheld to protect her son's identity.
"My prayer is that he can leave this behind him and go on and be a happy,
healthy young man."
</P>
<P>
The victim's mother said the boy is "well-adjusted" and shows no signs of having
been traumatized.
</P>
<P>
The boy told investigators he and Lafave had sex in a classroom at the school,
located in Temple Terrace near Tampa, in her Riverview town house and once in a
vehicle while his 15-year-old cousin drove them around.
</P>
<P>
The boy said he and Lafave, a newlywed at the time, got to know each other on
their way back from a class trip to SeaWorld Orlando in May 2004. He also said
Lafave told him her marriage was in trouble and that she was aroused by the fact
that having sex with him was not allowed.
</P>
<P>
Lafave apologized during the hearing Tuesday, saying that "I accept full
responsibility for my actions."
</P>
<P>
Hillsborough Circuit Judge Wayne Timmerman said LaFave will forever lose her
teaching certificate, must register with the state as a sexual predator, may not
have any contact with children including the victim, and will not be allowed to
profit from the sale of her story or personal appearances.
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's hearing, Lafave's attorney, John Fitzgibbons, said the plea was
"a fair resolution of this case."
