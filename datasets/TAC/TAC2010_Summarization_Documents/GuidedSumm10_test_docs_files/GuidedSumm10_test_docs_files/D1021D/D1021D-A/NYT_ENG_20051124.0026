WAVE OF COVERAGE SWAMPS FAMILY, TILTS BALANCE OF JUSTICE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that both sides have admitted a crush of worldwide media
attention helped former Tampa teacher Debra Lafave land a plea
deal that avoided prison time for seducing a 14-year-old boy,
two questions remain.
</P>
<P>
Was the constant media coverage, which eventually convinced the victim's family
to go along with the plea deal, part of the
defense's strategy all along? And should media outlets have tried
harder to avoid becoming the biggest factor in a case
they were supposed to only observe?
</P>
<P>
"To try to use (media interest) to make it more difficult
for the victims' family to go through this process made
sense from a tactical standpoint," said Hillsborough prosecutor Mike Sinacore,
noting that Lafave attended many hearings in the case, ensuring
cameras would capture her every move. "(But) I don't think
even (Lafave attorney John Fitzgibbons) could anticipate all of the
twists and turns and intensity of the media coverage."
</P>
<P>
Fitzgibbons declined to comment directly on how the media might have
impacted the family. He did say, however, that the media
coverage "was by far the most critical factor of the
entire case," highlighting how criminal law tactics must change in
a media-drenched world.
</P>
<P>
"In years past, generally, defense lawyers would have little or no
comment (on high-profile cases)," Fitzgibbons said. "In the last decade,
with the proliferation of 24-hour news, the Internet and the
large press departments of the police departments, you cannot effectively
represent your client unless you can represent that client in
the court of public opinion."
</P>
<P>
And that court reached far and wide, with Lafave stories featured
on Web sites in Russia and China, and newspapers in
Australia and Canada. Last December, the New York Post published
a full-page photo of Lafave modeling a bikini beside a
motorcycle; in July 2004, the British tabloid newspaper News of
the World published the name and school photo of her
victim.
</P>
<P>
A quick look through a database of media stories found at
least 168 print stories since 2003 on Lafave and about
515 TV news items.
</P>
<P>
"Every time a story aired the attention on the victim's family
escalated," said Sinacore, who nevertheless gave most mainstream media coverage
high marks.
</P>
<P>
"What the victim's family said, was every time this came up
the boy would get harassed at school," he said. "If
you had to sit back and just from a societal
point of view, (ask) what impact does the media have
by putting such focus on this case when a young
boy is going to be affected, that's the balancing act."
</P>
<P>
Still, the combination of factors - her beauty, her handsome ex-husband
and a past that included a lesbian relationship - made
saturation coverage inevitable.
</P>
<P>
"I fully admit I was one of the ones eating from
the trough on this one," said WFLZ-93.3 FM radio personality
M.J. Kelli, who featured photos of the bikini-clad Lafave on
his show's web site. "I am in the provocative broadcast
business and I am going to give people what they
want. This was a very steamy story."
</P>
<P>
MSNBC host Joe Scarborough personified the media paradox this week, railing
against the plea deal while perpetuating the news coverage that
helped seal it.
</P>
<P>
"Sex offenders from Maine to San Diego have been sent a
message that if they pick the right victim the prosecutors
are going to throw their hands up," said Scarborough, while
the channel displayed a headline reading "Sex Teacher Walks."
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for MSNBC said Scarborough was too busy to comment
after the show. But Matthew Felling, media director for the
Center for Media and Public Affairs, criticized such sensationalistic elements.
</P>
<P>
"Why is she the sex teacher?" Felling said. "When people report
on male pedophiles, words are tossed around like "predator' or
"mental illness.' In the stories about Lafave, I saw words
like "bombshell' and "romp.' If we want to report on
pedophiles responsibly - and I'm not sold that the media
wants to - we need to make the reporting gender
neutral."
</P>
<P>
Still, there's little doubt the plea deal avoided a trial which
could have brought a bigger media circus than even the
Terri Schiavo case.
</P>
<P>
"The whole world would have been here," said Phil Metlin, vice
president of news at WTVT-Ch. 13 in Tampa. "December is
a pretty slow news month."
