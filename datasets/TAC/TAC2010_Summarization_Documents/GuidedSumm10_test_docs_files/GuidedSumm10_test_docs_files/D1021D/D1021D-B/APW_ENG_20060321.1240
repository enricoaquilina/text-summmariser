<P>
Prosecutors in one Florida county decided Tuesday to drop charges against a
former Tampa teacher accused of having sex with a 14-year-old middle school
student.
</P>
<P>
The decision, announced hours after a judge rejected a plea deal for Debra
Lafave, means the victim will not have to testify.
</P>
<P>
Lafave's sentence in another county for having sex with the same boy still
stands.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and defense attorneys had urged the judge to accept the deal for the
sake of the boy involved. A psychiatrist who examined the teenager told the
judge at a previous hearing that the boy suffered extreme anxiety from the media
coverage of the case and does not want to testify.
</P>
<P>
Marion County Circuit Judge Hale Stancil, however, said the lack of prison time
for Lafave under the plea deal "shocks the conscience of this court," and he
rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Assistant State Attorney Richard Ridgway, in explaining the decision to drop the
charges, said: "The court may be willing to risk the well-being of the victims
in this case in order to force it to trial. I am not."
</P>
<P>
Lafave, 25, was already sentenced to three years of house arrest and seven
years' probation in Hillsborough County, where she was charged with having sex
with the same boy in a classroom and her home. She pleaded guilty Nov. 22 to two
counts of lewd and lascivious battery under a plea deal there.
</P>
<P>
In Marion County, she was accused of having sex with the boy in a sport utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Lafave said at a news conference later Tuesday that she was getting treatment
for bipolar disorder.
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of things in my past that have unfortunately become public,"
Lafave said.
</P>
<P>
"I pray with all my heart that the young man and his family will be able to move
on with their lives," she said. "Again, I offer my deepest apologies."
</P>
<P>
Hillsborough County prosecutor Mike Sinacore has said that the victim's family
had anticipated a trial, but that the media attention prompted the boy's mother
to push for a plea deal.
</P>
<P>
"There is no one that wanted to see Debra Lafave serve jail time more than
myself," the boy's mother wrote in an e-mail to the Ocala Star-Banner over the
weekend. But she said the welfare of her son was more important.
