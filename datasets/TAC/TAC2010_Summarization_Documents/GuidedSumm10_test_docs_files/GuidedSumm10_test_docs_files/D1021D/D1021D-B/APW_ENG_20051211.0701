<P>
The case of a former teacher accused of having sex with a 14-year-old student
should not go to trial after a judge rejected a plea agreement, the teenager's
mother said, according to a local media report.
</P>
<P>
Circuit Judge Hale Stancil on Thursday turned down a plea agreement that would
allow Debra Lafave, 25, to avoid a prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
Lafave was charged in 2004 with two counts of lewd and lascivious battery and
one count of lewd and lascivious exhibition after she allegedly had sex with the
student in a sports utility vehicle while another teenager drove.
</P>
<P>
In comments published in the Ocala Star-Banner on Sunday, the student's mother
said she disagreed with Stancil's decision to reject the agreement and that a
trial would create a "media circus," that would further humiliate her
son.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly feel it would further victimize my son if he was forced to testify
in court," the woman wrote. Her name has been withheld to protect her son's
identity.
</P>
<P>
She disagreed with a therapist who claimed testifying could be therapeutic for
her son.
</P>
<P>
If the case goes to trial, the notoriety would follow him forever, she
said.
</P>
<P>
"He deserves to have a chance to live a normal life, graduate high school and
then move on to college without everyone knowing him as the 14-year-old boy in
the Lafave case," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lafave was sentenced in Hillsborough County to three years of house arrest and
seven years probation after pleading guilty Nov. 22 to two counts of lewd and
lascivious battery for having sex with the boy in a classroom and her
home.
</P>
<P>
A similar sentence had been expected in the plea agreement in Marion County _ to
which prosecutors and defense attorney John Fitzgibbons had agreed. Under the
plea, Lafave would have been required to register as a sex offender, to forfeit
her teaching certificate, submit to warrant-less searches, and wear an
electronic monitoring device when the court requires it.
</P>
<P>
She would not have been allowed unsupervised contact with minors and would not
have been permitted to drive alone without permission from her community control
officer.
