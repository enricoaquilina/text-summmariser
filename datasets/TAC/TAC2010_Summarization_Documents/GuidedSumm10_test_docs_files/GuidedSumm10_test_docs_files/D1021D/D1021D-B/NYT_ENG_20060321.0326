GETTING BACK TO NORMAL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAMPA - Maybe it was when the flowers arrived at her
house in Temple Terrace with the card from Matt Lauer.
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was when her teenage son's school picture appeared in
the pages of a sensational British tabloid.
</P>
<P>
She's not sure just when, but at some point in the
summer of 2004, her world went completely crazy.
</P>
<P>
One minute she was a normal, divorced mom raising two pretty
great kids, working a sales job she loved, cheering at
her son's basketball games, visiting her daughter in college.
</P>
<P>
The next, she was taking the boy to the rape crisis
center for DNA tests on his clothes and fending off
advances from national news shows.
</P>
<P>
All because of Debra Lafave.
</P>
<P>
It would have been different - still terrible, but not so
terribly public - if her son had been involved with
almost any other adult. But Debra Lafave was 23 and
a bombshell, all blond hair, blue eyes and cheekbones. Reporters
even dug up a photo of her modeling a bikini
beside a motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
The tabloids couldn't have dreamed her up if they had tried.
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother, whose name is not being used to protect
her son's identity, told her story to the Times in
several conversations over the past few weeks. She said she
had one thought during the frenzy over her son's sexual
relationship with his teacher.
</P>
<P>
Normal. She would protect her son through this, and somehow they
would find their way back to normal.
</P>
<P>
That summer day just after eighth grade ended, the mom got
a call from her sister in Ocala, nearly a hundred
miles away. Did you know he's here today? She certainly
didn't. Her son was supposed to be at the rec
center back home.
</P>
<P>
She got him on his cell phone. He said he had
been working out at the rec center when a teacher
from his school came by and said she needed to
go to Ocala to buy a present for her husband.
</P>
<P>
His mom was shocked. What kind of teacher takes a student
somewhere without a parent's permission? She would be talking to
this teacher. Her son gave her the home phone number
for Debra Lafave.
</P>
<P>
She got the answering machine. "Hi, this is Debbie!" said a
bright female voice. "And Owen!" said a man. They sounded
like a happy couple. She left a message.
</P>
<P>
Later, the teacher called back and apologized. She said she used
bad judgment and it wouldn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sister from Ocala was calling. She had overheard little
things that the boy and his cousin had said to
each other. It was a mother's intuition. "I think something
more is going on," the sister said.
</P>
<P>
That night, in the car on the way home from his
basketball game, she confronted her son. "You need to tell
me the truth," she said. "Because I know."
</P>
<P>
He was 14. He was overwhelmed. He burst into tears and
told her everything.
</P>
<P>
He first talked to Lafave on an eighth-grade trip to SeaWorld
a couple of weeks earlier. Their relationship became sexual. At
the Riverview townhouse Lafave shared with her new husband, she
performed a sex act on him. They had sex in
a portable classroom and in the back of her SUV.
She was his first.
</P>
<P>
His mother was stunned. This woman was a teacher. He wasn't
even old enough to drive.
</P>
<P>
She called the Temple Terrace police. They set up a sting.
The boy would talk to Lafave on the phone while
they recorded her. They talked numerous times, and in the
final call, Lafave made plans to come by and pick
him up that morning. She asked if his mom had
left for work. He said yes.
</P>
<P>
"Pinky promise?" Lafave said while they listened. "Say pinky promise."
</P>
<P>
She drove up to the house. The blinds were open. The
boy's mom had not gone to work.
</P>
<P>
The mom had been thinking of Lafave as a 40ish woman,
her stereotype of a teacher. She saw her climb out
of the SUV, cops moving in.
</P>
<P>
The mom would remember the young teacher wearing shorts, a tank
top, no makeup. She was pretty. She looked so young.
For a moment, the mom almost felt sorry for her.
</P>
<P>
Why would a girl like that want to give up everything?
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The boy's mom grounded him that summer. Not because of what
happened with the teacher, but because he had lied to
his mother. She raised him to know actions had consequences.
So no computer, no cell phone, extra chores.
</P>
<P>
"He took it like a man," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they were under siege. Reporters found them. One showed up
on their doorstep and knocked, TV camera poised. She didn't
answer. Others talked to neighbors. She wouldn't let her son
answer the door or mow the lawn.
</P>
<P>
The flowers came from the Today Show's Lauer in a crystal
dish with a note saying he would like to talk.
Court TV host Nancy Grace and others would also ask.
A tabloid TV show wrote her a friendly letter, then
accidentally sent her a similar one meant for Lafave's parents.
</P>
<P>
The mom never considered talking. She was poised enough, but she
had no desire to be part of the circus. She
would not do that to her son.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor called. The British tabloid News of the World had
published the story of the "school miss," complete with racy
details - plus the boy's name and his seventh-grade picture.
His mom was outraged. She found a lawyer in London
who sent them a letter, and they took the boy's
picture off the Internet. It cost her nearly $4,000.
</P>
<P>
Months passed. In court hearings, the mom thought Lafave seemed smug.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes she heard the opinion that her son was a lucky
kid, not a victim. She doubted those people would say
the same had it happened to their son.
</P>
<P>
Why had Lafave picked him? Sex offenders sometimes seek out drifters,
the ones whose parents aren't paying attention. But he was
close to his mom, tight with his sister, saw his
dad a lot. Their family was big on holidays, summer
beach trips, Bucs games. He was liked at school. Maybe,
his mother thought, his popularity was what attracted Lafave.
</P>
<P>
Attorney John Fitzgibbons announced an insanity defense, hinting at the tragic
death of Lafave's sister, killed by a drunk driver, and
other emotional upheavals.
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother didn't buy it. Mostly, she felt sorry for
Lafave's parents.
</P>
<P>
By the time the December 2005 trial date drew near, the
boy had turned 16, grown to 6 feet tall and
started high school, though he could pass for a college
student. This could help the defense: The jury would see
a young man, not a 14-year-old boy. He could look
more like a willing participant than a victim.
</P>
<P>
Mike Sinacore, veteran prosecutor of sex crime cases, warned the boy's
mother that things could get rough. She watched her son
grow quiet after sessions of talking with Sinacore, even though
the prosecutor always handled him gently. What would happen at
the hands of a sharp defense lawyer? Not to mention
the cameras in the courtroom and everyone watching?
</P>
<P>
"He didn't deserve what was about to happen to him in
court," his mother said.
</P>
<P>
The last straw was Court TV, expected to be at the
trial. The boy's mom had seen enough of the courts-and-crime
cable station to know that shows about the juiciest trials
are broadcast again and again. Her son could go to
college and they might still be showing the Lafave case.
He could get married and they might still show it.
"It would go on forever," she said.
</P>
<P>
She wanted Lafave punished for abusing her position as a teacher
and taking advantage of her son. She also wanted to
spare him this trial.
</P>
<P>
She asked the prosecutor. Is there another option?
</P>
<P>
It was time to deal.
</P>
<P>
Lafave's lawyer wanted to keep her out of prison. The boy's
mom wanted to make sure Lafave couldn't do this to
another teenager.
</P>
<P>
The plea agreement was carefully crafted. She would plead guilty to
two counts of lewd and lascivious battery and get three
years of house arrest (even Martha Stewart struggled with that,
the mom thought, and she had a mansion.) Then seven
years of probation, during which she could not profit from
her crimes - no movies, no book deals. She would
be a registered sex offender who could not work with
kids. And she had to apologize in court. Didn't matter
if her lawyer wrote the words. The boy's mom wanted
her to say them.
</P>
<P>
Her son had asked before about the possibility of a deal.
She had asked herself how he would feel if Lafave
went to prison. Now, he looked like the weight of
the world was off his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
"I have zero regrets," his mother said. "I have no doubt
we made the right decision."
</P>
<P>
Soon after the deal was sealed, she was at a Bucs
game with her son when she ran into a prosecutor
she had gotten to know. Then she saw Fitzgibbons, the
defense lawyer, and they spoke a few minutes. There they
were, she thought, all going on with their lives after
Hurricane Lafave. And Debra Lafave could not go to a
Bucs game.
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who thinks she got a cakewalk," the boy's mom said,
"she didn't."
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't over after all.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors offered the same deal in Ocala, expecting a rubber stamp.
But Marion County Judge Hale Stancil said no. The mom
was stunned. How could a judge think of forcing a
victim into a trial? A psychiatrist testified that the teen
would be further victimized by the insanity of a trial.
Then everyone waited to see what the judge would do.
</P>
<P>
The call came from Ocala on Tuesday morning, when the mom
was working at home and her son getting ready to
head to the beach for spring break. The judge rejected
the plea. She couldn't believe it. "He has not considered
my son at all through this whole process," she said.
</P>
<P>
And then, finally, it was over. The Marion prosecutors announced they
would drop the charges.
</P>
<P>
Finally, she thought. Some sanity.
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother says that if she has learned anything, it's
this: "Be attuned to your kids. They've got to be
able to tell you anything."
</P>
<P>
Her son has grown up, faster than she would have liked.
He is a sophomore on the honor roll and talking
college. He has a tight group of friends, boys and
girls, though no serious girlfriend. He doesn't talk about what
happened. "He just wants to move on," she said.
</P>
<P>
So he plays basketball, drives with his newly minted license. He
doesn't love algebra. On weekends, he mows the lawn.
