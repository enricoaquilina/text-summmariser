LAFAVE CASE "OVER FOR GOOD'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAMPA - The criminal case against Debra Beasley Lafave, the former
Temple Terrace teacher who gained worldwide notoriety after being accused
of sexually assaulting a student, ended Tuesday as bizarrely as
it began.
</P>
<P>
First came a Marion County judge's rejection Tuesday morning of a
plea deal, a rare and controversial move that meant Lafave
could face a sensational trial and as many as four
decades in prison.
</P>
<P>
Next came the stinging response from a prosecutor, who criticized factual
errors in Judge Hale R. Stancil's rejection order.
</P>
<P>
Then Tuesday afternoon, the State Attorney's Office for the 5th Judicial
Circuit announced a decision that ended all the drama and
assured Lafave would stay out of prison.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors dropped charges of lewd and lascivious battery and lewd and
lascivious exhibition against Lafave, 25, after concluding that the emotional
welfare and privacy of the victim was more important than
sending Lafave to prison.
</P>
<P>
"Well, this case is really over," said Lafave's attorney John Fitzgibbons.
"Over, and over for good."
</P>
<P>
The judge had forced the state's hand, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not satisfied with the resolution, but I'm satisfied this is
the only resolution that protected the victim," said Ric Ridgway,
chief assistant state attorney in Marion County.
</P>
<P>
In a written response to Stancil's ruling, Ridgway's tone was more
biting: "The court may be willing to risk the well-being
of the victims in this case in order to force
it to trial. I am not."
</P>
<P>
Had Marion prosecutors not dropped the charges, Lafave and the former
student from Greco Middle School would have had to go
forward with a trial guaranteed to draw media from around
the world. The victim, now 16, likely would have had
to testify in detail about his sexual encounters with Lafave
when he was 14.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Lafave could have been sent to prison until she
was in her 60s.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Lafave will live under the terms of a plea deal
she reached in Hillsborough County in November. She is serving
three years of house arrest followed by seven years of
probation in exchange for pleading guilty to two counts of
lewd and lascivious battery stemming from her conduct in June
2004.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, speaking at length for the first time since her
arrest, Lafave apologized.
</P>
<P>
"I only pray the young man and his family will be
able to move on with their lives," Lafave said, reading
from a piece of yellow paper as her parents and
fiance stood behind her. "His privacy has been violated. His
picture has been on the Internet."
</P>
<P>
Worldwide media attention, which intensified as Lafave's scheduled trials drew closer,
led prosecutors in Hillsborough and Marion counties to offer Lafave
the plea deals late last year.
</P>
<P>
They had the blessing of the victim's mother, who did not
want her son to go through a trial in which
his identity might be revealed.
</P>
<P>
Hillsborough Circuit Judge Wayne Timmerman accepted the plea in November, but
when Marion prosecutors presented their proposal to Stancil in December,
he balked. He said he needed more evidence of the
trauma a trial would cause the victim.
</P>
<P>
During a March 8 hearing, Marion prosecutors called Hillsborough prosecutor Mike
Sinacore and child psychiatrist Martin Lazoritz to the stand.
</P>
<P>
Sinacore testified that the attention on the case has been like
nothing he ever has experienced, with various media outlets visiting
the home of the victim and his neighbors, sending flowers
to the home and incessantly seeking interviews.
</P>
<P>
When Lafave was in court, cameras followed her every move as
if she were "a runway model," Sinacore said.
</P>
<P>
Lazoritz, chairman of the department of psychiatry at the University of
Florida, met with the victim for 90 minutes. He concluded
the teen would be "revictimized by the system" if he
had to testify during such a highly publicized trial about
his sexual encounters with Lafave.
</P>
<P>
The teen doesn't like to talk about his feelings and "is
not the kind of young man" that responds well to
counseling, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stancil wasn't convinced.
</P>
<P>
"Rarely does one find a witness who enjoys testifying in a
courtroom before a jury and being cross-examined by attorneys," Stancil
wrote in his order, adding that the victim in this
case isn't any different from "most witnesses in any other
case."
</P>
<P>
Stancil wrote that Marion prosecutors' proposed plea, which would have given
Lafave the same house arrest terms as the Hillsborough deal,
"would undermine the credibility of the court, and the criminal
justice system as a whole, and would erode public confidence
in our schools.
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly," Stancil concluded, "if the allegations against the defendant are
true, the agreed-upon sentence shocks the conscience of this court."
</P>
<P>
"It isn't normal that a judge would go against prosecutors like
this," said Tampa defense lawyer Joe Episcopo. "The judges tend
to acquiesce to the state, because the state controls the
charges."
</P>
<P>
Stancil could not be reached for comment Tuesday. But in his
order, he wrote that he would like to have heard
from a victim or witness advocate and from police officers
who spoke to the victim.
</P>
<P>
He said the prosecution or defense should have tried to take
a deposition of the teen and his cousin, 15, who
drove around Marion County while Lafave and the victim allegedly
had sex in the car, to gauge whether they had
difficulty testifying.
</P>
<P>
Ridgway said the teen's cousin was deposed.
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, Lafave and the teen had sex on a
couch in her portable classroom at Greco Middle School, in
the Riverview townhouse she shared with then-husband Owen Lafave, and
in her Isuzu sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Lafave was 23; the victim was 14, and had just graduated
from Greco, where Lafave taught reading.
</P>
<P>
She was arrested June 21, 2004, in the teen's Temple Terrace
driveway, where police waited.
</P>
<P>
In the nearly two years since, Lafave lost her job and
divorced. She recently got engaged to a former boyfriend, Andrew
Beck, and is working as a waiter at a Sun
City Center diner.
</P>
<P>
"I've lost family, friends. My face has been plastered everywhere," she
said. "It's not easy."
</P>
<P>
Lafave said Tuesday that she has been getting treatment and counseling
for bipolar disorder.
</P>
<P>
"Mental illnesses can cause good people to do bad things," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked what she wants to do with her future now that
she cannot teach, Lafave replied that she is taking an
online journalism course.
</P>
<P>
So, after all this, a reporter asked, you want to be
one of us?
</P>
<P>
Her face lit up. She smiled.
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she said. "I would hope that I could reach people
through my writing."
