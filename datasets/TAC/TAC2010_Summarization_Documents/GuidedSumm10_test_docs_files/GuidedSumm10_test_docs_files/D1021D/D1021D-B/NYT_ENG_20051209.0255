Two weeks after the former Hillsborough teacher Debra Lafave avoided prison
with a plea deal on charges she had sex with
a 14-year-old student, an Ocala judge has put that agreement
in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
In a move that surprised many, Marion County Circuit Judge Hale
R. Stancil Thursday said he wanted to hear more evidence
before signing on to a plea agreement Lafave had reached
with Hillsborough prosecutors. The deal, agreed to Nov. 22, gave
Lafave house arrest and probation in exchange for pleading guilty
to charges of lewd and lascivious battery. Hillsborough prosecutors said
the deal would cover charges against the former Greco Middle
School teacher in both Hillsborough and Marion counties.
</P>
<P>
But Stancil rejected it and set a trial date of April
10.
</P>
<P>
Both the male victim's mother and Lafave, 25, teared up when
the judge announced his decision.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wanted to wrap it up. We wanted to wrap it
up, and the mom (of the victim) wanted to wrap
it up," said Lafave's attorney, John Fitzgibbons.
</P>
<P>
The plea agreement Lafave thought would end her case came nearly
18 months after she was arrested in front of the
boy's Temple Terrace home.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Hillsborough Circuit Judge Wayne Timmerman sentenced her to
three years of house arrest and seven years of probation.
Hillsborough prosecutor Michael Sinacore said then the deal would resolve
the outstanding charges in Marion.
</P>
<P>
The victim's mother had said she did not want to put
her son through the ordeal of a trial, adding that
the media frenzy surrounding the case had been traumatic for
her son. Reached by phone, the mother declined to comment
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Marion County prosecutor Stacy Youmans said the Hillsborough plea agreement was
separate from a deal her office negotiated, but said the
reasons for the agreement were the same. In Marion County,
Lafave was accused of having sex with the boy in
the back seat of a sport utility vehicle while his
friend drove around.
</P>
<P>
"It has always been my position that Debra Lafave deserves prison
time. That position changed once we were contacted by the
victims and their families," Youmans said.
</P>
<P>
In the Marion case, Lafave was to plead guilty to two
counts of lewd and lascivious battery and one count of
lewd and lascivious exhibition.
</P>
<P>
But Thursday's ruling could cause the deal to collapse. If Stancil
moves forward with a trial, Fitzgibbons said he may be
forced to ask the Hillsborough court to withdraw Lafave's guilty
plea and fight his client's battle on two fronts.
</P>
<P>
"If the plea deal doesn't hold in Marion County, then we're
back to square one in Hillsborough," Fitzgibbons said.
</P>
<P>
Youmans said the judge expressed concern about several conditions of the
Marion County plea agreement, but declined to give specifics.
</P>
<P>
If the case goes to trial, Lafave could face up to
45 years on the charges in Marion. If her plea
is withdrawn in Hillsborough and she returns to court for
trial, she could face an additional 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Her fate is in Stancil's hands. A Stetson University College of
Law graduate, the 59-year-old judge is a 12-year veteran of
the bench with a reputation for being tough on defendants.
</P>
<P>
Charles Holloman, who has tried cases before Stancil for 20 years,
said he expected the judge to reject the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
"If his ruling today was a surprise to anybody, then they
were inexperienced or they were drunk," he said. "When I
heard what this deal was, I said Hale's not going
to take that. He's not going to put the judiciary
in the position to take that kind of criticism."
</P>
<P>
Stancil realizes his responsibilities as a judge extends beyond victims' rights,
according to Holloman.
</P>
<P>
"When you go before Judge Stancil, sometimes he will appear harsh.
... He is a man of mercy, but his mercy
is tempered by his reason," he said. "He's not going
to give you some sort of political milquetoast decision, even
in a case where the victims might claim that's what
they want."
</P>
<P>
Stancil said Thursday he was prepared to consider imposing a sentence
on Lafave, but decided to wait to hear more from
Fitzgibbons and Youmans.
</P>
<P>
"The judge in chambers indicated to the lawyers that he wanted
some experts' reports on the impact that going to trial
would have on the two young men involved here," Fitzgibbons
said.
</P>
<P>
A pretrial hearing date has been set for Jan. 5 in
Marion County.
</P>
<P>
Hillsborough State Attorney's Office spokeswoman Pam Bondi declined to comment on
Stancil's decision.
