U.S. judge wants plea deal changed in teacher sex case

<P>
A judge has rejected a plea deal in which a former teacher would have avoided
prison time for having sex with a 14-year-old student, prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached last month, Debra Lafave, 25, would have been
sentenced to three years of house arrest and seven years' probation after
pleading guilty to two counts of lewd and lascivious battery. Had she been
convicted of the charges at trial, she could have been sentenced to 30 years in
prison.

<P>
The agreement was meant to resolve charges in two counties, but a judge in one
of the counties balked, Ric Ridgeway, a spokesman for the State Attorney's
Office, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Judge Hale Stancil set an April trial date, but Ridgeway said the attorneys will
be back before the judge with a new deal by then. He didn't say what the judge's
concerns were, only that he wanted changes.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding charges against Lafave claim she had sex with the boy in a sport
utility vehicle while his 15-year-old cousin drove.
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney John Fitzgibbons said the judge indicated he wanted to hear
expert information about a trial's potential impact on the two
boys.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Hillsborough Circuit Judge Wayne Timmerman said LaFave, whose sexual
liaisons made tabloid headlines, will forever lose her teaching certificate,
must register with the state as a sexual predator, may not have any contact with
children including the victim. He also said she will not be allowed to profit
from the sale of her story or personal appearances.
