Mother of alleged victim in U.S. teacher sex case does not want trial

<P>
The mother of a 14-year-old middle school student says she believes the case of
a former teacher accused of having sex with her son should not go to
trial.
</P>
<P>
Circuit Judge Hale Stancil last week turned down a plea agreement that would
allow the former teacher, 25-year-old Debra Lafave, to avoid a prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother told the Ocala Star-Banner for a story in Sunday's editions
that she disagreed with Stancil's decision to reject the agreement and set the
case for trial.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly feel it would further victimize my son if he was forced to testify
in court," she said. Her name has been withheld to protect her son's
identity.
</P>
<P>
Lafave was charged in 2004 with two counts of lewd and lascivious battery and
one count of lewd and lascivious exhibition after she allegedly had sex with the
student in a sport utility vehicle while another teenager drove.
</P>
<P>
Intense media coverage would create a "media circus" that would further
humiliate her son, she said. She disagreed with a therapist who claimed that
testifying could be therapeutic for her son.
</P>
<P>
If the case goes to trial, the notoriety would follow him forever, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Lafave was sentenced in Hillsborough County to three years of house arrest and
seven years probation after pleading guilty Nov. 22 to two counts of lewd and
lascivious battery for having sex with the boy in a classroom and her
home.
</P>
<P>
A similar sentence had been expected in the plea agreement in Marion County to
which prosecutors and defense attorney John Fitzgibbons had agreed.
</P>
<P>
Under the plea, Lafave would have been required to register as a sex offender,
to forfeit her teaching certificate, submit to warrant-less searches, and wear
an electronic monitoring device when the court requires it.
</P>
<P>
She would not have been allowed unsupervised contact with minors and would not
have been permitted to drive alone without permission from her community control
officer.
