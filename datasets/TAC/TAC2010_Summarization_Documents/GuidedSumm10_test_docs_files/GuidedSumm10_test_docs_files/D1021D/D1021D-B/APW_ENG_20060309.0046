U.S. judge asked to reconsider a plea deal for teacher accused of sexual abuse

Prosecutors and defense attorneys tried to convince a judge to accept a plea
deal that would prevent the case of a teacher accused of having sex with a
14-year-old student from going to trial.
</P>
<P>
The victim, who had sex with Tampa teacher Debra Lafave, has suffered extreme
anxiety from the intense media coverage surrounding the case, a psychiatrist who
examined the boy told Circuit Court Judge Hale Stancil at the hearing
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If the case did go to trial and the victim was forced to testify, it would be
detrimental to the teen's health, Dr. Martin Lazoritz said.
</P>
<P>
Stancil said he will decide in the next seven to 10 days whether to accept or
reject the plea deal, which would keep Lafave out of prison.
</P>
<P>
Lafave was sentenced in Hillsborough County, where Tampa is located, to three
years of house arrest and seven years probation after pleading guilty Nov. 22 to
two counts of lewd and lascivious battery for having sex with the boy in a
classroom and her home.
</P>
<P>
She is also accused of having sex with the teen in Ocala, north of Tampa, in the
back of a sport utility vehicle driven by the boy's cousin. A criminal
investigation followed after the cousin's mother saw the pair and alerted the
teen's mother.
</P>
<P>
Lafave, 25, agreed to a similar plea deal in Marion County, where Ocala is
located, that required her to register as a sex offender, to forfeit her
teaching certificate, submit to warrant-less searches, and wear an electronic
monitoring device when the court requires it.
</P>
<P>
If Stancil decides to proceed with a trial, Lafave's plea deal in Hillsborough
County could be revoked. Hillsborough County prosecutor Mike Sinacore said they
had anticipated a trial all along, but the media attention prompted the boy's
mother to offer a deal.
</P>
<P>
Reporters were knocking on her front door, sending her gifts and talking to
neighbors, in hopes of getting an interview with her and her son, Sinacore said.
At one point, the victim's photo and name were posted on a London internet news
site.
</P>
<P>
"She had a level of insecurity about how well her family's privacy would be
protected during a trial," Sinacore said.
</P>
<P>
Lazoritz said the victim had trouble even talking about details of the case and
was terrified that the intimate details of the sexual encounter would be played
out in the courtroom and the public arena.
</P>
<P>
Marion County prosecutor Ric Ridgway said accusations that Lafave may avoid
prison because "she is a woman" or because of "the idea that she's too pretty to
go to jail" are ludicrous. The deal is solely a result of the family's wishes to
maintain their privacy, he said.
</P>
<P>
If the case goes to trial, someone will have to pay the price, Ridgway
said.
</P>
<P>
"The price is being paid by a 15-year-old boy who shouldn't have to pay that
price," he said.
