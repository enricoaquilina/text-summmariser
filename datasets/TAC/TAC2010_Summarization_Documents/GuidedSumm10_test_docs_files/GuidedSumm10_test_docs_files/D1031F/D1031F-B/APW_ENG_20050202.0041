Catastrophe left lasting impact, and a hope that people don't 'rebuild the next one'

<P>
Weeks after the seas retreated, after the minutes of terror along hundreds of
kilometers (miles) of coast, people on the rim of the Indian Ocean are emerging
from their December morning's nightmare to a long, hard future of trying to
recreate an obliterated past.
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 26 earthquake-tsunami took a staggering toll of lives. But for those
left behind, from Aceh to Galle to the shores of east Africa, it also destroyed
a world: of houses, shops and schools, clinics, mosques and farms, roads and
railways, boats and vehicles, bridges, power lines and irrigation channels,
harbors and storehouses, trees, beaches, reefs and lagoons.
</P>
<P>
It will take months and years to rebuild local fishing industries and restore
other jobs, to wash the salt from farmlands, to re-grow coral reefs and
mangroves, to replant uprooted families, to repair wounded minds.
</P>
<P>
The world-destroying waves left economic, social, political, environmental
legacies _ and a geological one 8 kilometers (5 miles) deep in the sea, where
seismologists say a twin great quake is now inevitable.
</P>
<P>
But those who know disasters well hope the Indian Ocean tsunami will have one
more lasting impact: waking up a distracted world.
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get away from this whole idea that disasters are 'acts of God,'"
said Andrew Maskrey, a U.N. adviser to governments on ways to guard against
nature's violence. "In a sense, disasters are constructed _ through
development."
</P>
<P>
Now that they must "redevelop," Maskrey and others say, the Sri Lankans,
Indonesians, Thais, Maldive Islanders and others should rebuild smarter, making
themselves less vulnerable, through more sensible land use, with stronger
buildings, taking better care of natural barriers that could protect
them.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has dispatched experts around the region to help plan this
"resilience" to future disasters. It's calling for reconnaissance satellites to
map out the damage and vulnerabilities. But advice is no guarantee of
success.
</P>
<P>
"Whether the governments manage to implement it is another thing," said Salvano
Briceno, chief U.N. strategist for disaster reduction.
</P>
<P>
One thing governments are managing to implement is an early-warning system for
future Indian Ocean tsunamis. In Kobe, Japan, last month, delegates to a U.N.
conference on disaster reduction came together to promise such an alert system
by next year _ a network of buoys, sensors and communications that, had it been
in place, might have saved many of the more than 150,000 people killed in the
December disaster.
</P>
<P>
That immediate human cost of the tsunami is well known. Less quantifiable are
the numbers of people injured, physically and mentally, the years of schooling
that may be missed, the long-term repercussions of losing doctors and nurses, of
driving people to live in shelters, of shattered families, orphans, parents
bereft of their children, livelihoods lost.
</P>
<P>
In an already impoverished part of the world, an additional 2 million people may
be driven into poverty by the catastrophe, the Asian Development Bank
estimates.
</P>
<P>
The bank's economists say such large national economies as India's and
Indonesia's will move on with hardly a pause. But "national" glosses over huge
local impacts: In two Indian states alone, the loss of livelihoods, mostly
fishing, was the human equivalent of shutting down the economy of Boston,
eliminating all 600,000-plus paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
As for the smaller economies _ Sri Lanka and the Maldives _ the waves erased
years of progress.
</P>
<P>
The sight of broken boats among denuded trees, and the 13,000 fishermen dead or
missing, led Sri Lankan officials to lament that the struggling island's fishing
industry, a rising export sector, was set back a half-century. Along with
100,000 Sri Lankan homes and 150,000 vehicles _ the Asian bank's estimates _
almost all fishing harbor facilities were destroyed in that small country, and
20,000 fishing boats were lost or damaged.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-ocean Maldives, the tsunami swept over almost every centimeter (inch)
of dry land, destroying all roads, electrical lines and other infrastructure on
13 islands. It will take the equivalent of two years' gross domestic product to
repair and rebuild the tiny nation, the bank calculates.
</P>
<P>
Along battered shorelines from Indonesia's Banda Aceh, to Malaysia and Thailand,
to India's east coast, hundreds of acres of fish and shrimp farms were washed
away. Thousands of farm-raised groupers littered Malaysian beaches, dead. In
Indonesia alone, the aquaculture losses were pegged at US$210 million (euro161.1
million), the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports.
</P>
<P>
The onrushing ocean waters also flooded farmlands, destroying rice harvests
along coastal belts from Indonesia to India, wrecking irrigation and drainage
equipment, depositing salt in soils up to 2 kilometers (1 mile) or more inland,
and ruining the water of countless wells for consumption and
crops.
</P>
<P>
The damage doesn't threaten national food supplies, but like the loss of jobs,
it's crippling at the local level.
</P>
<P>
The FAO estimates 100,000 acres (40,000 hectares) of agricultural land were
devastated in Indonesia. Farmers who survived lost their equipment and
livestock, from chickens to water buffalo.
</P>
<P>
The Maldives' subsistence farming _ economically insignificant but vital to many
islanders _ was severely damaged. Coconut, breadfruit, mango and banana trees
were uprooted or poisoned by the seawater. The freshwater lens beneath several
islands _ their only source of drinking water _ was contaminated by salt,
threatening the future of settlement there.
</P>
<P>
Flushing salt-contaminated lands with fresh water would cost hundreds of
millions of dollars, the U.N. agriculture agency says. Waiting for rains to
flush them naturally could take years. In Bangladesh, whose eastern coast in
1991 was swamped by cyclone sea surges, it took several years for paddies to
grow rice again. And not all did: Some are now used to evaporate seawater and
sell the salt.
</P>
<P>
It will take even longer _ if it happens at all _ for shattered, smothered coral
reefs and gouged-out mangrove forests to grow back in the worst-hit spots around
the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
"In the Maldives, in Sri Lanka and Indonesia, the disaster's consequences for
the environment are very severe," U.N. environment chief Klaus Toepfer told the
disaster conference.
</P>
<P>
The long-term effect on coastal and sea animals _ endangered turtle species, for
example _ remains unknown, but Toepfer's U.N. Environment Program has made
preliminary assessments, finding that in Indonesia alone more than 60,000 acres
(24,000 hectares) of the coast-fringing mangrove and one-third of the offshore
coral reef may have been damaged.
</P>
<P>
Both reefs and mangroves are vital feeding and breeding grounds for marine life.
The tsunami showed they're also natural buffers for terrestrial life, including
humans.
</P>
<P>
Reefs ringing the Maldives were credited with helping break the giant waves,
heading off even worse destruction there. In some spots in India, Malaysia, Sri
Lanka and Indonesia, thick mangrove forests similarly softened the hammer blow
of the tsunami for villages just inland, authorities reported.
</P>
<P>
Protecting and restoring these natural barriers is a key way to rebuild for
"disaster reduction," said the U.N. Development Program's Maskrey.
</P>
<P>
"Often, 'reconstruct' is taken to mean replace what was there. But then you're
rebuilding the next disaster, when there could be four times the population," he
said in an interview at the Japan conference.
</P>
<P>
Instead, for example, tourist hotels _ many of which were battered by the
tsunami _ should be situated with "ecosystem protection," such as existing or
replanted mangrove stands, Maskrey said.
</P>
<P>
"Rebuilding smart" also means improving and enforcing building codes; making
replacement hospitals, schools, power plants and other critical facilities more
disaster-resistant, and rebuilding them at less vulnerable sites, the experts
say.
</P>
<P>
The route to a safer future also ultimately lies in a more prosperous one, they
say, since it's poverty that drives people to live in flimsy homes in
undesirable, vulnerable places, and to take on work that exposes them to risk _
in leaky fishing boats, for example.
</P>
<P>
The world may look back on the Indian Ocean tsunami as a turning point, said
Terry Jeggle, a senior U.N. planner on disaster reduction. "I think it will have
a very strong memory input that may translate into policy changes _ the clearest
one being early warning," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Japan conference, specialists from many nations have gotten down to
the business of getting an Indian Ocean tsunami-alert network up and running in
18 months.
</P>
<P>
December's epic tragedy seemed to spur cooperation and political progress in
other directions as well: The Sri Lankan government and Tamil separatist rebels
worked together on aid distribution, and the Indonesian government entered
cease-fire talks with its own separatists in tsunami-stricken Aceh
province.
</P>
<P>
Some in the region suggest the catastrophe may also prompt richer northern
nations to forgive some foreign debt of the less-developed countries in the
tsunami zone.
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, the surest prediction of the disaster's long-term impact
comes from the seismologists, who point out that only a northern section of the
Indian Ocean tectonic plate was involved in the great quake of Dec.
26.
</P>
<P>
"The question is, when is the other part of the arc going to go?" said James H.
Whitcomb, deep-earth chief for the U.S. National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
When that southern section of the undersea arc "goes," off Sumatra, it may send
another tsunami racing across the sea, this time probably toward
Australia.
</P>
<P>
"It's inevitable. It's got to happen," Whitcomb said of this disaster foretold.
Knowing that, he said, "at least gives you time to prepare."
