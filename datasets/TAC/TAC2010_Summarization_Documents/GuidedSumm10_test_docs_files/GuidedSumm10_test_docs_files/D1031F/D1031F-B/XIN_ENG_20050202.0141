China launched an eight-year 
program Wednesday to protect marine biodiversity in the coast of 
China's South Sea, which is with first focus on four sites in 
southeastern coastal cities.

Wang Shuguang, director of the State Oceanic Administration 
said at the project signing function that the four sites comprise 
Nanji Islands in Zhejiang province, Sanya marine protected area in
Hainan island province, Shankou mangrove reserve in Guangxi Zhuang
autonomous region and Dongshan-Nan'ao migratory species corridor 
along the boundary between Fujian and Guangdong provinces.

"The program will last for eight years and China is expected to
inject 12.75 million yuan (some 8.77 million US dollars) for this 
program," acknowledged Wang. "Other funds come from Global 
Environment Facility (3.515 million US dollars) and the US 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (460,000 US 
dollars)."

Rui Yuehua, deputy director of International Department, 
Ministry of Finance, said that China has prepared this program for
10 years. The total budget of 12.749 million US dollars will be 
used to step up the protection of marine biodiversity in the four 
regions, which will later serve as role models for the whole 
coastal region in China's South Sea.

As the project facilitator, Khalid Malik, resident 
representative of the United Nations Development Program in China,
cited the project as "a real partnership."

He said "the tsunami has reminded us of the intimate linkage 
between people and the marine environment, underscoring the need 
for each of us to think globally and act locally."

"Protecting and sustaining the earth's oceans and coastal areas
is essential both to the health and functioning of the planet's 
ecosystems and to the wide spectrum of human activities," Malik 
said.

Li Rusong, the program manager of this project, said that the 
tsunami in India Ocean did the least damage to shorelines that 
were protected by mangrove trees.
