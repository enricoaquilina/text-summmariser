The Indian Ocean's dazzling 
coral and dense mangroves suffered a beating during the tsunami, but 
environmentalists say they also protected the coastline and saved 
lives by absorbing some of the waves' power.
</P>
<P>
And while the deadly waves left behind mountains of debris, they 
also spread clean sand along vast stretches of beach which had often 
become littered and unattractive in tourist towns.
</P>
<P>
Thai authorities at Phuket island's famous Patang beach, for 
example, are now hoping to seize the opportunity to remove sloppy 
oceanfront shops and stalls and rebuild in a way that would better 
preserve the beach's natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have banned many of the businesses from 
encroaching on the beachfront and want shops to move at least 10 
meters (33 feet) further inland, although shopowners are resisting 
the changes.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to rearrange the use of the beach by people 
working and living along the beach, especially the people who do 
their business there," Phuket governor Udomsak Asavarangkul told AFP 
a few days after he proposed the plan to Kamala villagers.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists around the region say the run-away development 
that marred Phuket's beaches also heightened the tsunamis' effects.

<P>
Ridha Saleh, deputy director of the Indonesian Forum for 
Environment (Walhi), said more lives could have been saved if the 
government had paid more attention to environmental concerns in 
developing Aceh.
</P>
<P>
"We have warned the government in Aceh not to build more 
settlements near the flood plains but the warning went unheeded," 
Saleh told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"In the context of reconstruction, the environmental aspect is 
paramount. The new Aceh must be environmentally sustainable," he 
said.
</P>
<P>
In Malaysia, authorities are moving to protect mangrove forests, 
after finding that regions with healthy forests suffered less damage 
during the tsunami.
</P>
<P>
Natural Resources and Environment Minister Adenan Satem said a 
three-month study has been ordered to draw up an inventory of the 
country's mangrove forests distribution.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts will be taken to plant suitable trees along our 
coastline, not only to prevent tidal waves but also erosion. These 
habitats are also a haven for marine life," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's mangroves have long fallen to clear land for housing 
schemes, industrial estates, agriculture, tourism and illegal 
settlements.
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka, the government has enacted tough emergency laws to 
prevent construction within a 300-meter (1,000-foot) buffer zone 
along the coast.
