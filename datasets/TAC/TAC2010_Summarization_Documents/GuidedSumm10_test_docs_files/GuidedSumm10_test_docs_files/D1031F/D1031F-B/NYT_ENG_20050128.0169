FLORIDA FAUNA: STATE A MAGIC KINGDOM OF ANIMALS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You don't have to spin the turnstiles at Disney World to
see a real, live Florida mermaid. You can watch them
cavorting in freshwater springs along the Suwannee River or snorkel
with them in the Crystal River. But be forewarned: They're
not nearly as comely -- at least to the human
eye -- as Ariel. And nobody would call these mermaids
"little."
</P>
<P>
They've been catching the eyes of lovelorn sailors since 1492, when
Christopher Columbus spotted three swimming off the coast of Haiti
during his first voyage to the New World. In his
log he wrote, with palpable disappointment, that they were "not
as beautiful as I had heard, because they had faces
like men."
</P>
<P>
What Columbus actually saw were manatees -- enormous, gentle, slow-moving creatures
sometimes called "sea cows." You can see them yourself at
Manatee Springs State Park near Chiefland, Fla.
</P>
<P>
The park is a magnet for wild manatees, which seek its
soothing waters when their normal habitat grows too warm or
too cold. The shy, 1,000-pound creatures also find in the
park a haven in which to recover from wounds inflicted
by motorboat propellers, an increasingly common event in Florida's congested
waterways.
</P>
<P>
The resilience of Florida and its human population is amazing. After
being buffeted by a trio of hurricanes last autumn, the
state has bounced back and is open for business, eager
to recoup its losses. Most visitors will see little evidence
of the damage caused by Charley, Ivan and Frances.
</P>
<P>
These days people tend to think of Florida's fauna in terms
of mice with high squeaky voices, ducks in pantsless sailor
suits and the gaping-jawed hippos of the Jungle Cruise. But
outside the gates of the theme park is a natural
world of flesh-and-blood wildlife. Anyone who is disappointed not to
be able to go to next weekend's Super Bowl in
Jacksonville will no doubt be delighted to watch real-life eagles,
dolphins, panthers, falcons and sea hawks in the wild. What
follows is a sampling of some of the best places
to view them.
</P>
<P>
Manatee Springs State Park
</P>
<P>
Despite my most determined efforts, the clear freshwater pools of Manatee
Springs State Park provided only tantalizing glimpses of my shy
subjects. But I was rewarded when I strapped on a
scuba tank and facemask and swam to within 20 yards
of a propeller-sliced manatee and her frisky calf, a long-held
dream come true.
</P>
<P>
Nearly as rewarding was the disorienting experience of examining the submerged
bases of the cypress trees as gar, mullet, turtles and
other freshwater species flitted about the roots, then gazing upward
as the trees emerged into the light-filled air.
</P>
<P>
This remarkable park provides a satisfying glimpse into the unusual ecosystems
of northern Florida, and is famous as a haven for
injured or stressed manatees.
</P>
<P>
Mystified by the tea-colored water that flooded parts of the park
overnight, a friend and I climbed over the bright yellow
warning tape and balanced on the railing of the boardwalk
through the cypress swamp to the mighty Suwannee River.
</P>
<P>
During our return we were busted by a park ranger. Instead
of the deserved lecture or citation, he asked whether we
were enjoying our stay in the park and then engaged
us in an informative conversation about the manmade problems that
threaten the ecological health of this special part of Florida.
</P>
<P>
Chief ranger Bill Roberson is proud to call himself a Cracker
who grew up in the area, and he and his
fellow rangers run a friendly park where visitors are given
inspiration on how they can help protect the region.
</P>
<P>
Sea Ventures Marine Education and Crystal River manatee dive
</P>
<P>
Sirenians have fired the imagination of mariners for centuries, an attraction
that has increased through the years as people seek to
get close to the seemingly ungainly but lovable manatees. Sea
Ventures provides a detailed slide show and interesting lecture of
the history, biology and habits of manatees, and threats to
their existence. Only then are guests taken a few miles
up the Crystal River so they can snorkel or scuba
with the current, past a variety of freshwater creatures, and
a rare chance to interact with wild manatees.
</P>
<P>
LOWER SUWANNEE NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE
</P>
<P>
Judging from the towering shellfish middens throughout this wildlife refuge on
the Gulf Coast, the original inhabitants of this area lived
in a land of plenty.
</P>
<P>
With free literature from the park's bins to serve as your
guide, you will discover that the refuge is still abundantly
blessed with wildlife, and this river, marsh and estuary system
will reveal its secrets and specialized flora and fauna that
have adapted to the alternately saline and freshwater environments.
</P>
<P>
The estuary is visited by bottlenose dolphins, manatees and marine turtles,
while the river is home to Suwannee bass, largemouth bass,
catfish, bluegill, otters, alligators and more.
</P>
<P>
On land, raccoons and black bears prowl, and turkeys and white-tailed
deer warily forage. The refuge is a gathering place for
hundreds of bird species, including loons, magnificent frigate birds, snowy
egrets, black-crowned night herons, tundra swans, buffleheads, merlins, American coots,
black-bellied plovers, killdeers, marbled godwits, common snipes, sandwich terns, yellow-billed
cuckoos, hairy woodpeckers and tufted titmouses.
</P>
<P>
If while exploring the refuge you encounter a colorfully clothed character
speaking authoritatively about the area, you're in luck. You've found
naturalist John Purdin, and by all means tag along and
absorb the specialized knowledge of this area he has accumulated
through the decades.
</P>
<P>
COOPERTOWN'S EVERGLADES AIRBOAT TOUR
</P>
<P>
The suggestion of taking a nighttime cruise through the Everglades seemed
sketchy, if not downright perilous, notions that were reinforced by
the Coopertown Restaurant, headquarters of the tour. The restaurant's delightfully
odd decorations, gewgaws and souvenirs aren't arranged as props for
calculated effect -- the eerie ambience is homegrown and a
perfect complement to cruising through the swamp in the dark
in an airboat. The folksy guides are a fountain of
information about the Everglades, which for many of them has
been their home for generations. They can wax poetic about
the importance of the Everglades and the forces that are
destroying them.
</P>
<P>
A highlight of the tour comes when the airboat creeps up
to the many alligators the guides have befriended, giving visitors
a chance to sneak a quick feel of the reptiles'
rough hide, if they dare. The guides are worried that
the U.S. government might shut them down, claiming their tours
stress the swamp creatures. The guides are inclined to opine
that closing the tours down is a stratagem to allow
greater quarrying of limestone blocks in the Everglades, for decorative
facades of fancy new buildings.
</P>
<P>
EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK ANHINGA TRAIL
</P>
<P>
You can slog for miles on trails through the Everglades and
still not see as many interesting animals at close range
as you will on the short, self-guided tour of the
Anhinga Trail in the park at the Royal Palm visitor
center. Impudent alligators lounge nearly on the boardwalk and soak
up the sun throughout the trail. There are big gators,
baby gators, sleepy gators, cruising gators and, for variety, gar,
bass and manatees; snake-devouring anhinga birds and cormorants trying to
swallow squirming catfish; and snakes, both menacing and harmless.
</P>
<P>
Numerous illustrated markers and displays provide information and a context for
all that you are viewing, and the park's staff can
answer any additional questions you might have.
</P>
<P>
FLORIDA BAY OUTFITTERS KAYAK AND CANOE CENTER
</P>
<P>
It was chilling to listen to the guides and staff at
Florida Bay Outfitters provide a clear account of why the
Dewberry Creek and other nearby mangrove estuaries are clinging tentatively
to health before they let us rent the equipment for
an exploration of the estuary.
</P>
<P>
We glided through the mangrove estuary in elegant style -- a
few strokes and then let the wind and current carry
us silently through the edges of the mangrove trees in
a kayak. That stealthy technique allowed us to sneak up
on numerous beautiful jellyfish and juvenile bonefish and barracuda, and
even sharks and rays. We couldn't decide whether to pull
in at a sheltered bay and explore the mangrove trees
and have a picnic lunch, or paddle until we found
find an area to tie up our kayaks and snorkel
in one of the tributary channels. So we did both.
</P>
<P>
MARINELIFE CENTER OF JUNO BEACH
</P>
<P>
When the good citizens of eastern Florida come upon a sea
turtle in distress, they turn to the Marinelife Center of
Juno Beach. The staff has had endless experience helping these
gentle reptiles that have been slashed by boat propellers, shot
by humans, attacked by sharks, tormented by parasites in polluted
water and are otherwise in need of tender loving care.
</P>
<P>
There is no admission fee to visit the center's small but
informative sea life museum and its prime attraction, the rescue
center. I was delighted to see my longtime friends the
green sea turtles happily swimming around in their recovery pool,
and to meet new friends: loggerheads, leatherbacks, hawksbills and ridley's,
young and old, big and small, all being nursed and
rehabilitated in anticipation of their return to the wild.
</P>
<P>
KEY LARGO REEF DIVES
</P>
<P>
A tragic bit of miscommunication sent the Norwegian tanker Benwood to
the bottom of the ocean six miles off Key Largo
during World War II, and provided a boon to divers.
I thought I had seen the best that the ocean
has to offer during dives in Hawaii, Micronesia and Australia,
but the menagerie of sea creatures that has made the
wreck their home was a revelation. Especially surprising were the
purple sea fans, deep purple corals and an array of
parrotfish that included purple ones with light lavender iridescent spots,
along with the more-familiar schools of ta'ape clad in their
happy yellow with light blue stripes, sergeant fish, barracuda, lobsters,
giant red crabs, and feather dusters and tube worms arranged
like Christmas ornaments on a tree.
</P>
<P>
Nearby is French Reef, part of the third-largest barrier reef in
the world and home to Sandy Cove, a maze of
caves sheltering mollusks, crustaceans and schools of fish, as well
as swarms of swirling zooplankton and brine shrimp that keep
the other critters well fed. Molasses Reef contains the Aquarium,
an aptly named home to a delightful variety of sea
creatures, delicate branching corals, massive brain coral and flamboyant fish.
</P>
<P>
The staff at Horizon Divers, in addition to having excellent guides,
is painfully aware of the fragile nature of the marvelous
coral reefs and sea creatures that are the source of
their business, and can cite a sad litany of problems,
as well as suggestions of ways to maintain the health
of this special biosphere.
</P>
<P>
JULES' UNDERSEA LODGE
</P>
<P>
I have long since resigned myself to the disappointment that I
will never explore the mysterious depths of the ocean in
a submersible vehicle. So I was pleased to be able
to find out what it's like experience life under the
sea in Jules' Undersea Lodge in Key Largo. You don
scuba gear to reach the hotel, which is 30 feet
beneath the surface, and you enter through an air lock.
(It's theoretically possible to get there using snorkel gear, but
not recommended.) The staff goes to elaborate trouble to forward
your luggage there, packing it into depressurized containers and repressurizing
it once it's in the hotel.
</P>
<P>
I watched through the portholes of the submerged hotel as other
divers explored the lodge's lagoon, while others in our group
checked out the kitchen, stove, refrigerator, video players and lounged
on the beds.
</P>
<P>
You don't have to stay overnight in the hotel to enjoy
the diving and snorkeling in the lagoon, which are exceptional,
enlivened by a wide range of colorful tropical fish, crustaceans
and mollusks. Small fish dart through the mangrove roots, which
host colorful strings of feather dusters and tube worms fanning
the water for food with their delicate arms.
</P>
<P>
The staff is knowledgeable and eager to share insights into the
environmental pressures on this special part of the Keys, as
well as the park's research and aquaculture projects.
</P>
<P>
From San Francisco, American Airlines offers nonstop service to Miami and
United Airlines offers nonstop service to Orlando. A number of
airlines offer one-stop service to Pensacola and other gateway cities
in Florida.
