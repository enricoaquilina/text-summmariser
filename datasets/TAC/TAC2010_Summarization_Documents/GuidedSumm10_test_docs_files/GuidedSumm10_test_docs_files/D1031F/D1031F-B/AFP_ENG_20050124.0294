<P>
A UN-backed conference on biodiversity was 
told here Monday that Asia's tsunami disaster was a brutal warning 
for humanity to tackle the world's worsening environmental crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hamdallah Zedan, executive secretary of the UN's Convention on 
Biological Diversity (CBD), said the amplified toll from the 
December 26 calamity -- more than 227,000 dead -- was due in part to 
the destruction of natural buffers against killer waves.
</P>
<P>
"Once the immediate humanitarian needs are accommodated, it is 
time to rehabilite impacted ecosystems and to look at lessons 
learned," said Zedan.
</P>
<P>
"Early reports indicate that areas with healthier ecosystems, 
such as dense, intact mangrove forests and coral reefs, have been 
less affected than areas that have been disturbed or degraded," he 
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to use this knowledge in the reconstruction," said 
Klaus Toepfer, executive director of the UN Environment Programme 
(UNEP). "When we strip away these natural forms of protection, we 
place ourselves in harm's way."
</P>
<P>
The conference, taking place at the headquarterdeliver neutral, informed 
and timely advice on species loss.
</P>
<P>
France will push the idea at the CBD, the treaty set up under 
the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, Chirac pledged.
</P>
<P>
A similar scientific panel for climate change exists under UN 
auspices, and its findings have helped shaped the political agenda 
for reducing greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.
</P>
<P>
Of the estimated 10-30 million species on Earth, only around 1.7 
million have been identified and described. Each year, between 
25,000 and 50,000 species die out, the vast majority of which have 
not even been identified, according to scientists' estimates.
</P>
<P>
The loss is likely to accelerate this century under the impact 
of habitat loss and rising global temperatures, stoked by 
fossil-fuel gases which trap the Sun's heat.
</P>
<P>
As with so many problems involving the environment, resolving 
the biodiversity crisis will not be simple, for it raises questions 
that are tangled, not separate.
</P>
<P>
Population pressure and poverty are often interlinked with 
deforestation, overfishing, pollution and other perils to habitat.
</P>
<P>
The 2003 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Wangari Maathai, who is 
also Kenya's deputy minister for the environment, said it was 
senseless to ignore the connection between the environment and 
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the tsunami 
provided an "opportunity to take a hard look at what we are doing to 
protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
"The tsunami and its aftermath underscored not only the 
overwhelming power of nature, but also the fragility of our own 
existence."
