<P>
A major conference of biologists and 
policymakers got under way in Paris on Monday to calls for the world 
to draw the environmental lessons from Asia's December 26 tsunami 
disaster.
</P>
<P>
Coastlines that have proven tragically vulnerable to tsunamis 
should nurture healthy coral reefs, beds of sea grass and mangrove 
swamps, which are natural buffers against killer waves, speakers at 
the UN-backed biodiversity forum said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to use this knowledge in the reconstruction," said 
Klaus Toepfer, executive director of the UN Environment Programme 
(UNEP).
</P>
<P>
"When we strip away these natural forms of protection, we place 
ourselves in harm's way."
</P>
<P>
Hamdallah Zedan, executive secretary of the UN's Biodiversity 
Convention, said the amplified toll from the tsunami -- more than 
227,000 dead -- "vividly demonstrates" the cost of damaging the 
environment.
</P>
<P>
The calamity "brutally reminds us, on a global scale, how 
vulnerable and dependent we are on our natural environment, our way 
of living," said Koichiro Matsuura, director-general of the UN 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the 
venue for the conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference, gathering 1,200 experts from some 30 countries, 
is focussing on the planet's alarming loss of biodiversity, as wild 
species are battered by habitat loss and climate change.
</P>
<P>
The graphic opinion of some scientists is that the world is 
facing its biggest mass extinction in 65 million years, when the 
dinosaurs were wiped out by climate change inflicted by an asteroid 
impact.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, who proposed the forum at the 
G8 summit in Evian, France, in 2003, was to make a keynote speech 
later Monday.
</P>
<P>
Other figures attending the opening ceremonies were Malaysian 
Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Nigerian President Olusegun 
Obasanjo and President Marc Ravalomanana, as well as the heads of 
international environment agencies and 2004 Nobel Peace Prize 
laureate Wangari Maathai.
</P>
<P>
The conference, ending on Friday, will have no power of 
decision-making but could act on the problem by proposing solutions, 
such as creating a world panel of biodiversity experts, sources 
said.
</P>
<P>
A similar scientific panel for climate change exists under UN 
auspices, and its findings have helped shaped the political agenda 
for reducing greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.
</P>
<P>
Of the estimated 10-30 million species on Earth, only 1.7 
million have been identified and described. Each year, between 
25,000 and 50,000 species die out, according to scientists' 
estimates.
</P>
<P>
That pace is likely to accelerate this century under the impact 
of habitat loss and rising global temperatures, stoked by 
fossil-fuel gasses which trap the Sun's heat.
</P>
<P>
According to a study published this month in the British science 
journal Nature, a middle-of-the-range rise in temperature would 
cause the extinction of between 15 and 37 percent of 1,000 species 
in six regions that are rich in biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
As with so many issues involving the environment, resolving the 
biodiversity crisis will not be simple, Toepfer warned.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to "complex interlinkages," such as human population 
pressure and poverty, which encouraged deforestation, overfishing, 
pollution and other perils to habitat.
