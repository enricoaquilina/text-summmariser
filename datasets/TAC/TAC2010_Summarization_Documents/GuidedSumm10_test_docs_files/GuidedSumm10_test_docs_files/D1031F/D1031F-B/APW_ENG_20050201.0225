Myanmar's government said Tuesday that international aid has helped its citizens
recover from the effects of the Indian Ocean tsunami.
</P>
<P>
More than US$1.36 million (euro1.04 million) worth of cash and goods donated by
U.N. agencies and foreign private relief organizations has been distributed
directly to the victims in coordination with local authorities, Deputy Transport
Minister Pe Than said at a news conference in Yangon.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar sustained relatively little damage and few casualties from the Dec. 26
tsunami, which took at least 157,000 lives in 11 countries around the Indian
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Pe Than said the disaster killed 61 people, injured 42 and destroyed 29 villages
in Myanmar's coastal regions. A further 2,592 people lost their
homes.
</P>
<P>
Independent assessments made by international relief agencies gave similar
figures, adding that 10,000-15,000 people had needed recovery assistance,
5,000-7,000 of them on an urgent basis.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar did not request any aid for its tsunami victims, but accepted voluntary
contributions and donations, Pe Than said. The medicine, food and emergency
relief items from many countries, U.N. agencies and international aid
organizations had helped return the tsunami victims' lives to normal, he
said.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear why the tsunami did not cause more damage in Myanmar. The
epicenter of the earthquake that set off the tsunami _ off the northern tip of
Indonesia _ is relatively close to Myanmar's coasts.
</P>
<P>
Pe Than said most deaths in Myanmar occurred in the vast Ayeyarwady River delta
but the country was spared major damage and disaster due to "geographical
conditions, unspoiled mangroves and coral islands, and having uninhabited
islands." Scientists have suggested that natural barriers such as mangrove
swamps served as buffers protecting the shorelines.
