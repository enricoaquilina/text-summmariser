Beaches around South Asia devastated by tsunamis could be restored to
their former glory within a few years, but the marine life through
which the huge waves passed could take centuries to recover, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
Coral reefs, mangroves, fish and other marine life had been damaged
by the tsunamis which rose out of the Indian Ocean on Sunday,
triggered by a massive earthquake near the Indonesian island of
Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
The disaster has left more than 120,000 people dead and up to five
million displaced in the region, with Indonesia, Thailand, India and
Sri Lanka the worst affected countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is so hard to say in brief, but the level of devastation of
coastal areas by the disaster is obvious," director of Conservation
International in the Indonesian resort island of Bali, Ketut Sarjana
Putra, said.
</P>
<P>
"It will take a long time to recover."
</P>
<P>
The ocean's seagrass bed and mangrove ecosystem would also be
affected, Putra said, but it is the reefs that bore the brunt of the
destruction.
</P>
<P>
"The coral reef system might be totally destroyed. It will take
hundreds of years to grow back," he said.
</P>
<P>
The health of the reefs could in turn dramatically affect the size of
fish populations which rely on them for their habitat.
</P>
<P>
Lyle Vail, director of the Lizard Island Research Station on
Australia's Great Barrier Reef, said damage to coral reefs from a
tsunami would likely be similar to that from a cyclone.
</P>
<P>
When a tsunami passes, reef structures grind into each other causing
extensive damage. In serious cases recovery would be slow as there
would be fewer larval animals to repopulate the coral.
</P>
<P>
A major problem would be a loss of fish, displaced by the waves from
their habitat, and other forms of protein which depend on the reefs.
</P>
<P>
Regional marine programme co-ordinator for South and Southeast Asia
with the IUCN (World Conservation Union) in Colombo, Sri Lanka,
Jerker Tamelander, said damage to the marine ecosystem could be
"very, very serious."
</P>
<P>
"You have a region where the marine ecosystem is stressed and
degraded as it is," he told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Tamelander said many coral reefs in the Indian Ocean were just
beginning to recover from damage caused by the changing water
temperatures generated by the El Nino weather pattern.
</P>
<P>
"In the region as a whole I think we can expect very severe ecosystem
effects," he said, adding the recovery process for coral reefs could
take "decades to centuries".
</P>
<P>
A major problem would be the amount of silt, sand and organic matter
churned into the water which would then "smother" vegetation and
marine life. Coral could also have been damaged by exposure to the
air as water was sucked back from the shore before the tsunamis hit.
</P>
<P>
Tamelander says in some cases mangroves, which protect the shore from
erosion and often serve as nurseries for young fish, would also have
been completel0 years," he said.
