JAKARTA, Jan. 16 (Xinhua)-- The Indonesian government Sunday 
sent a research vessel to the west coast of tsunami-devastated 
Aceh to conduct survey of the ocean floor around the zone of the 
earthquake on Dec. 26 last year.

Indonesia's State Minister for Research and Technology 
Kusmayanto Kadiman saw off the ship, Baruna Jaya IV, at Jakarta's 
Tanjung Priok Port.

"We will conduct a submarine survey of the ocean floor around 
the quake's epicenter to find out whether the fault is still 
active and the extent of the damage," said Kusmayanto.

<P>
According to the minister, early information and data on the 
condition of the seabed around the epicenter of the quake would be
extremely useful for establishing an early warning system against 
earthquake, tsunami and volcanic eruption.

<P>
"We are not aiming only at tsunamis but other natural disasters
like volcanic eruptions as well. The plan to set up a disaster 
prevention and management center has already been launched and 
being discussed further," he said.

<P>
The Indonesian government is also sending a technology service 
operation team to Aceh to provide humanitarian aid and technical 
assistance, and in the meantime conduct surveys on seabed and 
damage of the coastal area along the west coast of Aceh, said 
Indonesian officials.

<P>
Some parts of the western Aceh are still not accessible by land
because of earthquake and tsunami and have received only a small 
amount of relief supplies, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The technology service operation team will also carry out 
mapping and water exploration, provide water and sanitation 
management, look for solar energy generated electricity, and 
conduct studies of the affected areas which could be rebuilt and 
those where dwelling would practically no longer be possible and 
should be developed into mangrove forests, said the officials.
