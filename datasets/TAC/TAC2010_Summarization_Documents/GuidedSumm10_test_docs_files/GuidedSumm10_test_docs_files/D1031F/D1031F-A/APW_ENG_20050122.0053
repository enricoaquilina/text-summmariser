In southern India, mangroves absorbed brunt of tsunami, saving lives

PICHAVARAM, India
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For generations, the Irula tribe in southern India made a living out of skinning
snakes.
</P>
<P>
Then a 1972 wildlife law banned such sales and the tribals, who lived in seaside
forests, turned to fishing and worked on a government program to restore coastal
mangrove swamps damaged by human development.
</P>
<P>
When the tsunami struck on Dec. 26, the mangroves in the Pichavaram wetland
acted as a buffer, saving the Irulas and about a dozen fishing hamlets from the
killer waves.
</P>
<P>
"We were saved by the trees we planted in the past," said V. Kumar, an Irula who
spends two hours every morning planting mangrove saplings.
</P>
<P>
"Those who destroyed the forest and built houses on open beaches had to face the
brunt," he said, pointing to a fishing hamlet on a sand bar between the
mangroves and the sea that was completely washed away.
</P>
<P>
There was no loss of human life or property in these villages, located 100
meters (110 yards) to 700 meters (765 yards) from the sea. Elsewhere in Tamil
Nadu state, the worst-hit in India, the sea entered as deep as 1,500 meters
(5,000 feet), washing away thousands of people and their homes.
</P>
<P>
The story of Pichavaram and others like it in areas where trees protected
thatched roofs even as huge concrete structures on open beaches collapsed,
prompted environmentalists to call for stringent rules to protect coastal
ecology. The tsunami struck as India was reviewing coastal regulations, which
critics say were diluted to allow increasing commercial activities near the
sea.
</P>
<P>
"The tsunami has taught us a lesson," said Rohan D'souza, an environmental
historian at the New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University. "By spending
millions of dollars on a tsunami warning system, we may save the people, but not
their livelihood. We need to save the coast."
</P>
<P>
Nearly 11,000 people died in India, mostly in Tamil Nadu state, where tens of
thousands of fishermen are still living in relief camps. They can't immediately
return to fishing because their boats were destroyed and few fish are found
close to the shore. Also, many fishermen are scared to go to
sea.
</P>
<P>
But in Pichavaram _ covered with 2,220 acres (900 hectares) of mangrove forests
_ the local residents continue to fish just as they did before the tsunami. Some
3,000 fishing families in the region depend on mangroves, harvesting some 230
tons in prawns, fishes and crabs annually.
</P>
<P>
"Here, there has been very little impact," said S. Ramamurthy, the officer in
charge of the forests, about 220 kilometers (135 miles) south of Madras, the
capital of Tamil Nadu state.
</P>
<P>
Some trees in rows close to the sea were uprooted, said Ramamurthy as he and an
Associated Press team toured the area on a boat. The waves slowed after entering
the thick forests and the volume of water was also reduced because it split off
into dozens of canals and creeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The mangroves are the best buffer against tidal waves. But they have been
steadily destroyed," said V. Selvam, program director at the Madras-based M.S.
Swaminathan Research Foundation, which helped the government persuade the Irulas
to manage the Pichavaram forest.
</P>
<P>
Mangroves grow in brackish water, in some delta areas where rivers meet the sea.
In other parts of the coast, coral reefs and other kinds of vegetation can also
help reduce the impact of waves and prevent soil erosion, Selvam
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization said it fears
the reconstruction of tsunami-hit areas could put pressure on mangroves and
other coastal vegetations.
</P>
<P>
"What we do know is that the demand for fuelwood, for wood to rebuild houses and
infrastructure and for constructing fishing boats is substantial," said Jim
Carle, an FAO expert on plantations. "This is likely to lead to further pressure
on the coastal forests, including mangroves," he said in a statement earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
After the tsunami, authorities in Tamil Nadu state launched a massive
forestation program along the coast. The program aims to involve fishermen's
families in growing and preserving forests. Officials have asked fishing
families to plant a sapling and dedicate it to a family member who died in the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
The plant will have a small tag with the engraved name of the dead person, said
Akash Deep Baruah, chief forest officer of Nagappattinam district, where nearly
7,000 people died.
</P>
<P>
"This way, they will be motivated to grow vegetation and stop encroaching on
land along the coast," Baruah said. "Also, it will help diversify the livelihood
of the fisherman."
</P>
<P>
Such local efforts, however, could slow unless the federal government tightens
environmental laws in the coastal region.
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1991, India allowed few industrial and commercial activities, including
tourism-related projects, along the coast. Government permission was required to
set up any venture within 500 meters (550 yards) from the point up to which high
tides reach. Commercial activity was completely banned in some areas like the
Andaman and Nicobar islands and fragile patches like the mangroves.
</P>
<P>
Many regulations were eased in the past decade to promote aquaculture, exports
and tourism as part of the government's economic liberalization policies. A
proliferation of shrimp farms destroyed vegetation and caused severe
waterlogging in many areas. To boost exports, officials often overlooked
environmental concerns and allowed industrial projects detrimental to the
coast's ecology.
</P>
<P>
"What we need to do very quickly is to defuse the ticking time-bombs that have
been generated in the past decade on our coast," said Valmik Thapar, a New
Delhi-based nature activist.
