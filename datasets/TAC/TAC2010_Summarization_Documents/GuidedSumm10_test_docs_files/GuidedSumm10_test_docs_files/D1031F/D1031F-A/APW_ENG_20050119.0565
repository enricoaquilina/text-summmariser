U.N. agency calls for rehabilitation of tsunami-affected mangroves

A U.N. agriculture agency called Wednesday for the rehabilitation of mangroves
damaged by the Asian tsunami, saying the move would help speed up recovery in
areas affected by the devastating tidal waves.
</P>
<P>
However, the Food and Agriculture Organization said that massive mangrove
planting should be avoided, especially in areas where there are other important
ecosystems, such as turtle nesting grounds and sea grass beds.
</P>
<P>
Mangroves grow in thickets along tropical coastlines and have tangled roots that
grow above ground. They cover an area of around 15 million hectares (37,000
acres) worldwide, said the U.N. agency, with about 40 percent of it found in the
countries affected by the tsunami.

"Mangroves contribute directly to rural livelihoods by providing wood and
non-wood forest products _ including timber, poles, fuel wood and thatch for
houses," said Mette Loyche Wilkie, an agency expert, "and indirectly by
providing spawning grounds and nutrients for fish and shellfish."

<P>
The damage inflicted to mangroves by the Dec. 26 tsunami was still being
assessed, and changes in soil salinity or fresh water inflow might cause further
damage in the longer-term, the agency said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Mangroves can provide a shield against destructive waves, and the Rome-based
agency said there have been specific cases during the recent tsunami where
damage and loss of lives were reduced thanks to the mangroves.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency said, narrow strips of mangroves, when uprooted or snapped
off at mid-trunk and swept inland, can kill people and cause additional damage.
The agency reported one case in Thailand where the mangroves also damaged
shallow coral reefs.
