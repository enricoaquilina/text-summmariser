There remains 14 mangrove forests for
Vietnam to be protected in the 2005-2010 period, according to a 
recent survey jointly conducted by Vietnam's Ministry of 
Agriculture and Rural Development and the United Nations 
Environment Program, Vietnam News Agency reported on Tuesday.

They distributed over the northern province of Quang Ninh and 
Nam Dinh, Hai Phong city and southern Soc Trang, Ca Mau, Kien 
Giang and Ben Tre province in the country.

Vietnam has in the past two years worked to ensure sustainable 
development for submerged forests, which face over-exploitation 
for aquaculture rearing. According to the survey report, the 
country's mangrove forests have to date dwindled to 155,290 
hectares, a 50 percent drop from 1980. The reduction was blamed 
for the conversion of these forests to aquaculture and farming, 
which has seriously ruined the mangrove forests' ecosystem and 
impacted the sea environment.

<P>
Mangrove forests thrive near the mouths of large rivers where 
river deltas provide lots of sediment. Its roots collect sediments
and slow the water's flow, helping to protect the coastline and 
preventing erosion. Over time, the roots can collect enough debris
and mud to extend the edge of the coastline further out.

At the same time, mangrove forests are teeming with life. 
Shorebirds, crab-eating monkeys, and fishing cats all make it home.
Mangroves provide a safe haven and a nursery for a variety of fish,
birds, crustaceans, and shellfish and have special aerial roots 
and salt-filtering taproots that enable them to thrive in brackish
water.
