<P>
China plans to build a new giant panda 
museum which aims to be the biggest of its kind to introduce efforts 
to save the endangered animal and its habitat, state press reported 
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The main theme of the 5,000 square meter (53,800 square foot) 
museum in Chengdu, capital of the southwest province of Sichuan, 
will be "man, panda and the harmony of nature," Xinhua news agency 
said.
</P>
<P>
Design plans for the museum from China, the United States and 
France are going through final stages of decision making, the report 
said without giving details of the cost of the museum or its 
expected completion date.
</P>
<P>
Early reports said the museum would be part of a 700-800 million 
yuan (84-96 million dollar) Giant Panda Eco Park and Tourist Area 
which is expected to be open to the public by May 2006.
</P>
<P>
The survival of the panda is of great concern to many Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Despite intensive efforts to promote breeding in the notoriously 
undersexed animal, there are only about 1,590 of the endangered 
species living in the wild, all in China.
</P>
<P>
Another 161 have been raised in captivity.
