National Zoo's Panda Gives Birth

The National Zoo's female panda, Mei Xiang, gave birth
early Saturday morning to a squealing cub the size of a stick of
butter, and keepers say she is caring for it tenderly.
</P>
<P>
Mei Xiang, although appearing startled at first by her baby's cry,
quickly cradled the blind, squirming cub and is attentive to its every
need, according to keepers. Zoo officials, elated by their first
successful birth after years of trying, said the next few days are
critical to the cub's survival.
</P>
<P>
``She is doing a great job taking care of it,'' said Suzan Murray,
the zoo's chief veterinarian. ``Like most new moms, she tries to rest
when the baby is asleep, but she wakes up when the baby squawks.''
</P>
<P>
A photo released by the zoo shows the tiny cub resting on its
250-pound mother's arm in an indoor den at the Panda House, as staff
and volunteers look on via closed-circuit cameras in a nearby room. It
may be weeks before they can get close enough to the cub to learn its
gender or weight, because its mother will hold it close and they say
they will not intervene unless something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
The Panda House will be closed for at least three months to avoid
disturbing mother and cub, zoo officials said, but the public will be
able to monitor them via round-the-clock Web cams beginning Sunday
morning. The outdoor panda yard will remain open, and zoo-goers will
be able to see her mate, Tian Tian, when he is outside.
</P>
<P>
Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated March 11. She recently had
been acting like a mother-to-be, sleeping much of the day, eating
little, building a bamboo nest in her den and cradling apples. Hormone
tests gave every indication that she could be pregnant, and volunteers
began a round-the-clock cub watch last month. But pandas often have
false pregnancies that mimic real ones. Zoo veterinarians hoped to
capture a pregnancy on a sonogram, but the panda had not sat still for
one since June 20.
</P>
<P>
It was around 1 a.m. that the volunteer on duty at the Panda House
noticed on camera that Mei Xiang seemed restless and unable to settle
down. The animal honked, grunted and panted, signs that she was in
labor. The volunteer called for backup, and keeper Brenda Morgan, who
had gone to China with the zoo delegation that brought the two pandas
to Washington in 2000, witnessed the birth at 3:41 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The cub was not visible on camera at first, but made itself heard.
</P>
<P>
``The cub came out squealing,'' said Lisa Stevens, associate
curator for pandas and primates. ``We knew right away we had a healthy
cub from that squeal.''
</P>
<P>
The cub will not be given a name until it is 100 days old. Under
the zoo's 10-year loan agreement for the pandas with China, the cub
will be sent there when it is 2 years old. Stevens said cubs generally
stay with their mothers until they are 18 months old.
</P>
<P>
Stevens has been at the zoo through its three decades of attempts
to breed a panda cub. The zoo's first pair of giant pandas, a gift
from the Chinese government to President Richard Nixon in 1972, had
five offspring in the 1980s, but none lived more than a few days. By
the time they bred, Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling were aging and the
female had chronic infections. This set of pandas is healthier, zoo
officials say, and younger -- she is 6 and he is 7. Pandas can
reproduce from about 4 years of age until about 20.
</P>
<P>
Mei Xiang, whose name means ``beautiful fragrance,'' and Tian Tian,
whose name means ``more and more,'' mated briefly in 2003, without
result. They attempted to mate last year, after which Mei Xiang was
vaginally inseminated, and a false pregnancy followed. This year, Tian
Tian's sperm was injected directly into her uterus, a technique that
zoo officials say it has a 55 percent success rate. Panda gestation
ranges from 90 to 185 days. Mei Xiang's was 120 days.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas are endangered in the wild, where only about 1,600
remain in China's bamboo forests, and panda breeding in captivity is
fraught with difficulty. The female panda is in heat only two or three
days a year, which is why artificial insemination is so frequently
employed. Detecting a pregnancy is equally difficult, though panda
experts hope that eventually a combination of behavior monitoring,
hormone tests and perhaps other technology can increase their odds.
</P>
<P>
Only three other zoos in the United States exhibit giant pandas, in
Atlanta, Memphis, Tenn., and San Diego. The San Diego Zoo has had two
successful births.
</P>
<P>
The National Zoo's happy news comes as the animal park emerges from
a troubled period in which its accreditation was on provisional status
for a year before being restored, a National Academy of Sciences
report criticized its management, and its director, Lucy Spelman,
resigned last year.
</P>
<P>
``Is it OK if I skip?'' Stevens asked as she walked toward the
microphones at the zoo's news conference to announce the birth.
``We've been waiting so long for another cub you wonder if it is real.
We're thrilled and a little scared because we want it to go
perfectly.''
