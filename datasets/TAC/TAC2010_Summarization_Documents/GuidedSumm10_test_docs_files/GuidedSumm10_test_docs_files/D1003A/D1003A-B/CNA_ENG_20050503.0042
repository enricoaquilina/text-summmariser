Major local wildlife conservation groups
launched a signature campaign Tuesday against China's offer to
present a pair of giant pandas to the people of Taiwan as a
goodwill gesture.
</P>
<P>
The groups, including the Humanistic Education Foundation, said
pandas are an endangered species subject to special protection, which
should not be abused by politicians as a "gift." 
</P>
<P>
"We support peace and friendship across the Taiwan Strait, but we
oppose use protected animals as a gift with political strings
attached," said a public letter issued by the groups.
</P>
<P>
"Let politics be politics. Don't sacrifice animals' rights and
lives for political purposes," the letter said, adding that
the precious pandas should stay at their original habitat.
</P>
<P>
In a mix of symbolic and concrete gestures, China announced 
earlier in the day "three gifts" -- a pair of pandas plus
concessions n fruit imports and tourism -- for Taiwan people to cap
a historic visit to China by Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's legislative
caucus published advertisements on local newspapers Tuesday saying
that Taiwan should not accept China's panda offer at the expense of
its national sovereignty.
