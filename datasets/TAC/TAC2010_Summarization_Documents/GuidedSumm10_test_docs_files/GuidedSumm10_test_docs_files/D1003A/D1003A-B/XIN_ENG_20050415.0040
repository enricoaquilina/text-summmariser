necessarily effective

Doctors at a leading hospital in 
northwest China say Thursday's operation on a paralyzed giant 
panda has been a success but they cannot tell at the moment when 
it will be on its feet again, or whether it ever will.
</P>
<P>
The operation was conducted Thursday morning at the Xijing 
Hospital, affiliated with the No. 4 Medical University of the 
Chinese People's Liberation Army in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi 
Province.
</P>
<P>
"It was quite a success, but we need further observation to 
tell when the panda will be able to walk again, or whether it'll 
be on its feet eventually," said Prof. Li Mingquan, one of the 
four orthopedists who operated on Kangkang, the injured panda 
found by forestry workers at the Changqing Nature Reserve earlier 
this month.
</P>
<P>
The operation lasted for two and a half hours and involved 
three anesthetists and two nurses, he said in an interview with 
Xinhua Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the operation, doctors reserved 400 milliliters of 
Kangkang's own blood for autotransfusion. The autotransfusion was 
successful and no excessive bleeding was reported during the 
operation, said Prof. Li.
</P>
<P>
He said it was the world's first ever attempt to fix fractures 
in the thoracic vertebra of a giant panda and it was worth the 
risk because Kangkang could die shortly unless it was operated on.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Xijing Hospital said they had prepared a 
mobile X-ray device, an anesthesia respirator and an 
autotransfusion machine for the operation. All the equipment will 
be reserved for future veterinary surgeries.
</P>
<P>
Kangkang was found to be suffering from fractures in the 
thoracic vertebra and a cataract had blinded his right eye. The 
veterinarians said it had probably fallen off a cliff during a 
fight with another panda a couple of weeks ago, because its wounds
were not new.
</P>
<P>
Doctors have named the panda "Kangkang", meaning healthy, with 
hopes it would recover soon.
</P>
<P>
Kangkang's well-being has aroused widespread concern among 
citizens and tourists in Xi'an. A group of foreign tourists 
visited Kangkang last weekend, praying for its earlier recovery 
and vowing to solicit more aid from their countrymen to protect 
the rare species.
</P>
<P>
The panda is between 19 and 21 years old, an equivalent to 42 
to 52 years old in human years.
</P>
<P>
The Changqing Nature Reserve in Yangxian county at the foot of 
the Qinling Mountain Range is home to at least 100 wild giant 
pandas. Wei Pengli, an official with the reserve, said male pandas
often fight over female pandas during the mating season in spring.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas are among the world's oldest and rarest mammals. A
latest forestry survey says there are about 1,590 wild giant 
pandas in the wild and another 160 are kept at zoos around the 
world.
