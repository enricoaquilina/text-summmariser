From the Smithsonian National Zoo's Web site:
</P>
<P>
-- Giant pandas reach breeding maturity between four and eight years
of age; they may be reproductive until about age 20.
</P>
<P>
--Female pandas come into estrus (heat) only once a year, in the
spring, during a short period of two to three days.
</P>
<P>
-- When female giant pandas ovulate but fail to conceive, they
undergo pseudopregnancies, where hormonal changes and behaviors are
identical to a true pregnancy, which makes it very difficult to
determine if a panda is pregnant.
</P>
<P>
-- Panda gestation length ranges from 90 to 185 days, with an
average pregnancy lasting 135 days. This two-month variation in
gestation occurs because the fertilized panda egg usually floats free
in the mother's uterus before it implants and begins developing. Once
the embryo is attached to the uterine wall in late pregnancy, its
development continues until a panda is born
</P>
<P>
-- A newborn cub weighs 3 to 5 ounces. Pink, hairless and blind, the
cub is 1/900th the size of its mother. Except for a marsupial (such as
the kangaroo or opossum), a giant panda baby is the smallest mammal
newborn relative to its mother's size.
</P>
<P>
-- Cubs do not open their eyes until they are six to eight weeks of
age and are not mobile until three months.
</P>
<P>
-- Any baby born to Mei Xiang and Tian Tian would belong to China,
and the National Zoo would likely return the cub to China when it is
two years old so that it could become part of the breeding population
there.
</P>
<P>
-- The giant panda is one of the most critically endangered species
in the world. There are about 1,600 left in the wild. More than 160
pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world, mostly in
China.
</P>
<P>
-- The National Zoo is one of four U.S. zoos that exhibit giant
pandas. The other zoos are in Atlanta, Memphis, Tenn., and San Diego.
