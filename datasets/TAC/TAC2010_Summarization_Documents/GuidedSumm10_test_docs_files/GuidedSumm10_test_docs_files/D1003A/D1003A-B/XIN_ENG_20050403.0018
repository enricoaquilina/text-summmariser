The Wolong Giant Panda Nature 
Reserve in southwest China's Sichuan Province has been fully 
covered by a regional telecom network based on Intel's Centrino 
mobile technology, said Wu Haishan, PR manager of Intel's Chengdu 
business office.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the regional telcom network covers the administrative 
office building of Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve, a giant 
panda museum, and China Conservation and Research Center for Giant
Pandas (CCRCGP), the open-air habitat for the endangered species.
</P>
<P>
With the broadband network, researchers are able to process 
real-time data on the pandas, including photos and video signals, 
around the clock at any given corner of the nature reserve, or 
observe giant panda cubs on a daily basis without having to step 
out of their offices, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
Before this regional telecom network was launched in Wolong, 
communication between the CCRCGP and the outside world was limited
to conventional means of access. Researchers had to walk back to 
their offices to process data or drive several kilometers to send 
disks to outside researchers.

<P>
"Digital technology has changed communication between Wolong 
and the rest of the world and will help promote information 
sharing on giant panda protection," said Zhang Weimin, director of
the Wolong Giant Panda Nature Reserve.
</P>
<P>
"This will not only help increase the number of giant pandas, 
but also help us manage the living environment of giant pandas in 
a more efficient manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brian M. Krzanich, vice president of the Technology and 
Manufacturing Group and general manager of Assembly/Test for Intel
Corporation, said he felt proud Intel technological progress could
be useful in protection of the giant pandas.

<P>
"I talked on phone with my daughter in the States and promised 
her to bring her to Sichuan to see giant pandas at Wolong next 
time," said Mr. Krzanich.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is one of the world's most rare and endangered 
species, with an estimated some 1,000 living in the mountainous 
regions of Sichuan in southwest China, and northwestern Shaanxi 
and Gansu provinces.
</P>
<P>
Pandas are among the world's most endangered wildlife species. 
Statistics from the State Forestry Administration released last 
June show the number of pandas in the wild in China has risen by 
more than 40 percent from 1,110 in the 1980s to 1,590 nowadays, 
while a total of 161 are in captive breeding programs worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increase, the animal's existence is menaced by 
problems including loss of habitat and a low rate of reproduction.
China has 33 nature reserves with a combined area of 1.6 million 
hectares.
</P>
<P>
Wolong, founded in 1963, is the largest. It has an area of 200,
000 hectares and owns 76 giant pandas. With 20 giant pandas on 
lease, including 13 leased overseas, there are now only 30 giant 
pandas in captivity at the Wolong center. The remaining 26 have 
been moved to the Bifeng Gorge Base in Ya'an, also in Sichuan 
Province, to make way for construction of new habitats.
