Love is in the air as pandas at San Diego Zoo mate successfully

<P>
The two giant pandas at the city's zoo retired to their favorite spot under a
few bushes and mated over the past two days _ the only successful natural
insemination of a panda this year in the United States, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
It was the second mating for Bai Yun and Gao Gao at the San Diego Zoo, which
closed its panda exhibit to visitors and pointed its Internet "panda cam"
elsewhere for the occasion. Bai Yun gave birth in 2003 to Mei Sheng and did not
mate last year because she was nursing the cub.
</P>
<P>
Bai Yun will likely give birth to her third cub in about 4 1/2 months, said Don
Lindburg, the zoo's giant panda conservation team leader.
</P>
<P>
Lindburg said Saturday that Bai Yun had displayed signs of being receptive to
mating in recent days, including yipping and raising her tail, walking through
water and scraping pine tree bark onto her head and face.
</P>
<P>
"It's getting her perfume on for the date," Lindburg said.
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials then lifted the gate that separates the two for much of the year
on Friday to let the mating begin. The pandas, both 13 years old, spent about 15
minutes mating in the same spot on Gao Gao's side of the exhibit where they
mated in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Then, Lindburg said, "They pretty much ate and slept. They were pretty content
to sleep most of the day, and try it again this morning."
</P>
<P>
The pandas mated for about a half-hour on Saturday. Researchers detected live
sperm in Bai Yun's urine and determined that she had been successfully
inseminated.
</P>
<P>
Female pandas are in heat for only a day or two a year. Natural mating attempts
in recent weeks were unsuccessful at zoos in Atlanta and Washington, D.C. Both
females were then artifically inseminated, but it is too soon to tell whether
they are pregnant.
</P>
<P>
The recent amorous tendencies of the pair in San Diego are a relief for zoo
officials who tried unsuccessfully from 1996 to 2002 to get Bai Yun to mate with
Shi Shi, the zoo's first male.
</P>
<P>
Artificial insemination resulted in the 1999 birth of Hua Mei, the first giant
panda to survive more than four days in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
About 1,600 giant pandas live in the wild in their native China and another 200
live in captivity there. Less than two dozen pandas live in captivity outside
China.
</P>
<P>
Under the loan agreement with China, all pandas born at zoos outside the country
must be returned to China after the animals mature.
