The discovery of panda traces in 
Fengxian County, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, demonstrates 
that the habitat of the rare creatures is expanding in this inland
province, an official with the Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau 
said.
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 14 last year, Feng Shiliang, a farmer from Youfangzui 
Village, told the Fengxian County Wildlife Management Station that
he had spotted an animal that looked very much like a giant panda 
and had seen giant panda dung while collecting bamboo leaves on a 
local mountain.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the Shaanxi Provincial Wildlife Management Station
confirmed that the dung was left by an adult giant panda.
</P>
<P>
They ascribed the appearance of giant pandas in Fengxian County,
located on the western section of Qinling Mountain, a major 
habitat for giant pandas, to the local government's strenuous 
efforts to restore and protect natural forest resources in the 
region over recent years.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas used to live in Fengxian County before the 1970s 
but later disappeared from the area owing to the construction of 
the railway from Baoqi in Shaanxi to the capital city of Chengdu 
in southwestern Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
A project to protect the natural forest was kicked off in the 
area in 1999. The Shaanxi provincial government approved the 
establishment of the Wuliang Mountain Nature Reserve in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wanyun, head of the bureau's Wildlife Protection section, 
said that traces of giant pandas have also been left and spotted 
in neighboring Zhouzhi and Liuba counties over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The third national survey on giant pandas, which began in 2000 
and ended last year, shows that pandas live in mountain areas of 
20 towns of eight counties along the east-west Qinling Mountain in
Shaanxi Province. A total of 273 wild giant pandas have been 
spotted in an area of 347,864 hectares, which officials say means 
there are 7.8 pandas on per 100 sq km, the highest density among 
all pandas' habitats in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang said, Shaanxi has so far established 13 giant pandas 
protection zones and nature reserves focused on pandas' habitats.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas are said to have been around during the time of 
dinosaurs and regarded as a "national gem" of China. About 1,590 
giant pandas are still at large in the wild, mostly in the high 
mountains around Sichuan Basin, and 160 live in captivity.
</P>
<P>
The central and provincial governments have invested 160 
million yuan (nearly 20 million US dollars) into panda protection 
programs since 1992. China built its first natural preserve for 
giant pandas and began to ban poaching in the 1950s. The pandas 
have been put under state protection in the past four decades 
since 1962.
