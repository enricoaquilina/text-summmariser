Forest coverage in southwestern 
Sichuan Province has increased to 27.94 percent from 24.3 percent 
in 2003, making the region, a major habitat of giant pandas, a 
greener home, according to the local government.

<P>
More than 20 million hectares of forest have been brought under
protection and 3.61 million hectares of forest have been planted 
since 1997. This is a result of two provincial projects, the 
natural forest protection and cultivated land reforestation, said 
Yang Dongsheng, head of the provincial forestry department.

"We have given priority to the afforestation in the habitats, 
especially nature reserves, for giant pandas," said Yang.

<P>
The province's efforts have paid off. The latest national 
survey on giant panda, which was organized by the State Forestry 
Administration, showed that the population and habitat of the 
pandas in Sichuan have both increased 30 percent during the past 
seven years.

"Now China has about 1,700 giant pandas and 76 percent of them 
live in Sichuan," said Yang, adding that the provincial government
has obtained a financial support of more than 24 million yuan (2.
89 million US dollars) for nature reserve construction from the 
central government.

<P>
"We will definitely first consider the panda natural reserves 
when planning how to use the money," said the official.
