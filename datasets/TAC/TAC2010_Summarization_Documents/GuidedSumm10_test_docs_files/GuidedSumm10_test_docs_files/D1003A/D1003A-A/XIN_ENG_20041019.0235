through natural selection, which will result in similar heredities, "
said a zookeeper. "The inbreeding among giant pandas in the same
areas easily leads to the species' degeneration."

There are 11 giant pandas in Beijing Zoo and only one was caught in
the wild, with the other ten artificially bred.
