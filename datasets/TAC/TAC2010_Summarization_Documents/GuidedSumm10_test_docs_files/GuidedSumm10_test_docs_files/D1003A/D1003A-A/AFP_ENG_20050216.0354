<P>
China's endangered panda is migrating 
into forest areas restored by the government, the re-discovery of 
its dung in northern Shaanxi province indicates, state press 
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Scatologists identified the panda droppings in the region's 
Qinling mountains where it lived 30 years ago, while locals have 
reported sighting animals resembling the bear, Xinhua news agency 
reported.
</P>
<P>
The reappearance of the panda in the western parts of the 
Qinling mountains was attributed to recent efforts by the government 
to restore the region's natural habitat, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Qinling panda has been identified as a sub-species of the 
giant panda that mainly resides in southwestern Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
Only around 1,600 pandas are believed to live in the wild, with 
some 300 of the sub-species living in the Qinling mountains, while 
the other 1,300 giant pandas live elsewhere in China, Xinhua said in 
a separate report.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of bio-diversity protection, Qinling and Sichuan 
pandas need equal protection, but it is a more urgent task to rescue 
and protect Qinling pandas due to their smaller number," Wang 
Wanyun, chief of the Wild Animals Protection section of the Shaanxi 
Provincial Forestry Bureau, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas, said to have been around during the time of 
dinosaurs, are cited as a "national gem" of China. The Qinling 
pandas are believed to have separated from the giant panda about 
50,000 years ago, Chinese researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Last week Xinhua reported that some 7,420 hectares of bamboo, 
the panda's favourite food, bloomed and died in December in 
neighboring Gansu province, 200 kilometers (120 miles) west of the 
Qinling mountains.
</P>
<P>
This has meant there is little for pandas to eat in Gansu's 
Baishuijiang nature park.
