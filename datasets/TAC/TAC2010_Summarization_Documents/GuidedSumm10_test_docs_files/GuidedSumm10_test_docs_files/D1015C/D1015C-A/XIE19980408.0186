<HEADLINE> China Taking Steps To Protect Tropical Rain Forest (1) </HEADLINE>

KUNMING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China's largest tropical rain
forest, in the Xishuangbanna nature reserve in Yunnan Province,
will get further protection when the reserve is enlarged from
247,000 ha to 533,000 ha, according to Zhuang Yan, head of the
Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Zhuang says that they are removing itinerant farmers from the
rain forest and helping them settle elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Han Xingguo, of the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden,
says that the Himalayas acts as a natural protective screen,
stopping cold air from the north, while warm, moist air from the
Indian Ocean brings plentiful rain.
</P>
<P>
This allows the tropical rain forest to harbor many rare and
valuable flora and fauna that are on the verge of extinction
elsewhere, Han says, but because it's between a torrid zone and a
subtropical zone, it is more fragile than those at the equator.
</P>
<P>
Xishuangbanna has at least 58 species of rare or endangered
plants, 15 percent of China's total number, and it is home to 102
species of mammals and 427 species of birds, a quarter and a third
of China's total, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Protecting the area means protecting an important gene
storehouse, Han says.
</P>
<P>
The first nature reserve was established on 57,000 ha of land
in Xishuangbanna as early as in 1959, and after nearly four
decades it has grown to 247,000 ha with most of the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
The Academy of Sciences has observation posts in the forest to
study the bio-diversity and scientists have moved 3,000 rare
plants to a special 90-ha area for protection.
