<P>
KUNMING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Xishuangbanna, one of China's
largest tropical rain forest reserves, will almost double its area
to bring more wild plants and animals under protection.
</P>
<P>
The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of southwest
China's Yunnan Province has decided to enlarge the reserve area to
470,000 hectares from its present 268,000 ha., according to the
local government.
</P>
<P>
The government has also formed a team of armed patrolmen to
discourage poaching and illegal lumbering in the area.
</P>
<P>
The area, bordering on Myanmar and Laos, earned its reputation
as "a kingdom of plants and animals" for its more than 20,000
species of plants, 429 species of birds, and 67 species of animals.
</P>
<P>
China's largest group of wild Indian elephants, as well as
gaurus, peacocks, gibbons, and 105 other endangered species under
protection, inhabit the primeval forest.
