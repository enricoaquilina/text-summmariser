DAR ES SALAAM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma has called for concerted efforts and cooperation
among African nations in designing programs to curb deforestation
and land degradation.
</P>
<P>
Juma made the appeal while opening a five-day international
workshop on composite materials and waste minimization here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is great hope in new technologies to turn
agricultural residues and wastes into useful construction
materials and therefore reduce dependence on wood products.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president noted that deforestation and land
degradation are taking place at a great pace in the country,
cautioning that unless drastic measures were taken, Tanzania and
many other African countries would soon experience
desertification.
</P>
<P>
He said that the indiscriminate use of forests is largely
caused by poverty, "symbolized by such negative practices as
rampant felling of trees for firewood and bad farming practices."
</P>
<P>
The dwindling rain forest reserves and rapid expansion of the
Sahara desert southwards pose a threat to the survival of the
people in the African countries, Juma warned.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is being attended by experts from 14 countries in
Africa and Europe.
