KUNMING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Yunnan
Province has launched a project to strengthen environmental
protection, and will pour more investment into the sector.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan plans to achieve widespread improvement in its
environment by the first decade of the next century, with forest
coverage rate hitting 30 percent, and the area of natural reserve
zones accounting for eight percent of the province's total land.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be focused on 100 severely polluting sources, and
provincial officials will close 15 kinds of small enterprises. By
the year 2000, the volume of waste discharged by Yunnan will be
reduced to the national standard.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan also has decided to strengthen environmental protection
of its lake areas, which are the main residential areas there, by
working out many restrictions for the use of lake resources. It
has already succeeded in improving the water quality of the
Dianchi Lake and Nanpanjiang River.
</P>
<P>
Regional ecological protection programs have also been launched
to reduce the deterioration of the ecological environment. The
province has limited the number of trees to be chopped down in the
forest area in northwest Yunnan and has stopped building sugar
factories in the Xishuangbanna region to preserve the only
tropical rain forest in the country located there.
