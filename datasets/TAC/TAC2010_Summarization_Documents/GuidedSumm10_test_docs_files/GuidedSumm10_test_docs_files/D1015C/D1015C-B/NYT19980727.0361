COMMENTARY: IN BRAZIL, POLITICS IS THE ECOSYSTEM

   UNA, Brazil _ It's not often you get to walk through one of the
world's greatest rain forests at treetop level. It's not everywhere
you can look one of the rarest monkeys on earth, the golden-headed
lion tamarin, in the eye as he jumps from tree to tree. It's not
your average Sunday when you share a path with a caravan of
leaf-cutter ants carting away chunks of leaves to their anthill the
size of a pitcher's mound. It's not often you see termite nests as
big as pumpkins, hanging from rubber trees dripping with natural
latex. It is not every forest where a single hectare of land
contains as many as 450 different tree species, all wrestling for
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   No, Virginia, this is not the Rainforest Cafe. This is the real
deal. It is an eco-tourist park in Brazil's spectacular Atlantic
rain forest. The eco-park was built last year by rock climbers who
used bows and arrows to shoot ropes over the 100-foot-high trees
and then wove the ropes and netting together to create a treetop
canopy walkway, with connecting tree houses. The walkway winds
through the top of the rain forest and above cascading waterfalls.
Though the ropes and planks sway as you walk, the view is worth
every careful step.
</P>
<P>
   The canopy walk is located outside the town of Una, in
northeastern Brazil, where the Atlantic Rain Forest once covered
the entire coast. Today only 5 percent has survived loggers and
slash-and-burn farmers. I toured the Una area forest with
Conservation International, which, using grants from Budweiser and
Ford, is trying to help save what's left of one of the great
ecosystems on the planet by creating a tourist industry here that
will pay better than logging.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a travel column. This is a column about the
unusual coalition that formed to make this canopy walkway possible.
</P>
<P>
   First there is Keith Alger, who runs an environmental
organization near Una with 15 Brazilian scientists. Alger, an
American political scientist married to a Brazilian monkey
specialist, came here originally with the very American
environmentalist view that he would save the rain forest by helping
educate Brazilians about its ecological significance. He learned,
however, that as long as he couldn't provide jobs for the loggers
who would be put out of business by keeping the rain forest
pristine, he was talking to himself. Says Alger: ``They would tell
me that they want to save the rain forest, but their jobs were also
endangered species. If I wanted to save the rain forest, I had to
help deliver jobs for them.''
</P>
<P>
   So Alger became an environmental entrepreneur. With one hand he
and his Brazilian team fought the loggers in a seven-year battle
that ended two months ago with the Brazilian government finally
banning all logging in this rain forest. With the other hand he
worked with the mayor of Una, himself a logger, to create jobs _
through eco-tourism projects like the canopy walk (which is near a
five-star hotel that now employs 600 people), by increasing farming
within the rain forest with crops like cocoa and coffee that can be
harvested in the shade of the trees, and by helping the local
government line up farm loans and computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
   This effort led him to George St. Laurent, an American
entrepreneur-turned-environmentalist who opened a factory in Bahia
state, where Una is located. His company, Vitech, manufactures
personal computers for the Brazilian market in an old cocoa
factory. St. Laurent got tax incentives from the governor of Bahia
to open his high-tech factory here. But he told the governor that
he needed more than tax breaks if he was going to attract computer
engineers from Sao Paulo and Silicon Valley to move to Bahia. ``I
told him we need a nice environment,'' said St. Laurent. ``I told
him computer engineers can live anywhere. They want a high quality
of life and places they can go on weekends. If they happen to live
next to one of the most exciting biodiversity systems, they would
rather be part of it than watch it destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, this brought around the mayor of Una, Dejair
Birschner. The mayor clearly understands now that the rain forest
has to be protected, even though it has put him out of business.
But practically, he has hundreds of people out of work, and loggers
are threatening him personally. ``Some 40 percent of our people
live in wooden shacks,'' said the mayor, ``and since the cocoa
industry collapsed, things have gotten really bad here. I don't
blame Keith for telling us the truth _ that logging was not
sustainable. But if people can't eat, they will cut trees, and no
one can stop them. We will have to produce jobs ourselves. But
Keith will have to play his part too.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. The only way to save the rain forest today is with
this sort of collaboration: environmentalists who can create jobs,
high-tech entrepreneurs ready to use their enormous leverage in
today's world to promote the environment, groups like Conservation
International that can get corporate sponsors to kick in, and local
officials ready to adapt. Without more coalitions like this, the
only rain forest your kids will ever see will indeed be the
Rainforest Cafe.
