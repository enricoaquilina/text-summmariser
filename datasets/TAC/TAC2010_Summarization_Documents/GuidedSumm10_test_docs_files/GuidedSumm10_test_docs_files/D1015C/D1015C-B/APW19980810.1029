	   EL DORADO, Venezuela (AP) _ The Pemon Indians rolled a huge log
across the highway to block traffic. The tribe, some dressed in red
loin cloths and their faces streaked with paint, was defending its
piece of paradise.
	   Tensions are rising in Venezuela's Amazon rain forests, where
Indians and environmentalists are clashing with mining companies
and government officials who want to exploit some of the richest
gold deposits in Latin America and build towns and tourist hotels
in the wilderness.
	   Rapid economic development ``is going to mean the death of the
jungles and of the indigenous people,'' said Pemon leader Jose Luis
Gonzalez.
	   Workers with chain saws and bulldozers recently started cutting
a swath through the forest in southeastern Venezuela for a 470-mile
(750 kms) high-voltage electricity line that will be the lifeline
of the projects.
	   During the last two weeks, about 400 Indians trying to stop the
line periodically blocked traffic on a highway used by construction
crews as national guardsmen stood by in riot gear.
	   The dlrs 110 million line is to provide hydroelectric power to
northern Brazil, remote communities in eastern Venezuela and scores
of gold mining companies eager to work the pristine Imataca rain
forest reserve.
	   They're being drawn by gold deposits thought to be worth
billions of dollars and that over the centuries have attracted
explorers such as Sir Walter Raleigh looking for the legendary
golden city of ``El Dorado.''
	   Last year, President Rafael Caldera authorized large-scale
logging and gold and diamond mining in nearly half of Imataca.
	   The 9 million acre (3.6 million-hectare) reserve _ twice the
size of Switzerland _ sits in southern Bolivar state and boasts a
variety of wildlife that few places in the world can match:
jaguars, pumas, red howler monkeys, bearded bluebells, neon-colored
butterflies and the world's largest eagle, the endangered harpy.
	   Imataca ``is one of the most gorgeous endemic forests I've ever
seen,'' said Mary Lou Goodwin of the Audubon Society in Venezuela.
Nature lovers and scientists from around the world come to visit
it.
	   The power line also will slice through Canaima National Park,
one of about 100 U.N.-designated World Heritage Sites. The park is
home to the mysterious flat-topped mountains that inspired Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle's classic adventure story ``The Lost World.''
	   Government officials see the region as a vast untapped source of
wealth that could help alleviate the poverty that afflicts more
than half of Venezuela's population. Thousands of jobs would be
created through projects including a proposed 500-room hotel to be
built on sacred Pemon lands in Canaima.
	   Authorities deny their plans will wreak widespread environmental
and cultural destruction. They contend the damage should actually
decrease since large companies will help control thousands of
illegal miners who poison rivers with mercury, knock down trees
with high-pressure water hoses and create lawless boom towns rife
with drugs, prostitution and violence.
	   ``There are a lot of unfounded fears,'' said the Environmental
Ministry's Santos Carrasco.
	   Environmentalists and Indians say they aren't opposed to all
development in the jungles, but the government plan is too much,
too fast, and officials won't properly regulate the mining and
logging companies.
	   Bringing large-scale development to still mostly unexplored
Imataca is ``sort of like destroying a treasure chest before you
even know what you're destroying,'' said Atossa Soltani of
California-based Amazon Watch.
	   Bulldozers already have leveled some of the Indians' yucca,
corn, banana and pineapple crops. The Pemons and three other tribes
say they plan to keep shutting down the highway until the
government halts the electricity project.
	   They also want officials to overturn last year's mining and
logging decree, grant them title to what they say are millions of
acres of their ancestral lands and recognize their right to decide
the future of the region.
	   Pemon leader Lloyd Henrito said, ``We're the owners of this
land. We were here before Colombus, but in the eyes of the
Venezuelan government we are nothing.''
