	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Southeast Asian nations outlined a plan Friday
to catch haze-causing wildfires more quickly with aerial
surveillance, clearer satellite photos and international aid for
fuel and training.
	   It's an expensive plan, ``but it's much more expensive to fight
fires that are out of control,'' Singapore's environment minister
Yeo Cheow Tong told reporters.
	   The one-day meeting was aimed at avoiding a repeat of last
year's costly fires and cross-border haze pollution, which
blanketed the region in smoke, causing widespread health problems
and hobbling transportation.
	   ``A repeat of this disaster will surely aggravate the already
bad regional economic situation,'' Yeo told fellow ministers and
officials from the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, or ASEAN.
	   Conservative estimates say last year's disaster cost about dlrs
4.5 billion, not counting the loss of human and animal life, plus
the continuing disturbance of tourism, health costs and damage to
forests up until May this year from the lingering rain forest fires
on Borneo.
	   The United Nations Environment Program is coordinating donor
countries toward a target of dlrs 10 million to help prevent new
fires and put out existing ones. Some are taking a wait-and-see
attitude, because of recent rains.
	   Underground peat and coal seam fires, the most difficult to
extinguish, are still burning. The United States has committed part
of its dlrs 6 million in anti-fire aid money to focus on those
unique types of fires, and American experts are heading into the
region now to assess them and give advice, officials said.
	   Meanwhile, new hot spots have been detected in central Sumatra,
resulting in some haze drifting over Singapore.
	   The new Indonesian government, which has made forest
fire-fighting its second priority after food, is doing all it can
to quickly put out the Sumatran fires before they spread, an
Indonesian official told reporters.
	   ``For sure, it's not enough,'' said Effendy A. Sumardja,
assistant minister for environment coordination. ``That's the
reason why we need the support.'' He said the government had
allocated dlrs 4 million to fire fighting this year ``but it isn't
enough.''
	   Within two weeks, he said, Indonesia plans to provide four
military planes, and civilian and military personnel, for aerial
surveillance in four provinces.
	   The satellite photos now in use are not detailed enough to spot
fires when they first break out. Better pictures will cost more.
	   About 80 percent of the fires that burned agricultural land,
grassland and rain forest in Indonesia since last year are blamed
on large landowners who illegally use fire to clear away unwanted
vegetation. But it is often hard to prove who set the fire, said
Yeo.
	   In Indonesia, legal cases have begun against two landowners as a
result of last year's fires, said Sumardja.
