<P>
The tropical rain forest accounts for eight percent of the total
area of the Xishuangbanna Nature Reserve.
</P>
<P>
"The government has made great efforts to build the nature
reserve and offered a guarantee for the effective survival of the
tropical rain forest," said Li Hongwei, who is also an engineer with
the Yunnan Provincial Design Institute of Forestry Survey and
Planning.
</P>
<P>
The first nature reserve was established on 57,000 ha of land
in Xishuangbanna as early as in 1959, he said, and after nearly
four decades it has grown to more than 240,000 ha and contains
most of the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve is divided into a core area and an
experimental area. The core area is exclusively for farming
activities, while the scale of farmland is under strict control
in the experimental area. Hunting is banned in all areas of the
nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
In order to stop farmers from cutting trees for residential
buildings and fuel use, the local government has designated a
commercial forest area beyond the nature reserve, and executes
planned felling.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the use of new building materials relieves the
burden on the nature reserve. The traditional bamboo houses in
which the local people live are being replaced by brick and cement
buildings.
</P>
<P>
The local government is now carrying out a resettlement
program, gradually removing itinerant farmers from the rain
forest. In 1997 the government spent more than four million yuan
(about 480,000 US dollars) building new villages for over 3,000
farmers of the Yao and Hani minority nationalities who had moved
from the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
A Norwegian prince, when visiting Xishuangbanna, insisted on
taking a look at the tropical rain forest. When he saw the
thriving trees there, he said that he had seen an example of
successful protection of nature.
