Rains helping extinguish fires in southern Mexico

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Long-awaited rain showers have helped
extinguish dozens of fires in southern Mexico, but several blazes
continue to burn, including those in prized rain forest, an
environment official said Thursday.
	   Rains that began two weeks ago have been ``very erratic,'' Ramon
Aguirre, natural resources deputy in southern Chiapas state, said
by telephone from the state capital of Tuxtla Gutierrez.
	   The showers have lasted only a few hours a day _ not enough to
extinguish all the fires, he said.
	   A team of U.S. forest experts arrived in southern Mexico last
month to help Mexican firefighters gain control of the blazes,
which have endangered rare plant and animal species and spewed a
thick haze of smoke across Mexico and the United States.
	   Forty-one technical assistants from U.S. federal, state and
county agencies were helping the Mexicans set up and use
firefighting helicopters and radio equipment, said Frank Mosbacher,
a spokesman for the Washington Incident Information Center, a U.S.
government office that monitors and reports on fires.
	   The members of the U.S. team were ending their 21-day assignment
and will be replaced by a new set of about 29 experts starting
Tuesday, Mosbacher said.
	   Many of the fires were started by farmers who traditionally
clear land by burning fields. A severe drought, however, had dried
out the typically moist area, making conditions ripe for wildfires.
	   Though the rain is lessening the intensity of the fires and
making it harder for them to spread, ``if it dries out again these
fires can come back to life,'' Mosbacher said.
	   The smoke from the fires raised air pollution fears in Texas in
recent weeks, but researchers say it now poses little threat to the
United States.
	   The U.S. National Weather Service's forecast through Saturday
predicts smoke will continue to drift to the northwest, but says no
visible smoke should be noticed over Texas.
	   A health alert caused by the drifting smoke over Texas was
lifted May 28 when the smoke cleared after about three gloomy
weeks. At its worst, the haze covered much of the Gulf Coast and
Southeast and was apparent as far north as North Dakota.
	   In Mexico, the three regions still troubled by fires in Chiapas
were the Ocote reserve, an area near the municipality of Benito
Juarez, and an area called Pantano near the state's northern border
with Tabasco state, Aguirre said.
	   In the Pantano area, an underground peat fire was proving hard
to locate, Aguirre said.
	   In Oaxaca state, northwest of Chiapas, rain showers have helped
firefighters gain control of most of the fires burning in the rain
forest region of Chimalapas, the government news agency Notimex
cited environment officials as saying.
	   This year, 295 fires have burned in Oaxaca, according to the
report.
