<P>
   In the two decades since saving the world's rain forests became
an environmental cause celebre, there has been plenty of
consciousness raising, some successful corporate boycotting, and a
new flavor of ice cream _ Rainforest Crunch.
</P>
<P>
   There have been modest victories. Children have been putting
coins in parking meters at zoos and aquariums around the country
which has raised $1.5 million to purchase conservation land. Costa
Rica, which witnessed massive deforestation, has managed to
preserve about 20 percent of its wilderness and is in the vanguard
for creating new, benign uses for the land. And there is hope for
more: In April, Brazil promised to set aside 62 million acres of
Amazon jungle for preservation.
</P>
<P>
   But in the amount of time it takes you to read this sentence,
more than two acres of rain forest will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   From 1980 through 1995, 450 million acres of forest _ almost all
of it tropical _ were lost around the world. In roughly that same
time, a comparatively small 18.3 million acres were conserved,
according to the World Conservation Monitoring Centre in Cambridge,
England.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the high profile of the rain forest issue, the rate
of destruction is increasing. A congressional commission this year
estimated that 22,393 square miles, or 145 million acres, are being
destroyed in the Amazon every year. As a result, the rain forests
aren't only being threatened, they are disappearing. If the current
rates continue, all that may be left in 20 years is boutique
forests and jungle museums _ protected areas that give a glimpse of
what the past was like, but that are so small they cannot support
all the life that once thrived there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to leapfrog destruction or jump start some new
conservation processes so that something meaningful is left,'' says
Bruce Cabarle, director of the global forest program for the World
Wildlife Fund. ``When we whittle forests down to such a small size,
we begin to lose the things inside them that make them unique. And
one of the things you usually lose are the large vertebrates that
require a lot of space. We could end up where we will have
boutiques or museums, but they will be empty museums.''
</P>
<P>
   And the dry season is about to settle on an Amazon basin that
some scientists say is dangerously parched. That condition could
permit fires to burn out of control. The Amazon is the largest of
the world's three remaining great tropical rain forests _ the
others are in Central Africa and Papua, New Guinea _ and the home
to much of the world's flora and fauna, and a fifth of the world's
fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a very critical situation,'' says Daniel C.
Nepstad, a scientist at the Amazon Institute and the Woods Hole
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an interaction between  &UR; gfspanish &LR; El Nino events
increasing in severity and frequency, selective timber harvesting,
which leaves the forest more vulnerable, and the expansion of the
agricultural frontier. It means that 1998 could be a severe burning
season. The area that is vulnerable is some 400,000 square
kilometers, or eight Costa Ricas, or 20 Massachusettses.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent fires in Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia indicate how
fragile the rain forests are on a global scale. The fires are set,
in some cases by poor indigenous people clearing land to farm, in
others by multinational companies clearing land for plantations.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of subsistence farming, the resultant ash provides
rich fertilizer for only two or three years, then the process is
repeated. The Amazon forest is also facing threats from
international timber companies that previously clear-cut their way
across the Southeast Asian archipelago and are now moving into
Latin America with a vengeance, buying up the logging rights to
millions of acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we are tilting at windmills,'' acknowledges
Christopher Hatch, campaigns director for Rainforest Action
Network, a California-based environmental action group that
organizes product boycotts and demonstrations in an effort to raise
awareness and protect the remaining forests.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the pace of deforestation, the World Bank and World
Wildlife Fund estimate that one of every eight plant species on
earth is threatened with extinction. Some have great medicinal and
pharmaceutical value _ for example, a plant that grows only on
Madagascar is used in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease _ while
the value of others remains undiscovered.
</P>
<P>
   The rain forests also have helped to protect the world's climate
by cleansing the air.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon dioxide _ a gas mostly caused by industrial uses and
burning forests _ exacerbates the greenhouse effect by permitting
the sun's heat to reach the earth, but then blocking the heat from
radiating back out to space. As a result, the globe's temperature
is rising. Last year was the warmest in the last 600 years,
according to researchers at the University of Massachusetts. In
1995, scientists reported direct evidence that the tropical rain
forests soak up large amounts of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   Even selective logging, mining, or oil exploitation the forests,
each of which leaves a much smaller area of destruction than
slash-and-burn agriculture or clear-cut logging, can also create a
threat because the access roads left behind are used by settlers to
clear more land, says Ian Bowles, vice president of Conservation
International.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a generalized awareness that it is important to
preserve the rain forest, that does not seem to be translating into
significant consumer action. Imports of the tropical wood mahogany
to the United States, for example, rose 14 percent from 1991 to
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the daunting odds, conservationists insist there is
still some hope for the future of the rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic because I have seen significant successes and I
have seen corporate leaders from Intel and Ford Motor play an
active role in our organization,'' says Bowles. ``Ten years ago,
major corporate leaders in the US were not paying as much attention
to conservation on a global scale as they are now.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hatch, of the Rainforest Action Network, predicts that
mahogany imports should start to drop as public awareness is
increased.
</P>
<P>
   What is doomed, however, is the idea of a wilderness area set
aside simply for preservation's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Land purchases are good solutions for areas that are highly
threatened and might not otherwise be saved, says Nigel Sizer, a
senior associate with the World Resources Institute. But buying the
land, which can be had for as little as $1 an acre, is the cheap
part. Protecting it from poachers and illegal logging is more
difficult, and more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that 80 percent of logging in Brazil is illegal.
And many of the country's national parks are known as ``paper
parks'' because there is nothing to prevent them from being
overrun. Even Brazil's announcement with the World Bank and World
Wildlife Fund that 62 million acres will be set aside has been met
with some skepticism since preserving the land may be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every effort made today, no matter how small, can make a
difference many years from now,'' Sizer says. ``The environmental
movement has won huge victories protecting wilderness. ... That
said, each year more forest is lost, less is left, and time is
running out.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of simply buying land and fencing it off, says Daniel
Janzen, a biologist at the University of Pennsylvania who has spent
the last three decades working in Costa Rica, the rain forests must
be viewed as gardens _ with all the attendant requirements: care
and management and harvesting. ``We do not need more planning
conferences, more studies, more analysis,'' he says. ``We need
honestly spent cash to buy the land and put it into a different
kind of production, in direct competition with the agro-scape and
urban landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop thinking of there being `productive lands' and
set-asides, conserved. All three land uses are highly productive,
but each produces a different crop and each requires a different
set of rules, laws and traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   In Costa Rica, there are plenty of examples of how to protect
rain forests while producing income. Tourism now accounts for about
$700 million annually and has supplanted bananas and coffee as the
top foreign-exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bioprospecting'' is another potential money-maker that
requires rain forests to be kept intact. The largest such contract,
partially brokered by Janzen, was the $1.3 million that drug giant
Merck paid to Costa Rica's National Biodiversity Institute for
chemical extracts from flora and fauna in protected areas. If drugs
are made, Costa Rica gets a royalty. Other companies, seeking
everything from fragrances to natural pesticides, followed suit.
Conservationists are also hopeful that demand for potable water
will help to keep forests intact because they protect water sources
from agricultural pollution and obviate the need for expensive
treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Another promising international effort is the purchase of carbon
storage rights by polluters who emit large amounts of carbon
dioxide. A Nebraska-based power company spent $500,000 and raised
that much again for 5,777 acres of Costa Rican forest to give to
the national park system this year, in order to offset carbon
dioxide emissions from a power plant under construction in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   If such sales are approved under the Kyoto global protocols
hammered out last year, they could generate hundreds of millions of
dollars a year for forest preservation. Diplomats will gather in
November in Buenos Aires to grapple with the issue of carbon
set-asides and the role that forests can play. But the time for
action is growing short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goods and services that come out of the forest that require us
to keep it in a fairly pristine state will be the key to the
future,'' says Cabarle. ``And what happens in Buenos Aires will be
a key event to watch. It will fundamentally determine if and when
we have a market for trading greenhouse gas emissions and what
role, if any, forests will play in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be the greatest boon for forest preservation, or the
biggest fatalistic missed opportunity we stumbled over in the
dark.''
