   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 20:
</P>
<P>
   The world's forests have been under siege since the turn of the
century, but this year has been calamitous. In Canada, Brazil,
Mexico, Central America, Africa, and Indonesia, fires have
destroyed nearly 40 million forested acres, an area as large as New
York state. The easy explanation is El Nino, a perverse weather
system that has flooded some regions but left others bone dry. But
the main culprit, as always, is human activity, chiefly logging,
mining, and agriculture, which dries out the forest by stripping it
bare of trees, leaving even humid tropical rain forests vulnerable
to fire. For that reason, the fires are likely to reoccur, with or
without El Nino, unless something is done to curb mankind's
insatiable appetite for wood.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, there was a small ray of hope in the
announcement last week that a small South American country,
Suriname, had decided to give permanent protection to four million
acres of untouched tropical forests, about one-tenth of the entire
country. Suriname reached its decision at the urging of
Conservation International, an American environmental group that
has set up a private trust fund to help Suriname manage the area.
The group became actively involved in Suriname several years ago,
when Asian timber interests _ having pretty much stripped their own
countries of marketable hardwoods _ sought timber rights on 11
million acres of Suriname's forests. Suriname rejected that deal,
and has now put four million of these acres out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this decision so heartening is that Suriname is a
poor country that might normally have jumped at the quick profits
promised by foreign logging interests. Far richer nations like
Brazil have been unable to resist these blandishments, and Asian
timber interests are even now burrowing deeper into the Amazon rain
forest. At the other end of the economic scale, Guyana, Surname's
destitute neighbor, has opened up two-thirds of its forest mass to
foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   Suriname chose the long-term economic value of forests over
short-term revenues from logging and other resource-depleting
activities. It hopes over time to make money from tourism generated
by the forest and its spectacular animal life, from non-timber
forest products like tannins and resins, and from
``bioprospecting'' _ the search for medicines among forest plants.
The National Institutes of Health and big pharmaceutical companies
like Bristol-Myers Squibb are already engaged in this search. This
avenue has been left unexplored by most of the world's governments,
which own 80 percent of the world's forests and which as a rule
cannot see beyond the next truckload of mahogany. The lure of
short-term gain is also the main reason various international
agreements, including the non-binding ``forest principles'' adopted
at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, have had zero impact.
</P>
<P>
   The larger point here is that a living forest is worth more than
a dead forest, locally and globally. Healthy forests prevent
erosion and water pollution. They also act as a natural ``sink''
for the carbon-based gases that contribute to global warming, and,
perhaps most important, they harbor at least half of all plant and
animal species, with enormous untapped benefits for human health.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-half of the world's original tropical forests have
now disappeared, mostly in this century. At present rates of
destruction, half of what is left could vanish in the next 50
years. This depressing prospect has not, however, inspired the
wealthier nations to act constructively. One of the few tangible
products of the 1992 Earth Summit was the Global Environmental
Facility, a multilateral body designed to persuade poor countries
to hang on to their natural assets, rain forests included. But the
United States, which pledged $435 million over five years, is $200
million in arrears.
</P>
<P>
   The task of saving the forests has thus been left to private
conservation groups, whose resources are limited. The very fact
that one of these groups and one small country have joined to save
four million acres might shame Western governments into broader
action.
