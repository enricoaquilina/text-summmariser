Brazil government grants extension for environmental law
</HEADLINE>

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The government has given companies
up to five years to bring their operations into compliance with a
strict new environmental law approved earlier this year, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   O Estado de Sao Paulo reported that the Environment Ministry
granted extensions ranging from three months to five years before
it begins imposing fines under the new law.
	   Environment Minister Gustavo Krause said the government has
already imposed some fines under the new law, but will not impose
any new fines until the extension period expires.
	   Environmental authorities are investigating 2,056 complaints
that the companies are breaking the law in the state of Sao Paulo,
the newspaper reported.
	   Under a law approved earlier this year, companies caught
breaking environmental rules cannot participate in government bids
for 10 years. The companies won't qualify for tax breaks, and
owners must pay fines proportionate to the profits of the company.
	   The law also sets prison terms of up to three years for anyone
caught illegally trading animals, burning trees, extracting
minerals or polluting.
	   The law was passed in an effort to protect Brazil's Amazon rain
forest. About 13 percent of the 2 million square-mile (5 million
square-kilometer) Amazon rain forest already has been destroyed.
Some scientists say the destruction accelerates global warming.
