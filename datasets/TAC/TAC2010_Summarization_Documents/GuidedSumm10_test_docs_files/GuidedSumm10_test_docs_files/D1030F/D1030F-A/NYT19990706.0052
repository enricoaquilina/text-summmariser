<P>
   They vow to help you trim down, boost energy, put muscle on, and
even take cellulite off.
</P>
<P>
   Go to any health food store, fitness center, or grocery store
and you'll see shelves stocked with energy enhancement and sports
performance pills, drinks, and bars. And consumers are hungrier for
them than ever.
</P>
<P>
   They spent more than $6.5 billion in 1996 on over-the counter
dietary supplements, according to the US Food and Drug
Administration's latest figures. And nutrition groups say that
sales are rising each year.
</P>
<P>
   But do these supplements actually work? And, more importantly,
are they safe?
</P>
<P>
   While the FDA can alert consumers to products that could be
dangerous, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994
limits the agency's latitude in regulating supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike drugs that get FDA approval before they are marketed,
dietary supplements must be proven unsafe before regulators can
restrict the use of a product.
</P>
<P>
   While the FDA forbids labels that ``state or imply that the
product can help diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent a disease (for
example, `cures cancer' or `treats arthritis')'' consumers should
be wary of products that are marketed as ``miracle cures,''
``wonder drugs,'' and ``new breakthroughs,'' according to the
agency's website.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the FDA has issued warnings about the danger of
over-the-counter supplements containing ephedrine, a powerful heart
stimulant, and gamma butryolactone, or GBL, a central nervous
system depressant.
</P>
<P>
   In January, muscle and performance boosting products containing
GBL had to be pulled from gym and store shelves after the FDA
banned the product when some consumers experienced vomiting, slowed
heart rate, seizures, comas, and even death.
</P>
<P>
   Weight loss, muscle building, and energy boosting products
containing ephedrine have not been recalled by the FDA, although
the agency issued several warnings after it investigated more than
800 adverse health events including heart attack, stroke, seizure,
and more than 30 deaths associated with products containing
ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the FDA advised consumers to restrict their intake of
ephedrine (derived from the ephedra plant) to 8 mg per dose and no
more than 24 mg per day and not to use the product for more than
seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Products containing ephedrine _ commonly labeled as ephedra, ma
huang Chinese ephedra, and epitonin _ are often found in
weight-loss, energy boosting, and body building supplements.
</P>
<P>
   But some in the dietary supplement industry are at odds with the
government's descriptions that some supplements _ particularly
those containing ephedrine _ are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Metabolife International Inc., sued WCVB-TV Channel 5,
its anchor Susan Wornick, and Dr. George L. Blackburn of Harvard
Medical School after the Boston station reported on health risks
related to the use of ephedrine-containing weight-loss dietary
supplements, including the top-selling Metabolife 356, which the
San Diego-based company makes.
</P>
<P>
   The report included a comment from Blackburn, who, when
discussing the safety of ephedrine-containing products such as
Metabolife, said ``you can die'' from taking them.
</P>
<P>
   Metabolife claims his comments, as well as the broadcast, were
false, and are damaging to the company, which sold an estimated
$600 million worth of the supplements last year.
</P>
<P>
   Motions to dismiss Metabolife's lawsuit were filed last month by
attorneys on behalf of Blackburn and by those for Wornick and
WCVB-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn's attorney Jeffrey R. Martin called Metabolife's
lawsuit ``frivolous'' and said ``we are doing our best to get it
dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   Metabolife's president Michael J. Ellis has also threatened to
sue the Washington Post over a similar report and has battled
successfully in states, such as Texas, to stop legislatures from
requiring prescriptions for weight-loss products containing
ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some stores have voluntarily pulled ephedrine from
their shelves. Bread and Circus Whole Foods Markets, a small
Massachusetts chain, stopped selling about 12 products containing
ephedra around the time the FDA warned in 1996 that the product was
an ``amphetamine-like stimulant'' that can damage the heart and
nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled everything. None of our stores carry ephedra
products or ma Huang _ `speed' _ as we like to call it,'' said
Allyn Kunz nutrition coordinator for Bread and Circus's northeast
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies actually changed their formulas so we would
keep their products on the shelf,'' she said, while others ``took
out the ma huang and added another herb very high in caffeine
called guarnana and they advertise it as `ephedra free,''' Kunz
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bread and Circus doesn't carry products containing guarana
either, she added.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of supplements are not dangerous, consumers
shouldn't buy or use products just because the label says
``natural,'' according to Dr. David Levitsky a nutrition and
psychology professor at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is natural,'' Levitsky said. ``Somehow there is the
idea that if you use a plant directly or extract a tea it will be
more effective and have less side effects (than approved drugs) and
that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   For Levitsky, who is studying the effects of several herbal
supplements, memory-aiding products and mood supplements seem to
show the most promise. Despite volumes of testimonials from users,
many who have been paid to make them, fitness, energy, and
weight-loss supplements don't appear to produce a measurable
effect, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Where weight-loss is concerned, ``the more you believe in them
the more they work...there is something to the placebo effect,''
Levitsky said. ``If you reduce caloric intake you are going to lose
weight, no question. If you think what you're doing (with
supplements) is helping, then you will stick with it,'' believing
the supplements helped, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Spellman, a registered dietician at the Boston Athletic
Club, said that creatine, a popular strength-increasing supplement,
seems to ``have some promise,'' but she tries to steer (her
clients) away from most supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for that quick fix. People think that they
can take creatine or other supplements and sit on the couch for two
hours to get more muscle and it ain't gonna happen,'' Spellman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a supplement is ``easier to swallow than hearing that
you'll have to go to the gym a lot and watch what you put in your
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The athletic club does not sell creatine or any other
supplements, but does have protein powders and sports bars.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Clark, a registered dietician and director of
SportsMedicine Brookline, said supplements ``are just that _
supplements. They are not replacements to eating and living
right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not against them,'' Clark says, but ``there is not a magic
pill. I say use food to help meet your goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers can buy drinks, pills or meal supplements at Gold's
Gym, according to Marco Cosentino, owner of four Boston area Gold's
Gyms. He says about half of his customers use drinks, pills, or
meal supplements to boost performance and build muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an easier way, people want it,'' Cosentino said.
``It's marketing, there's no miracle. Some do work better than
others. We don't tell anyone to take them but we sell them if they
want them.''
