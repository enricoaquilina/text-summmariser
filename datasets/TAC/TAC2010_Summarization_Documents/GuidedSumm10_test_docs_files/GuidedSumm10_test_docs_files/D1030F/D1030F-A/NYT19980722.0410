   But not everyone sees the trend as a healthy one for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to understand that this is not about health and
this is not about well-being; this is about money and jumping on a
bandwagon,'' said David Kessler, a former head of the FDA and now
dean of Yale University's medical school. Kessler waged a vigorous
but unsuccessful battle against the law that virtually stripped his
former agency of its authority to regulate herbal and other dietary
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   For healthy people, most of the products pose little or no risk,
and some, containing garlic and ginseng, may even be helpful,
Kessler said. The danger, he said, is that some people with
potentially life-threatening illnesses will use the products in
place of standard medical treatments. That has always been a risk,
but the marketing giants now pushing into the industry can pitch
these formulas to more consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they are positioned in the marketplace can lead people
down roads to ineffective treatments,'' Kessler said, pointing to
products whose names, he argued, could cause consumers to think
they could be used instead of prescription drugs. ``If you promote
a product as Mood Mender, you have a responsibility to that person
who is depressed, and if that product doesn't work, you are doing
harm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People with specific illnesses look at these products a
different way than the healthy person,'' he added, ``and it is
through their eyes that the marketplace must be judged.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, critics say, the supplements can be quite
dangerous indeed. The FDA, for example, is attempting to rein in
the use of the herbal stimulant ephedra, which is sold by various
companies in a formula under different names. The formula, which
manufacturers say is safe, has been linked to more than a dozen
deaths nationwide. Marketers promise that the pills provide an
amphetaminelike rush, aid in weight loss and even increase sexual
sensation, but medical experts say they can cause heart attacks,
strokes and seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The big-name herbal pill dispensers now entering the market say
they are sticking to more ``mainstream'' substances and argue that
those formulas are safe and effective when taken by healthy people
in recommended doses. Besides, they say, unlike the little-known
manufacturers that once dominated the industry, they have the
research and development budgets and purchasing clout to insure
product quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend tens of millions of dollars putting together
manufacturing and quality-control processes,'' said Elliot
Friedman, chairman and chief executive of Pharmaprint Inc., which
is producing the supplements that American Home Products is
planning to market under the Centrum name. ``The big companies are
very protective of their brands.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be, but the critics say consumers have a false sense of
security about the regulatory oversight of supplements. They
mistakenly assume, the critics contend, that the supplements are
subject to the same scrutiny as toothpaste, cough drops and other
seemingly benign products under the FDA's watch. The agency
requires those goods to carry general cautionary labeling and
dosage information, and it imposes limits on the claims that can be
made in marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal supplements are regulated by a looser set of standards.
Before the passage in 1994 of the Dietary Supplement Health and
Education Act, manufacturers were prohibited, for instance, from
making claims about the potential benefits of their products. But
the revised guidelines allow companies to advertise the health
effects of herbal supplements _ without having to conclusively
prove their effectiveness _ so long as the wording does not suggest
that the products prevent, treat or cure disease.
</P>
<P>
   That gives companies much greater range in making product claims
than manufacturers of, say, mouthwash. While a company cannot claim
an herbal supplement cures cancer or relieves depression, for
example, it can say that it ``promotes prostate health'' or ``aids
in mental focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also worry that pharmaceutical companies will attempt to
classify some products as herbal supplements instead of as drugs to
skirt the rigorous process required to bring a drug to market.
</P>
<P>
   That complaint is at the heart of a battle between the FDA and
Pharmanex Inc., which manufactures a product called Cholestin,
which it sells as an supplement in Wal-Mart and other big chains.
The FDA wants to ban the substance, maintaining that it is an
unapproved drug because it contains a natural form of a key
chemical in the cholesterol-lowering prescription drug Mevacor,
made by Merck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pharmanex won the first round in the battle _ which
was prompted by Merck's complaints about the product _ when a judge
issued a preliminary injunction lifting the FDA's administrative
ban of Cholestin. The company contends that the product is a
natural alternative for people who are too healthy to take the
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as other drug makers begin producing herbal pills,
the FDA is struggling to find a way to exercise its limited
oversight authority.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products declined to provide an executive to
discuss its supplements business beyond issuing a statement through
a public relations representative saying, ``Herbals represent a
large and growing market with increasing consumer acceptance.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, analysts estimate that the Centrum line alone has the
potential to generate $80 million in revenues within a year of its
introduction, a figure Friedman calls ``on the low side.'' His
company's share would be 10 percent of pretax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said the industry's growth could be even greater as
more retailers make room for brand-name supplements on their
already crowded shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are looking for a name they trust and, to be honest,
that's why we went with Centrum,'' he said. ``Pharmacists know it,
doctors know it and consumers know it. That is the edge in bringing
these new people into the fold.''
