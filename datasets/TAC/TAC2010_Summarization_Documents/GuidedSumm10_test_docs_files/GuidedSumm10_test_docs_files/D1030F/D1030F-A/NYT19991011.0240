   The herb is called ephedra, or ma huang, and it comes from a
shrublike plant grown widely in Asia. It can be found in more than
200 diet supplements, in pills and powders, drinks and diet bars,
for sale in health food stores and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Its advocates say it decreases appetite, raises metabolism,
improves concentration, burns fat and even enhances sexual
performance. In thousands of postings on the Internet, users praise
it for raising their energy, helping them lose weight and
sharpening their muscle tone.
</P>
<P>
   But to its critics, ephedra is a potentially dangerous substance
that urgently needs more study and regulation. They point out that
its active ingredient, ephedrine, is a central nervous system
stimulant similar to amphetamine, and they say reactions to it can
vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedrine has been widely studied over the past few years, and
studies suggest that it can produce a wide array of possible side
effects, including anxiety, insomnia, hypertension, tachycardia,
psychosis, kidney damage, dependency, heart attack, stroke and
death. The federal Food and Drug Administration says it has
received hundreds of reports from physicians, health authorities
and others about adverse reactions to ephedrine-based products.
</P>
<P>
   Critics and proponents alike agree on one thing: ephedra is
flying off the shelves. Metabolife International Inc., a 5-year-old
San Diego company that sells an ephedra-based pill called
Metabolife 356, says this year's sales will reach $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   A critic, Dr. Jacqueline Berning, a professor of nutrition at
the University of Colorado, whose clients include many professional
athletes, says the use of ephedrine-based products is ``rampant
among athletes,'' even though they have been banned by the National
Collegiate Athletic Association and the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra's active ingredient, ephedrine, has been in
over-the-counter cold and asthma medications since the 1920s, and
the ephedra plant has been used for thousands of years in Chinese
medicine. Still, the combined effects of the herbal potpourri found
in many diet supplements have not been studied. While
over-the-counter drugs are subject to Food and Drug Administration
regulation, herbal supplements are assumed safe unless proved
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has a blind spot with the herbals,'' said Dr. Bill
Gurley, of the College of Pharmacy at the University of Arkansas.
``I have a feeling over time enough serious cases of addiction will
pile up and enough adverse events will be reported to change that
perception.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurley has just completed a study suggesting wide variations in
product ingredients and quality. ``Ephedra supplements are derived
from plants that can contain any number of ephedrine-like
alkaloids,'' he said. ``These alkaloids vary not only in
pharmacological activity and potency, but certain combinations may
be additive or synergistieir effect.''
</P>
<P>
   In testing 19 ephedrine-based supplements, Gurley said, he found
wide variations in alkaloid content. Some products contained
significantly less of the active ingredients than listed on the
label, some significantly more.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in response to reports of adverse reactions, the
Food and Drug Administration proposed restricting doses of ephedra
to 8 milligrams at a time and 24 milligrams a day, and prohibiting
the addition of caffeine to ephedrine products. (The American
Herbal Products Association, a trade organization that sets
standards and guidelines for the diet supplement industry,
recommends that dosages not exceed 25 milligrams, or 100 a day; a
Metabolife pill has 12 milligrams, according to the label.)
</P>
<P>
   After a lobbying effort by the diet supplement industry, a
congressional subcommittee asked the General Accounting Office to
investigate the research behind the FDA's proposal. In August, the
accounting office issued a report assailing the agency's findings
as sloppy science. ``The FDA needs to provide stronger evidence on
the relationship between the intake of dietary supplements
containing ephedrine alkaloids and the occurrence of adverse
reactions,'' the report said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In recent months, ephedrine-based products have figured
prominently in two widely publicized cases, both involving deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a judge in British Columbia ruled that Julia
Campagna, a 28-year-old woman from Kirkland, Wash., was not
criminally responsible in the deaths of two teen-age girls in a
fiery car crash near the U.S. border in May 1998. Court-appointed
psychiatrists testified that Ms. Campagna had been in a state of
psychosis, a reaction to the ephedrine-based supplement Xendrine,
which she had taken for five days.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Anne Marie Capati, a 37-year-old knitwear designer
from Huntington, N.Y., died after suffering a stroke at a fitness
club in Manhattan. Ms. Capati, who suffered from high blood
pressure, had been taking Thermadrene, an ephedra supplement
manufactured by SportPharma of Concord, Calif. According to her
husband, who has sued the manufacturer, the fitness club and his
wife's personal trainer, she had been taking the recommended dose
for five days, ``to lose the last five pounds and firm up.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning label on Thermadrene (and many other brands,
including Metabolife) makes clear that ephedrine-based products
should not be taken by people with certain medical conditions,
including high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Michael Ellis, the chief executive of
Metabolife and a board member of the American Herbal Products
Association, strongly defended ephedrine-based supplements. ``I
read about the Long Island woman's death, and it's tragic,'' he
said. ``This case points out why we need consistency in the warning
labels. But let's keep this in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   With millions of people taking ephedrine each year, Ellis
argued, a few cases of adverse effects are to be expected. ``Some
people die from eating peanut butter or strawberries,'' he said.
``Everything carries risk.''
</P>
<P>
   He has urged the FDA to appoint a working group of scientists,
consumers, herbalists and industry representatives to develop new
guidelines for dietary supplements containing ephedra and other
herbs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the purity of Metabolife, he said: ``We believe we are
responsible. We label correctly, and we have a nonprofit third
party give us a certification of good manufacturing practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis is at the center of the latest ephedra-related
controversy. After being interviewed for the ABC News program
``20/20,'' and anticipating a hostile report, Ellis took
pre-emptive action last week.
</P>
<P>
   In a $1.5 million advertising campaign Metabolife announced the
creation of a Web site (www.newsinterview.com) posting the unedited
70-minute interview. Commercial spots ran on 1,500 radio stations,
and a number of full-page newspaper advertisements. ABC News says
it expects to broadcast the interview later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years ago, Ellis, a former police officer, was arrested
in San Diego and charged with using ephedrine to produce
methamphetamine, a highly addictive street drug. He pleaded guilty
to using a telephone in the trafficking of drugs and was sentenced
to five years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did something very wrong, something very much out of
character, and something I am very sorry about,'' he said, and
later added: ``Metabolife has been looked at inside and out. We
have a report from a DEA-approved lab that shows you can't make
methampethamine out of Metabolife. Obviously we are not breaking
any laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said he was hopeful that the attention would help him make
a point. ``If this product and industry are going to have
longevity, we have to come out say, `You can't pop supplements like
they are carrots; this is another form of medicine.'''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment is shared by many mainstream physicians. ``The
public should be informed,'' said Gurley, of the University of
Arkansas. ``A drug is a drug whether it's from a natural source or
you make it in laboratory.''
