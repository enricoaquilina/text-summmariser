   UNDATED: DUI vs. DWI?
</P>
<P>
   Q: I remember reading some months ago that the Fuller Brush Co.,
of Fuller Brush Man fame, still exists. I had assumed that with
changing technology and lifestyles, it was long gone. Do you have
any information, and where can I order products?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Fuller Brush Co. is still a booming business. Although
distributors nationwide still may call on customers occasionally,
the legendary ``brush man'' calling door-to-door is little more
than a memory, said company spokesman Larry Gray. These days, many
customers choose to order products by mail or electronic order, or
by phone to a toll-free number, he said. The company manufactures
more than 2,000 items, such as household cleaning aids, polishes
and wax products, cotton and synthetic mops, floor brushs and
brooms, hair care aids, lotions and fragrances, even silk-screen
graphics, at its plant in Great Bend, Kan. Information:

   Q: Over the past few years, Dean Johnson, host of ``Hometime''
on public television, has had three women who have helped him
build, and all seemed to be his wives. What's the story on these
women? What is Johnson's background?
</P>
<P>
   A: Johnson is married, but not to any of the women _ there have
been four, not three _ with whom he has co-hosted ``Hometime.''
There's reason for your confusion, though. The program makes it
appear as though Johnson and his co-hosts are married ``so we can
introduce situations that might realistically occur with a
husband-wife team,'' as the program's publicity material states.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Knapp, the first co-host, started in 1986, but left after
the first season. Since then, she been hosting ``Newton's Apple,''
a public TV children's program. JoAnne Liebeler, the second
co-host, stayed with ``Hometime'' for four seasons, after which she
moved to the West Coast to pursue other acting opportunities.
Susanne Egli, who joined the show for one season, has since been
acting in regional theater and appearing in commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Current co-host Robin Hartl joined ``Hometime'' in July 1992.
She received a real estate license and spent two years selling real
estate in Eau Claire, Wis., before moving to Minneapolis, where she
worked in the commercial insurance business for eight years while
renovating homes in her off-time.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was an accountant, sales representative and residential
contractor before launching ``Hometime'' in 1984. He and his real
wife, Kathi, have two children.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can someone from Jamaica participate in the National
Spelling Bee? Isn't it restricted to students of the United States
and its territories?
</P>
<P>
   A: The competition, sponsored by Scripps Howard Newspapers, has
only these restrictions: contestants must speak English and be
younger than 16, and cannot have passed beyond the eighth grade at
the time of their school finals. All have qualified by competing in
previous spelling bees sponsored by their local newspapers. The 249
contestants this year represented 49 states (no Vermont entry),
several U.S. territories, Mexico, the Bahamas and Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   This year's winner was Jody-Anne Maxwell, 12, a seventh-grader
at Ardenne High School in Kingston, Jamaica. The only previous
winner from beyond the mainland United States was Hugh Tosteson of
Puerto Rico, who won in 1975. In light of Jody-Anne's victory and
the foreign participants this year, Scripps Howard officials said
they would consider renaming the 71-year-old contest, substituting
the world international for national.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw a newspaper photo showing a U.S. Army infantry veteran
wearing a Combat Infantryman Badge. The caption said he was a
veteran of Desert Storm. I thought the badge was given only to
those who had been in combat for at least three months, or had been
awarded a Purple Heart. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Combat Infantry Badge is awarded to infantrymen who have
been under enemy fire in a combat zone, with no minimum time limit
specified, according to the Dictionary of the Modern U.S. Military.
The only restriction stated is that generals and
support/administrative personnel usually are ineligible to receive
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know a lot of people who use the product Ripped Fuel to
boost energy. I heard something on the news about a danger
associated with it, but I didn't get the details. Do you have any
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: You probably heard about concerns expressed by the Food and
Drug Administration relating to scores of herbal products and
supplements. Government and other experts have warned that a number
of such products can be risky. They have said that the pills,
tonics and teas are sold with little information for consumers to
judge whether they actually work or might have potential side
effects. The culprit named in Ripped Fuel is ephedra, also called
ma huang, epitonin and sida cordifolia. It contains stimulants
known chemically as ephedrine. Several months ago, the FDA reported
having 900 reports of side effects, including heart palpitations
and psychosis, heart attacks and strokes. Several states have
banned ephedrine-containing supplements. Federal limitations are
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw that Tony Bennett sang ``Ave Maria'' at Frank Sinatra's
funeral. Knowing that Sinatra was an admirer of President John F.
Kennedy, I wonder if Sinatra sang ``Ave Maria'' at Kennedy's
funeral? If not, who did?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was Luigi Vena who sang Gounod's ``Ave Maria'' at
Kennedy's funeral service Nov. 25, 1963, at Washington's St.
Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral. Jacqueline Kennedy had
specifically requested him to do so. Vena had sung the same music
when she and Kennedy married at Newport, R.I., on Sept. 12, 1953.
Another vital participant at both ceremonies was Cardinal Richard
Cushing of Boston. He officiated at the wedding and sang the
requiem mass at the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have the Atlanta Braves ever had a black announcer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Billy Sample, an outfielder for the Braves in 1986,
announced for the team for two years, 1988 and 1989, said Braves
publicist Glen Serra. Over the years after that, Sample held jobs
announcing for ESPN, the California Angels and the New York
Yankees. No longer in the broadcast booth, he now evaluates umpires
for the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, I heard about a doctor who grows Carolina Gold
rice, donating the crop to a church to sell. Can you tell me about
this venture, and where I might purchase some?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to South Carolina ophthalmologist Richard R.
Schulze who, in an attempt to attract ducks, planted his first rice
seeds in 1979 on his 400-acre Turnbridge Plantation on the South
Carolina side of the Savannah River. Schulze and his wife switched
to Carolina Gold, the original variety grown in the state's Old
South heyday, after discovering a source for the seed in Texas.
Carolina Gold is the variety that European nobility prized for its
sweet, nutty taste and whiter-than-white color after it was washed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Schulze family couldn't consume all the rice they
produced, they have, over the years, given generous amounts to
patients and friends. Even so, they still had a surplus, so Schulze
first donated it to the Savannah Association for the Blind to sell
as a fund-raiser. Now he donates it _ for the same fund-raising
purpose _ to the Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity in Ridgeland,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The church still has a small supply of the Carolina Gold from
last December's harvest, a spokeswoman said Thursday. You can order
it by sending a check to Church of the Holy Trinity, Rt. 3, Box
260, Ridgeland, S.C. 29936. The cost is $10 for a 1 1/2-pound bag,
plus $1.50 for shipping. Once it is sold out, the next crop will be
available for shipping next December, the spokeswoman said.
Information: 803-726-3743.
