   FARMINGTON, Utah _ Here in the heart of the nation's herbal and
vitamin industry, a stainless steel contraption was hard at work on
a recent morning, spitting out clear plastic capsules at the rate
of 90,000 an hour. Each contained precisely 600 milligrams of a
fine, brick-colored powder that federal health officials are trying
to ban.
</P>
<P>
   The powder, a pulverized strain of rice called red yeast, is
imported from China, where it has been consumed for 2,000 years,
both as an herbal remedy (it was thought to improve blood flow) and
a food (it spices up tofu and makes a tasty marinade for duck and
pork.)
</P>
<P>
   Then, five years ago, William McGlashan Jr., a young California
venture capitalist, learned that scientists in Beijing were
studying the rice for another reason: it seemed to lower
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Today, McGlashan's company, Pharmanex, sells the encapsulated
red powder under the trade name Cholestin in 37,000 American
stores, from health food outlets to the giant Wal-Mart chain.
McGlashan calls Cholestin a dietary supplement. Officials at the
Food and Drug Administration call it something else: an illegal,
unapproved drug.
</P>
<P>
   On June 15, in the gray stone federal courthouse in Salt Lake
City, U.S. District Court Judge Dale Kimball will be asked to
determine who is correct. The case is being watched as a pivotal
battle between the FDA, which is chafing against a 1994 law that
left it almost powerless to regulate vitamins and herbal products,
and the dietary supplement industry, which has been growing wildly
since the law was passed.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is not whether Cholestin is dangerous; no one argues
that it is. Rather, the FDA contends that Cholestin has crossed the
increasingly murky boundary that separates dietary supplements from
drugs, because it contains an ingredient, lovastatin, that is the
key component of a cholesterol-lowering drug. Pharmanex says the
lovastatin occurs naturally and that Cholestin is more akin to a
food than a drug.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the case could affect the medicine and kitchen
cabinets of millions of American consumers, including many doctors
and scientists, who have come to believe that herbs like ginkgo,
echinacea and St. John's wort are as important to good health as
aspirin and antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the turf battle between the supplement industry and
regulators, the dispute raises crucial questions: What is the
distinction between these herbal products, which may contain
naturally occurring chemicals as potent as those in any drug, and
drugs themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Must products like Cholestin be subjected to the rigorous
testing that drugs undergo?
</P>
<P>
   ``You see more and more dietary supplements sold right next to
over-the-counter drugs,'' said William Schultz, the FDA's deputy
commissioner for policy. ``There is a risk that the line will
blur.''
</P>
<P>
   It is already blurry. ``Foods are medicines; medicines are
foods,'' said Loren Israelson, executive director of the Utah
Natural Products Alliance, a trade group based in Salt Lake City.
``If you drink coffee in the morning, why are you drinking coffee?
You're looking for the caffeine, a stimulant. That same caffeine is
sold over the counter as No-Doz. That's a drug when it's in a pill
form, and it's a food when it's in coffee. Why is that?''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA struggled with such questions for decades. But with the
passage of the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act,
the law under which the Cholestin case will be decided, the
agency's task grew even more vexing.
</P>
<P>
   The new law took dietary supplements out of the underground and
into the mainstream, giving manufacturers like Pharmanex the
long-sought right to advertise the potential benefits of herbs,
even if the evidence for those benefits was sketchy. If the
products were safe, companies could say what they wished, so long
as they did not claim their products could prevent, treat or cure
disease. Thus, McGlashan can advertise that Cholestin ``promotes
healthy cholesterol,'' but not that it ``prevents heart attack or
stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time,'' he said, ``we can educate the American
consumer about what the product does. We don't have to rely on a
person in a health food store to explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the law was passed, the FDA has received about 2,300
notifications from manufacturers intending to make claims about
their products, and has objected to about 150 of them. It has also
proposed a rule that would restrict, but not eliminate, the
manufacturer's ability to use the herbal stimulant ephedra, which
has been linked to more than a dozen deaths nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But these actions, says former Food and Drugs Commissioner David
Kessler, are hardly enough to make a dent in the rampant
proliferation of herbal remedies that he says are ineffective at
best and unsafe at worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just walk into your pharmacy; it's out of control,'' said
Kessler, who waged a bitter, unsuccessful battle against the 1994
law as commissioner. ``Efficacy is now defined as what sells off
the shelves. The agency is powerless.''
</P>
<P>
   While the law was a disaster for regulators, it was a windfall
for businesses that sell herbs and vitamins. Indeed, after the act
was adopted, annual sales of dietary supplements in the United
States skyrocketed, jumping from more than $8 billion in 1994 to
nearly $12 billion last year, according to the Nutrition Business
Journal, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   So furious has the growth been that one analyst, Matthew Patsky
of the Boston-based investment banking firm of Adams, Harkness &AMP;
Hill, said some of the nation's biggest pharmaceutical companies
are now planning to introduce their own lines of herbal products.
</P>
<P>
   That worries Schultz, the FDA deputy commissioner for policy.
``If companies that would have tested their products and sold them
as drugs are now going to not test them and sell them as dietary
supplements,'' he said, ``then we have lost information about the
safety and efficacy of those products.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the law's beneficiaries was McGlashan, a 34-year-old
Stanford University business school graduate who studied Chinese
history as an undergraduate. With the baby boomers growing older,
McGlashan sensed a growing demand for natural medicines the Chinese
have used for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   McGlashan says he had a vision for his business; he wanted to
apply ``pharmaceutical rigors'' to the dietary supplement industry,
using research to persuade consumers that Eastern therapies worked.
In early 1994, he Dr. Michael Chang, a medical chemist and former
pharmaceutical industry researcher who had set up a manufacturing
plant to produce herbal medicines in Huzhou, China, near Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Chang scoured Chinese research for promising herbal products and
identified 5,000; together, he and McGlashan narrowed the list to
30. By early 1995, Pharmanex was born, with headquarters in Simi
Valley, Calif. Red yeast rice, called Hong Qu, was one of the most
promising projects on its list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know Hong Qu has been used for centuries, but we don't know
why it lowers cholesterol,'' Chang said. ``We need to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 law, McGlashan said, made it worth investing in
science. The company introduced Cholestin at the end of 1996, after
nearly three years of study. Most recently, Pharmanex enlisted Dr.
David Heber, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the
University of California at Los Angeles, to study the effects of
Cholestin in adults with moderately elevated cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   The study, financed by Pharmanex, compared the cholesterol
levels of 42 adults who took 2.5 grams of Cholestin every day for
three months with the levels in 41 adults who were given placebos.
Heber said the total cholesterol counts of those who took the
supplement dropped, on average, from 250 to 210.
</P>
<P>
   Heber dismisses the contention that red yeast rice is a drug;
instead he calls it ``a functional food.'' The same
cholesterol-lowering ingredient in lovastatin, he notes, occurs in
even higher concentrations in oyster mushrooms, commonly used in
Asian cooking. And nobody, he said, is trying to ban mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Richard A. Friedman, director of psychopharmacology
at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, contends the current
distinction between dietary supplements and drugs is based on
semantics, not biology, and that both should be carefully
regulated. ``If there is a biologically active component in the
supplement, to say it is not a drug is illogical because it will
have a similar effect,'' he said. Companies like Pharmanex, he
added, ``want to be able to implant the idea in the public that the
drug is medically beneficial'' without doing rigorous research drug
companies must do to obtain approval.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of science, McGlashan admits, would cost far too much
for a small company like his. Yet with a decent body of research
behind Cholestin, he said, he at one time envisioned himself
becoming the FDA's poster boy for good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he received a visit from FDA investigators in April of
last year; the agency had received complaints that Cholestin
contained lovastatin, both from a pharmacist and from Merck &AMP; Co,
the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Mevacor, the
cholestorol-lowering drug that contains the same ingredient as
Cholestin.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, federal authorities impounded 10 tons of red
yeast rice that had come into the Port of Los Angeles from China;
the shipment is now sitting in a storage facility in Mexico. Then
on May 20, the FDA notified McGlashan that it considered Cholestin
illegal, a move that prompted the company to ask for a hearing
before Kimball of the U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   McGlashan contends that, at its root, the dispute is an economic
one. Cholestin, he said, is sold to people who are too healthy for
Mevacor, the Merck drug. Merck, he contends, is making a power grab
for that market by trying to push Cholestin off the shelves _ a
charge denied by Jan Weiner, a spokeswoman for the pharmaceutical
company.
</P>
<P>
   While the court case is pending, McGlashan said, sales of
Cholestin are booming. One woman recently wrote him to say she had
purchased eight months' worth of the capsules. Even his mother
called, he said, asking, ``How am I supposed to get my Cholestin?''
</P>
<P>
   For now, McGlashan has no answer. Standing outside the
low-pressure room where the encapsulating machine was spinning, a
lab coat covering his royal blue shirt and Hermes tie, he looked a
little wistful. The fine red powder being packed into the capsules,
he said, was the last of his supply.
