<P>
   Herbal medicine, the mainstay of therapeutics for centuries
before modern purified drugs relegated it to the status of
near-quackery, has in the last five years emerged from the fringes
of health care with an astonishing flourish and now shows clear
signs of joining the medical mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many cautionary tales about adulterated and even
dangerous products, herbs formulated as capsules, tinctures,
extracts and teas _ and increasingly as additions to common foods
like potato chips and fruit drinks _ are now routinely used by a
third of American adults seeking to enhance their health or
alleviate their illnesses. Each day the herbal realm wins new
converts, particularly among those who have become disillusioned
with the cost and consequences of traditional drugs, distrustful of
conventional physicians and convinced that ``natural'' equals
``good.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, because herbal products are classified as dietary
supplements, not drugs, and face none of the premarket hurdles
drugs must clear, consumers have no assurance of safety or
effectiveness. Indeed, scores of products sold in the United States
are listed by European and American authorities as ineffective,
unsafe or both, and manufacturing standards to assure high quality
have been proposed but are not yet in force.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, countless consumers are wasting their money on useless
products or jeopardizing their health on hazardous ones. Among the
serious side effects that have been linked to herbal remedies are
high blood pressure, life-threatening allergic reactions, heart
rhythm abnormalities, mania, kidney failure and liver damage. A few
widely available products, including sassafras and comfrey, contain
known carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, according to a report last year in the journal
Psychosomatics, unsuspecting consumers ``have used herbal remedies
with good results only to discover that the benefit was actually
derived from the presence of undisclosed medicines,'' including
steroids, anti-inflammatory agents, sedatives and hormones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of quality standards is the No. 1 problem in the
whole industry,'' said Dr. Varro Tyler, emeritus professor of
pharmacognosy (the study of active ingredients in plants) at Purdue
University. Tyler, who has no financial connection to herbal
products and is arguably the nation's leading independent expert on
herbal medicine, said: ``I feel sorry for the typical consumer. How
is he or she to know what is best, what products are reliable and
safe? Even when a label says the product has been standardized, the
consumer has no way to know if it actually meets that standard.''
And even if an herbal product has been reliably made in some
standard dose, it does not mean that scientific studies have shown
it to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   The industry itself is promoting a ``good manufacturing
practices'' doctrine. Annette Dickinson, director of scientific and
regulatory affairs for the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a
trade organization for producers of dietary supplements, said a
consortium of associations submitted a document of manufacturing
standards to the Food and Drug Administration two years ago.
Although such a standard would say nothing about an herb's safety
or effectiveness, it would result in reliable methods that the
industry would have to use to assure the identity and quality of
its products. The agency has issued a notice of proposed rules but
no final ruling as yet.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, botanicals _ as herbal products are more accurately
known _ are enjoying an annual retail market approaching $4
billion, up from $839 million in 1991 and growing about 18 percent
a year. Hundreds of products formulated with virtually no
government oversight are crowding shelves of health food stores,
food markets and pharmacies nationwide. Supplements are also widely
sold by marketers like Amway, through catalogs and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even major pharmaceutical companies like Warner Lambert,
American Home Products, Bayer and SmithKline Beecham are
introducing herbal products, adding respectability to this
marginalized market.
</P>
<P>
   Some herbs _ like echinacea, goldenseal, American ginseng and
wild yam _ have become so popular that their continued supply from
natural sources is in danger. As the plants become scarcer and more
expensive, products containing them are increasingly likely to be
adulterated and may even contain none of the herb listed on the
label. Peggy Brevoort, president of East Earth Herb Inc., a company
in Eugene, Ore., that produces botanicals, said the demand for St.
John's wort, used for mild depression, and kava, a calmative said
to reduce anxiety, now exceeds their supply, introducing the
``danger of adulteration'' by ``unscrupulous dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, two major new publications _ a 1,244-page
Physicians' Desk Reference for Herbal Medicines, produced by the
same company that publishes the Physicians' Desk Reference, and an
English-language edition of Germany's therapeutic guide to herbal
medicines, The Complete German Commission E Monographs _ have been
issued to help educate physicians, pharmacists and interested
consumers about the known uses, proper dosages and safety concerns
of more than 600 botanicals now sold in this country. The
evaluations in both books are based on studies, most done in
Germany and reviewed by teams of experts.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the National Institutes of Health began listing on
the Internet international bibliographic information on dietary
supplements, including herbal products. The address is
www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/IBIDS/.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a few medical and pharmacology schools have
recently introduced courses in phytomedicine, the study of
botanicals. And next month the American Pharmaceutical Association
will conduct a two-day program on herbal medicine as part of its
annual meeting. Still, most doctors remain wary of botanicals,
especially when patients choose self-medication with plant extracts
over established medical remedies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The very act of Congress that has fostered this growth _ the
1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act _ has also
permitted chaos to reign in the botanical marketplace, with no
mechanism to assure that products are safe or effective. Pushed
heavily by Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the home base of
many supplement makers, and passed over the objections of the FDA,
the law created a new product class, the dietary supplement, that
was not subject to regulations applied to drugs. Now any substance
that can be found in foods, regardless of amount or action and
including substances that act as hormones or toxins, can be
produced and sold without any premarket testing or agency approval.
</P>
<P>
   Marketed as neither a food nor a drug, herbal products are not
obliged to meet any established standards of effectiveness or
safety for medicinal products, which require extensive laboratory
and clinical trials before approval. As with other substances
classified as dietary supplements, the FDA can restrict the sale of
an herbal product only if it receives well-documented reports of
health problems associated with it. The agency took four years, and
more than 100 reports of life-threatening symptoms and 38 deaths,
to act against ephedra, often sold as the Chinese herb ma huang, a
stimulant that can prove disastrous to people with heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   With FDA authority limited by the 1994 law, the Federal Trade
Commission, which monitors advertising, has taken a more active
role in monitoring supplement makers.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC last year took legal action against seven manufacturers
that had broken rules requiring advertising be truthful and
verifiable. The companies were selling remedies or purported
cure-alls for ailments like impotence, cancer and obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also sent e-mail warnings to 1,200 Internet sites
that it said had made ``incredible claims'' for drugs, devices and
supplements, including herbal remedies that would supposedly ward
off AIDS. Also, the commission late last year issued its first set
of advertising guidelines aimed specifically at the supplement
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the current regulations have created a quagmire of
consumer confusion and set up potential health crises that even
industry officials say could ultimately hurt producers as well as
users of herbal products. Under the 1994 law, consumers have no
assurance that an herbal product contains what the label says it
does or that it is free from harmful contaminants. Independent
analyses of some products, particularly those containing costly or
scarce herbs, revealed that some have little or none of the
purported active ingredient listed on the label.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion is that botanical makers are allowed to
describe products only in terms of their effects on the structure
or function of the body, not their potential health benefits. Thus,
a product label might say ``promotes cardiac function'' but it
cannot say ``lowers cholesterol.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, although the law does allow health warnings on the
label, most manufacturers have yet to include them.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are warned, however, that federal drug safety
officials are not watching the store. All botanicals must display a
disclaimer on the label following the description of the product's
structural or functional role: ``This statement has not been
evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not
intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.'' To
which Tyler commented, ``If that is true, why on earth would anyone
use it?''
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of the modern herbal market were sown in the '60s when
``green, organic and natural became buzzwords,'' Tyler said. But
they did not mature until the '90s with the growing consumer
interest in ``self-care and controlling one's destiny,'' he said.
Many turned to herbs as a gentler way to treat health problems and
a potential tool for preserving mental and physical health.
</P>
<P>
   The interest has spawned scores of Internet sites and hundreds
of books on various herbs. But much of the literature is replete
with poorly documented health claims and, with few exceptions
(among them, Tyler's books), advocacy prevails over objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   Because plants contain a mixture of relatively diluted
chemicals, they naturally tend to have milder actions, both in
their therapeutic benefits and side effects, than the concentrated,
single chemicals in most drugs. Thus, botanicals generally take
longer to act than regular pharmaceuticals and few have the potency
of a prescription, the one possible exception being saw palmetto,
which a well-designed study indicated may be as helpful for an
enlarged prostate as the more expensive and riskier drug, Proscar.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of chemicals in botanicals is potentially both a
plus and a minus. When two or more chemicals enhance one another's
activity, the therapeutic benefit could theoretically exceed that
of an isolated substance formulated as a drug. Mark Blumenthal, who
heads the American Botanical Council, noted that the herb St.
John's wort, widely used in Germany and increasingly in the United
States to counter mild depression, is standardized for a substance
called hypericin. But, he explained, ``hypericin is not directly
linked to its antidepressant activity.'' Rather, other substances
in the herb seem to have diverse actions on brain chemicals, all of
which work together to counter depression.
</P>
<P>
   Equally possible, though, when using an herb with two or more
active chemicals, is that one will cancel the benefits of another
or introduce a hazard. Without careful chemical tests and large,
well-controlled clinical trials such actions are often hard to
detect.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer confidence in herbal medicine is bolstered by the
common but erroneous assumption that ``natural'' equals ``safe''
and the public's failure to realize that many plants contain
chemicals that are potent drugs or outright poisons. Natural
laxatives like the herb Cascara sagrada are just as habit-forming
and harmful to the colon as laxatives sold as drugs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one quarter of prescription drugs and hundreds of
over-the-counter products were originally isolated from plants.
Ephedra, for example, contains a natural stimulant that is approved
for use as a decongestant and bronchial dilator in some
pharmaceutical products. However, when used in uncontrolled dosages
or by people with certain underlying health problems, it can cause
a dangerous rise in blood pressure and, in its herbal form, has
been responsible for serious adverse reactions and dozens of
deaths, mainly among people who inappropriately used it as a
stimulant or diet aid.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the safety issue is the fact, shown in several
recent surveys, that most patients fail to tell their physicians
they use herbal supplements and thus sometimes risk dangerous drug
interactions or endure costly tests or treatments when an herb
causes an unrecognized side effect. Experts say many patients
withhold information about herbal drug use because they fear being
ridiculed by their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Although all German physicians must take courses on herbal
remedies, only a handful of American medical and pharmacology
schools offer courses in this field.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the President's Commission on Dietary Supplement
Labels recommended that the FDA appoint a committee to evaluate the
safety and effectiveness of herbal products. ``This could be the
most important step in the United States toward legitimizing herbal
medicine,'' Tyler said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the agency responded that it lacked the budget to
support such an effort. American physicians have completed and
published only a few well-designed studies of some popular
botanicals. Among them were studies showing that saw palmetto can
shrink an enlarged prostate and ginkgo biloba can improve memory in
patients with early Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of
Health is helping to finance a three-year multicenter study of St.
John's wort as a treatment for clinical depression and a study of
plant-based estrogens as a preventive for postmenopausal health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   However, thousands of studies of botanicals have been completed
abroad _ mainly in Germany _ that strongly suggest a
health-promoting role for more than 200 plant products. Germany's
Commission E evaluated 380 botanicals, approving 254 as safe and
reasonably effective and disapproving 126 as ineffective, unsafe or
both.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans use a different criterion to assess an herb's
benefits _ a doctrine of ``reasonable certainty'' that the herb has
the desired effect and is safe, Blumenthal said. Whereas standard
testing of a drug for approval by the FDA can cost as much as $500
million per product _ a prohibitive amount for companies to spend
on botanicals that cannot be patented _ tests to establish
``reasonable certainty'' would cost only $1 million to $2 million,
Tyler estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, Dr. Robert Temple, director of medical policy for
the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation, suggested that, rather than
subjecting botanicals to the extensive tests required for drugs,
the agency might consider applying less stringent criteria to
assess an herb's effects, at least when a product is to be used
only for a short time. He said, ``A long history of safe use might
provide sufficient safety information for products that are
intended for short-term use.''
</P>
<P>
   More than four dozen botanicals or botanical formulations have
been submitted to the agency as investigational new drugs. If any
meet the agency's criteria for safety and effectiveness and are
eventually approved as drugs, they would be allowed to carry direct
health claims _ instead of just structure and function statements _
on labels and in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dr. Joerg Gruenwald, medical director of a German
phytomedicine company and primary editor of the new Physicians'
Desk Reference for Herbal Medicines, said professionals can rely on
that volume for current, documented information about botanicals.
The volume, to be issued annually, updates the Commission E reports
and adds several hundred other products sold in the United States,
listing effects, side effects and conditions in which their use is
inadvisable.
