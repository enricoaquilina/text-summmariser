   AUSTIN, Texas _ Seeking to boost his daily workouts at the gym,
Jeff Bowers turned recently to a popular herbal supplement to
increase his metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers bought the ephedrine-based product, Ripped Fuel, at a
health food store in San Antonio. But after only a few days of
using it as directed to try and heighten athletic performance and
burn fat, Bowers suffered an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel my heart pounding through my shirt, my hands were
jittery and I was hyperventilating, so my roommate took me to the
emergency room,'' he recalled in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the Ripped Fuel with me, and before I even opened it
up, the nurse guessed what it was,'' he said. ``She said I wasn't
the first whom she'd seen with the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving more than 1,400 similar, ephedrine-related
complaints from people across the state, the Texas Department of
Health is considering classifying the stimulant as a dangerous drug
and requiring a prescription for most products containing it.
</P>
<P>
   Banning ephedrine from over-the-counter sales would affect the
multimillion-dollar, herbal-supplement industry in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its products include diet aids, athletic
performance-boosters and many ``herbal ecstasy'' intoxicants that
teen-agers buy at convenience stores to get an amphetamine-like
``buzz'' or ``high.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of non-prescription ephedrine products sold for asthma,
such as Primatene and some nasal decongestants, would not fall
under the proposed new regulations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At least eight deaths in Texas and more than 40 nationwide have
been linked to ephedrine _ a stimulant found in certain Asian
plants _ said Cynthia Culmo of the state health department.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say you can determine a safe amount (for over-the-counter
sale) is incorrect,'' Culmo said. ``The only amount we see as safe
is zero.''
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Health committee met Wednesday to accept public
comment on the regulation change. More than 150 people testified at
the hearing, with an overwhelming majority against requiring
prescription sales of ephedrine.
</P>
<P>
   Most who testified were connected to the industry that provides
ephedrine-based dietary supplements or stimulants. The witnesses
pleaded with the state to back down from the proposal and instead
consider a compromise that, among other things, would restrict
sales of ephedrine-based products to minors.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health is not expected to rule on the possible
changes until this fall.

   Banning over-the-counter sales of ephedrine would only hurt
consumers and independent business distributors, while allowing
larger drug companies to profit, said Phillip Sindler of the
Dallas-based Wellness International Network, which sells dietary
supplements, including the stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a health issue. It's an issue of where is the profit
going to go,'' Sindler told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 companies in the Texas market ephedrine-based
products, which constitute a multimillion industry in the state,
according to Michael Ellis, president of Metabolife International.
</P>
<P>
   Although other states have restricted some sales of ephedrine
products, Texas' proposal is by far the most far-reaching, Ellis
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shocked us,'' he said, stressing that there is no medical
evidence that ephedrine products cause adverse effects.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis and Dr. Ted Farber, a toxicologist for the dietary
supplement industry, disputed the number of complaints and deaths
Culmo said were possibly linked to ephedrine products.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration originally had reported it was
investigating more than 40 deaths possibly related to ephedrine,
Farber said. But recently, the federal agency revised that number
to only two, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An FDA spokeswoman did not respond to a request for the correct
number.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA currently is considering prohibiting the marketing of
dietary supplements containing 8 milligrams or more of ephedrine
per dose. The agency also is looking at requiring product labels
that instruct consumers not to use the product for more than seven
days.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence ephedrine is safe, Ellis cited an ongoing study by
Dr. Patricia Daly of the Harvard Medical School on the effects of a
supplement containing caffeine and ephedra, an herb from which
ephedrine is extracted.
</P>
<P>
   The incomplete study, paid for by companies that market
ephedrine products, has found no adverse effects so far on
patients, Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   The death about two months ago of a 15-year-old California girl
who was taking an ephedrine-based stimulant also has highlighted
the ongoing debate over the safety of such products. Rosanna Porras
reportedly took Ripped Fuel capsules before collapsing at soccer
practice.
</P>
<P>
   She later died, and California officials are still investigating
the possibility that the herbal supplement caused her death. The
company that markets Ripped Fuel, Twinlaboratories Inc. in New
York, has said it does not believe its product was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers supports the move to ban such products from
over-the-counter sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'll admit that part of it's because of my own ignorance
for trusting some 18-year-old who recommended the stuff at the
health food store,'' he said. ``But these companies are duping
people because they stand to make a lot of money, while this stuff
is killing people.''
