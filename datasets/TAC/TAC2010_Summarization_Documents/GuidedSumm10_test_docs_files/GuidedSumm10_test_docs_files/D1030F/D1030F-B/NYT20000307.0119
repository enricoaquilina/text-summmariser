&HT;     FDA REVIVES PROBE OF ENERGY SUPPLEMENT AMID SAFETY CONCERNS

   SAN FRANCISCO _ In truck stops, it's sold as a ``super-energy''
pill.
</P>
<P>
   In drugstores, it's touted as an appetite-curbing diet aid.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, it's marketed to teen-agers as an herbal
alternative to the illegal street drug, Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra, a chemical cousin to the drug methamphetamine, has been
popularized in hundreds of health products sold as dietary
supplements. It's as easy to buy as aspirin, and looks safer,
because no warning labels are required.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Food and Drug Administration has collected more than 800
reports of users suffering adverse reactions, ranging from
dizziness and dementia to strokes, heart attacks and sudden deaths.
</P>
<P>
   After years of failed attempts to regulate the ephedra products,
the FDA notified Congress on Feb. 25 that it is launching a new
push to address public safety issues posed by ephedra.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of concern about this particular product in
terms of its safety,'' said Joe Levitt, who heads the FDA unit that
oversees dietary supplements. ``There is a public health issue here
that needs to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of dietary supplement products contain ephedra, which
is extracted from the Chinese plant ma-huang and then manufactured
into capsules, liquids or powders.
</P>
<P>
   They are sold as energy boosters for athletes, as weight loss
tools, muscle builders, or as stimulants for those who need to stay
awake. A few companies even market products as an herbal
alternative to the illegal street drug Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say that ephedra, which has a chemical structure that
differs from methamphetamine by only one atom, has an effect on the
body similar to that of the illicit drug ``speed.'' It constricts
the blood vessels, raises blood pressure and causes the heart to
beat more rapidly, according to Dr. Bill Gurley, a pharmacologist
with the University of Alabama, who has studied ephedra products.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Siegner, a lawyer who represents dietary supplement
manufacturers, said the industry's own research has shown ephedra
is safe if taken in proper doses and in accordance with package
labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry is very, very concerned about the safety of these
products as well,'' he said. ``Industry has consulted with
toxicologists and doctors and come up with a dosage that we believe
is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gurley and Haller said they believe that even small doses
can trigger devastating reactions in people who have
susceptibilities they don't know about.
</P>
<P>
   While industry officials say there is no proof that ephedra is
the actual cause of the reported problems, some of the
most-publicized cases have involved alarming injuries:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1998, 15-year-old Rosanna Porras of Ventura County, Calif.,
collapsed on a high school soccer field from a massive heart
attack. Friends said she had been taking ephedra energy pills
available at local drugstores to boost her athletic stamina. Her
parents believe that the pills triggered an underlying heart
condition, causing her death.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 28-year-old Seattle woman claimed that ephedra diet pills
made her slip into such severe psychosis that she became delusional
while driving and slammed into another car in Canada, killing two
teen-age girls. A Canadian court agreed that she was made
temporarily insane by the product and declined to prosecute her.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 31-year-old Newport Beach, Calif., man was hospitalized for
uncontrollable vomiting after using a tea containing ephedra to
help his body-building regimen for several months. Doctors found a
hole in his pancreas ``big enough to put a thumb through.'' He was
diagnosed with ``pancreatitis'' and told he would have to receive
daily insulin injections for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike drugs, dietary supplements, including those containing
ephedra, are not tightly regulated by the FDA. Current federal law
allows companies to market many chemicals extracted from natural
sources as dietary supplements without first having to study the
safety or effectiveness of them. Yet medical experts say those
unstudied chemicals occurring in nature can be just as potent as
synthetic, prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   John Hathcock, of the Washington, D.C.-based dietary supplement
industry group, the Council for Responsible Nutrition, said the
industry does not oppose warning labels, but he dismissed
suggestions that ephedra products ought to be sold by prescription
only.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everything that has the potential to be dangerous can be
taken off the market and made prescription only,'' he said.
``People kill themselves with liquid drain cleaner.''

   The FDA's earlier attempts to regulate ephedra, starting in
1997, were beaten down by political opposition and criticism that
the agency failed to scientifically prove the substance was unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   With drugs, manufacturers are required to show the products are
safe before putting them on the market. But with dietary
supplements, which are regulated like foods, federal law places the
burden on the FDA to prove the product is unsafe, before it can
impose restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Citing adverse reaction reports collected by the agency, the FDA
originally proposed requiring companies to sell ephedra products
only in low dosages and to advise consumers to use them for no more
than seven days. The proposal also would have banned popular
products that mix ephedra with caffeine _ a combination that
medical experts say greatly magnifies stimulant effects.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA backed off the proposal, after an uproar from
industry leaders and some members of Congress and a report from the
General Accounting Office criticizing the agency's methodology for
proving ephedra was unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   In its Feb. 25 letter to Congress, the agency withdrew its
earlier proposal to limit ephedra dosages and announced it will
hold hearings to work out new ways to handle the safety concerns
about the substance.
