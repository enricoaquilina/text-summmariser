   Three-year-old Siderah Bentley's parents have given her herbal
remedies since infancy. When she had fever and congestion as an
infant, elderberry juice eased her symptoms within a half hour.
Dandelion root tea worked wonders when Siderah complained of pain
when she urinated. Now, on days when she's cranky, chamomile tea
calms her down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herbal medicines have been around for centuries, so they have
a longer safety record than conventional drugs, which means I feel
more comfortable using them on my child,'' says her father, Andrew
Bentley, a professional herbalist in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Calise Finney is a more recent convert. When she noticed
that her son Max's ears were inflamed, she was reluctant to load
her 1-year-old with antibiotics, the standard treatment for ear
infections. So her family physician, who has incorporated
alternative medicine into her practice, recommended an antidote
that sounds as though it were lifted from a 19th-century
apothecary's stores: ear drops fortified with licorice, echinacea,
mullein and calendula.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my first experience treating an ear infection with
herbals _ and he got well without antibiotics,'' says Finney,
director of a learning center in Boulder, Colo. ``That really sold
me on herbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynnell Ramey wishes she had used them sooner. ``Our previous
pediatrician overused antibiotics,'' says Ramey, a 30-year-old
mother of three who lives in Gainesville, Ga. ``Now my middle
child, who's 4, has a few infections we're having a hard time
getting rid of because he was given so many antibiotics for
recurrent ear infections when he was younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ann Sheth, a pediatrician in Lawrenceville, Ga., suggested
that Ramey try several milder herbal products to treat her youngest
child's colds and congestion. To Ramey's surprise, they worked.
Now, whenever he gets the sniffles, she'll put a few echinacea
drops in his apple juice to disguise the herb's tart taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stops the symptoms in their tracks,'' says Ramey, who
admits she ``was very doubtful initially about using herbs. But Dr.
Sheth had experience using them, and I trusted her judgment. I'm
glad I did.''
</P>
<P>
   These parents' stories echo those of thousands of others who
have recently discovered age-old folk remedies, often with the
recommendation of family doctors who are adding herbal remedies _
for example, echinacea to stave off colds and flu, chamomile or
lavender to treat colic, calendula to soothe diaper rash and ginger
root to quell queasy little stomachs _ to their disease-fighting
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal medicine has become big business. Last year, Americans
snapped up nearly $4 billion worth of herbal products from the
shelves of supermarkets, pharmacies and health food stores. Fueling
these soaring sales, at least in part, is growing scientific
evidence indicating that some of these products really can ease the
symptoms of many minor ills. That also explains why alternative
medicine is gaining acceptance by the medical mainstream and more
doctors are getting up to speed on botanical remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use them routinely in my practice,'' says Dr. Kathi J.
Kemper, director of the Center for Holistic Pediatric Education and
Research at Children's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one 1998 survey, conducted by researchers at Wayne
State University School of Medicine in Detroit and the Medical
University of South Carolina in South Charleston, revealed that
half of the pediatricians polled would consider referring their
patients for therapies such as homeopathy, acupuncture and herbal
supplements to treat benign childhood ills such as scrapes, stuffy
noses, and stomachaches.
</P>
<P>
   Even more startling were the results of a 1998 study of local
physicians conducted by Kemper at the Swedish Medical Center at the
University of Washington in Seattle. At the height of the cold
season, one-third of the doctors surveyed were treating their own
colds with echinacea and zinc, and half were found to be taking
vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   However promising these herbal medicines sound, though, be aware
of some important caveats before you treat your child with them.
First, the herbal supplement industry is poorly regulated by the
FDA. The agency will step in if a product claims to cure a
condition, but many herbals say only that they may be of help in
easing certain symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Second, some botanical remedies, many of which have not been
tested specifically on children, can have powerful and unexpected
side effects. This makes it imperative that you check with your
child's doctor or health care practitioner before administering any
herbal product, however innocuous it may seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents need to be careful _ they should not just go to the
health food store and start picking things off the shelf,''
cautions Dr. Tierana Low Dog, a family practitioner in Albuquerque
who is on the botanical medicine faculty at Columbia University in
New York City. ``They need the assistance of someone who knows
about herbal medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to talk to your pediatrician. ``Parents are
often reluctant to ask their doctor about herbs because they think
their physician will look down on them,'' says Sheth. ``But doctors
have more access to the latest scientific information. Once I've
made a diagnosis, if my patients are interested in herbs, I'll have
them fax me the (names of) ingredients of something they're
considering using. Then I'll double-check the ingredients to give
them my recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to consult a doctor before giving your child an
herbal: Subtle signs of illness, especially in children under age
2, can indicate a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving your kids herbs is no substitute for seeing a doctor if
they're sick,'' says Dr. Bob Rountree, a family practitioner in
Boulder, and co-author of ``Smart Medicine for a Healthier Child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, that nagging cough or lingering cold may need
more than echinacea _ these symptoms could be warning signs of
pneumonia, while an earache could progress to meningitis. Herbs are
particularly useful in the early stages of mild illnesses, but they
will never take the place of all medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   In treating their youngest patients, physicians like Low Dog and
Rountree say they have had success over the years using these
botanicals:
</P>
<P>
   _ chamomile tea to calm frazzled nerves and relieve stomach
cramps
</P>
<P>
   _ ginger root, grated and simmered in water, to prevent nausea
from a bout of stomach flu or motion sickness and to help children
fall asleep.
</P>
<P>
   _ peppermint leaves, made into a tea or munched straight from
the garden, to help soothe an upset stomach.
</P>
<P>
   _ rosemary, whether in capsule form or served as a tea, to treat
colds, sore throats and headaches in children.
</P>
<P>
   _ calendula (also known as pot marigold), found in topical
creams, to treat mild cases of diaper rash and other skin
irritations.
</P>
<P>
   _ lavender, taken as a tea, to relieve nausea, motion sickness
and gas. A few drops of lavender oil placed on a child's forehead
or on a pillow can also help him fall asleep.
</P>
<P>
   _ aloe vera, used as gel taken directly from the live plant, to
soothe minor cuts and scrapes and to take the sting out of sunburn.
``When you apply aloe on children's sunburns,'' says Low Dog, ``you
can just feel the heat coming off their backs. And it's excellent
to use on insect bites, too.''
</P>
<P>
   _ echinacea, taken in capsule form or as drops, to short-circuit
cold and flu bugs. ``Often we can abort an upper respiratory viral
infection if we catch it in the earliest stages,'' says Low Dog _
and thereby avoid giving kids antihistamines that can leave them in
a fog, or antibiotics that can make them a breeding ground for
drug-resistant bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Though some herbs are considered safe and effective, others can
have harmful side effects. Know that:
</P>
<P>
   _ children under 6 months should never be given herbals. Their
liver and digestive tracts are still developing and their fragile
systems can't handle them. Kids between the ages of 6 and 12 months
should only be given herbals under a doctor's direct supervision.
</P>
<P>
   _ herbal medications can counteract or dull the effects of drugs
your child is already using.
</P>
<P>
   _ parents of kids with asthma or allergies should be especially
careful with herbals; many (like echinacea) are made from plants
belonging to the ragweed family, which can trigger an allergic
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   _ certain herbs are taboo for children. Among them, chaparral,
pennyroyal, ephedra, germander and comfrey, as well as concentrated
oils derived from peppermint, eucalyptus and the tea tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``These oils are very toxic,'' warns Dr. Gail Mahady, a research
assistant professor in the Department of Medicinal Chemistry and
Pharmacognosy at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ``Less than
a teaspoon can kill a child or cause severe reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the FDA has no inspection authority over facilities
that manufacture herbal supplements. Most of these are on the up
and up, but there have been problems with the potency and purity of
batches of loose herbs imported from Mexico and China. Some, for
example, may contain heavy metals, especially lead, mercury and
arsenic, as well as other impurities, while as much as 30 percent
of Chinese-grown herbs are laced with potent prescription
medications like steroids, antibiotics and painkillers, according
to Kemper.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, too, that ``a supplement billing itself as 'all
natural' isn't automatically safe,'' according to Dr. Michael D.
Cirigliano, assistant professor of medicine at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia. ``Hemlock is
natural. So is snake venom.''
