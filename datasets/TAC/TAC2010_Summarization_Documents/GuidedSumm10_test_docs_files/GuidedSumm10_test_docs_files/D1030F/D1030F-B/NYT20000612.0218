   REMEDIES: When Supplements Cause Sleeplessness
</P>
<P>
   Doctors whose patients are having trouble falling asleep or
staying awake should ask what herbal medications they may be
taking, researchers from the University of Illinois at Chicago
report.
</P>
<P>
   The medications may exacerbate sleep problems, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charlotte Gyllenhaal, a professor in the university's
college of pharmacology, said the study, an analysis of medical
literature, was conceived by her co-author, Dr. Sharon Merritt,
director of the university's sleep research center. Merritt had
noticed that an increasing number of patients complaining of
insomnia were taking the stimulant ephedra, sold as a dietary
supplement, to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   Gyllenhaal said the study, published in the June issue of Sleep
Medicine Reviews, found reason for doctors to be concerned about
ephedra because of the disorders that it could make worse,
including high blood pressure and diabetes, besides possibly
unintended effects on sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Some herbal medicines' reputations are better founded than
others, she said. Valerian and kava have been shown to be effective
as mild sedatives; findings on ginseng, said to fight fatigue, are
equivocal.
</P>
<P>
   Gyllenhaal said the best remedy for insomnia was not medication
but a change in behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herbal medicines, like any others, are best for occasional use
or after sleep disruptions like travel,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   What does she use for such occasions? ``I never have a hard time
getting to sleep _ I'm always exhausted,'' said Gyllenhaal, 51.
``But I'm at an age where getting back to sleep can be a problem. I
take one milligram of melatonin, which makes that easier, and if
for some reason anxiety is a problem, I take a little kava.''

   OUTCOMES: An Eye on the Elderly for Mental Health
</P>
<P>
   A program that used janitors and building managers to monitor
the mental health of the elderly in public housing helped reduce
depression and other problems, according to a study reported last
week in The Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   In a study conducted by psychiatrists from Johns Hopkins
University at six sites in Baltimore, people at three of the sites
who had regular contact with residents were trained by a
psychiatric nurse to recognize and report changes in mental status.
When a warning was sounded, the nurse examined the patient and
worked with a psychiatrist to plan treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the sites where the program was in effect scored 32
percent lower on a test measuring levels of depression, and 17
percent higher in a test of general mental health.
</P>
<P>
   The program has since been expanded to all Baltimore public
housing, said Dr. Peter Rabins, a psychiatrist who led the study.
Having nurses provide care where patients live ``seems to overcome
the stigma of mental illness for elderly residents,'' he said.

   PATTERNS: The Finer Points of Seat Belt Safety
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a shoulder belt without wearing a lap belt can leave
drivers and passengers at greater risk of some serious injuries
than wearing no seat belt at all, researchers conclude in a study
in the current issue of The Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies found that in cars that combined automatic
shoulder belts with manual lap belts, drivers would leave the lap
belts unbuckled 50 percent to 70 percent of the time. Other studies
found that neglecting the lap belt raised the risk of death in a
serious accident, though not as much as wearing no seat belt at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, by researchers from the Harborview Injury
Prevention and Research Center in Seattle, went further, analyzing
data from more than 25,000 ``tow away'' crashes that occurred from
1993 to 1996 to look at types of injury in a variety of
circumstances. Few victims, 2.7 percent, were wearing shoulder
belts without lap belts, while 21.9 percent wore no belt.
</P>
<P>
   Partly belted car occupants fared about as well as those who
wore no belt in incidence of head injury, while people who wore
both belts cut their risk by more than 80 percent. Chest and
abdominal injuries were more than twice as common among those who
wore shoulder but not lap belts than among those with no belts.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 million vehicles still on the road have the combination
belts, abandoned in the mid-1990s. ``We may just have to wait for
them to fade out,'' said Dr. Frederick P. Rivara, the study's lead
author.

   PREVENTION: After a Stroke, an Aspirin Regimen
</P>
<P>
   Aspirin is safer and has a more immediate benefit for acute
stroke patients than previously believed, according to a study in
the June issue of the journal Stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, aspirin has been given to survivors of strokes
caused by clots that cut off the blood flow to the brain, called
ischemic strokes. By preventing coagulation, the risk of a second
such stroke is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors have hesitated to give aspirin quickly because it
thins the blood and can harm patients whose strokes are caused by
brain hemorrhages. This is particularly true where brain scans are
rarely available to allow doctors to pinpoint the cause, said the
study's lead author, Dr. Zeng Ming Chen of Oxford University.
</P>
<P>
   Chen and a team of colleagues analyzed data on 40,000 stroke
patients in two studies, the Chinese Acute Stroke Trial and the
International Stroke Trial. In both trials, half the patients
arriving at hospitals within 48 hours of a stroke's onset were
given aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that even a few weeks' use of aspirin
decreased the rate of recurrent strokes by a third. They also found
that the dangers of aspirin may have been overstated: of the 40,000
patients, they found 773 who had suffered hemorrhagic strokes and
been given aspirin by mistake, but no difference was seen in
outcome from those who had not.
</P>
<P>
   More powerful clot-busting drugs have been shown to be more
effective but they must generally be given within three to six
hours of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early aspirin therapy should be used much more widely,'' Chen
said.

   EVIDENCE: Data Suggest Multiple Causes of MS
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who analyzed brain tissue from patients suffering
acute flare-ups of multiple sclerosis say they found evidence to
support the idea that the disorder may be a group of different
diseases, some caused by malfunctions of the immune system and some
by viruses or toxins.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in the June issue of Annals of Neurology,
the researchers described finding four consistent separate patterns
of damage to the covering of nerves in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The striking differences in the course of MS in different
patients _ some of whom have cycles of relapse and recovery, some
of whom steadily deteriorate _ had led to speculation that the
condition could have more than one cause. But pursuit of this
theory has been limited by the scarcity of brain samples from MS
patients other than deeply scarred tissue from some who died after
chronic degeneration.
</P>
<P>
   In the current study, led by Dr. Hans Lassman of the University
of Vienna, brain tissue was collected in biopsies from 51 patients
in efforts to rule out other diseases and from 32 others who died
during an acute MS flare-up.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the researchers, Dr. Claudia Lucchinetti of the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., will lead an effort to translate the
patterns found in the biopsied brains into criteria that be can be
used for diagnosis without such surgery. In the longer run, an
accompanying editorial said, the study could help determine which
medicines might be most effective for patients exhibiting one
pattern or another.
