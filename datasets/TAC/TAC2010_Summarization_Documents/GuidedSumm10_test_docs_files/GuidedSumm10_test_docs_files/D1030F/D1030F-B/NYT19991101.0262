 &HT;    Losing weight 101: Eat less, move more

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Count calories. No, count fat grams.
</P>
<P>
   All right, you can have some fat, but only the good kind. Eat
more protein and less sugar. Eat more fiber and less dairy. Eat six
small meals, not three big ones.
</P>
<P>
   Snack. Don't snack. Don't touch pasta. Don't even look at that
Halloween candy.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise 30 minutes, three times a week. Or 10 minutes, three
times a day, three times a week. Or 90 minutes on the days with the
letter A in them.
</P>
<P>
   Every diet and exercise program says: Eat this, do that.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, losing weight and improving your health boils down
to this: Eat less, move more.
</P>
<P>
   At heart, we know this. Most of America knows this.
</P>
<P>
   So why are we fatter than ever?
</P>
<P>
   A brief digression: In this context, fat means being overweight
according to your body mass index, which is based on your height
and weight. Being larger than a supermodel or a Hollywood actress
does not necessarily make you fat. This latest uproar over the
obesity epidemic is not intended to fuel an increase in eating
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   That said, more than half of all Americans are fat, with BMIs of
25 to 29.9. One-fifth of U.S. adults are clinically obese, with
BMIs of 30 or higher. Georgia has earned a special distinction as
the state with the largest increase in the percentage of obese
people since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Which means we are neither eating less nor moving more.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, no one is saying that we deliberately choose to be
lazy pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That suggests that people are at fault for their weight
problems,'' says Dr. William Dietz, who heads the division of
nutrition and physical activity at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. ``Our research indicates it's much more complicated
than that. Our lifestyle and our environment make it increasingly
difficult to be active and make the food choices that we want to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   We spend hours commuting to and from neighborhoods without
sidewalks. Exhausted, we slump in front of the TV or the computer
and eat microwave dinners or takeout, which we wash down with
sugary sodas. Or we go to restaurants and shovel down enormous
portions.
</P>
<P>
   We take elevators and escalators and circle sharklike through
parking lots for a space near the door. Our kids would rather watch
TV or play computer games than go outside, a factor proven to
contribute to childhood obesity. We order the Super Size fries by
reflex.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pick one thing and say, this is the problem,'' says
Dr. James Hill, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the
University of Colorado in Denver. ``What you have to realize is,
society is the problem. The way we live is creating obesity.''
</P>
<P>
   But history shows we sure do want the easy way out.
</P>
<P>
   We want foods that taste great and are less filling. We
foolishly thought ``fat-free'' meant free to eat all you want, and
we ate Snackwells cookies by the box. Admit it, they didn't even
taste that good.
</P>
<P>
   We want magic pills. We went nuts over fen-phen diet drugs, and
look how that turned out.
</P>
<P>
   But even nasty side effects don't faze us. We eat potato chips
made with the fat substitute olestra, even though it commonly
causes stomach upset and diarrhea. We take the supplement
Metabolife, whose active ingredient is ephedra, an unregulated
herbal stimulant that can raise your blood pressure and cause heart
palpitations.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly 100,000 prescriptions have been written for the
recently approved drug Xenical, whose side effects include rectal
leakage. Yes, that means what you think it means.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, we fell in love with the HealthRider, a goofy
piece of fitness equipment best described as a mechanical bucking
Shetland donkey. It didn't make you feel like you were working
hard, because you weren't. A study by the American Council on
Exercise found that even the most strenuous workout on an aerobic
rider only burns 50 percent to 75 percent of the calories consumed
during a similarly intense workout on a treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   In March, ACE debunked a claim by Time Works that its new
exercise machine, which combines the dynamic principles of a stair
stepper and a hula hoop, could provide a complete aerobic,
strength-training and flexibility workout in just four minutes. The
$600 machine, heavily advertised on TV, brought in $60 million in a
single year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, treadmills, which really do offer solid exercise,
turn into extra clothing racks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think there's some miraculous way, without any
discipline or hard work, to live a healthier, fitter lifestyle,''
says Charles Platkin, the founding CEO of the Internet site
eFit.com, to debut Nov. 22. ``They want to believe in a quick
fix.''
</P>
<P>
   America is, after all, the land of instant gratification, the
country that pioneered drive-thru banking and one-hour photo
processing. By comparison, we're being generous when we give
ourselves until the holidays to lose 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the enormous popularity of highly restrictive diets and
ultra-intense exercise programs that promise fast results.
Frequently, though, the only result is burnout.
</P>
<P>
   Slim Fast has a special ``Jump Start'' kit that promises users
they will lose 5 pounds in 5 days. The packaging doesn't mention
the likelihood that you'll gain it all back as soon as you quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to make any money telling people to lose a
pound a month,'' points out Rod K. Dishman, a professor of exercise
science at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Workouts such as spinning, kickboxing and military-inspired
``boot camp'' programs, all of which burn several hundred calories
per hour, do have merit _ for those already in shape. Novice
exercisers risk injury and, more significantly, discouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to push too hard because they remember that they
were in better shape at one time, and that's what they want to
reproduce immediately,'' says Richard Cotton, ACE's chief exercise
physiologist.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, obesity experts say, is that we make such a
big deal out of weight management. The word diet implies
restriction. People think they have to limit themselves to certain
foods to lose or maintain weight.
</P>
<P>
   But dieting is doomed to fail, says compulsive eating expert
Geneen Roth, who has a simple philosophy: Eat when hungry, and eat
until full. Roth says people have yelled at her for telling them
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so accustomed to these fad diets, and people are so
removed from that initial and instinctive reason to eat, that when
someone says to tune into your hunger, it sounds like another
diet,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   We think exercise must be done in a gym, or requires copious
sweating, or demands special clothes and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about exercise is that it has a negative
connotation,'' says Dr. Karen Dewling, an Emory Clinic pediatrician
who deals with childhood obesity. ``Somewhere in childhood it turns
into a not fun thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many health experts prefer the term physical activity. Lisa
Stone, deputy director for Georgia's Commission on Physical Fitness
and Sports, applauds companies that install gyms, but she'd just as
soon see more people taking the stairs every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gyms in workplaces only get the same 30 percent of the
population that's going to exercise anyway,'' Stone says. ``We're
thrilled that corporations are spending all this money on fabulous
facilities, but they're not getting the people in there that need
to be in there. We're trying to reach the inactive people.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the commission's most popular and effective worksite
programs, the Take Charge Challenge, encourages participants to get
physical activity into their workday by taking the stairs, doing
leg lifts while talking on the phone, walking over to someone's
desk instead of e-mailing them.
</P>
<P>
   Some exercise physiologists point out that this moderate
activity doesn't fulfill the recommendation that people elevate
their heart rate for at least 30 minutes at a time. Dietz counters
that we should be realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a significant debate in this field whether you need
continuous and sustained activity rather than small increments of
exercise,'' he says. ``But 60 percent of the adult population is
inactive. In that context, even small amounts of activity are
likely to have benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're talking about are changes in lifestyle that can be
sustained,'' Dietz says. ``Not short-term solutions from which you
will relapse.''
</P>
<P>
   So, walk. Skip the elevator. Get up from your desk every hour.
</P>
<P>
   Eat lunch, but walk to get it. Eat out, but cut your portions.
Eat dinner at the table, not in front of the TV. Always eat
breakfast. Drink water. Drink more water.
</P>
<P>
   Move more. Eat better.
