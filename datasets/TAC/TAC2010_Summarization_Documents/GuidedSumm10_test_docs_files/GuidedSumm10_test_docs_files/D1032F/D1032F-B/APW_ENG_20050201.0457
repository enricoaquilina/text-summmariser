Statoil ASA is being investigated for possible criminal negligence after a
potentially catastrophic natural gas leak on a North Sea oil platform, police
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Nov. 28 gas leak from a well shut down the Snorre A platform and forced the
evacuation of 180 crew members. Though no one was injured, safety authorities
called it one of the most serious incidents ever on the Norwegian continental
shelf.
</P>
<P>
In its own investigation, the state-controlled oil company said the leak could
have been catastrophic for the platform and its employees had the gas ignited,
as it did in 1988 on the British Piper Alpha platform, killing 167
workers.
</P>
<P>
Police lawyer Tor Arvid Bruskeland, of the Rogaland district, said authorities
decided on a full investigation after conferring with the Norwegian Petroleum
Safety Authority.
</P>
<P>
"Based on their report and what they had found out, we decided to start the
investigation," Bruskeland said, adding the inquiry would cover every aspect of
the incident, including planning.
</P>
<P>
Statoil had no immediate comment. Despite the decision, shares of Statoil rose
1.3 percent to 97.75 kroner (euro11.79, US$15.36) in trading on the Oslo
bourse.
</P>
<P>
Statoil's report, which mirrored that of the Safety Authority, blamed
sloppiness, poor planning and a failure to follow specified routines.
</P>
<P>
Police will investigate whether there was criminal negligence by employees of
the Stavanger-based company.
</P>
<P>
Criminal negligence by a company can be punished with a fine of unlimited size,
while for employees a conviction could include fines and up to five years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
Bruskeland said police hope to finish the investigation by late
March.
</P>
<P>
The incident shut down 205,000 barrels of day of oil production from the Snorre
A and Vigdis platforms, or 6.4 percent of this Nordic country's 3.2 million
barrel per day capacity. It took nearly two months after the accident for
Statoil to begin building up production to normal levels.
</P>
<P>
Statoil, founded by the government in 1972, employs about 24,000 people in 28
countries.
