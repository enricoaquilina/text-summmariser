<P>
The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority on Monday approved Statoil ASA's plan
to resume full production from its Snorre A field, which was shut down by a Nov.
28 natural gas leak.
</P>
<P>
Full production from the Snorre A and nearby Vigdis fields would restore about
205,000 barrels a day of production, or some 6.4 percent of this Nordic
country's 3.2 million barrel per day capacity.
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 14, the authority granted permission to resume about 100,000 barrels per
day of production from Snorre A satellite field that were not affected by the
natural gas leak.
</P>
<P>
The authority and Statoil both said they want to see stable production from
those wells before phasing in full production from Snorre A.
</P>
<P>
"Production can start as soon as Statoil has stabilized production from the
satellites," the safety authority said.
</P>
<P>
The leak forced the evacuation of 180 crew members from Snorre A, and, although
no one was injured, the safety authority called the blowout one of the most
serious incidents ever in the Norwegian continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
In its own report, which blamed sloppiness, poor planning and a failure to
follow specified routines, Statoil said if the gas had begun to burn it could
have been catastrophic for the Snorre A platform and those aboard.
</P>
<P>
Statoil would not estimate how long it would take to stabilize that production.
It has said the startup has been slow because of the time the wells were
idle.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Kjersti Moerstol would not say how much oil the Vigdis or Snorre A's
satellite were producing, only that, "work and production is very
good."
</P>
<P>
Statoil was founded by the government in 1972 to oversee the nation's petroleum
interests, and employs about 17,000 people in 28 countries. The government began
partial privatization of the concern in 2001, but retains control.
