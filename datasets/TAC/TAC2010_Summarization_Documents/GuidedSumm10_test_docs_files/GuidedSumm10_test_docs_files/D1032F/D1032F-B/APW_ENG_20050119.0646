Statoil ASA sought government permission Wednesday to resume its full 205,000
barrel a day production from two offshore oil fields that were shut down in
November after a natural gas leak.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority, or PSA, last week allowed the
state-controlled oil company to start production from parts of the Snorre A and
Vigdis fields not affected by the leak.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown resulted in a roughly 6.4 percent reduction in the 3.2 million
barrel per day production capacity that makes Norway the world's third-largest
oil exporter, after Saudi Arabia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Work on restarting those wells began Friday, and was slowly building up to
100,000 barrel-per-day capacity.
</P>
<P>
Statoil spokeswoman Kjersti Morstoel said the company, based in the western port
of Stavanger, had requested permission to resume the remaining 105,000 barrel
per day production from the rest of the area.
</P>
<P>
The safety authority has called the gas leak from a production well one of the
most serious incidents ever on the Norwegian continental shelf. No one was
injured, but the leak forced the evacuation of 180 crew from Snorre A platform.
On Tuesday, Statoil said the leak of highly explosive gas could have been
catastrophic had it been ignited.
</P>
<P>
Statoil blamed the leak on sloppiness, saying it had not lived up to its own
safety standards. A Statoil internal investigation criticized inadequate
planning and risk appreciation, and a failure to observe governing
documentation.
</P>
<P>
Statoil had hoped to start Snorre A and the adjacent Vigdis field around Dec.
24, but was delayed by storms and technical delays.
</P>
<P>
Morstoel said production will have to build up slowly because the fields had
been idle for so long.
</P>
<P>
Statoil was founded by the government in 1972 to oversee the nation's petroleum
interests, and employs about 17,000 people in 25 countries. The government began
partial privatization of the concern in 2001, but retains control.
