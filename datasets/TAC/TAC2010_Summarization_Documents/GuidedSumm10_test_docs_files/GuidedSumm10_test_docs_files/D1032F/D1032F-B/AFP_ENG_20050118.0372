oil platforms

<P>
Norwegian oil group Statoil on Tuesday 
admitted that its "inadequate planning" had led to a gas leak last 
November that forced it to shut down two North Sea oil platforms.
</P>
<P>
"According to the inquiry report, the underlying causes of the 
incident were inadequate planning and appreciation of the risk, as 
well as a failure to observe governing documentation," the company 
said in a statement issued after completing an internal 
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Statoil shut down its Snorre A platform on November 28 after a 
gas leak was detected, and also closed its satellite platform 
Vigdis, the production of which transits via Snorre.
</P>
<P>
The gas leak, which could have caused an explosion if the gas 
had ignited, was sealed a day later and Statoil is still trying to 
repair the injection well where the leak appeared.
</P>
<P>
The company, which before the accident pumped up 205,000 barrels 
per day (bpd) from the two platforms, last week received the green 
light from the Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority to gradually 
resume production, but said it would take a while to even reach a 
preliminary target of 100,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
"Safe operation is a precondition for all our activities ... Our 
inquiry shows that we've failed to live up to our own targets. We 
must learn from this incident," senior Statoil executive Terje 
Overvik said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the company, the leak appeared when gas passing 
through an external casing that had suffered wear damage escaped 
under the seabed.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the accident, some 220 Statoil employees were at 
risk, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"With hindsight, we can say that the organization responded 
extremely well to the emergency ... But this was a very serious 
incident which, in the worst case, could have caused major harm to 
people, the environment and material assets," Overvik said.
</P>
<P>
"We will ensure that sufficient attention is paid to governing 
documentation and best practice for drilling and well operations," 
he added.
</P>
<P>
Norway, which is the world's third-largest oil exporter after 
Saudi Arabia and Russia, normally has an average daily production of 
three million barrels.
