Oil production in Norway to be disrupted for days: companies
</HEADLINE>

OSLO, Jan 12

<TEXT>
<P>
Oil production in Norway, disrupted by 
technical problems and aggravated due to a storm in the North Sea, 
will probably be reduced by 11.5 percent for at least a few more 
days, oil companies said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Norway, the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi 
Arabia and Russia and which normally has an average daily production 
of three million barrels, has seen its production reduced by 345,000 
barrels per day (bpd) since it shut down three offshore platforms.
</P>
<P>
Production is not expected to resume on the three installations 
anytime soon, operators told AFP on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
State-controlled company Statoil shut down its Snorre A platform 
and satellite platform Vigdis on November 28 last year after a gas 
leak was detected.
</P>
<P>
That closure has led to production losses of 205,000 barrels per 
day.
</P>
<P>
Statoil has requested permission from the Norwegian Petroleum 
Safety Authority to gradually resume output on the two platforms, 
targeting a production of 100,000 barrels per day in the short 
term.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the green light from authorities. Then we 
will resume production very slowly because the well has been 
inactive for a long time," Statoil spokeswoman Kjersti Mostoel said. 
"This could take a long time," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anglo-Dutch company Shell said it did not foresee 
opening its Norwegian platform Draugen before the weekend at the 
earliest. Draugen was shut down on Friday after its loading 
equipment was damaged, leading to production losses of 140,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
Repairs cannot be undertaken until the storm in the North Sea 
subsides.
