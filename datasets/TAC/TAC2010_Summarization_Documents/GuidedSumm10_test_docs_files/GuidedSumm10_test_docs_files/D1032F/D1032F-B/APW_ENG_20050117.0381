Statoil, Shell restart production at oil fields shut by technical problems

<P>
Three offshore oil fields shut down after they were damaged in accidents were
restarted over the weekend, the companies that operate them said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 140,000 barrel per day Draugen field in the Norwegian Sea was restarted
Saturday and reached full production on Monday, its operator, Royal Dutch/Shell
Group of Cos., said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Norway's state-controlled oil company Statoil ASA began a small amount of
production Friday from its 205,000-barrel a day capacity Snorre A and Vigdis
fields, following a Nov. 28 shutdown because of a natural gas
leak.
</P>
<P>
When at full production, the fields account for nearly 11 percent of Norway's
3.2 million barrel a day oil production capacity. Norway is the world's
third-largest oil exporter, after Saudi Arabia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Draugen field was forced to shut down Jan. 7 because its storage tanks were
full after equipment damage prevented it from loading crude onto
tankers.
</P>
<P>
Storms had prevented Shell from repairing the damage until a break in the
weather let them finish the repair work.
</P>
<P>
"We are back up to full production," Shell spokesman Svein Ildgruben said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Statoil's Snorre A platform was hit by a gas leak in a production well that the
Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority called one of the most serious incidents
ever on the Norwegian continental shelf.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured, but the leak forced the evacuation of 180 crew and a halt in
production. Bad weather also hampered the restart of the Statoil fields because
it prevented the safety authority from completing inspections.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the authority accepted a Statoil plan for resuming about 100,000
barrels per day of production from areas of the Snorre and Vigdis fields that
were affected by the leak. At the same time, the authority will continue
inspections intended to eventually allow full production.
</P>
<P>
Statoil said on Friday production would resume gradually, but decline to
estimate when it would hit the full 100,000 barrels.
