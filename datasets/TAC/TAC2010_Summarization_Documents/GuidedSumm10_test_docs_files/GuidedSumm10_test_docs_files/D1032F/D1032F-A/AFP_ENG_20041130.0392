Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Tuesday that it had yet to resume
production on two of its platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut
down operations earlier this week, cutting Norway's total oil output
by 200,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
"We are still working on securing the well," Statoil spokesman
Kristofer Hetland told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"This will take time ... It's complicated work," he added.
</P>
<P>
Production was suspended and 180 of 216 employees were evacuated
after a gas leak appeared at the Snorre A platform in the North Sea
on Sunday, giving rise to fears of an explosion.
</P>
<P>
The gas leak, which Statoil said was "unusual and serious", came from
an injection well used to pump gas and water into a layer of oil to
extract as much oil as possible.
</P>
<P>
A team of about 60 workers is currently trying to seal the leak with
cement.
</P>
<P>
Until repairs are completed production has been halted on the Snorre
A platform, causing losses of 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) and on
neighboring platform Vigdis, entailing losses of 75,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to speculate on when we can resume production,"
Hetland said.
</P>
<P>
According to public radio station NRK the production halt is costing
Statoil, whose stake in the two platforms accounts for 40,000 bpd,
11.5 million kroner (1.8 million dollars, 1.4 million euros) a day.
</P>
<P>
Norway is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia
and Russia, with an average daily production of three million
barrels.
