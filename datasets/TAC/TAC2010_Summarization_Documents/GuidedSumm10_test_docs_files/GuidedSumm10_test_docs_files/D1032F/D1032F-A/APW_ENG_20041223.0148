Statoil's Snorre A unlikely to resume oil production this week
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Snorre A offshore oil platform is unlikely to resume production
this week after being shut down by a natural gas leak because more
time is needed to review plans, the Norwegian Petroleum Safety
Authority said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, state-controlled oil company Statoil ASA said it hoped to
get the platform running this week and build up to full production by
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
A Nov. 28 natural gas leak forced the shutdown of the Snorre A steel
tension-leg platform and the evacuation of 180 workers. The shutdown
of Snorre and production in the nearby Vigdis field cut Norway's
production by 205,000 barrels of oil a day, or 6.4 percent of the
nation's roughly 3.2 million barrel daily production.
</P>
<P>
Statoil pumped cement into the production well to permanently cap it
and prevent any further leaks.
</P>
<P>
Magne Ognedal, director general of the safety authority, said his
staff is working intensely on reviewing a startup proposal submitted
by Statoil this week, but needs more information.
</P>
<P>
"For us, it is impossible to estimate when it will be done. There are
a number of things we need information about," he said, adding that a
startup this week is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the information must come from the field itself, and
that a fierce storm has prevented the gathering of crucial data.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleum Safety Directorate was created in January 2004 to
oversee safety, health and environmental concerns on Norwegian
offshore oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Norway is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia
and Russia. Statoil was founded by the government in 1972 to oversee
the nation's petroleum interests, and employs about 17,000 people in
25 countries. The company was partly privatized in 2001 when the
state sold a 17.5 percent stake to investors.
