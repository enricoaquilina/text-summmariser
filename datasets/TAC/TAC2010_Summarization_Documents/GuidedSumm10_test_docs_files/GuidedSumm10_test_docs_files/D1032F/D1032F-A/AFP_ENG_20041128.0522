More than 160 of 216 people working on a Norwegian oil platform in
the North Sea were evacuated Sunday after one of the rigs became
"unstable", causing a loss of output of 130,000 barrels per day, a
company spokesman and rescue services said.
</P>
<P>
The group was evacuated by helicopter from the Snorre A platform
which is operated by Norway's Statoil, Terje Largaas, a rescue
official at Sola in the southwest of the country, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"It means that we lost control of the pressure in one of the rigs,"
after a gas leak around 7:00 pm (1800 GMT), he said.
</P>
<P>
Three helicopters and four ships were helping evacuate the rest of
the staff, Norwegian news agency NTB said.
</P>
<P>
"We have stopped production" at Snorre A, Kristofer Hetland, a
spokesman for Statoil, told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Hetland could not say when production was expected to resume.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to stabilize the situation," he said, adding that the
problem appeared to have been fixed four hours after the incident
began.
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Snorre oil field where the Snorre A and Snorre B platforms are
located produces a total 238,000 barrels per day, according to the
Statoil website.
</P>
<P>
Norway is the third crude exporter after Saudi Arabia and Russia and
produces nearly three million barrels per day.
