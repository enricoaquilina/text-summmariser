Norwegian oil group Statoil said on Wednesday that it remained
"unclear" when it would be able to resume production on two of its
platforms after a gas leak forced it to shut down operations earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment it is unclear when production from Snorre A and Vigdis
will resume," Statoil said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Production was suspended and 180 of 216 employees were evacuated
after a gas leak appeared at the Snorre A platform in the North Sea
on Sunday, giving rise to fears of an explosion.
</P>
<P>
The gas leak, which Statoil said was "unusual and serious", came from
an injection well used to pump gas and water into a layer of oil to
extract as much oil as possible.
</P>
<P>
Until repairs are completed production has been halted on the Snorre
A platform, causing losses of 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) and on
neighboring platform Vigdis, entailing losses of 75,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
"Work to secure the well on the Snorre A platform ... continued all
through the night, and is still going well and according to plan
today ... But it will take some time before these efforts will be
completed," the company said.
</P>
<P>
Norway is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia
and Russia, with an average daily production of three million
barrels.
