Statoil seeks gradual resumption of production on closed oil 
platforms

<P>
Norwegian oil group Statoil on Tuesday 
requested permission to gradually resume production on two platforms 
in the North Sea that were shut down last November due to a gas 
leak, targeting a production of 100,000 barrels per day in the short 
term.
</P>
<P>
"Statoil thinks it will be acceptable to resume partial 
production from its Snorre A platform in the North Sea," the company 
said in a statement, adding that, "a partial start-up could take 
place independently of remaining work with the platform wells".
</P>
<P>
Statoil, which will need a green light from the Norwegian 
Petroleum Safety Authority before resuming production, shut down 
Snorre A on November 28 last year after a gas leak was detected.
</P>
<P>
Its satellite platform Vigdis, whose production transits Snorre, 
was also closed.
</P>
<P>
The gas leak, which could have caused an explosion if the gas 
had ignited, was sealed a day later and Statoil has since been 
trying to secure the injection well where the leak appeared.
</P>
<P>
Norway, which is the world's third-largest oil exporter after 
Saudi Arabia and Russia and which normally has an average daily 
production of three million barrels, has seen its oil production 
reduced by some 205,000 barrels per day (bpd) since the platforms 
were closed.
</P>
<P>
Statoil has proposed resuming full production on Vigdis (75,000 
bpd), and partial production on Snorre A, by pumping up oil through 
underwater extensions while repairs continue on the platform 
itself.
</P>
<P>
The proposed solution would permit the company in the short term 
to pump up some 100,000 bpd while waiting for the platform repairs 
to be completed.
</P>
<P>
Statoil however said it could take some time to reach even such 
limited production goals.
</P>
<P>
"It will take a lot of time to reach the targeted production 
levels (of 100,000 bpd) because the installations have been closed 
for a long time and reopening them requires proceeding with 
caution," company spokeswoman Kjersti Morstoel told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Continued poor weather conditions in the North Sea also hindered 
British-Dutch oil giant Shell from resuming production on Tuesday on 
its Norwegian platform Draugen, which was shut down last Friday 
after its loading equipment was damaged.
</P>
<P>
That closure has slashed Norway's oil production by an 
additional 140,000 bpd.
