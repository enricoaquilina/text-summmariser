Statoil evacuates North Sea platform after gas leak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Norway's daily oil production was down by an estimated 4 percent
after a gas leak forced Statoil ASA to shut down one of its platforms
in the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
The gas leak, which led to the evacuation of 180 workers from the
floating Snorre A platform located northwest of the port city of
Bergen, was contained Monday afternoon, nearly 18 hours after it was
reported, Statoil spokesman Oeivind Reinertsen said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Marathon Oil Corp. said production on its Brae Alpha
platform in the British portion of the North Sea remained closed
after a gas leak there on Saturday forced it to shut down, cutting
its 36,000 barrels a day of production.
</P>
<P>
The gas leaks, which were unrelated, resulted in the stopping of
130,000 barrels a day on Statoil's platform, or a 4 percent reduction
in Norway's daily production of about 3.2 million barrels a day. The
platform processes another 75,000 barrels a day in production from
the nearby Vigdis field, but it wasn't clear if that oil was being
routed to another platform.
</P>
<P>
Norway's petroleum ministry said the shutdown would not affect its
oil exports since it has sufficient reserves.
</P>
<P>
Statoil did not say when it expected to resume production at its
Snorre A platform, noting that a permanent cap had not been put in
place.
</P>
<P>
"The safety aspect has top priority at the moment," Reinertsen said.
"All other considerations will have to wait."
</P>
<P>
Marathon was similarly mum on when production aboard its platform
would restart.
</P>
<P>
Norway's oil ministry said there was no evidence that any oil leaked
from the Statoil-owned floating platform into the water because of
the accident.
</P>
<P>
The 36 workers aboard the platform pumped heavy drilling mud into the
leaking injection well.
</P>
<P>
"The mud is intended to push back the gas so that we can get at the
well to halt the leak," Reinertsen said. "We quickly mobilized
technical expertise in Stavanger, and these specialists have been in
constant contact with the platform and drilling management on Snorre
A."
</P>
<P>
He said the leak was discovered during an attempt to drill a
sidetrack from an injection well. Although heavy mud had been pumped
in to stem any possible leaks, the gas pushed out as the production
tube was being removed.
</P>
<P>
"Gas is no longer appearing on the sea surface," said Terje Overvik,
executive vice president for Statoil's exploration and production
Norway, adding that work was still ongoing to permanently secure the
well.

Light, sweet crude for January delivery was up 26 cents at US$49.70 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Monday. In London, the
January contract for Brent crude rose 98 cents to US$45.53 on the
International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Norway is the world's third-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia
and Russia. Statoil was founded by the government in 1972 to oversee
the nation's petroleum interests, and employs about 17,000 people in
25 countries. The company was partly privatized in 2001 when the
state sold a 17.5 percent stake to investors.
