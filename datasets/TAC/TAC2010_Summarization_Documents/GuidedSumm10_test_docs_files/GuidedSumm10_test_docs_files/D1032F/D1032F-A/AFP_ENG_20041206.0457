Norwegian oil group Statoil said Monday that production on two of its
platforms in the North Sea shut down last week because of a gas leak
would probably remain suspended until at least next week.
</P>
<P>
"It is probably impossible to say anything until the end of next week
end about the date at which the Snorre A and Vigdis (platforms) will
be able to resume activity," Statoil, the operator of the two
installations, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
On November 28, the company shut down Snorre A after a gas leak was
detected. The smaller Vigdis, located near Snorre A and whose
production transits Snorre, was also closed.
</P>
<P>
Norway's oil production has been reduced by some 205,000 barrels per
day. The country is the world's third-largest oil exporter after
Saudi Arabia and Russia, with an average daily production of three
million barrels.
</P>
<P>
The gas leak, which could have caused an explosion if the gas had
ignited, was sealed a day later and Statoil has since been trying to
secure the injection well where the leak appeared.
</P>
<P>
"We still have a fair amount of work to do before we can resume
production," Oivind Reinertsen, a senior Statoil official, said in
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The agency that oversees health and environmental issues in the oil
sector, Petroleumtilsyn, must also give the green light for
production to resume, which could delay matters even further.
