<P>
The prosecution and defense both rested their cases in the murder trial of actor
Robert Blake, clearing the way for closing arguments next week.
</P>
<P>
"All sides have rested and the case is now concluded," Judge Darlene Schempp
told the jury Friday.
</P>
<P>
The judge said closing arguments will begin Wednesday and the case will be sent
to the jury Friday. The extended recess is needed because of jurors' medical
appointments.
</P>
<P>
Blake, 71, is accused of shooting wife Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, to death in May
2001, as she sat in his car parked near a restaurant where they had dined. Blake
could face life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution wrapped up its case after calling a writer for the National
Enquirer as its last rebuttal witness. The testimony sought to shore up the
account of Gary McLarty, one of two former stuntmen who said Blake solicited
them to kill his wife.
</P>
<P>
The stuntmen were attacked by the defense as drug users who suffered from
hallucinations and paranoia.
</P>
<P>
The Enquirer writer, Alan Smith, was called to vouch for the authenticity of an
article he wrote quoting Cole McLarty, the son of the stuntman, about the
case.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said that in the story Cole McLarty stated that Blake had talked
of Bakley and "he didn't like Bonny, didn't approve of her lifestyle and wanted
her out of the way."
</P>
<P>
The story also said Gary McLarty told his son that "he almost threw up when he
heard Bonny Bakley was dead" and he thought Blake was behind
it.
</P>
<P>
Smith said all comments attributed to Cole McLarty about his father's contact
with Blake regarding Bakley were correct.
</P>
<P>
Cole McLarty has denied saying many of the comments attributed to him in the
story, for which he was paid $8,000.
</P>
<P>
The defense established on cross-examination of Smith that the story never said
Blake asked Gary McLarty to kill Bakley.
</P>
<P>
Cole had testified for the defense, saying that when his father told him of his
discussions with Blake it was about getting paid to beat up someone and there
was no mention of killing Bakley.
</P>
<P>
The article itself was not admitted as evidence because it was considered
hearsay, but prosecutors were allowed to raise it in an effort to contest Cole
McLarty's testimony.
