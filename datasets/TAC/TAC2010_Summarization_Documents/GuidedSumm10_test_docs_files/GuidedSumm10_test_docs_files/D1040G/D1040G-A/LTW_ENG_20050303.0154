Blake Defense Goes Out Swinging

Robert Blake's lawyer told jurors Thursday that they
should discredit the testimony of two aging Hollywood stuntmen who say
Blake asked them to kill his wife because they are drug addicts who
have lied to authorities.
</P>
<P>
Each acknowledges he failed to tell police about Blake's alleged
solicitations to kill his wife until Bonny Lee Bakley was fatally shot
on May 4, 2001, near a restaurant where she and Blake had dinner, the
lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
During his daylong summation of the two-month trial, M. Gerald
Schwartzbach also disputed the accounts of several prosecution
witnesses that Blake acted oddly the night his wife was killed, and
denied that his client was acting when he wailed and moaned at the
crime scene.
</P>
<P>
``Was it acting? Was it real?'' Schwartzbach said. ``It was real.''
</P>
<P>
Both stuntmen changed their statements about the details of the
solicitations, including the type and color of the gun Blake showed
them, whether Blake offered money for a hit and possible locations to
carry out the slaying.
</P>
<P>
He said it was a dumb murder plot -- to commit the crime in a place
where Blake is well known, near his favorite restaurant.
</P>
<P>
``I'll kill her in a neighborhood I'm recognized in,'' Schwartzbach
said sarcastically. ``How absurd would that have been?''
</P>
<P>
Blake, 71, faces life in prison if convicted of killing Bakley. He
also is charged with soliciting the stuntmen to kill her, punishable
by 9 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution had argued earlier that Blake despised his wife,
and when he could not get anyone else to kill her, he pulled he
trigger himself.
</P>
<P>
In her summation Wednesday, Deputy Los Angeles County District
Attorney Shellie L. Samuels told jurors that Blake, a two-time Emmy
Award winner, ``overestimated his acting abilities.''
</P>
<P>
She said the killing had ``freaked him out,'' causing him to become
physically ill and unable to fulfill his plan to create an alibi by
returning to the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Not only did Blake have the opportunity to kill her, but he had
motive, Samuels said, casting Bakley as a small-time scam artist who
had tricked Blake -- who considered himself a streetwise tough guy --
into marriage by getting pregnant.
</P>
<P>
She said Blake fell in love with their now-4-year-old daughter,
Rosie, and began scheming to gain sole custody of the child while
trying to get rid of Bakley.
</P>
<P>
Schwartzbach reminded jurors that Gary McLarty testified that Blake
never directly asked to kill his wife. He said the stuntman assumed
what Blake wanted, and was wrong, the result of a ``very disturbed
dysfunctional mind'' because of long-term drug use.
</P>
<P>
``He (McLarty) testified he was unclear in his mind what Mr. Blake
was talking about,'' Schwartzbach said of McLarty who testified about
a drug induced breakdown when he hallucinated that police were
tunneling under his home and satellites were watching him from the
skies.
</P>
<P>
``I'm sure a lot of things where unclear in Mr. McLarty's mind,
using cocaine for 20 to 30 years,'' Schwartzbach said.
</P>
<P>
Schwartzbach downplayed records from a prepaid phone card and a
restaurant where Blake and Ronald ``Duffy'' Hambleton ate, saying they
do not confirm the substance of their conversations, only that they
took place.
</P>
<P>
``What does that prove? That they met? Where's the corroboration
that they were solicited to commit murder?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer also ridiculed the idea that Blake would ask these aging
stuntmen -- one who had recently had a heart attack and they other
missing a kidney -- to kill Bakley.
</P>
<P>
Schwartzbach also took aim at another key prosecution witness:
hoodlum-turned-preacher Frank Minucci, who testified that Blake wanted
his wife dead.
</P>
<P>
Minucci took money from the National Enquirer and testified for
publicity, Schwartzbach said.
