Lawyer Says Blake Overacted as Grieving Spouse

<P>
The prosecutor in the Robert Blake murder trial
urged jurors Wednesday to ignore his celebrity, then derided his
acting abilities by saying he overplayed his role as a grieving
spouse.
</P>
<P>
Blake, a two-time Emmy Award winner, ``overestimated his acting
abilities,'' said Deputy Los Angeles County District Attorney Shellie
L. Samuels during her three-hour closing argument.
</P>
<P>
She told jurors that ``reality crashed into fantasy'' the moment
Blake pulled the trigger, killing Bonny Lee Bakley on May 4, 2001,
near a Studio City restaurant where the couple had just eaten. And she
said it explained why Blake became physically ill at the sight of his
fatally injured wife.
</P>
<P>
``He shot people on TV. He shot people in the movies. But he never
really shot a person in real life,'' Samuels said. ``It freaked him
out.''
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer M. Gerald Schwartzbach countered that the evidence
does not support the theory that Blake shot the 44-year-old Bakley.
</P>
<P>
``There is no direct evidence -- none, zero, zippo -- that Mr.
Blake killed Bonny Bakley,'' he told jurors in a San Fernando Valley
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
Schwartzbach accused the Los Angeles Police Department of
incompetence, and rushing to judgment against the celebrity. And he
branded the key prosecution witnesses, both aging Hollywood stuntmen,
as ``liars'' and delusional drug addicts. Both testified that Blake
tried to hire them to kill his wife.
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of the circumstantial case was Blake's hatred for
Bakley. She had been convicted of fraud, ran a mail-order pornography
business and, over his objections, bore his now 4-year-old daughter,
Rosie.
</P>
<P>
Although Blake first tried to have Bakley undergo an abortion, his
love for the girl grew after her birth, as did his hatred for the
woman whom he felt he had been forced to marry, the prosecution
contends.
</P>
<P>
``He was tricked by Bonny Lee and he hated her for it,'' Samuels
said. ``He got taken by a small-time grifter.''
</P>
<P>
No one witnessed the shooting and no fingerprints were found on the
murder weapon, a Walther P-39 revolver later retrieved from a trash
bin next to Blake's car, in which Bakley died, according to testimony.
The tiny amount of gunshot residue on Blake's hands could have come
from handling the Smith &amp; Wesson revolver he was carrying at the time.
</P>
<P>
Blake, 71, is charged with murder, two counts of solicitation of
murder. If convicted he could be sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
The star of TV's ``Baretta'' said someone else shot his wife in his
parked car when he returned to a Studio City restaurant to retrieve
the Smith &amp; Wesson revolver that he said he accidentally left behind
at their dinner table. He told police he carried the gun because his
wife feared she was being stalked.
</P>
<P>
But Samuels said no one saw Blake return to the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
``The alibi would have worked better if he truly had the acting
abilities,'' she said, accusing him of acting more like a killer than
a grieving spouse.
</P>
<P>
Samuels cited testimony that Blake tried to have Bakley arrested
and her pregnancy aborted so that he would not have to marry her.
After their marriage in November 2000, Blake solicited two Hollywood
stuntmen to kill her.
</P>
<P>
When he couldn't get anyone to go along with his murder-for-hire
scheme, Samuels said the actor pulled the trigger himself.
</P>
<P>
Schwartzbach focused on the stuntmen -- Gary McLarty and Ronald
``Duffy'' Hambleton. They admitted lying under oath about their drug
use, and offered inconsistent versions of events, Schwartzbach said.
They also waited until Bakley was dead to tell police about Blake's
murder schemes.
</P>
<P>
It was those troubled backgrounds, said Samuels, that made the
stuntmen attractive to Blake.
</P>
<P>
``You are not going to go to your minister. You are not going to go
to your banker,'' she said. ``You are not going to go to anyone
upstanding.''
</P>
<P>
She said that despite their questionable lifestyles, their accounts
were corroborated by pre-paid phone card records documenting 56 calls
from Blake's house to Hambleton and three to McLarty.
</P>
<P>
She warned jurors to beware of ``red herrings'' put up by the
defense, including McLarty's mental breakdown three years after
Bakley's killing, Hambleton's earlier legal woes, the dearth of
forensic evidence and a book author who shadowed homicide detectives
during the investigation of Bakley's murder.
</P>
<P>
As early as the night of Bakley's murder, Blake ``did some
suspicious things'' that led detectives at the scene to focus on him
as a possible suspect, Samuels said.
</P>
<P>
She said a husband fearing for his wife's safety would not leave
her sitting alone on a dark street. And she also underscored the
testimony of witnesses that the actor did not appear sincere when he
cried over his wife's death, including one witness who described Blake
as ``turning it on and off.''
