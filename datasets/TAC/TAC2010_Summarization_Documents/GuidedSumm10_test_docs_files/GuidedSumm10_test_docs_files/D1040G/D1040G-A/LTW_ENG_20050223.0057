Blake Defense Closes Without Actor's Testimony

<P>
Robert Blake's defense closed Wednesday without his
testimony, gambling that jurors won't buy the state's largely
circumstantial case that accuses the actor of shooting the wife he
despised after he couldn't find someone willing to commit the crime.
</P>
<P>
M. Gerald Schwartzbach called 38 witnesses to emphasize the lack of
evidence directly linking his client to the 2001 murder of Bonny Lee
Bakley, and to attack the competence of the Los Angeles Police
Department investigation, which focused early on the accused.
</P>
<P>
Schwartzbach has also closely followed a blueprint he laid out for
jurors in his opening statement, but avoided a-trash-the-victim
strategy by earlier counsel that dominated the early stages of the
case with accounts of Bakley's involvement in a mail-order pornography
business.
</P>
<P>
``For a celebrity case, it was tried like a pretty standard
criminal case'' with the defense focusing on reasonable doubt, said
Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor who teaches criminal law
at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Levenson noted that Blake, 71, not only faces life if convicted of
murder, but up to nine years if jurors find him guilty on the other
charge, solicitation to murder.
</P>
<P>
``For Blake, there are a lot of ways to lose,'' said Levenson. ``At
his age, it could be very close to a life sentence.''
</P>
<P>
While Bakley hasn't emerged unscathed at trial, Schwartzbach
suggested that someone from her past was out to harm her, and that
Blake was concerned enough with the threat that he began to carry a
gun for protection.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have built their case on the testimony of stuntmen Gary
McLarty and Ronald ``Duffy'' Hambleton, who each testified Blake asked
them to ``pop'' or ``snuff'' his wife, laying out multiple scenarios
to kill her including one involving the restaurant near where she was
killed May 4, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Blake has pleaded not guilty to killing Bakley. He faces life in
prison if he is convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
The defense's strongest moment came during the cross examination of
McLarty, when the veteran stuntman acknowledged a long-term cocaine
addiction and a drug-induced breakdown in which he thought police were
tunneling under his home and satellites monitoring his every move.
</P>
<P>
To a lesser degree, Schwartzbach tried to discredit Hambleton, who
had testified that he hadn't used drugs since 1999, with witnesses who
told jurors that the stuntman used drugs as late as 2001.
</P>
<P>
``Clearly, they didn't make the best witnesses,'' said Robert
Pugsley, a criminal law professor at Southwestern School of Law in Los
Angeles. ``On the other hand, that's all the prosecution had. ... Even
people on drugs can tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
Still, by keeping Blake off the witness stand, legal experts say
jurors will remain focused on the credibility of those who did
testify.
</P>
<P>
When a defendant testifies, ``It becomes `Do we believe the
defendant?' '' said Peter Keane, a former San Francisco public
defender and criminal law professor at Golden Gate University School
of Law in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
But there is what Levenson called ``the Peterson effect.'' Jurors
want to hear from the defendant, she said. They want to hear that side
of the story.
</P>
<P>
Yet there's an obvious risk for any defendant who takes the stand.
</P>
<P>
``As a general rule in a criminal case, if you can keep your client
from testifying, you do,'' Keane said.
</P>
<P>
And Blake's case has an added problem. ``It's a no-win situation,''
Levenson said, if he does well, ``prosecutors are just going to claim
he is acting.''
</P>
<P>
Despite excessive pretrial publicity about Bakley's tawdry past,
legal experts said Schwartzbach was smart to avoid dirtying the
victim.
</P>
<P>
``One of the things that turns jurors off is tarnishing the
victim,'' Keane said. ``Jurors resent it.''
</P>
<P>
Besides, experts say that Blake's earlier lawyers, most notably
Harland Braun, excelled in their efforts to influence the jury pool by
painting Bakley as a scam artist who bilked money out of men answering
her ads in lonely hearts magazines.
</P>
<P>
Yet experts downplayed Schwartzbach's attempt to blame the police
for allegedly mishandling evidence and focusing on Blake too early in
the investigation
</P>
<P>
Since the O.J. Simpson double-murder trial, ``we have not had a
case where the LAPD has not been accused of mishandling evidence,''
Pugsley said.
</P>
<P>
Its normal for police to focus immediately on a spouse of the
murder victim.
</P>
<P>
``In most domestic partner killings, the surviving partner is the
usual prime suspect, that doesn't mean Blake did it, but statistically
he was the most likely suspect,'' he said.
