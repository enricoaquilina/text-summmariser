Humor Helps Lawyers Make Their Case

<P>
Most comedians wouldn't attempt to conduct a
cross-examination any more than most lawyers would try to headline in
a comedy club.
</P>
<P>
And while no one will mistake the San Fernando Valley courtroom --
where jurors are considering whether actor Robert Blake killed his
wife -- for the Laugh Factory, both sides have exploited humor as a
tool for making their cases.
</P>
<P>
Amid gruesome testimony on blood-spatter patterns and ballistics,
defense attorney M. Gerald Schwartzbach and prosecutor Shellie L.
Samuels have waxed comedic on a variety of subjects, including the
pitfalls of modern marriage and musings on why some people claim they
buy Playboy magazine only for the articles.
</P>
<P>
Moments of levity serve an important purpose within the staid
confines of the courtroom by relieving tension, putting witnesses at
ease and allowing lawyers to connect with a jury, according to
attorneys and legal scholars.
</P>
<P>
``Humor is not going to change a case,'' said San Diego criminal
defense attorney Charles Seville, co-author of two books on courtroom
humor.
</P>
<P>
But if you can make the jury laugh, Seville said, ``you are going
to be more persuasive.''
</P>
<P>
Humor can also hammer home a point or deflect an opponent's
argument.
</P>
<P>
Schwartzbach was sparring recently with an expert on crime scene
reconstruction who had studied the trajectories of the bullets that
struck and killed Blake's wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, in a parked car in
Studio City four years ago.
</P>
<P>
It was important for Schwartzbach to undermine the testimony. He
wanted jurors to conclude that there was no reliable way the height of
the killer could be deduced.
</P>
<P>
With the timing of a stand-up comic, Schwartzbach asked whether
jurors could conclude that Bakley could have been shot by either
``Gary Coleman or Shaquille O'Neal.''
</P>
<P>
The lawyers aren't the only courtroom cutups.
</P>
<P>
University of California, Los Angeles professor Ronald Siegel is an
expert on the sustained use of hard-core drugs, which several key
witnesses for the prosecution admitted using. He drew laughs when he
described some of the research upon which his credentials are based:
tending a cage with crack-smoking monkeys in a basement on campus.
</P>
<P>
``I crawled into the cage with the monkeys and played monkey to
make sure that the smoking tube was working,'' Siegel said. ``I didn't
become a crazy monkey from any of that. I do like bananas.''
</P>
<P>
Even Blake, whose tears in and out of court have been the subject
of much debate, laughed during a reference to his lack of
home-decorating skills, and again when Schwartzbach described his
purple-and-gold van as ``hideous.''
</P>
<P>
In the Blake trial, each attorney has displayed a distinctive style
of humor while vying for the hearts and minds of the jury.
</P>
<P>
Schwartzbach, soft-spoken and formal in ever-present bow ties,
tends toward wry and self-deprecating one-liners.
</P>
<P>
``Stipulate to being married,'' the Mill Valley lawyer interjected
when a witness testified she had ignored her husband at dinner at
Vitello's, the Studio City restaurant where Bakley and Blake had dined
immediately before Bakley was slain.
</P>
<P>
Samuels, a hard-nosed veteran prosecutor who has won 48 out of 49
murder cases, has been particularly caustic off-the-cuff.
</P>
<P>
As Schwartzbach was directing jurors to look at a blowup of a
headline on the cover of a Playboy magazine, Samuels quipped that she
was surprised the attorney hadn't focused on the super-sized image of
the scantily clad woman.
</P>
<P>
At one point in the trial, which began in December, retired
Hollywood stuntman Roy ``Snuffy'' Harrison, who said Blake had asked
him to kill Bakley, was being pressed by Samuels on a bit of testimony
that seemed to suffer from faulty memory. She handed him a transcript
of his earlier testimony and asked him to refer to it, as is common in
criminal trials:
</P>
<P>
Harrison: ``I fall on my head for 30 years, and you want me to read
this?''
</P>
<P>
Samuels: ``Whose choice was it to fall on his head for 30 years?''
</P>
<P>
Harrison: ``My wife's.''
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara University School of Law professor Gerald Uelman, a
member of the O.J. Simpson defense team, said many lawyers avoid
humor, fearing it could appear rehearsed, or simply fall flat.
</P>
<P>
In the Blake trial, both lawyers have steered clear of
mean-spirited, derisive and personal exchanges that can turn a jury
off or earn a rebuke from the judge.
</P>
<P>
``If you're ridiculing somebody, the jury generally doesn't like to
see that,'' said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in
Los Angeles and a former federal prosecutor. ``Jurors are more likely
to identify with witnesses, not with the judge, lawyers or the
defendant.''
</P>
<P>
to Eric Dubin, an attorney who has attended almost every day of the
trial on behalf of Bakley's four children, said he hasn't been
offended by the lighter moments. ``Cracking jokes during a jury trial
is like kissing a girl: You need both timing and permission.''
