<P>
Jurors in the murder case against actor Robert Blake deliberated for more than
five hours Monday without reaching a verdict _ and without making any requests
to review trial testimony or evidence.
</P>
<P>
They were to resume deliberations Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Blake didn't appear at the courthouse. When asked if Blake was going to be
present during deliberations, his attorney, M. Gerald Schwartzbach, replied:
"Not unless he has to."
</P>
<P>
Blake, 71, is accused of killing his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley, after she allegedly
tricked him into marrying her. Bakley, 44, was shot to death in May 2001 near
Blake's favorite Italian restaurant in Studio City.
</P>
<P>
The actor is charged with murder, two counts of solicitation of murder and a
special circumstance of lying in wait. If convicted, he could be sentenced to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
Jurors deliberated for about 90 minutes Friday before going home for the
weekend. In his closing arguments, Schwartzbach portrayed the prosecution's key
witnesses as liars and accused the police of bungling a rushed
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Blake maintains someone else killed Bakley when he left her briefly in his car
to retrieve a gun he left behind during dinner. He told detectives he was armed
because his wife feared someone was stalking her.
</P>
<P>
Blake's .38-caliber revolver was not used to kill Bakley.
</P>
<P>
Deputy District Attorney Shellie Samuels told jurors in her closing arguments
that Blake killed Bakley because she had tricked him into marrying her by
getting pregnant. She argued that Blake then became obsessed with protecting the
baby from Bakley, who he believed was a con artist who sold promises of sex by
mail.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree that Blake married Bakley because of the baby, Rosie, and that
Blake suspected his wife of using another of her children for
pornography.
</P>
<P>
Schwartzbach argued Blake was willing to put up with Bakley for the sake of
their daughter. Blake's defense also attacked the credibility of the
prosecution's two key witnesses, both whom have admitted being heavy drug
users.
