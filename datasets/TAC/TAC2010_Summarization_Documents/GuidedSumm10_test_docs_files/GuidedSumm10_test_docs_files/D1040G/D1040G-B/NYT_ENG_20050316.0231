ROBERT BLAKE ACQUITTED OF KILLING HIS WIFE

<P>
Robert Blake, the 71-year-old actor who has spent
his entire life in front of a camera, was spared
death in prison on Wednesday, when a jury acquitted him
of the murder of his wife.
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing the verdict, Blake, who had maintained a gristly facade
throughout the three-month trial, wept into the shoulder of his
lawyer, M. Gerald Schwartzbach.
</P>
<P>
The day was a complete vindication for Blake, as the jury
of seven men and five women also found him not
guilty of soliciting a former stunt double from his days
as the television detective Baretta, to kill his wife, Bonny
Lee Bakley. The jury was hung on a third count
of soliciting a second stuntman to commit murder, and Judge
Darlene Schempp of Los Angeles County Superior Court dismissed that
charge in "the interest of justice."
</P>
<P>
Bakley, 44, died from a gunshot wound to the head on
May 4, 2001, as she sat in a car outside
a Studio City restaurant where she had just had dinner
with Blake.
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered that Blake be given back his passport and
$1.5 million bail.
</P>
<P>
In the back of the Van Nuys Superior courtroom, Bakley's daughter,
Holly Gawron, wept.
</P>
<P>
Speaking outside the courthouse, a visibly exhausted Blake was propped up
by his supporters as he spoke of his ordeal. "If
you want to know how to go through $10 million
in five years, ask me how," he said. "I was
a rich man. I'm broke now."
</P>
<P>
When asked who then was the real murderer of his wife
Blake snapped: "Shut up." And then: "Anybody got a question
that makes sense?"
</P>
<P>
Bonny Lee Bakley was a woman with a reputation as a
gold digger, a woman with at least a dozen aliases
and 10 former husbands, who the defense contended had trapped
Blake into an unloving marriage by becoming pregnant with his
child. They met at a Los Angeles jazz club in
1999 and consummated their future that night in the back
of Blake's vehicle. Their daughter, Rose, was born in June
2000 and the couple was married in November.
</P>
<P>
Bakley, 44, it is known, fished for rich and famous men
by sending them form letters and nude photos of herself.
Her dream she told friends, was to marry a celebrity.
