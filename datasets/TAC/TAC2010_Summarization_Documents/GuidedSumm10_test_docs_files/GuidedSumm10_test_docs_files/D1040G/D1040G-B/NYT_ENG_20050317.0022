BLAKE FANS FLOCK TO VITELLO'S

<P>
For Robert Blake fans across Los Angeles, there
was only one place to party after his scot-free verdict
Wednesday: Vitello's.
</P>
<P>
And there was only one possible order: The Robert Blake Special.
</P>
<P>
Hordes of patrons shunned pricey booths in Beverly Hills and the
Westside for the humble blend of the actor's favorite fusilli,
spinach, tomatoes and garlic -- described as "innocent and wholesome"
fare.
</P>
<P>
Just like Blake.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight's the night," declared Kevin and Don Norte, domestic partners who
drove from Hollywood to the Studio City haunt for a
mutual toast to "Freedom."
</P>
<P>
"It's a moment that is not only L.A., but is being
watched all over the world -- Paris, London, Australia. This
is the place to be."
</P>
<P>
They stopped in the street. They peeked in the door. They
packed the small restaurant known for its down-home feel --
and Hollywood stars.
</P>
<P>
All to talk of the plain-speaking actor known to TV buffs
as Baretta, and to Vitello's regulars as the friendliest neighbor
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Steve Restivo, co-owner of Vitello's, said he'd never seen so many
people -- nor heard so many Southern accents -- among
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
"I always had faith in Robert Blake," declared Restivo, who would
dish up any plate Blake desired three or four nights
a week. "He was a gentleman. And a gentle man.
</P>
<P>
"I'm ecstatic. I'm happy. He can (now) live his life."
</P>
<P>
Restivo, who is retiring from Vitello's next month with his brother
for health reasons, said he'd give the broke Blake a
job: "I'll go back to wash dishes -- and he
can have my job."
</P>
<P>
Outside, seven TV trucks lined the street as throngs gathered to
discuss the verdict.
</P>
<P>
Inside the scalloped awnings and blood-red booths, fans waited beneath hundreds
of Hollywood prints -- sans Blake's, who never signed one
over -- for the world-famous special.
</P>
<P>
And in the back of the fabled restaurant, a piano man
helped lift the glasses while regulars looked for their star.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good night, and it's a good day," said Hope
Nielsen, 44, of Beverly Hills. "I thought that (Blake) would
show to get a warm welcome from everyone."
</P>
<P>
Many came because they had known Blake at the studios, at
his nearby Mata Hari Ranch, or at Vitello's.
</P>
<P>
"I'm celebrating," said Maria Schreiber, 50, of Sherman Oaks, who headed
for Vitello's as soon as her day was done. "I'm
a psychologist, I know he's innocent. Oh, I can tell.
I can tell. I can tell he's an honest man.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to order the Robert Blake Special."
</P>
<P>
One woman joked that she ordered the special -- and found
a bullet in it.
</P>
<P>
Helen Nemchick and Carole Weir had just finished eating at an
Irish pub in Burbank when they were drawn toward the
Blake murder mecca.
</P>
<P>
"We're looky-loos," said Nemchick, of Burbank. "We (once) came down here,
saw the blood, went over to Mata Hari Ranch. I
said, No way he did it. He's going to be
acquitted. End of story."
</P>
<P>
Not so, snapped Weir, 62, of Burbank. "He's guilty as sin."
</P>
<P>
"There is no way he could do this," said Elizabeth Cotton,
a former neighbor. "He loved his children too much and
would never put them through this."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, die-hard trial watchers raced to the Van
Nuys courthouse after hearing the verdict.
</P>
<P>
"I came to support Robert Blake. All along we knew he
was not guilty," said Maria Garcia, 30, a housewife from
Van Nuys, who said she'd seen Blake's movies, followed the
case and wanted to be there for the verdict.
</P>
<P>
Others, such as Carlos MacPherson and his friend Oscar Rosales, both
30 and Sylmar residents, said they were disgusted.
</P>
<P>
"I feel it's an injustice. I followed the case from the
beginning and the evidence was sufficient to convict him," MacPherson
said, shaking his head and staring at the media trucks
and cameras there for Blake.
</P>
<P>
"Money buys you freedom. If you have money to buy a
defense team then you're going to go free."
</P>
<P>
The crowd continued debating as they watched jurors and then Blake
and his team of attorneys take questions in the media
zone.
</P>
<P>
Lost in the crowd was Jeff Moreno, 35, a hospital employee
from Toluca Lake, who waited holding the box cover of
the "Baretta" board game.
</P>
<P>
He hoped Blake would sign it. It was his second attempt;
his first request a few months back was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
"He was outside having a cigarette and I asked him if
he could sign it," Moreno recalled.
</P>
<P>
Blake said no, but agreed to pose for a photo.
