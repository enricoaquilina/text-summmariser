Blake Is Found Not Guilty

<TEXT>
<P>
After a 12-week trial that ended with jurors saying
they did not believe two Hollywood stuntmen central to the
prosecution's case, actor Robert Blake was found not guilty Wednesday
of fatally shooting his wife.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors ``couldn't put the gun in his hand,'' said jury foreman
Thomas Nicholson. ``I felt the primary thing from what I saw was that
the circumstantial evidence was flimsy.''
</P>
<P>
A jury of seven men and five women deliberated for nine days in a
Van Nuys courthouse before acquitting Blake, accused of having killed
Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, in a car parked on a quiet Studio City street
nearly four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The jury also found the star of the 1970s detective series
``Baretta'' not guilty of soliciting someone to kill Bakley. They
deadlocked 11-1 on a second solicitation count, but the judge later
dismissed that charge ``in the interest of justice'' after jurors
reported they could not reach a verdict.
</P>
<P>
Blake, 71, shook from apparent emotion when the verdict was read by
the clerk for Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Darlene E.
Schempp.
</P>
<P>
The jurors, who ranged in age from 24 to 78, included an
air-conditioning technician, a legal secretary, a retired librarian
and a postal worker. They cited concerns about the circumstantial
nature of the case against Blake, in which prosecutors were never able
to link Blake to the murder weapon or produce a witness who could
place him at the scene during the time of the murder.
</P>
<P>
``As things progressed, it just turned out there were a lot of
gaps,'' said Michael Pollack, 47, an alternate juror, who said he
believed Blake didn't stand a chance of acquittal when the trial
began.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of direct evidence, jurors were asked to believe
testimony from the stuntmen who testified that Blake had asked them to
kill Bakley two months before her murder. But Blake's attorney, M.
Gerald Schwartzbach, was able to undermine their credibility by
putting on evidence that their admitted use of cocaine and
methamphetamine could have caused them to be delusional.
</P>
<P>
Another juror, Charles Safko, a 50-year-old truck driver, said the
stuntmen were a major problem in deliberations.
</P>
<P>
``I didn't believe either one of them,'' he said. ``I thought they
were both so full of it, it was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
Deputy Los Angeles County District Attorney Shellie Samuels, a
career prosecutor who had won 48 of 49 murder cases before Blake, said
she was ``blown away'' by the verdict. She wondered what impact
Blake's celebrity had on the case.
</P>
<P>
``I can't believe a jury would not convict on this,'' Samuels said.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the 12 jurors noted on questionnaires they filled out
during jury selection that they recalled Blake from his roles in
``Baretta'' and ``Our Gang.'' All said they were aware of the case
before being called, but only four jurors said they followed it
``quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
Outside the courthouse, Schwartzbach said he had hoped for a quick
verdict but instead got the prolonged deliberations. He also said
Blake handled the trial with ``tremendous grace.''
</P>
<P>
``He handled the deliberations with more composure than I was able
to muster,'' he said. ``As the jury was about to come back, he said to
me `You did your best.' Now what kind of person says something like
that when he doesn't know which door he's walking out of?''
</P>
<P>
After his acquittal, Blake was at times rambling, profane and
emotional. He said he was broke and had to get a job.
</P>
<P>
``I used to be a rich man,'' he said, ``Right now I couldn't buy
spats for a hummingbird.''
</P>
<P>
Asked who he ``honestly believe killed your wife,'' Blake shouted,
``Shutup.''
</P>
<P>
He then asked for a pair of scissors to remove the electronic
monitor that had been attached to his leg since he was released on
bail.
</P>
<P>
Bakley, the mother of four, was fatally shot on May 4, 2001, in
Blake's car near Vitello's, the Studio City restaurant where the
couple had just eaten dinner.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Changes in Blake's legal team, other delays and bigger celebrity
defendants -- Michael Jackson for one -- seemed to dampen interest in
what was once the nation's most talked-about crime story.
</P>
<P>
But the media flocked to Van Nuys for the verdict on Wednesday,
descending on Schempp's eighth-floor courtroom to hear the fate of an
actor who had once shared the screen with such luminaries as Humphrey
Bogart, John Wayne, Charlton Heston, Gregory Peck, Sidney Poitier and
Spencer Tracy. After the verdict, jurors were allowed to keep their
badges, which they had autographed by many of the trial's
participants, as souveneirs.
</P>
<P>
Bakley's daughter Holly Gawron wept profusely as the verdict was
read.
</P>
<P>
``It was not what I wanted to hear, but I will accept it and move
on,'' she said. ``At this point there is nothing I can do. I would
like him to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
Eric Dubin, Gawron's lawyer, who is suing Blake for Bakley's
wrongful death, said, ``I completely respect the jury's decision, but
in America money and fame will buy you freedom.''
</P>
<P>
During the four-month murder trial, Blake did not testify in his
own defense. But 110 witnesses were called during the trial, 74 for
the prosecution and 36 for the defense.
</P>
<P>
But in the end, the two Hollywood stuntmen -- Gary McLarty and
Ronald Hambleton -- were crucial to the prosecution's case, and their
credibility proved an insurmountable problem for Samuels.
</P>
<P>
A juror called one of the men ``a prolific liar'' and said the
testimony of the other ``had no bearing at all.'' Several jurors cited
their admissions of heavy past drug use.
</P>
<P>
Legal expert Laurie Levenson of Loyola Law School said ``the
stuntmen were walking, talking reasonable doubt.''
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contended the stuntmen's testimony not only proved the
solicitation charges but also supported their theory that Blake feared
that Bakley, who ran a lonely hearts mail order con game, would
corrupt their now 4-year-old daughter, Rosie.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, prosecutors focused on records from a prepaid
phone card documenting 56 calls from Blake's house to Hambleton and
three to McLarty between March 2001 and the May 2001 slaying --
confirming the actor's contact with his accusers.
</P>
<P>
Schwartzbach suggested throughout the trial that someone other than
Blake, possibly one of the hundreds of men he said Bakley had bilked
with naked pictures and promises of a sexual relationship, killed her
in the moments she sat alone in Blake's car.
</P>
<P>
Schwartzbach also emphasized repeatedly the lack of eyewitnesses,
fingerprints or other forensic evidence linking Blake to the murder
weapon, a Walther P-38 handgun.
</P>
<P>
Blake was arrested at his Hidden Hills home in April 2002 after one
of the most intensive investigations in Los Angeles Police Department
history.
</P>
<P>
Blake spent the next 11 months inside a private cell in Men's
Central Jail until his release on $1.5 million bail. While in jail,
his hair, which he had previously dyed jet black, turned gray.
</P>
<P>
After his acquittal, Blake referred repeatedly to the high cost of
his defense, calling himself ``broke.''
</P>
<P>
``If you want to know how to go through $10 million in five years,
I can tell you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Blake met Bakley, a small-time scam artist who dreamed of snagging
a celebrity husband, in 1998 at a now-defunct Burbank jazz club. Their
stormy, disjointed relationship, which included a contentious child
custody dispute, provided the backdrop for the prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
One witness testified that when Blake learned that Bakley was
pregnant, he threatened to ``whack her'' if she refused to get an
abortion. He schemed to get her probation revoked on an Arkansas fraud
case, and tried to have her arrested for alleged crimes relating to
her mail-order pornography business, prosecution witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses testified that once Blake saw the child --and a
paternity test proved he was the father -- he became a loving, doting
father. A former Blake employee testified that shortly after Rosie was
born in June 2000, Blake refused to return her after a visit from the
mother.
</P>
<P>
Bakley filed kidnapping charges, which she dropped after Blake
agreed to marry her. She moved into the guesthouse behind Blake's
then-home, the ``Mata Hari Ranch'' in Studio City, five days before
her murder.
</P>
<P>
McLarty, 64, of Lake View Terrace, said Blake offered him $10,000
to ``pop'' his wife, acknowledging that the actor never used the word
kill. On the stand, the semi-retired stunt coordinator also admitted
to being hospitalized last year for a drug-induced breakdown, in which
he believed police were tunneling under his home and satellites were
monitoring his every move.
</P>
<P>
Then Hambleton, 68, of Lucerne Valley, testified that Blake
proposed several ways to kill Bakley, saying that one possible
location for the crime would be near Vitello's, Blake's favorite
restaurant. He told jurors that when he told Blake he wanted no part
of the scheme, the actor responded: ``Well, if you're not going to do
it, then I sure as hell am.''
</P>
<P>
In most of the murder plots Blake proposed, Hambleton said, the
actor wanted to be present. He said that Blake told him: ``Don't worry
about it. I'm an actor, you know, I'll take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
In Blake's defense, Schwartzbach questioned police tactics,
accusing detectives of mishandling evidence and courting author and
former Los Angeles Times reporter Miles Corwin to bolster their
careers. He suggested detectives targeted Blake early as a suspect to
give Corwin a celebrity ending to his book about the LAPD's elite
Robbery-Homicide unit.
</P>
<P>
Several jurors said the issue was not central to deliberations.
``They could have left him out,'' said juror Charles Safko.
</P>
<P>
The judge, in a pretrial ruling, found that Corwin's presence
during a search of Blake's home violated the actor's constitutional
rights but declined to throw out any evidence, finding that he was
merely an observer.
</P>
<P>
One defense expert testified that whoever shot Bakley would have
had significantly more gunshot residue on his hands than the few lead
particles that police had found on Blake in the 2-1/2 hours after his
wife's shooting. Several jurors cited that testimony as important in
the acquittal.
</P>
<P>
Bakley's unsavory past played a surprisingly small role inside the
courtroom, despite early efforts by Blake's defense team to exploit
her mail-order pornography business as the possible reason for her
death.
</P>
<P>
Blake, born Michael James Vijencio Gubitosi in 1933 in Nutley,
N.J., made his stage debut at age 3 in father's vaudeville act. He
quickly moved to silver screen, joining the ``Our Gang'' cast as
``Mickey,'' then played Red Ryder's Indian sidekick Little Beaver in
the Western serials.
</P>
<P>
Blake played the young boy in the John Huston classic ``The
Treasure of the Sierra Madre'' and got rave reviews in 1967 for his
terrifying performance as murderer Perry Smith in ``In Cold Blood,''
based on Truman Capote's book.
</P>
<P>
The actor returned to TV in 1975, winning an Emmy for his role as
New York detective Tony Baretta, a scrappy, streetwise cop who lived
in a rundown hotel with his pet cockatoo, Fred. After three seasons,
the series was canceled and Blake worked sporadically in the TV or
movie business.
</P>
<P>
Blake was nominated for an Emmy in 1993 for his portrayal of John
List, a meek New Jersey accountant who killed his family in 1971 and
led a secret life for more than 17 years before being caught.
