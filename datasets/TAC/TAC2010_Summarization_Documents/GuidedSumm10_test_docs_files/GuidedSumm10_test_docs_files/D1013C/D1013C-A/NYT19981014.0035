ARIZONA MEASURES HANG ON BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Budget negotiations between the White House and
congressional Republicans and end-of-session shenanigans have left
a half-dozen measures important to Arizona hanging in legislative
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the provisions keeping the state's delegation on
tenterhooks are two immigration measures that just a few days ago
seemed settled: border crossing cards and an entry-exit
documentation program.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators had worked out a deal to delay for 2{ years a
program that would require foreigners to fill out entry and exit
forms at the United States' northern and southern borders, a plan
that had border businesses fretting that it would create long lines
of traffic and interminable delays.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last-minute haggling this week, negotiators decided
the program would be on indefinite hold along the Canadian border,
but only delayed for a year in the south, a situation that
Arizona's congressional delegation says is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Jon Kyl and John McCain and other members of the Arizona
delegation wrote to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott asking that
the original deal be restored.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, along with Rep. Jim Kolbe and other members of the
delegation, is also involved in trying to straighten out the border
crossing-card issue. Congress required the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to change border crossing cards _
identification cards used by frequent border crossers _ to make
them more fraud-resistant. The cards were going to be expensive for
users, and devising them had become controversial, so the INS began
requiring visas issued by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona members heard complaints that obtaining a full visa is
inconvenient for many people crossing the border at Nogales or
other ports of entry because the nearest State Department facility
is miles away, in Hermosillo.
</P>
<P>
   Until the situation is resolved with INS, Kyl and Kolbe are
lobbying for a return to the old crossing-card system.
</P>
<P>
   Most frustrating for Rep. John Shadegg is the hold the Senate
placed on his and Kyl's identity-theft bill, which was passed after
an Arizona couple spent $15,000 and countless hours trying to
restore their good name after a thief destroyed it. A Democratic
senator _ it's unknown who it was _ placed a hold on the popular
measure, which for the first time makes identity theft a crime. The
senator reportedly was attempting to pressure other members to
approve some judges.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had cleared the Senate unanimously and the House by a
voice vote. President Clinton has promised his signature to make it
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an outrage, and I think it's a particular outrage
when they do it to non-controversial, bipartisan legislation
concerning the fastest growing crime in America, which causes its
victims financial ruin and great emotional distress,'' Shadegg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also caught in the legislative crossfire are:
</P>
<P>
   The Tres Rios sewage reclamation project, a demonstration
project to clean effluent through wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   The Wellton-Mohawk water transfer from the federal government to
Wellton.
</P>
<P>
   A measure to prohibit the use of federal funds to drain or study
draining Lake Powell, an idea under review by the Glen Canyon
Institute and approved by the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of Jose de Jesus Rivera as U.S. attorney for
Arizona. He is the acting U.S. attorney. &QL;
