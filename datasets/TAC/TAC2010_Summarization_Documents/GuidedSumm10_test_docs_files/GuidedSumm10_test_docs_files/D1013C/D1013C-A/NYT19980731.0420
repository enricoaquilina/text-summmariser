GORE OUTLINES PLANS FOR STRONGER ONLINE PRIVACY

   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration announced a new privacy
initiative Friday aimed at protecting children and medical
patients, among others. But while the proposals were ambitious, the
administration can enforce few of them without the consent of
Congress or private industry.
</P>
<P>
   Calling privacy in the age of electronic commerce ``a basic
American value'' that ``must be protected,'' Vice President Al Gore
made public a list of a dozen or so new initiatives that seek to
tighten the security of financial and medical records and to
protect the privacy of children who use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the proposals are simply endorsements of bills already
wending their way through Congress. Others require new
congressional action that is, in some cases, uncertain at best.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration chose not to offer any broad new ideas
for protecting the privacy of adults online, an issue important to
many in Congress and to public-interest groups. Gore announced
instead that, for now, the administration would leave industry to
regulate itself.
</P>
<P>
   The government's privacy rules are of special concern now
because the European Union plans to enforce a new electronic
privacy program in October and has threatened to stop doing
business with companies in other countries that have looser rules.
In congressional testimony earlier this week, Commerce Secretary
William Daley said the administration's new proposals would bring
the United States into compliance. But some experts in privacy law
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The administration can enforce only a handful of the initiatives
proposed Friday, including two that would tighten the security of
medical and banking records.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the Department of Health and Human Services
would propose a new rule next week to enhance the security of
electronic medical records, but offered no details.
</P>
<P>
   And federal bank regulators will strengthen the enforcement of a
law that sets limits on how easily banks can share information
about their customers and their accounts with related business,
such as insurance companies, according to a senior administration
official.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Gore said, was ``to ensure that account-holders have
the chance to give a thumbs-down or a thumbs-up before banks hand
out sensitive information about their accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the other proposals are just that _ ideas that are up to
others to implement. For example, Gore said he wanted to discourage
``profiling'' _ the practice by some companies of building dossiers
on the activities of private citizens using a variety of databases
and then using or selling that information to other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with the Federal Trade Commission to issue a
new challenge to companies that use information technology to piece
together personal profiles of American citizens and then sell those
profiles for profit,'' the vice president said. ``And here is the
message to them: If you don't find a way quickly to effectively
regulate your own industry, we will take actions to make you
protect the privacy of all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the White House urged Congress to pass pending
legislation that would enforce criminal penalties for ``identity
theft'' _ stealing someone's Social Security number, credit-card
numbers or other identifiers and using them to commit a crime, such
as credit-card fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also urged Congress to pass a law that would forbid
companies running sites on the World Wide Web to collect
information about children under 13 visiting the sites without
permission from their parents. ``Before children innocently forfeit
personal information, parents should have a say,'' the vice
president said.

<P>
   Experts in privacy regulation found few new ideas in the White
House initiative. David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic
Privacy Information Center, a private research group based in
Washington, said, ``We didn't hear much here that we haven't heard
before, and the gaping hole in their policy continues to be
Internet privacy'' for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Hendricks, editor of the Privacy Times newsletter, said:
``In form and ceremony, it's a great day. But in substance this
leaves a lot wanting.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobel also said the proposals ``still leave us out of step with
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks agreed, saying: ``This does hardly anything to deal
with the coming problem with Europe. It leaves us on a collision
course with the EU.''
