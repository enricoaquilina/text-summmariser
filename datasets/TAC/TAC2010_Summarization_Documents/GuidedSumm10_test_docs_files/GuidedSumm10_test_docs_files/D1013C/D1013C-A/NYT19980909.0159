   SAN FRANCISCO _ Marvin Young Jr. got home from work one evening
and found a certified letter from the Sacramento police that
changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a warrant for my arrest for check fraud,'' said
Young, who lives in Oakland. ``I nearly fainted. I'd never even
been to Sacramento.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1991. Seven years later, he is still fighting to
clear his name, stolen by a former housemate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having trouble explaining who I am _ he took over my
life,'' Young said. ``I just sold my house and I can't buy another
one. I've worked hard and never made a late payment in my life, but
this other guy has just messed up everything for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The saga of the real Marvin Young and the impostor using his
name illustrates the struggle identity-theft victims face in
reclaiming their names and restoring their credit. Identity theft,
one of the fastest growing crimes in the nation, is a type of fraud
in which a criminal takes another's personal information and uses
it to apply for credit. The con artist can then make thousands of
dollars in fraudulent purchases and have it all billed to an
unwitting victim.
</P>
<P>
   As in Young's case, catching the thief doesn't necessarily stop
the crime. The person who stole his identity has been arrested
several times, the authorities say, but apparently finds Young's
name too useful to resist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once these guys find a good name, they pretty much stick to
that and keep it going as long as possible,'' said Andrew Wong, a
U.S. Postal Service inspector who has handled numerous cases
identity theft. ``Many of these guys are into drugs and can't get
regular jobs. They just go back to what they know best.''
</P>
<P>
   Stealing a person's identity requires only a Social Security
number and one other piece of identifying information, such as a
mother's maiden name. Much of that type of information is now
available on the Internet for as little as $15.
</P>
<P>
   Once a thief gets a credit card in someone else's name, it's
party time. Thieves normally max out a fraudulent card in less than
an hour, leaving the victims to sort out the mess.
</P>
<P>
   In the Young case, he could prove that he was at work at a San
Francisco bank the day the fraudulent checks were written. But his
problems were far from over.
</P>
<P>
   The man who was Young's housemate for a few months in 1989 had
stolen his identity and run up debts around the nation,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Young always carries copies of letters from the police and
credit agencies confirming his identity. He was never arrested for
the crimes committed in his name.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Young's case began in 1989, shortly after he moved to the
San Francisco from Mississippi. His housemate asked to see Young's
Mississippi driver's license photo. The man covertly copied some of
Young's personal information, including his Social Security number
and date of birth.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until two years later that Young realized he'd been
had. His housemate requested and received a copy of Young's birth
certificate from Mississippi, then used that document to obtain
driver's licenses in Young's name in several states. The impostor
opened credit lines at dozens of stores in different areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 60 or 70 accounts in my name that I had to close,''
Young said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 to 1993, Young worked to clear his name, writing more
than 100 letters and checking his credit report regularly.
Eventually, Young settled into a normal life and even bought a
house. The impostor became a bad memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was quiet until August of 1997, then he went on a
rampage,'' Young said. ``In one month, he opened up 40 accounts in
my name. He was all over _ in Atlanta, Florida, Washington, D.C.,
and Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's housemate was finally arrested. But Young is still
slogging his way out of the swamp caused by fraudulent bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a year later and I still can't get a drop of credit,'' he
said.

<P>
   The police say that as long as credit cards and checks have
existed, criminals have used them for fraudulent purposes. Every
advance in technology brings new twists from scammers.
</P>
<P>
   Identity theft wasn't always so well-known, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1988 when it happened (to me), nobody even knew what I
was talking about,'' said Elsie Strong of Los Angeles, founder of
the support group Victims of Identity Theft. ``I felt so alone. Now
there are thousands of us. People need somebody to talk to. They
don't know what to do next. I realized that there needed to be a
group for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Strong was victimized, there have been thousands of
others, often without any knowledge they are victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these people don't find out about it until they're
getting a house. ... By the time they clear their credit, they've
missed getting the house,'' said Phil Dito, a fraud inspector with
the San Francisco police.
</P>
<P>
   Strong and other victims have testified for legislation to make
it easier to clean up credit and get tougher on perpetrators. They
share frustration over an economic system that grants credit easily
and a criminal justice establishment that puts a low priority on
prosecuting fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police just don't have time to really go after these
problems,'' said Joanne Mankiewicz of San Francisco, whose name was
used to amass $80,000 in debt. ``It's easier to go after a bank
robber who uses a gun than one who does it with paper and
plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Mari Frank, an Orange County attorney who has worked on cases of
identity theft, summed up the odyssey of fraud victims:
</P>
<P>
   ``First you get victimized by the bad guy, then you get
victimized by the banks that won't believe you, then you get
victimized by the credit reporting agencies that won't take off the
fraudulent information and then you are victimized by another
company that won't give you credit, then you are victimized by
government agencies that won't believe you,'' Frank said. ``It's a
wound that never gets to heal.''
