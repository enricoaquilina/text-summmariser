   SAN FRANCISCO _ If someone steals your name and runs up lots of
bills with it, how do you clear things up? Slowly.
</P>
<P>
   It took Mari Frank two years and became an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through identity-theft hell and I survived,'' said
Frank, 50. ``I had to write 90 letters and spent 500 hours working
to clear my name.''
</P>
<P>
   But Frank, an attorney in Orange County, Calif., turned her
ordeal into a service for other victims: She has compiled a guide
to help others avoid the same problems. She has created an
``Identity Theft Survival Kit,'' written a book and pamphlets, and
produced computer discs with sample letters to send to banks,
creditors and credit reporting agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become a reluctant expert,'' Frank said. ``I found out
more than I ever wanted to know about this.''
</P>
<P>
   She had no idea what identity theft was until 1995, when she
received a call from the Bank of New York demanding that Frank pay
up on her $11,000 credit card balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: There must be some mistake. I don't have a credit card
with you,''' said Frank, an adjunct professor at the Western State
College of Law in Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't. She'd been scammed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was technology rape,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Ventura County woman had somehow gotten hold of Frank's Social
Security number and other personal data. The woman set up a series
of fraudulent lines of credit, ordering credit cards, starting
checking accounts and having Frank's mail sent to a different
address. The impostor ran up about $100,000 worth of bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``She even bought a car using my name,'' Frank said. ``And then
she didn't keep up her payments. ... Bills in my name were being
sent to Ventura (Calif.). I'd never even stopped there before.''
</P>
<P>
   The scam apparently had been going on for at least a year. After
spending thousands of dollars, Frank believes she has finally
cleared her name with the Bank of New York and other creditors
including Thrifty Rental Car, which was threatening to sue her
after the impostor trashed a car.
</P>
<P>
   The impostor, Tracy Lloyd, eventually pleaded guilty to six
counts of felony fraud but spent no time behind bars, Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman stalked me. If she had used the .22 Beretta handgun
she had in her possession at the time of her arrest to steal that
money, she would still be behind bars. But instead she used a pen,
a computer and the telephone. She drove home from the courthouse in
the same red convertible Mustang that she bought with my name.''
</P>
<P>
   Repairing the damage can be difficult, time-consuming and
frustrating. Frank and other experts said that victims of identity
theft often become depressed. There is now a support group called
Victims of Identity Theft (310-397-3004).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fight for your credit and your sanity,'' Frank said.
``There's post-traumatic stress disorder that occurs from this
crime. Most of the time you don't know who is doing it, and the
perpetrators never get caught.''
