<TEXT>
<P>
   Wondering why you didn't get a job offer after that last
interview?
</P>
<P>
   So did Bronti Kelly, a retail salesman and former military
reservist from Temecula, Calif., who couldn't figure out why he was
repeatedly turned down in the early 1990s for dozens of sales
positions at department stores _ or dismissed within a week if he
did manage to secure a job.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after more than four years, Kelly, now 34, finally
discovered the problem: He had been denied employment because of an
erroneous shoplifting report circulated to retailers who did
background checks on him when he applied for work.
</P>
<P>
   The report had been forwarded by one of the stores to which he
had applied _ Robinsons-May _ through its parent company, the May
Department Stores, to the Stores Protective Association, a
nonprofit group in Simi Valley, Calif., that provides background
screening, work histories and loss-prevention programs to about 100
retail chains, manufacturers and other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the association, founded in 1929, share information
about employees. The group is a regional affiliate of the United
States Mutual Association, an 80-year-old private clearinghouse in
Chicago that pools theft case reports from its 10 member groups
nationwide _ it currently has about two million such reports _ and
operates much like a major credit bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly says he was the victim of identity theft. After his wallet
was stolen, he said, a shoplifter who was arrested used Kelly's
name and identification; the Los Angeles County Police Department
corroborated his account. When he was unable to get work, he ended
up filing for bankruptcy and became homeless for a time.
</P>
<P>
   After he found out about the shoplifting report, Kelly sued May
and the Stores Protective Association in 1995, complaining that May
had failed to correct the report in the association's files even
after he had discovered it and provided proof of his innocence. The
association was found not liable, and May settled out of court in
January, paying Kelly $73,680.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost me my life, really,'' said Kelly, who has since
legally changed his name and Social Security number. ``I never knew
why I wasn't being hired. That's the insidious nature of this _
there's often no way to know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda West, a spokeswoman for the May Department Stores in St.
Louis, said, ``We regret the difficulties this created for Kelly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's story points to a growing conflict between the rights of
employers and employees in an age of quick, easy and inexpensive
computer access to public information: how to balance a company's
need to know about a person it might hire with the individual's
need for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best efforts of federal regulators and private
businesses, workers can be plagued by black marks mistakenly left
on public records if they do not pursue their right to discover and
correct errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, you had to hire a gumshoe to find out about a
person's background,'' said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy
Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit advocacy organization in San
Diego. ``Now you don't have to go any farther than your desk _ what
you can find out today for typically under $100 is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   More public records have been placed on the Internet in recent
years as information brokers have linked with public agencies,
governments and businesses for computer access that enables them to
compile virtual dossiers on anyone, including data like Social
Security numbers, property ownership, driving records and nearest
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The services available range from large, blue-chip investigation
companies to upstart Web sites that offer data at bargain rates.
Checks can be done in days or minutes, usually for a cost of $5 to
$200.
</P>
<P>
   Since many employers do not disclose what sort of background
checks they use, it is hard to know exactly how they conduct them.
But one thing is sure: The scrutiny of job applicants has
intensified in recent years, as incidents of workplace violence,
and the number of lawsuits charging employers with negligence in
hiring, have increased, employment experts say. And that has meant
a boom for the companies _ especially Web-based services _ that do
such searches.
</P>
<P>
   Technology, of course, has spawned an increase in the number of
databases containing background information and has made such
information available faster. Some of the services available are
www.knowx.com, which uses the Information America database;
www.informus.com, which primarily conducts direct public-records
searches for 1,000 businesses and employers; Advanced Research Inc.
(www.advsearch.com), which offers many checking services on a
contingency basis (no hits, no charge), and www.digdirt.com, which
says it has access to 325 billion records.
</P>
<P>
   Peoplewise, a 10-month-old privately held company
(www.people-wise.com) in Hollister, Calif., has developed what it
says is technology that allows the first real-time background
checks. Employers can get information within seconds, even during
an applicant's interview, said Gary Cornick, president of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-employment screening must be fast, Cornick said. ``In this
labor market, you have to act quickly or you'll lose applicants to
competitors,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But job applicants do have rights, especially under amendments
to the Fair Credit Reporting Act that took effect on Sept. 30,
1997, extending the protection of the rules governing credit
reports to job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The changes give consumers more protection by requiring an
employer to get applicants' permission before getting credit
reports or other background checks on them. And if job applicants
are turned down because of credit reports, the employer must tell
the applicants about that as well as their right to free copies of
the reports. The changes in the law also make it easier for job
applicants to correct any errors found.
</P>
<P>
   More employers are doing background checks on job applicants
because more courts are finding employers liable for not only the
actions of employees, but also of former employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legal requirements have increased the use of background checks
by businesses,'' said Garry G. Mathiason, a senior partner with
Littler, Mendelson, Fastiff, Tichy &AMP; Mathiason, an employment and
labor law firm in San Francisco. ``There are enough horror stories
out there about criminal liability that employers feel it's become
absolutely necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   A Florida Circuit Court in 1995 found the Allstate Insurance Co.
liable for failing to disclose the violent history of an employee
it had dismissed. The Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. subsequently
hired him, based on Allstate's recommendation, and he killed three
co-workers there.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in Oakley vs. Flor-Shin Inc., the Kentucky
Court of Appeals ruled that an employer could be held liable for an
attack by an employee against a third party. In the case, a Kmart
employee was accused of rape by an employee of Flor-Shin, the
company the retailer had hired to clean floors. The victim sued
Flor-Shin, saying it had known that the worker had a criminal
history.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three states now require criminal background checks for
workers in positions like health care, child care, schools and
housekeeping. But few use Federal Bureau of Investigation records
to check potential employees, so workers with criminal convictions
can secure new jobs by simply crossing state lines, says a federal
report issued Sept. 14 by the federal Health and Human Services
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which focused chiefly on nursing-home practices,
calls for a national registry of workers with criminal backgrounds
that would be accessible to employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Background checks today are more critical than ever before,''
said Lynda Lucas, president and chief financial officer of the
Stores Protective Association. ``In a society where the term `going
postal' is routinely coined, I think if you asked most employees,
they would want to be assured that the person working next to them
wasn't a dangerous criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly 300,000 screenings conducted by the association
each year, fewer than 2 percent return ``hits'' _ findings that
flag the applications as needing further checking _ and 1 percent
of the hits turn up applicants with reports on file of criminal
offenses, Ms. Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a day and age where it's hard to find qualified employees,
you really don't want to turn people away if there's not a real
good reason for doing so,'' said Barry Lawrence, a spokesman for
the Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   But checking applicants' records is quickly becoming routine for
many companies. In a 1995 Society for Human Resource Management
survey of 1,331 human-resource professionals, 92 percent said they
spoke to former employers before hiring new employees, 78 percent
called references provided by candidates, 61 percent verified
educational backgrounds, 42 percent checked driving records, and 25
percent conducted credit checks.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 survey of 589 members of the American Management
Association in New York found that 70 percent conducted background
checks on applicants and 48 percent searched criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   Employers do background checks in various ways _ using the
telephone, fax or Internet, for example. But Alan F. Westin, a
professor emeritus of public law and government at Columbia
University and publisher of the Privacy and American Business
newsletter, said: ``I don't believe there's any documented place to
find out for sure who's relying on the Internet sources and who's
not. No one tracks it.''
</P>
<P>
   When employers check applicants' resumes, they find that quite a
few are lying. About one-third of all resumes have inaccuracies,
and 10 percent of those are serious enough to deny employment,
estimated Edward C. Andler, owner and president of the Certified
Reference Checking Co. in St. Louis, who has provided reference and
resume checking for employers since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, the incidence of resume distortion has
continued to creep up,'' said Andler, who is the author of ``The
Complete Reference Checking Handbook'' (Amacom, 1998). ``People are
more willing to lie and stretch the truth.'' Andler estimated that
one of every 12 applicants _ even those who are seeking
executive-level positions _ will claim to have college degrees they
do not have.
</P>
<P>
   Many employers have adopted a policy of giving only basic
employment information when asked for references on former
employees because they fear lawsuits. Lawrence said, ``Employers
are frustrated because they can't always get the specific
information they need to make a hiring decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Westin said background checks were most likely to hurt
applicants' chances unfairly when employers conducted hasty checks
using sources that were not reliable, many of them inexpensive
checking services offered on the Internet. ``No one is tracking
what the employer's checking on these Net services,'' Westin said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Small companies may turn to unreliable pre-employment checking
services because they may not know about reputable services or may
consider them too expensive, some experts say. ``This is not the
way the IBMs of the world check up on people,'' Westin said. ``But
it tends to be the impression many employees have. The most
potential for problems will be with smaller employers, not the big
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   If a check turns up questionable online information, employment
lawyers say, it should be corroborated by other sources, like
public records. Mathiason cautioned, ``Electronic information can
be wrong and to rely upon it blindly is unwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups concerned with privacy rights say mistakes in reporting
personal data happen routinely. But while Kelly had a hard time
countering erroneous information that came up in background checks
in the early 1990s, people applying for jobs can easily find out
now if inaccurate negative information is keeping them from
employment, and they can take steps to correct any errors.
</P>
<P>
   Katrina Haines, 27, a resident of Mission Viejo, Calif., found
herself doing just that. She applied in May for a sales job with
Good Guys, an electronics retailer in Brisbane, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   She did not get the job because of the results of a criminal
records check in California conducted by the Amherst Group on
behalf of Good Guys, she said. The check turned up arrest records
for criminal prostitution and drug possession, but those records
were incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so ridiculous, it was laughable,'' she said. ``But it
was no joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The police record, Ms. Haines discovered, belonged to a person
with the same name. She was given a copy of the report, as required
by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, so she disputed the errors, which
were corrected. She said she was now eligible to reapply to Good
Guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't know that they have the right to request the
details of their own report and the ability to dispute it,'' Ms.
Haines said, ``they'll never know why they didn't get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern over such mistakes in employment records has spawned
a cottage industry of do-your-own-search services that, for a fee,
will scout out the data available about you from public records and
references. Documented Reference Check, for example, at
www.badreferences.com, advertises that it will call an applicant's
previous employer, asking for a reference as if the applicant had
applied for a job.
</P>
<P>
   The company uses one of several corporate names when making such
inquiries. It sends the former employee a confidential report,
generally for a fee of $87.95. If negative comments are discovered,
(justified or not, it says) the company offers to ask the former
employer in a letter to stop passing on bad references to
prospective employers.
</P>
<P>
   When errors in records are found, said Deirdre Mulligan, a staff
counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington,
``the only way to correct records is to go back to the original
source of the information.'' At times, she said, that can be a
lengthy process.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the problem that background checks sometimes turn up
inaccurate information, employers have to try to balance their need
to screen job applicants with the rights of prospective employees.
The problems have increased with the growth of online
background-checking services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no easy solution,'' said Norman G. Magnuson, vice
president of public affairs for Associated Credit Bureaus, a
642-member trade association in Washington whose members generate
650 million credit reports a year, speaking about the growing
reliance on electronic databases. ``We're trying to integrate a new
delivery method for information, but maybe we're just not ready for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, of the Society for Human Resource Management, said:
``Employers can have all that data and still not take away a sense
of how a person will perform in the job.''
