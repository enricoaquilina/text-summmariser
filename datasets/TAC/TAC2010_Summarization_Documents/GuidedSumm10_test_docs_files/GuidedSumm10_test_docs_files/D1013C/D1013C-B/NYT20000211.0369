   On Nov. 15 last year, Philip Tsitseklis, a Greek tourist
shopping for sunglasses at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan, reported
noticing a clerk swipe his credit card twice _ once through the
cash register and once through a hand-held scanning device she had
taken from her pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-held device, a magnetic strip reader attached to a
palmtop computer, was used to collect and store credit card
numbers, according to local prosecutors. The clerk, quickly
arrested after the tourist notified a store manager, has been
charged with four felonies, and investigators are looking to see
whether other shoppers had similar experiences.
</P>
<P>
   As technology advances, criminals are finding new ways to steal
and exploit personal information _ identity fraud, as the practice
is known. Such crime claims at least 400,000 victims a year in the
United States _ and new laws, enforcement efforts and insurance
coverage are being used to combat it.
</P>
<P>
   (Bloomingdale's says the clerk was not an employee but a
representative of a company with which the chain does business.)
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no one is immune to identity fraud, not even John M.
Shalikashvili, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
whose Social Security number was snatched from a Web site last
fall, according to a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that it's a growing problem,'' said Jim
Bauer, assistant director of the Secret Service office of
investigations. ``It's the modern-day crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization in
San Diego, estimates that there will be 400,000 to 500,000 new
cases of identity fraud this year.
</P>
<P>
   But identity fraud remains difficult to track, tough to quantify
and challenging to prosecute. It can range from unauthorized use of
a credit card to the takeover of a person's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the Federal Trade Commission began offering a
toll-free number for consumers to report identity fraud
(877-IDTHEFT) and to receive help and advice. The line receives an
average of 400 calls a week, the agency says.
</P>
<P>
   As part of legislation that took effect in 1998, making identity
fraud a federal felony, the FTC is developing a new databank of
consumer complaints that will be shared with law enforcement
agencies nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the Treasury Department will gather federal, state
and local officials, corporate representatives, consumer advocates
and identity theft victims to examine other ways to curb the
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Identity fraud has long occurred through the stealing of mail,
purses and wallets or copies of credit reports. But thieves now
have many more means.
</P>
<P>
   The Bloomingdale's case was the first in New York to involve
credit card readers, according to Robert M. Morgenthau, the
Manhattan district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing new about credit card fraud,'' Morgenthau
said. ``What's new is the type of technology being used to commit
the crime. The lesson is that people have to be ever more vigilant
and protective. They'd be better off never to let their card out of
their sight.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Shalikashvili, his Social Security number, and those of
many other military officers, were published in the Congressional
Record in the mid-1990s, in connection with Senate approval of
their promotions. Afterwards, more than 4,900 names and numbers,
including those of many admirals and generals, were posted on a Web
site run by a group whose aim, prosecutors say, was to prove how
readily available these records are.
</P>
<P>
   Information from the Web site was used by at least three people
to open 273 credit card accounts in the names of the officers,
including Shalikashvili, and to establish 30 separate credit
accounts with Gateway Inc., the computer maker, according to
prosecutors who refused to be cited by name. Together, these
accounts were used to charge $200,000, the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fear is that there may be others doing the same thing with
this information,'' said Beth Moskow-Schnoll, an assistant United
States attorney in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   A new type of insurance, now offered in 25 states by the
Travelers Property Casualty Corp. in Hartford, covers some of the
expenses incurred by victims of identity fraud. The coverage, which
can be added to existing Travelers homeowners or renters policies
for $25 a year, provides reimbursement of up to $15,000 for each
instance of fraud, minus a $100 deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Covered expenses include lost wages of up to $500 a week for
four weeks, for taking time off from work to deal with the fraud;
legal fees; certain mailing costs; loan re-application fees; and
phone charges. The coverage includes identity fraud resulting from
Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at victims in real cases to see what the
circumstances were where people had to open up their wallets to
deal with this problem,'' said Robert Nighan, vice president of
Travelers Property Casualty. While the Fair Credit Billing Act
generally limits a consumer's liability for unauthorized credit
card charges to $50 a card, Nighan said the costs of undoing the
damage could be substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates, although acknowledging that the coverage may
provide peace of mind, otherwise question whether it should be
necessary. ``I don't think you should have to pay for your own
privacy or pay for your own identity theft protection,'' said Ed
Mierzwinski, consumer program director at the Public Interest
Research Group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the rise in such cases is that financial
institutions grant credit too readily, he said, adding, ``To me,
your bank or credit bureau should pay for it.''
