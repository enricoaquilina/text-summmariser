   It was supposed to be a quick business trip, a job interview at
the Brockton (Mass.) Veterans Administration Hospital, but when
Doug Mason paid a visit to the area in January, he entered a legal,
financial, and bureaucratic hell unlike anything he has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's mistake? He left his briefcase out of sight for about
five minutes. Here's what has happened since: His name has surfaced
as the chief suspect in a robbery case and is hazily connected to a
murder investigation. Money is missing. His credit history has been
stained. All the while, as he wonders what will go wrong next, one
uncaring bureaucrat shuffles his case off to the next.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, someone, or perhaps several people, stole Mason's
identity and ran roughshod over society. They also wrought havoc on
Mason's sense of self, and tarnished his good name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all consuming,'' he said last week from his house in Palm
Bay, Fla. ``There's a strong sense of helplessness.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mason, 34, a psychology doctoral candidate, first lost his
briefcase, he did what anyone might expect. He canceled credit
cards, got a new license, and continued on with his life.
</P>
<P>
   That was in January. His first sign of trouble didn't come until
he answered a call on April 6. Massachusetts State Police Trooper
Al Hunt was on the line, telling Mason that someone in the Boston
area had been using his name.
</P>
<P>
   First there was a cellular telephone account that was somehow
linked to a murder investigation, but neither Hunt nor anyone else
will tell Mason how. Last week, a credit bureau sent Mason a letter
detailing two credit card accounts that were opened at Filene's
Basement and charged to their maximum amount.
</P>
<P>
   When Mason called the store, he was told that the person with
the credit cards took a job at Filene's Basement using Mason's name
and Social Security number. A week and a half after that Doug Mason
was hired, he stole $1,500 and fled.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the real Doug Mason has been caught in a legal
quagmire. Hunt won't explain the murder link, and he hung up when I
asked him about it. As often happens in such cases, authorities
disputed jurisdiction and failed to investigate _ until Detective
Steven Blair of the Boston police launched a probe late last week.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, meanwhile, wonders whether police will knock on his door
and take him away from his wife and 5-year-old daughter. His fears
are not misplaced. In the age of computers and instant credit,
stolen identities have become an enormous and disastrous problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming more and more popular, assuming someone's
identity and committing crimes left and right,'' said Blair, who
specializes in investigating such crimes. Though the state enacted
a new law against identity theft last month, many authorities fear
lacks the teeth to be much of a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Joe Machado, an antiques dealer from Boston. A
man acquired Machado's identity last year and ran up thousands of
dollars in bills on newly acquired credit cards. The suspect tried
to run down two police officers with his car, which was found with
a stash of heroin in it. He gave police Machado's name and
information.
</P>
<P>
   That unleashed a torrent of misfortune. When the impostor
skipped a court appearance, police showed up at Machado's house.
The Registry revoked his license. He carried a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   ``My credit was destroyed,'' said Machado. ``I had to carry
special papers all the time. If I got stopped, the computer would
tell them I'm dealing drugs and defaulting. You never know what's
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The thieves operate without fear. One even stole the identity of
Kathy Curran, a reporter for WBZ-TV, whose face is regularly on
television in Boston. That particular thief had the same maiden
name as Curran, lifted her information from records at Beth Israel
Hospital in October, and had new credit cards mailed to an
abandoned house in Quincy, Mass. She charged nearly $5,000 to the
cards before she was caught, then was sentenced to just probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She still has all my information,'' Curran said. ``It's really
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in Florida, Mason still waits for the worst, wondering when
police might wrongly arrest him, when a credit application might be
turned down, when a potential employer might reject him because of
the mistaken criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever took the briefcase has a key to my house,'' he said.
``My wife's Social Security number was in that briefcase. My
address was in that briefcase.''
</P>
<P>
   What he wants back is simple: His own good name.
