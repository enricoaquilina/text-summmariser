   WASHINGTON _ Thieves have swiped personal data such as Social
Security numbers, birth dates and addresses for more than a decade
to gain access to bank accounts and credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   But now the crime of identity theft is becoming more complex as
rings of crooks use other people's personal data to open telephone
and other utility accounts, rent apartments, apply for loans, buy
cars, set up new businesses, and even declare bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Victims are often left with damaged credit ratings _ and
complicated paperwork to untangle their messy personal finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing much more varied and more sophisticated means by
which identities are being stolen and used in ways they weren't
used before,'' said James Johnson, undersecretary for enforcement
at the Treasury Department. ``The limit is as broad as the
imagination of the crook.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said it can take ``hundreds of hours of leg work,'' and
the help of lawyers to restore a victim's good name, not to mention
the toll it can take in emotional anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a person's good name has been stolen, it is not an
ordinary theft,'' Johnson said. ``It's not as if someone has stolen
the radio out of your car. It's taking the information that is most
private to you and exploiting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Identity swindlers frequently steal key data such as Social
Security numbers and birth dates from the mail or the trash, when
people discard documents. They also get it through the Internet, by
stealing wallets or credit card numbers, fraudulently obtaining
credit reports or getting personnel records from the workplace. The
number of identity theft victims is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration received more than 30,000
complaints about the misuse of Social Security numbers last year;
most of the complaints concerned identity theft. That is an
increase from about 11,000 complaints in 1998 and 7,868 complaints
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   An identity theft hotline established last year by the Federal
Trade Commission reports getting 400 calls a week. (The FTC hotline
is 877-438-4338.)
</P>
<P>
   Identify theft has brought huge complexity to Marvin Young, a
32-year-old San Francisco man who works as a clerk for an Italian
paper company.
</P>
<P>
   Young says he has spent $10,000 in lawyer's fees and thousands
of hours trying to salvage his credit rating since his Social
Security number was stolen in 1989. His troubles began when he
handed over his Social Security number and driver's license to rent
a room.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterwards, another man had obtained a copy of his
Mississippi birth certificate and opened credit cards in his name,
charging purchases worth $80,000 on the cards.
</P>
<P>
   The thief also has opened several checking accounts in Young's
name, an account at Montgomery Ward and has bought a car and a
condo in Pensacola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   When Young was stopped by police near Hayward, Calif., in 1997
for driving alone in a carpool lane, he was told there was a
warrant out for his arrest. The policewoman wouldn't tell Young
what the arrest warrant was for and detained him for an hour until
his employer verified that he had been a victim of identity theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's living a life like he's me,'' Young said. ``He would
start doing a fraud on me, then he would stop and I would get my
life together and my credit again Now I have bad credit, I can't
get the credit agencies to take this information off my credit
rating and stores don't believe I didn't do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is drafting legislation that
would restrict the sale of Social Security numbers, a key
ingredient in identity fraud, and their display on mailing labels
and other public documents.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary
Subcommittee of Terrorism, Technology and Government Information,
and Sens. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., and Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
introduced legislation that would restrict credit bureaus from
selling personal information such as Social Security numbers and
birth dates.
</P>
<P>
   It would require the credit bureaus to provide each citizen a
free credit report every year, investigate potential fraud and
alert potential creditors that the citizen has been the victim of
identity theft.
</P>
<P>
   If a credit card issuer is notified about a change of address of
the card owner, the issuer would be required to notify the owner at
both the original and the new address.
</P>
<P>
   That is intended to protect the credit card holder against a
swindler trying to hijack the card to another address. It sometimes
can take months before victims realize their personal information
has been stolen this way.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would authorize the Social Security Administration
to impose up to a $5,000 maximum fine for the misuse of a Social
Security number.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Darlene Hooley, D-Ore., who has sponsored a matching House
bill, says credit bureaus ``have a responsibility to help stop
fraud'' and that it is ``outrageous'' that they sell personal
information such as Social Security numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Mierzwinski, programs director at U.S. PIRG, a watchdog
consumer organization, says legislation is urgently needed
``because the crime has gotten so much bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it used to be that victims only had to clean up credit
card debt, which was a hassle but not devastating. Credit card
companies usually cover most of the charges that have been rung up
on a credit card by a thief.
</P>
<P>
   But Mierzwinksi said the ``mission creep'' of the crime,
especially in California, means victims have ``a real mess on their
hands.'' He notes that swindlers are even committing crimes in
other peoples' names using false IDs and are renting apartments in
a victim's name and then filing bankruptcy to stall eviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way, light years worse than stealing a credit card,''
Mierzwinski says.
</P>
<P>
   Mierzwinkski says Congress and state governments need to force
banks, credit bureaus and retailers to better verify the identities
of credit applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two states have passed laws since 1996 making identity
theft a crime. In October 1998, Congress passed legislation
sponsored by Kyl and Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., that made identity
theft a federal crime, punishable by fines and up to 15 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Givens, director, of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a
consumer information and privacy organization in San Diego, says
those laws have done little to stop the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crime is not going away,'' Givens said. ``The key to
reducing the crime is for the credit industry and for all entities
that use sensitive information like Social Security numbers to make
that information secure and keep it out of the hands of identity
thieves.''
