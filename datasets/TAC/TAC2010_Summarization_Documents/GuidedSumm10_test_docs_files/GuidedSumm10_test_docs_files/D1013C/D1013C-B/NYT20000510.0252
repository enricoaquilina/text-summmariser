COMMENTARY: DEFEND YOUR IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Stevens and his wife, Mary, have been ``going
through hell'' for three years, they testified to the House
subcommittee on social security this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always paid our bills on time and never defaulted on any
obligation,'' the retired Air Force officer, 72, told Congress, but
retirement plans were dashed ``when we discovered that our Social
Security numbers and names had been used to open 33 fraud accounts
with a total value of $113,000. Our credit had been destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The tale of their three-year harassment by credit bureaus and
banks _ primarily because their Social Security numbers had been
stolen _ can be multiplied by thousands. This epidemic of
``identity theft'' is spread by the government's shameful
acquiescence in the use of the Social Security numbers (SSN) held
by 227 million Americans as a kind of national ID card.
</P>
<P>
   It was never so intended. The purpose of the number was to track
earnings so that the Social Security Administration would know who
was entitled to what benefits. But in the late 1930s, Hitler's
Gestapo was demanding that Germans ``show us your papers''; fears
of that totalitarian trend led Americans rightly to insist that the
new cards be clearly marked ``Not for Identification.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from businesses seeking quick credit checks and
bureaucrats who place efficiency above personal freedom, that
prevention of privacy abuse was erased. An unthinking federal
government allowed the citizen's SSN to become the Medicare number,
bandied about doctor's offices and drugstores and insurance
companies, even emblazoned on the envelopes of mailings.
</P>
<P>
   With the onset of e-commerce, pressure on people to reveal their
private Social Security numbers has increased tenfold. Travel
agents coerce it out of customers as hurried ``proof'' of identity.
Banks regularly deny loans to customers who are good credit risks
if they dare to refuse to hand over the number coveted by
practitioners of ``target marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   But a number is not a person. A number, unlike a person, can
easily be kidnapped. When a number is stolen, or when an impostor
purchases your number from an ``information broker'' or the
``personal information industry''(euphemisms for e-snoops), your
life is not only an open book, but it can be made a Kafkaesque
hell, as the Stevenses testified.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that no law prevents anyone from buying or selling
your personal SSN without your consent? Or that discourages any
business from refusing to serve you unless you reveal the SSN that
the government professes ``may not be used for identification
purposes''?
</P>
<P>
   The piracy of our privacy, as well as the protection from the
theft of one's credit reputation, cries out for legislation. The
chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee holding these hearings,
Florida's Clay Shaw, says that no one proposal can stop this theft
of good names, ``but since Social Security numbers often represent
the entry point for ripoff artists and identity thieves, there's no
better place to start.'' The ranking Democrat, Bob Matsui, tells me
he agrees that ``something has to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Bills to do something protective have been introduced by the
House's four horsemen of privacy: Jerry Kleczka, Jim McDermott, Ed
Markey and Ron Paul. In the Senate, Judd Gregg took note of an
Internet stalker's use of an SSN to find and murder a New Hampshire
woman, and put forward a bill to outlaw the sale of an SSN without
the individual's consent. The Social Security inspector general
testified that ``there is no reason'' to allow such trafficking in
private information.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to see regular public exposure of businesses that
refuse services solely on the basis of a customer's refusal to
supply the SSN. And I'd close down the federal Parent Locator
Service; that was well intentioned to track down employees evading
child support obligations, but has become a national databank using
SSN's to monitor Americans' movements _ posing a danger to civil
liberty far greater than letting some dads be deadbeats.
</P>
<P>
   To vote in Congress to protect the SSN from being used as a
national ID card, representatives must first flash their voting
cards. And what do you suppose appears right beneath their names on
those cards? Their Social Security numbers.
