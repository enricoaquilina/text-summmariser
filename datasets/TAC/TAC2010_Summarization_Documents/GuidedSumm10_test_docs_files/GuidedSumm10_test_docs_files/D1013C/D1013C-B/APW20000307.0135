<HEADLINE> Identity Theft Cases Said on Rise  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the millions of Americans now wedded to
their computers for household purchases, banking and entertainment,
Maureen Mitchell seemed an unlikely target to have her identity
stolen through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the registered nurse from Ohio nor her husband bank on
the Net. They don't make cyber-purchases and both carefully protect
their credit information by getting all receipts when using a
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't enough. And only now, after an identity theft ring
purchased two vehicles, obtained bank loans and opened numerous
credit accounts at stores using her and her husband's identity,
Mitchell said the full extent of the damage to her financial
well-being isn't known.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know if other accounts are still outstanding. This
has a huge impact on your life,'' Mitchell told members of the
Senate Judiciary subcommittee on technology, terrorism and
government information Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was held to discuss the effectiveness of the
Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence law passed in 1998 to help
officials combat the growing problem of pilfered identities.
</P>
<P>
   Identity theft occurs when someone hijacks a consumer's personal
identifying information such as a name, address, credit card or
Social Security number and uses the information to open new charge
accounts or purchase merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   A recent General Accounting Office report said the number of
consumer inquiries to the fraud victimization department of Trans
Union, the credit bureau, increased from 35,235 in 1992 to 522,922
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Social Security Administration conducted 1153 social
security number misuse investigations in 1997 compared to just 305
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increase in inquiries, there is no comprehensive way
to tally the incidence of so-called identity fraud because it
encompasses a wide variety of illegal activities that can be part
of larger financial crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, a conviction for identity theft carries a
maximum 15 years jail sentence, a fine and forfeiture of any
personal property used to commit the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The law also mandates that the Federal Trade Commission assist
people have had their identities stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Az, who sponsored the bill, said the law seems
to be working and that in 1999, 1,350 people were charged under the
law and 644 people were sentenced. Of those sentenced, 407 entered
guilty pleas.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are few clearer violations of personal privacy than
actually having your identity stolen and used to commit a crime,''
Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell knows the pain firsthand. She said she has spent more
than 400 hours trying to clear her name and restore her credit.
</P>
<P>
   Though a suspect was arrested, Mitchell said neither she nor
authorities know exactly how her personal information was
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to know how it was accomplished,'' Mitchell said.
