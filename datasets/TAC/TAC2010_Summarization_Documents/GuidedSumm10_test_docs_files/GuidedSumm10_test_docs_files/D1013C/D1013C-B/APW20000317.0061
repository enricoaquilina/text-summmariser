<HEADLINE> Will Privacy Panel Stop New Laws?  </HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even as the push for new laws protecting the
privacy of consumers on the Internet appears to be picking up
speed, two congressmen want to create a commission to study privacy
issues for 18 months and hold at least 20 hearings across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of new federal privacy laws -- who are encouraged by
recent pronouncements of support from public polls and by some
lawmakers -- offered lukewarm support, even skepticism for the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Jim Moran, D-Va., this week
introduced a bill to form a 17-member national privacy commission
to study for up to 18 months questions surrounding Internet
privacy, identity theft and protections for health, medical and
financial records.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the panel would hold at least 20 public
hearings nationwide before submitting a report about privacy
threats that includes recommendations whether new laws are needed.
The commission was expected to cost about $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Clinton administration has urged U.S. companies to
regulate among themselves ways they protect consumer privacy on the
Internet, such as under programs run by the Better Business Bureau
or Truste, which audit companies that volunteer to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The industry fears mandatory privacy rules that could raise its
costs even in these earliest stages of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be your way or the government's way -- your
choice,'' warned Orson Swindle, a member of the Federal Trade
Commission, in a speech this week to Internet companies. He urged
companies to do a better job safeguarding the privacy of their
customer data and for executives to review their Web sites'
promises to protect that information.
</P>
<P>
   But amid increasing public concerns about the threat of privacy
violations made possible by new technologies, some lawmakers and
other government officials believe it increasingly likely that new
laws are inevitable -- possibly as early as this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole thing of Internet privacy is just going to
explode,'' Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, told a meeting this week of
the Consumer Federation of America. ''Within a very short time
we're going to have strong privacy protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said the national privacy commission he envisions
wouldn't prevent Congress from considering related proposals, and
it could issue interim reports on specific privacy questions before
the end of 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would not foreclose individual privacy legislation from
going forward,'' Hutchinson said. ''The privacy commission bill can
move forward singularly as the only privacy protection effort, or
it can move forward in a complimentary fashion with other privacy
bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of new privacy laws, who generally argue that the
industry's self-regulation hasn't proved effective, weren't
impressed. Some suggested the commission could be a delay tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact it's a study commission is the reason privacy
advocates are at best lukewarm,'' said Marc Rotenberg of the
Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center. ''It's a
little late in the day to have a study commission. The mood in the
country right now is in support of some action.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If this should really be called the privacy procrastination
act, that's exactly what we don't need,'' said Jason Catlett of
Junkbusters Corp., a New Jersey-based privacy advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said that won't be the commission's tact.
</P>
<P>
   ''They yearn for a faster track, and I'm in sympathy for that,''
he said. ''As time goes on, political realism will set in. It's
difficult to get consensus on some of the individual (privacy)
efforts.''
