A Symptom of FDA Laxity

Merck &amp; Co. said its surprise decision Thursday to withdraw the
arthritis drug Vioxx -- used by about 2 million people worldwide --
was driven by recent evidence that the drug's adverse side effects
outweighed any potential benefits. But that wasn't really news. Though
the new study was more comprehensive than past research because it
looked at patients over the course of three years, research since
November 2000 has suggested that those who take Vioxx face a heart
attack risk four to five times greater than those who take older,
equally effective arthritis treatments such as ibuprofen and naproxen.
</P>
<P>
So why is Merck recalling the drug now? One can only speculate, but
it may have less to do with side effects outweighing benefits than
with legal liabilities outweighing profits. Merck faces several
lawsuits, including a class action filed Thursday alleging the company
made false and misleading statements about Vioxx's safety. Whatever
the company's motives, its decision to withdraw Vioxx should cast
scrutiny on at least two problems inherent in the nation's system for
assessing and monitoring drug safety.
</P>
<P>
The first is misleading ads. Vioxx and a similar drug from Pfizer
Inc., Celebrex, have been touted as ``super-aspirins'' in numerous TV
commercials that have downplayed their known cardiovascular risks.
Such commercials show how far the Food and Drug Administration has
slipped in enforcing its own rules. When the agency determines a drug
company has made a misleading ad, it first issues a warning letter,
then imposes a fine if the ad is not pulled. But the number of warning
letters has dropped precipitously since the Bush administration took
power, from 82 in 2000 to 24 in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The second problem is the nation's almost exclusive reliance on
drug companies to police the safety and efficacy of their own drugs.
Although the FDA requires drug makers to demonstrate the superiority
of their medications to placebos before they can release them, the
agency lets drug companies monitor their own products' dangers after
they've reached the shelves.
</P>
<P>
The FDA could help solve these problems not only by enforcing its
own rules but by requiring doctors and hospitals to report ``adverse
events'' when patients use drugs. Big government payers such as
Medicaid or Medicare could pay only for expensive new drugs that are
demonstrably superior to older, cheaper ones.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of Vioxx caused Merck's market value to sink by
almost $27 billion. The FDA's current hands-off approach to drug
companies doesn't just endanger consumers, it hurts investors -- who
shouldn't be caught by surprise over a drug whose dangers have long
been clear.
