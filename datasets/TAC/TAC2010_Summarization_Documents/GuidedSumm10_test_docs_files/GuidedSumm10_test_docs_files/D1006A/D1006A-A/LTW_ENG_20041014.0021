Evaluating Vioxx

The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post:

In a certain sense, Merck &amp; Co.'s decision to cease selling Vioxx,
its best-selling painkiller, demonstrates how the peculiarly American
combination of government regulation and private-sector competition
can, serendipitously, sometimes work well. Vioxx was approved after
trials held under the auspices of the Food and Drug Administration
showed it to be effective (which it was). After some initial evidence
that the drug might be linked to cardiac disease, the FDA required
Merck to attach an additional warning (which was justified). Merck,
which knew Vioxx was in competition with similar drugs, then conducted
further trials, largely to find out if Vioxx could be legitimately
recommended for other conditions. Through this process, Merck
discovered that Vioxx did indeed carry a small but unacceptable risk
of cardiac problems when used for longer than 18 months. Competition
combined with regulation forced the drug off the market. And if courts
determine that Merck was negligent, the company will pay a heavy price
in compensation.

On its own, this incident does not make a good argument for more
stringent FDA approval procedures. Extensive and lengthy pre-approval
testing of the sort that would have kept Vioxx -- and all other drugs --
under examination for years ultimately would have harmed more patients
than it would have helped. As hundreds of patients' groups can attest,
there are high costs when the FDA does not approve drugs quickly, even
drugs with serious side effects. People die every day waiting for new
treatments.

But the Vioxx withdrawal should inspire some sharper thought about
what happens to drugs once they have been approved, and whether the
FDA should have the authority to mandate more thorough, ongoing,
long-term testing. This is a safety issue, but also an economic one.
Vioxx is a new-generation painkiller, one of several that are (or
were) prescribed instead of aspirin or other over-the-counter drugs.
Vioxx was easier on the stomach than aspirin, but it cost more. Did
the 20 million Americans who used the drug since its launch in 1999
really have to spend that extra money and, as it turns out, incur a
slight extra risk? Or were they persuaded to do so by Merck's
advertising?
</P>
<P>
According to studies carried out by the Kaiser Family Foundation
and others, the pharmaceutical industry's advertising encourages some
people to consult doctors, which is a good thing, particularly for
those who may not have known they have, say, high cholesterol or blood
pressure. But ads also persuade people to spend money on unnecessary
drugs, which is a bad thing for their health and for insurance
premiums. The solution is not a total ban on advertising, as some
suggest, but rather more clinical trials of drugs, aimed specifically
at determining effectiveness as well as long-term safety. It is in the
insurance industry's interest, the FDA's interest and the federal
government's interest -- because the federal government is a major
provider of health insurance -- either to require drug companies to
conduct such comparative tests or to set up a neutral agency to do so.
If there is a lesson to be learned from the Vioxx withdrawal, surely
it is the need for renewed attention to evidence-based medicine and
evidence-based drug prescription as well.
