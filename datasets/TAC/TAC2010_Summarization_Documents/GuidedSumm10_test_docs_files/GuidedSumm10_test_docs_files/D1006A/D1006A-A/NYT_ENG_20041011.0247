SELLING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO THE CONSUMER

When Emily Martin was hospitalized for emergency gallbladder surgery
last summer, her doctors found that she had also had acid reflux,
causing erosion of her esophagus.

"My stomach was very unsettled," said Martin, a 26-year-old mother in
Oradell, N.J. So she asked her doctor for Nexium, the "purple pill"
that is the nation's most widely advertised prescription drug. "I saw
the commercial and they showed people talking about immediate and
miracle relief," she said.

The issue of drug advertising directly aimed at consumers was thrust
into the news recently when Merck withdrew its arthritis painkiller
Vioxx from the market, citing studies indicating a risk of heart
attacks or strokes. Critics noted the role that advertising and
marketing had played a role in the drug's being widely prescribed to
patients who might do just as well with ibuprofen or other
inexpensive over-the-counter remedies.

Vioxx, whatever its safety risks, was hardly unique as a prescription
drug that became a best seller on the strength of advertising aimed
directly at consumers. In the seven years since the FDA lifted
longstanding strictures against such ads, prescription drug
advertising has grown into a $3.8 billion-a-year business. And the
FDA says that, despite the controversy accompanying the withdrawal of
Vioxx, it has no plans to place new curbs on such ads.

Nexium is typical of the brand-building trend. No one is arguing that
the drug poses serious health risks, beyond a slight chance of side
effects like headaches and flatulence. Despite clear beneficiaries
like Emily Martin, though, many medical experts say most patients
would do just as well with various cheaper, over-the-counter remedies
for indigestion and heartburn, including AstraZeneca's own Prilosec
-- a chemically similar predecessor that no longer requires a
prescription and sells for $40 a month or less.

<P>
"Nexium is no more effective than Prilosec," said Dr. Sharon Levine,
an executive with Kaiser Permanente, the United States' largest
health maintenance organization. "I'm surprised anyone has ever
written a prescription for Nexium."
</P>

AstraZeneca, a British-based company, said that it was unfazed by the
critics and that the Vioxx backlash would have no effect on its own
consumer advertising for Nexium or other drugs. "We're moving forward
undeterred," said Jim Coyne, a spokesman for the company. "We've got
adequate support for what we say in the ads."
</P>
<P>
And an FDA spokeswoman, Crystal Rice, said late last week, "There are
no additional changes expected at this time in light of the Vioxx
withdrawal."
