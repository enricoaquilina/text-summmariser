PFIZER WARNS OF RISKS FROM ITS PAINKILLER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pfizer Inc. warned doctors on Friday that one of its bestselling
painkillers, Bextra, might increase the risk of a heart attack or
stroke in coronary artery bypass surgery patients. The announcement
comes just two weeks after Merck pulled its painkiller, Vioxx, which
is in the same class of drugs as Bextra, from the market because a
study showed that the risk of heart attacks doubled for patients who
had taken Vioxx for 18 months or longer.
</P>
<P>
Pfizer said a clinical study involving more than 1,500 patients
showed that those who had undergone bypass surgery and had taken
Bextra intravenously and orally were at higher risk for heart
attacks. An initial study last year raised similar concerns in the
same kinds of patients.
</P>
<P>
The painkillers known as COX-2 inhibitors, which include Bextra and
Vioxx, have been widely prescribed to people suffering with
arthritis. Merck's decision to withdraw Vioxx cast suspicion on the
safety of drugs in that class. Now Pfizer's warning is sure to fuel
the debate about the overall safety of these drugs for all patients.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Food and Drug Administration said Friday that a
meeting about these issues will occur in January. Regulators abroad
have also indicated plans to review COX-2 drugs.
</P>
<P>
Pfizer said it is already conducting research into whether Bextra
increases the risk of heart attacks in people taking the drug for
chronic pain. The company also issued a warning on Friday about an
extremely rare and potentially fatal skin reaction to Bextra. In
addition to Bextra, Pfizer also makes Celebrex, the best-selling
COX-2 drug on the market. Bextra is the company's new and
faster-acting version of Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
Pfizer says there is no evidence that its drugs have problems similar
to Vioxx because they are chemically different. Although Bextra is
not approved for use for surgery patients, Pfizer said that its
studies had shown that general surgery patients -- as opposed to
bypass patients -- were not at higher risk for heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
But some doctors say this group of drugs may work in a way that
increases the risk of heart problems for some patients, and they
point to this latest information as additional reason for concern.
