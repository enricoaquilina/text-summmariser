Other drugs besides Vioxx may raise heart risks, report suggests
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Momentum was growing for a fresh look at the safety of Celebrex and
other pain relievers as key researchers, a congressman and European
regulators said they feared such drugs might raise the risk of heart
problems like those blamed on the arthritis medicine Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
Heavily advertised as an arthritis drug, Vioxx was pulled from the
market last week after its maker said a study showed it doubled the
risk of heart attack and stroke. But the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration said similar prescription drugs were safe.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the European Medicines Agency in London announced it
would review all drugs of this type. And researchers writing in the
New England Journal of Medicine voiced their concerns as well with
such drugs as Pfizer's popular Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
The medical journal published two reports on the issue Wednesday on
the Internet _ more than two weeks ahead of their planned print
publication _ to help inform doctors and patients considering whether
to stop using the drugs.
</P>
<P>
Studies done five years ago when Celebrex and Merck &amp; Co.'s Vioxx
were approved suggest that the same mechanism that inhibits
inflammation and makes the drugs easier on the stomach than
traditional painkillers also blocks a substance that prevents heart
problems, according to Dr. Garret FitzGerald, a University of
Pennsylvania cardiologist. FitzGerald led the studies, which were
designed by him but funded by the drug companies.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this is a class effect," he said, meaning that the problem
also applies to Celebrex and Pfizer's newer, similar drug, Bextra,
which remain on the market.
</P>
<P>
He called on the FDA to change its advice to patients and doctors to
reflect the new safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
Pfizer's medical director, Dr. Gail Cawkwell, insisted that its drugs
are safe.
</P>
<P>
"The data for Celebrex is robust and exceeds, in the length of
patients in studies and in the size of studies, the data Vioxx has,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
She called FitzGerald's contention "an interesting theory," but said,
"there is no evidence" of increased risk of heart problems among the
75 million Americans who have taken Celebrex. Long-term studies are
not yet available on Bextra, which was approved in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Celebrex is the 10th most popular drug in the United States, with
annual sales of $2.7 billion, up 5 percent in a year, according to
IMS Health, a company that tracks drug industry trends.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report also released by the medical journal, Dr. Eric
Topol of the Cleveland Clinic chastises the FDA for not requiring
Merck to do studies investigating heart problems with Vioxx when
hints of them first appeared years ago, and for allowing the company
to blitz consumers with TV ads touting the drug.
</P>
<P>
Vioxx was the largest prescription drug withdrawal in history, "but
had the many warning signs along the way been heeded, such a debacle
could have been prevented," Topol wrote. "Neither Merck nor the FDA
fulfilled its responsibilities to the public ... I believe there
should be a full Congressional review of this case."
</P>
<P>
An FDA official said the agency would have no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
When Merck voluntarily withdrew Vioxx, FDA officials said heart
problems were unique to that drug and that the mechanism underlying
them wasn't known.
</P>
<P>
But FitzGerald and colleagues published two studies in 1999 and
another in 2001 suggesting that by selectively blocking one of the
two substances called prostaglandins that lead to inflammation, these
so-called cox-2 inhibitors were sparing the stomach at the expense of
the heart.
</P>
<P>
"There's a good prostaglandin and a bad prostaglandin as far as the
heart is concerned," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Suppressing both, as older painkillers like aspirin and other
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS do, helps the heart.
But shutting down just the "good" one raises the risk of high blood
pressure, hardening of the arteries and clotting, he reports.
</P>
<P>
FitzGerald also challenged Pfizer's contention that no science shows
increased risk from Celebrex. The original report from one study
involving Celebrex found no increased risk of heart problems, but it
covered only six months of a year-long study, according to the
cardiologist. A look at the full data "reveals signs of increased
cardiovascular risk," he writes.
</P>
<P>
The medical journal will publish the new reports in its Oct. 21 print
edition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Republican Congressman Tom Davis of Virginia, who chairs
the House Government Reform Committee, sent a letter to FDA's acting
commissioner, Dr. Lester Crawford, giving him two weeks to answer
questions about how FDA tracks problems with drug safety, how it
dealt with issues surrounding Vioxx, and whether the agency will
study potential risks in similar drugs.
</P>
<P>
"In light of Merck's withdrawal of Vioxx from the market and other
recent news stories examining FDA's review of the safety and efficacy
of anti-depressant drug use by children, I am concerned whether FDA
has been sufficiently aggressive in monitoring drug safety," Davis
wrote.
