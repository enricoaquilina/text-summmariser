U.S. drug agency accused of silencing scientist's early Vioxx
warnings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration silenced one of its drug experts who
raised safety concerns weeks before Merck &amp; Co. yanked the
blockbuster drug Vioxx due to increased risks for heart attack and
strokes, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. David J. Graham, associate director for science in the FDA Drug
Center's Office of Drug Safety, told Senate investigators he faced
stiff resistance within the regulatory agency to his findings.
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Graham described an environment where he was 'ostracized,'
'subjected to veiled threats' and 'intimidation,'" Republican Sen.
Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, said in a statement after Finance Committee
investigators interviewed the researcher Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Graham told The Associated Press that Grassley's characterization was
accurate. Raising safety concerns within the agency is "extremely
difficult," the 20-year employee said, declining further comment.
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, the FDA said it "values open discussion and
frank exchange about scientific and medical issues" and subjects its
scientists to "more rigorous" scrutiny than typical scientific peer
reviews.
</P>
<P>
The Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of
Congress, already has been asked to look into whether the FDA muzzled
another staffer who linked antidepressants to raising the odds of
children suffering suicidal tendencies. When Merck voluntarily pulled
Vioxx from the market on Sept. 30, the GAO was asked to roll the
FDA's handling of that controversy into its inquiry.
</P>
<P>
That report is not expected for months. Grassley's committee is one
of three in Congress also scrutinizing the FDA's actions.
</P>
<P>
A "picture is emerging of an agency that can't see the forest for the
trees," Grassley said. "Merck knew it had trouble on its hands and
took action. At the same time, instead of acting as a public
watchdog, the Food and Drug Administration was busy challenging its
own expert and calling his work 'scientific rumor.'"
</P>
<P>
Graham was lead author on a research project that studied the records
of 1.39 million Kaiser Permanente patients, including 40,405 treated
with Pfizer's Celebrex and 26,748 treated with Vioxx. The study found
that high doses of Vioxx, known as rofecoxib, tripled risks of heart
attacks and sudden cardiac death.
</P>
<P>
The research team's original conclusion said that high doses of Vioxx
should not be prescribed or used.
</P>
<P>
Graham, scheduled to present those findings in late August during an
epidemiology conference in France, said he ran into resistance when
the FDA reviewed his abstract.
</P>
<P>
"I think the recommendation about high dose rofecoxib is unnecessary
and particularly problematic since FDA funded this study and David's
travel to France to present it," Anne E. Trontell, deputy director of
the FDA's Office of Drug Safety, wrote in an Aug. 12 e-mail.
</P>
<P>
The internal e-mail exchange was released by Grassley.
</P>
<P>
In the e-mail, Trontell suggested that Graham defer his presentation
in favor of a journal article so dissenting scientists _ including
within the FDA _ could comment.
</P>
<P>
She also said Merck should be alerted before the findings became
public "so they can be prepared for extensive media attention that
this will likely provoke."
</P>
<P>
Others within the agency suggested Graham's conclusion was too
strongly worded, given the FDA had not added such warnings to Vioxx
labels.
</P>
<P>
"I've gone about as far as I can without compromising my deeply held
conclusions about this safety question," Graham replied in an Aug. 13
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
The FDA said such discussions are typical before scientific findings
are published.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion Graham presented in France was revised: "This and
other studies cast serious doubt on the safety" of Vioxx doses higher
than 25 mg. per day.
</P>
<P>
The FDA said that Graham decided to revise his abstract conclusion.
"He did so voluntarily," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In testimony before a congressional panel in mid-September, Andrew
Mosholder, an FDA epidemiologist, said his bosses asked him to soften
recommendations about antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
Mosholder's analysis pointed to increased suicidal thoughts and
behaviors among children taking antidepressants well before federal
advisers pushed for strident warnings on the drugs. He suggested
preferential use of Prozac, the only drug approved to treat depressed
children and _ according to his review _ the one with the lowest
risk.
</P>
<P>
His supervisors within the FDA told him to suggest that children use
such medications "with caution," Mosholder told the Congressional
panel.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Paul Seligman, acting director of the FDA's Office of Drug
Safety, said the agency did not pressure Mosholder to change his
conclusion.
