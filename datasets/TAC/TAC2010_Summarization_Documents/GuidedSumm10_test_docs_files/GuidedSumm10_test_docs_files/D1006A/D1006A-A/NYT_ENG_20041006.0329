VIOXX RECALL TURNS EYES TO CELEBREX

<P>
Less than a week after Merck &amp; Co. yanked its popular Vioxx
arthritis drug off the market, the New England Journal of Medicine
voiced strong concerns Wednesday about the safety of Pfizer's
bestselling Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the medical journal, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, chief of
pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania, said studies suggest
the same mechanism that makes the drugs easier on the stomach than
traditional painkillers also blocks a substance that prevents heart
problems.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this is a class effect," he said, meaning the problem that
caused Vioxx to be removed also could apply to Celebrex and Pfizer's
newer and similar drug, Bextra.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Medicines Agency in London announced it would
review drugs similar to Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
And a congressman requested the U.S. Food and Drug Adminstration
answer questions about the medications used to treat arthritis,
diagnosed in more than 49 million people.
</P>
<P>
Pfizer said both Celebrex and Bextra will remain on the market and
that there's no reason they shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
Company spokeswoman Maryann Caprino described FitzGerald's article as
"an interesting hypothesis" but said that "in terms of the real
world, we totally disagree."
</P>
<P>
The FDA said last week after Vioxx was withdrawn that the problems
were unique to that drug. But FitzGerald suggested that by
selectively blocking one of the two substances called prostaglandins
that lead to inflammation, these Cox-2 inhibitors were sparing the
stomach at the expense of the heart.
</P>
<P>
Dr. W. Hayes Wilson, chief of rheumatology at Piedmont Hospital in
Atlanta, urged people taking the drugs not to panic. He said he sees
no reason for people using Celebrex to stop.
</P>
<P>
"We all take reasonable risks in our lives," the physician said.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, FitzGerald published research "revealing a mechanism"
in both Vioxx and Celebrex that could "predispose people . . . to the
risk of heart attack or stroke," he said in an interview. "Over the
years, evidence has slowly accumulated consistent with that
hypothesis."
</P>
<P>
Merck officials said last week its latest research showed an
increased risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular complications
in patients who took Vioxx for at least 18 months.
</P>
<P>
FDA urged to weigh in
</P>
<P>
Vioxx, Celebrex and Bextra are the only three drugs in a class known
as Cox-2 inhibitors. The Cox-2 inhibitors cause fewer
gastrointestinal side effects, including upset stomach, heartburn and
ulcers, than other pain-relieving drugs.
</P>
<P>
Merck took the drastic step of pulling Vioxx because its research
showed it caused increased risk of heart attack. The drugmaker's
colon cancer study of 2,600 people was designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of the standard 25-milligram dose in preventing a
recurrence of colon polyps. But the study was halted when it
indicated a heightened risk of cardiovascular complications.
</P>
<P>
FitzGerald said the Food and Drug Administration "has a
responsibility to provide informed, unbiased information rapidly to
advise doctors and their patients as to how to respond to the
withdrawal of Vioxx."
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, that information has come almost entirely from Merck
and Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
"The question for the FDA is whether there should be a general
warning, particularly for patients who are at high risk of
cardiovascular disease," the doctor said. "I'm trying to prompt
guidance from an unbiased source, and it should come urgently."
</P>
<P>
The FDA had no comment Wednesday on the report.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, Republican chairman of the House
Government Reform Committee, sent a letter to FDA's acting
commissioner, Dr. Lester Crawford, giving him two weeks to answer
questions about how FDA tracks problems with drug safety, how it
dealt with issues surrounding Vioxx and whether the agency will study
potential risks in similar drugs.
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned whether FDA has been sufficiently aggressive in
monitoring drug safety," Davis said.
</P>
<P>
Along with the FitzGerald piece, The New England Journal of Medicine
also posted a second article on the Internet, two weeks ahead of
scheduled publication, signaling a more immediate concern.
</P>
<P>
The second article in the medical journal, by Dr. Eric Topol of the
Cleveland Clinic, criticizes the FDA for not requiring Merck to do
studies investigating heart problems with Vioxx even though hints of
danger appeared years ago. Topol also criticized the FDA for letting
Merck blitz consumers with TV ads pushing the drug.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven million prescriptions have been written for Celebrex
since 1999, Caprino said. Celebrex earned $1.5 billion in the first
six months of this year, she said. By contrast, Vioxx made $2.5
billion for Merck last year.
</P>
<P>
Celebrex and Vioxx have become household names in recent years. Rich
Tomaselli of Advertising Age Magazine said Merck spent $78 million
advertising Vioxx last year, compared to $96 million for Celebrex,
the 10th most popular drug in the country. Long-term studies on
Bextra, which was approved by the FDA in 2001, are not yet available.
</P>
<P>
Wilson at Piedmont Hospital pointed out that there are alternatives
to such medicines, like weight loss and exercise prescribed by a
therapist. "Most people want a pill to make them better," he said.
"But there are other things they can learn that are
nonpharmacological."
</P>
<P>
He thought the concerns, however, would result in more conversations
between doctors and patients. "I think it's good we are looking at
safety," Wilson said. "But we need to understand that anything strong
enough to help you is potentially strong enough to have a side
effect."
</P>
<P>
For people too worried about the risks to continue taking
prescription medications, he suggested over-the-counter drugs like
Tylenol, at least until they have time to consult with their doctor.
</P>
<P>
"I did have a patient who said, 'I've heard about Vioxx, I hear
Celebrex is next.' Then I gave her the facts," he said. "(And) I
offered one of the older anti-inflammatories, and she said, 'I think
I'd rather stay on Celebrex.' "
