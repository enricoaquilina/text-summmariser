FDA IGNORED EARLIER WARNINGS OF VIOXX'S DANGERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON

<P>
Seven weeks before Merck &amp; Co. pulled the arthritis drug Vioxx
off the market because of safety concerns, federal drug regulators
downplayed the significance of scientific findings citing the
increased risks, documents released Thursday show.
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Graham, associate director for science in the drug safety
division of the Food and Drug Administration, by early August had
notified his supervisors that a study of Vioxx showed patients on the
starting dose had 50 percent greater risk of cardiac arrest than
those on competitor Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
Graham planned to present the study Aug. 25, but he immediately hit
resistance from his supervisors, who said they were too preliminary.
They recommended that Graham's findings either be submitted to a
medical journal for a peer review or presented beside an alternative
FDA opinion.
</P>
<P>
E-mails released Thursday show John Jenkins, director of the Office
of New Drugs, on Aug. 13 said Graham's findings include "pretty
strong language." He goes on to suggest that Graham rework the study
to say "something like 'This and other studies suggest an increased
risk of (acute myocardial infarction with (Vioxx) use and should be
considered by prescribers when making individual treatment
decisions."
</P>
<P>
Graham presented his findings in France Aug. 25, but already had
encountered the resistance from supervisors.
</P>
<P>
The drug was not pulled at that point. Merck removed Vioxx from sale
Sept. 28 after seeing an increased risk of "serious cardiovascular
events," the FDA said, including heart attacks and strokes. Graham
submitted a revised study to the FDA Sept. 30. The FDA's announcement
on Sept. 30 did not include the 50 percent higher risk data.
</P>
<P>
The FDA said it followed its standard review process.
</P>
<P>
"As a scientific agency, FDA values open discussion and frank
exchange about scientific and medical issues," the agency said in a
statement. After the presentation in France, Graham discussed the
issue with his supervisor, the statement said. "After that
discussion, it was Dr. Graham's decision to revise the abstract. He
did so voluntarily."
</P>
<P>
E-mails suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
Graham responded to his supervisor's suggested revisions in an Aug.
13 e-mail that: "I've gone about as far as I can without compromising
my deeply-held conclusions about this safety question. I've also
shared with you the perspectives of my co-authors and I think it's
safe to say they share these same conclusions."
</P>
<P>
A senior Republican senator who released the e-mails said the case
was another example of a pattern by the FDA. He compared it to the
FDA last February of not allowing another doctor to present his
findings that antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal behavior
in children.
</P>
<P>
"As my investigative staff continues looking into how the Food and
Drug Administration handles drug safety issues, particularly with
antidepressants and Vioxx, a picture is emerging of an agency that
can't see the forest for the trees," said Sen. Charles Grassley,
R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate's Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
Graham told Senate investigators that he believed the FDA was trying
to block publication of his findings noting the higher risk.
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Graham described an environment where he was 'ostracized,'
'subjected to veiled threats' and 'intimidation,' " Grassley's office
said.
