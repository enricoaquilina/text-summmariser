WITH VIOXX GONE, NOW WHAT DO WE DO?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drug companies rushing to fill the vacuum left by Merck &amp; Co.'s
withdrawal of its best-selling arthritis drug Vioxx are flooding the
airwaves with competing advertising claims that are bewildering many
patients.
</P>
<P>
Over-the-counter pain-relief competitors like Advil, Aleve, and
Tylenol have turned up the volume on TV, radio, and in print
advertising that speaks directly to Vioxx fears in an attempt to grab
a larger slice of the market. Pfizer Inc., the maker of two competing
prescription drugs that are in the same class as Vioxx -- Celebrex
and Bextra -- also has launched a big ad campaign. Pfizer is avoiding
any specific reference to Vioxx while combating fears among patients
and doctors that its drugs may cause similar problems to Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
The blitz of conflicting ads can be overwhelming to many of the 20
million former Vioxx users forced to switch, and many other arthritis
sufferers who are wondering what to do, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
"It adds to their confusion. Patients feel anxious," said Dr. Eileen
Winston, a rheumatologist in Framingham, Mass. who is one of many
doctors who say they are spending significant amounts of time
explaining alternatives to scared patients. To save time, Winston
said, she has resorted to addressing groups of patients in her
waiting room about the pros and cons of competing treatments.
</P>
<P>
Among Winston's patients is 68-year-old Mary Allen of Marlborough,
who said she was taking Celebrex for a swollen, painful knee, and it
worked. "When I heard about this Vioxx scare, I just took myself
right off it," she said. "Now, I don't know what I will take."
</P>
<P>
She has begun exploring alternative therapies, including an herbal
concoction she ordered from Australia. She is also considering
acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
Merck threw the market for arthritis pain drugs into chaos when it
voluntarily removed Vioxx from circulation. Vioxx belonged to a class
of drugs called Cox-2 inhibitors. Cox-2s were widely embraced after
their introduction in the 1990s as powerful pain relievers without
the potential gastrointestinal side effects of traditional pain
remedies.
</P>
<P>
But after fending off warnings for years, Merck said one of its own
clinical trials showed the drug elevated patients' risk of stroke and
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Merck's action raised fears about the Cox-2s, Celebrex and Bextra.
These drugs remain on the market in the absence of any evidence
linking them to heart attacks and strokes. Pfizer is even seeking to
strengthen its Celebrex brand with a fresh round of television and
print advertising. A print ad shows a cartoon character swatting a
tennis ball after treating an inflamed elbow with the drug and says,
"Over-the-counter pills may not always be what you need."
</P>
<P>
Pfizer said the new campaign was under development for months, well
before the Vioxx flameout. The advertisements are meant to encourage
Americans to see their doctor, said Pfizer spokeswoman Michal
Fishman. "It's really about making sure that people have the
motivation to talk to their doctor, now more than ever," she said.
</P>
<P>
The company also said it will launch a clinical trial involving 4,000
patients next year that will test whether Celebrex actually helps
prevent heart attacks and strokes. Results are supposed to be
available in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least three competing and less expensive
over-the-counter drugs, Advil, Aleve, and Tylenol, are directly
trying to fill the Vioxx gap, too. A new ad slogan for Tylenol
Arthritis Pain Extended Relief, marketed by a division of Johnson
&amp; Johnson, sums up the approach: "Don't let the recent news about
your arthritis medicine stop you from treating your arthritis pain."
</P>
<P>
"They are all playing off this safety issue right now," said Thani
Jambulingam, chairman of the pharmaceutical marketing program at
Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
In another marketing twist, TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. is
offering consumers a free, seven-day supply of NapraPAC, a package
that includes a prescription Naprosyn pain pill (with the same active
ingredient as Aleve) alongside a tablet of prescription Prevacid
antacid to ward off stomach damage.
</P>
<P>
"Arthritis pain relief your stomach can live with," says the NapraPAC
website.
</P>
<P>
Several rheumatologists said the Vioxx withdrawal is a good lesson
that just because a drug is heavily advertised and prescribed does
not make it a good choice.
</P>
<P>
"Merck had done us a wonderful service," said Dr. Anne Sigsbee, a
rheumatologist affiliated with Cape Cod Healthcare. "This makes it
easier when people come in clutching a print ad or talking about a
television ad, saying 'Isn't it great?' We can now allude to this
moment and say, 'Just because it's advertised doesn't make it good.'
"
</P>
<P>
Sigsbee and other doctors said that the Vioxx withdrawal also
presents an opportunity for a pain-relief reality check.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good time for doctors and patients to re-explore why you
are taking these medications in the first place," said Dr. Don
Goldenberg, chief of rheumatology at Newton-Wellesley Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Goldenberg's office telephoned 350 patients in the days after the
Vioxx withdrawal and advised them to switch to another form of pain
relief.
</P>
<P>
Goldenberg said he wrote new prescriptions for Celebrex for some
patients, while some others came into the office for more in-depth
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Goldenberg is among doctors who believe all Cox-2 inhibitors carry
some cardiovascular risk, despite assertions from Pfizer that
Celebrex and Bextra are fine. But he said the risks can be minimized
by limiting its use to patients whose cardiovascular systems are
strong.
</P>
<P>
Several stock analysts who follow drug companies said physicians will
switch patients to Celebrex in the short term.
</P>
<P>
"Celebrex is picking up some of the slack, but the whole Cox-2 market
can be expected to continue to shrink," said Viren Mehta, managing
member of Mehta Partners LLC in New York. "The concerns about side
effects are real and intense."
</P>
<P>
Down the road, he predicted, doctors and patients will return in
larger numbers to the tried-and-true over-the-counter medications.
</P>
<P>
"Marketing hype has been successful in creating extraordinary demand
for the Cox-2 class," said Mehta.
</P>
<P>
But Donna Allen, a 50-year-old technology recruiter from Berlin,
Mass. (and no relation to Mary Allen), said she is sticking with
Celebrex as long as she can.
</P>
<P>
She said it takes care of the debilitating symptoms of her rheumatoid
arthritis, which make daily tasks like turning a doorknob or her
car's ignition key a painful ordeal.
</P>
<P>
"You worry about damage to your cardiovascular system every time you
eat a cheeseburger, too," she said. "In the meantime, I'm pain free."
