FDA to Strengthen Reviews of Drugs' Side Effects
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Responding to continuing criticism that it mishandled
internal warnings that the painkiller Vioxx had deadly side effects
and that antidepressants were being misprescribed for children, the
Food and Drug Administration announced Friday that it would strengthen
its system for reviewing the safety of drugs already on the market.
</P>
<P>
Without saying that the agency had done anything wrong, acting
Commissioner Lester Crawford outlined a series of steps the agency
will take to become more aggressive about responding to reports of
potentially harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
The steps include include establishing an internal program to
ensure that the views of dissenting scientists are heard, a formal
request to the National Academy of Sciences for a study of the
agency's safety monitoring procedures, and a renewed, nationwide
search for a new director of the Office of Drug Safety. The position
has been vacant for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
``We don't always understand the full magnitude of a drug's risks
before it goes on the market,'' said Steven Galson, acting director of
the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a teleconference
on the new initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Galson, however, rejected criticisms that the Vioxx and
antidepressant episodes -- where FDA scientists accused superiors of
suppressing warnings about the drugs -- reflected a major problem with
the culture of the agency.
</P>
<P>
``It's a rarity,'' he said of the highly publicized disagreements.
``It doesn't represent the culture, so we don't really think there is
a need for an overwhelming cultural change.''
</P>
<P>
Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Committee on
Finance and recently a sharp critic of the FDA's actions, called the
announcement ``welcome, albeit late in coming.''
</P>
<P>
``It's obvious that the leadership of the agency must take on what
look like deep-rooted problems when it comes to putting public health
and safety first and public relations second,'' Grassley said. ``These
initiatives need to take hold in a meaningful way and be more than an
attempt to inoculate the agency in the face of alarming revelations.''
</P>
<P>
Vioxx was taken off the market in September by Merck &amp; Co. after a
clinical trial using it was stopped because twice as many people
taking the drug experienced cardiovascular disease than those taking a
placebo. Several major medical journals have since published
commentaries concluding that the drug should have been taken off the
market earlier and criticizing the FDA for its role in keeping Vioxx
on the market.
</P>
<P>
The agency also came under sharp criticism for its handling of
internal reports about the possible increased risk of suicide among
children prescribed antidepressants. After initially dismissing the
link, the agency last month ordered all antidepressant drugs to carry
a prominent ``black box'' warning to alert doctors that the
medications can increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior
among children and adolescents.
</P>
<P>
As part of its effort to strengthen safety monitoring, the FDA will
establish a formal program for agency scientists who disagree with
decisions about specific drugs. The scientists will be able to present
their views to a panel of FDA and outside experts, who will be
required to come back with a decision within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the FDA will contract with the National Academy's
Institute of Medicine to review the drug safety system and assess how
it can learn more about potential harmful side effects before the
drugs become widely used. While defending the FDA's safety record,
Galson said the agency would be open to changes recommended by the
study.
</P>
<P>
Public health advocates generally supported the FDA's initiatives,
but the chief counsel of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a
non-profit public policy organization dedicated to the principles of
limited government, questioned the changes. Sam Kazman, the chief
counsel, said they were potentially harmful to the public health. He
said he feared the agency would slow its drug review process and
potentially keep useful drugs off the market.
</P>
<P>
``There's a real danger that the Vioxx situation will make the
agency less willing to take any risk,'' he said. ``Historically, the
agency suffers from deadly overcaution rather than recklessness, and
has only been coming out of its shell in recent years. We don't want
them to retreat again.''
</P>
<P>
The controversy surrounding the withdrawal of Vioxx has battered
Merck, which has long had the reputation of being one of the most
ethical drug companies. Merck's stock closed at $26.21 Friday, down 81
cents for the day and now down nearly 42 percent since Vioxx was
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
Merck officials declined to comment on the FDA's reform proposal,
but they argued that the agency's initial press releases about the
Vioxx withdrawal were very supportive of Merck's handling of the drug.
</P>
<P>
``Now people are looking at this through the prism of hindsight and
there are people with agendas who leak information to influence the
process,'' said Merck general counsel Kenneth Frazier.
</P>
<P>
Frazier and chief Merck spokeswoman Joan Wainwright said the
company continues to believe it handled Vioxx appropriately. They said
the company followed the FDA's guidelines for advertising and pointed
out that the company promptly shared all its Vioxx studies -- including
the 2000 study that first suggested a heart attack risk -- with the
public.
</P>
<P>
``I think we still are the good drug company. We still have the
same ethics,'' Wainwright said. ``Is (the negative publicity)
something I like to see every day? No, but it doesn't change the
fundamentals of the company.''
</P>
<P>
Merck is facing hundreds of lawsuits from Vioxx users who claim the
drug harmed their health. Judges in the California and New Jersey
state courts have already ruled that Vioxx-related lawsuits can be
treated as class actions involving hundreds of plaintiffs at once.
Hundreds of plaintiffs' lawyers are scheduled to gather next week in
Las Vegas to coordinate their efforts to bring additional cases in
federal and state courts.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 20 million Americans have taken Vioxx since the drug
was approved, making the number of potential plaintiffs enormous. Some
Wall Street research analysts have put Merck's potential liability
above $10 billion, fueled in part by an FDA study that estimated Vioxx
could be responsible for 27,000 deaths and the conclusion in this
month's Lancet, a British medical journal, that the drug should have
been pulled in 2001.
