Merck says new pain reliever gentler than older product

Merck &amp; Co.'s new pain reliever, Arcoxia, was gentler on the
stomach than an older pain reliever, the drug maker said as it
released results of a new study Tuesday.

<P>
But these days doctors and analysts are more concerned with Arcoxia's
cardiovascular safety profile than its gastrointestinal attributes.
That's because Arcoxia is Merck's successor drug to Vioxx, which was
taken off the market last month after a study showed patients taking
it had double the rate of heart attacks and strokes than those taking
a dummy pill.

<P>
The trial results released Tuesday found that there was no
statistical difference in adverse cardiovascular events between
Arcoxia and diclofenac, the older pain reliever against which it was
being compared. However, the average length of time a patient was in
the trial was nine months and Vioxx's dangers didn't manifest
themselves until 18 months into the trial.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is slated to rule on whether to
approve Arcoxia by Oct. 30, but most analysts and doctors don't
believe the agency will act without longer safety studies. Merck is
scheduled to finish a 23,500 patient study that was designed to study
cardiovascular safety in early 2006. Many analysts and doctors
believe Arcoxia will only be approved after that study is completed
and it demonstrates the drug doesn't increase the risk of heart
attacks and strokes

The 7,111-patient trial that was presented Tuesday at the American
College of Rheumatology's annual meeting in San Antonio, and is part
of the Merck's application for approval. It found that dropout rates
due to stomach problems were more than double in the patients taking
diclofenac than in those taking Arcoxia.

Merck shares were up 36 cents to $31.26 in morning trading on the New
York Stock Exchange. Merck shares were trading above $45 a share
before the Vioxx recall late last month.
