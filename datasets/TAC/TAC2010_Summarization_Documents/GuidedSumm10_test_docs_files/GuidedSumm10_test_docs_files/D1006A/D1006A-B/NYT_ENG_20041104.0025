DRUG-SAFETY REVIEWER SAYS FDA DELAYED VIOXX STUDY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a series of testy e-mail exchanges with his bosses, a federal
drug-safety reviewer contends that an effort to publish his study
demonstrating the dangers of Vioxx was delayed and demeaned by top
officials at the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
The e-mail and meeting notes also show that Dr. David Graham, an
official in the FDA's Office of Drug Safety, is seeking to begin a
study of the safety of Bextra and Mobic, two arthritis pills that are
similar to Vioxx. Merck withdrew Vioxx in September after finding
that it caused an increase in the risk of heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
The proposed study of Bextra and Mobic would use data from the
California Medicaid program, according to a note written Oct. 29 by
Graham about a meeting held between Graham and his boss, Dr. Paul
Seligman, director of the Office of Drug Safety. The exchanges are
part of a stream of e-mail suggesting a tense environment in the FDA
office. In one note, Graham reports that the atmosphere has gotten so
bad that Seligman has said he was going to resign.
</P>
<P>
In the note from the meeting of Oct. 29, Graham wrote that Seligman
said to him: "This only confirms what I suspected, that the staff
don't trust me. You can't lead if the staff don't trust you. That's
why I have a letter of resignation I am handing in next Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
Seligman could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
In e-mail dated Oct. 25, 2004, Graham said one of his bosses, Dr.
Anne Trontell, referred to his Vioxx study's conclusions "as nothing
more than a scientific rumor."
</P>
<P>
Graham defended his study and chided Drs. Trontell and Seligman for
taking weeks to decide whether they would approve the study's
publication in the Lancet, a leading medical journal. Trontell is the
office's deputy director. Graham's study concluded that Vioxx, also
known as rofecoxib, had a dangerous effect on the heart. The study
has been submitted to the Lancet for peer review and possible
publication. Meanwhile, the FDA posted a version of the study on its
Web site on Tuesday, after certain parts of the study were first
published in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
"For all the center claims in its operating principles that respect
for others is a core value, my experience with rofecoxib was just the
opposite from management, once the results from this study and their
potential implications came to light in August," Graham wrote in
e-mail dated Oct. 26.
</P>
<P>
The e-mail and notes, which were made available to The New York
Times, come in the midst of a congressional inquiry into whether the
agency has been slow to respond to findings that anti-depressants may
cause children to become suicidal and that Vioxx may be harmful to
the heart in some cases. Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, who is
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has criticized the agency
for failing to respond more quickly to these findings and for
suppressing the findings of its own drug safety reviewers that
concluded that the drugs were risky.
</P>
<P>
In the case of anti-depressants, Dr. Andrew Mosholder, another
reviewer at the Office of Drug Safety, concluded last fall that
depressed children should not be prescribed most anti-depressants
because they have failed to show any benefit against depression and
may cause some to become suicidal.
</P>
<P>
Top agency officials refused to allow Mosholder to testify about his
findings at a public meeting in February because they disagreed with
his conclusions. A second study conducted by researchers at Columbia
University confirmed Mosholder's conclusions in August, and the
agency has since decided to place a "black-box" warning on the labels
of anti-depressants warning of the suicide risk.
</P>
<P>
In his notes on an Oct. 29 meeting with Seligman, Graham writes that
he, Mosholder and others in the Office of Drug Safety feel that "the
review and clearance process had been turned into a battleground,
full of contention and intimidation because our managers, the people
who fill out our performance evaluations, had created a system where
it was taking a great risk to stand firm in our scientific beliefs."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, according to the meeting note written by Graham, Mosholder
recently asked to have his name removed from a textbook chapter on
risk management "because under the current climate, he's afraid to do
anything that will set him up for retaliation or adverse disciplinary
action."
</P>
<P>
The e-mail responses from Seligman and Trontell are mostly brief
requests from seemingly harried bosses asking for more time to review
Dr. Graham's manuscript.
</P>
<P>
Top agency officials have said they have no convincing evidence that
either Bextra or its cousin Celebrex is unsafe, but independent
researchers have speculated that the entire class of medicines known
as Cox-2 inhibitors may be harmful to the heart. Bextra, Celebrex and
Vioxx are all Cox-2 inhibitors. The FDA will hold an advisory panel
meeting in January to discuss these concerns.
</P>
<P>
Mobic is made by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma. They could not be
reached. Officials at FDA and Pfizer did not immediately have
comment.
</P>
<P>
Steve Galson, director of FDA's Center for Drug Evalution and
Research, said the back-and-forth between Graham and his bosses is
part of a scientific peer review that "is a totally normal process
that takes place all over the government dozens of times a day."
</P>
<P>
He said he would consider Graham's request to perform studies on the
safety of Bextra and Mobic, but he said other studies are under way
into the safety of Bextra that might provide better evidence.
</P>
<P>
Andrew McCormick, a spokesman for Pfizer, said he could not comment
on e-mail that he had not seen.
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Campen, Graham's co-author on the Vioxx study and a top
medical director at Kaiser Permanente, which provided data for the
Vioxx study, supported Graham's view of events, including the
proposal for a new study.
</P>
<P>
"This has been a real challenge for us with respect to the support we
have received from FDA.," Campen said. "There were a number of
e-mails that were generated within FDA that were really an effort to
delay publication of our study."
