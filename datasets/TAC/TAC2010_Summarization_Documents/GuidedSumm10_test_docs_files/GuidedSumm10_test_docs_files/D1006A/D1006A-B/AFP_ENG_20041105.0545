<P>
US pharmaceutical giant Merck on Friday disputed the conclusion of
the British medical weekly The Lancet that the arthritis drug Vioxx
should have been pulled from the market four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
Merck said it posted a scientific critique on its website "to further
clarify for the scientific community why Merck disagrees with the
conclusions" of The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
The Lancet report said there was enough evidence four years ago
linking the drug to an increased risk of strokes and heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
Merck claimed however that "it was vigilant in monitoring and
disclosing the cardiovascular safety" of Vioxx and added that the
company "absolutely disagrees with any implication to the contrary."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the scientific critique details why Merck
disagrees with analysis of The Lancet and added that until a study
this year, "data from Merck's clinical trials showed no significant
difference in cardiovascular risk" of Vioxx.
</P>
<P>
The British journal strongly criticized the US drug company, which
withdrew the drug from the market in September, for failing to stop
marketing the drug in 2000 when data showed Vioxx was potentially
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
"The licensing of Vioxx and its continued use in the face of
unambiguous evidence of harm have been public health catastrophes,"
editor Richard Horton said in a commentary. "This controversy will
not end with the drug's withdrawal."
</P>
<P>
Merck withdrew Vioxx based on the results of an internal three-year
study of 2,600 patients, half of whom received a 25 milligram dose of
Vioxx and half of whom received a placebo.
