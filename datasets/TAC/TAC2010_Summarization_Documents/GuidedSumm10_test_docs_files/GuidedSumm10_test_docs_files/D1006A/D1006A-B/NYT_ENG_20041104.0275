STUDY SAYS DRUG'S DANGERS WERE APPARENT YEARS AGO
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Merck and federal officials should have withdrawn the painkiller
Vioxx from the market as early as 2000 because studies of the drug
had clearly shown that it doubled the risk of heart attacks among
users, according to a study released Thursday by The Lancet, a
British medical journal.
</P>
<P>
Authors of the study pooled data from 25,273 patients who
participated in 18 clinical trials conducted before 2001. They found
that patients given Vioxx had 2.3 times the risk of heart attacks as
those given placebos or other pain medications. Merck withdrew Vioxx
on Sept. 30 of this year after a company-sponsored trial found a
doubling of the risks for heart attack or stroke among those who took
the medicine for 18 months or more.
</P>
<P>
An editorial accompanying the study criticized both Merck and the
Food and Drug Administration, and described Vioxx's approval and its
popularity as "public health catastrophes" that led to over 27,000
heart attacks and sudden deaths.
</P>
<P>
"For with Vioxx, Merck and the FDA acted out of ruthless,
short-sighted and irresponsible self-interest," wrote Richard Horton,
editor of The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Merck said that the Lancet study was not
comprehensive or new. "Merck was vigilant in monitoring and
disclosing the cardiovascular safety of Vioxx, and we absolutely
disagree with any implication to the contrary," the company said.
</P>
<P>
The Lancet study increases pressure on the FDA, which is dealing with
allegations that it tried to squelch prescient warnings by its own
drug-safety reviewers about the dangers of Vioxx and about the
hazards of antidepressant use by children and teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Committees in the House and Senate are investigating the FDA's
handling of those issues. More hearings are expected.
</P>
<P>
In his editorial, Horton wrote that the FDA failed to act after a
2001 analysis demonstrated the risks of Vioxx. He called for a
thorough revamping of the agency's process for reviewing drug safety.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sandra Kweder, the deputy director of the FDA's Office of New
Drugs, said that many of Horton's assertions were "flat-out wrong."
She noted that the entire heart attack risk found when pooling data
of the 18 Vioxx studies came from a single study. The FDA examined
the results of that trial closely, Kweder said, and the agency made
sure Merck was conducting more studies on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"We knew we were getting more data as well as ongoing studies and
ongoing placebo-controlled studies that could be extremely useful in
answering the question" of whether Vioxx caused heart attacks, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic and one of the
first to call attention to the heart problems presented by Vioxx,
said in an interview that he had never read a more powerful editorial
in a medical journal.
</P>
<P>
"It is unquestionable that the risks of the drug were known some time
ago and not duly acknowledged, and this study is the best yet to
prove that," Topol said.
</P>
<P>
Tony Butler, an analyst for Lehman Brothers, said that the recent
slide in Merck's share price -- down 40 percent since Sept. 29 --
suggested that investors believe that Merck's liability for Vioxx is
about $20 billion. Butler said that projection is highly inflated,
because very few drug withdrawals result in such a huge legal bill.
</P>
<P>
"The fears expressed by so many others seem exaggerated with the
information that we know today," Butler said.
</P>
<P>
Vioxx is a member of a class of painkillers called COX-2 inhibitors,
which also includes the Celebrex and Bextra drugs made by Pfizer.
Studies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery have found that Bextra
increased risks to the heart. In rare cases, Bextra can also cause a
fatal skin reaction.
</P>
<P>
Pfizer has said that Celebrex had not been found to pose cardiac
risks. But Pfizer shares tumbled Thursday after The National Post in
Toronto reported that Celebrex may have contributed to at least 14
deaths, according to incidents reported to Canada's health regulator.
</P>
<P>
Pfizer called the article "misleading" and Maria Valois, a top
official at Health Canada, noted that the data cited by the newspaper
was difficult to interpret.
</P>
<P>
"The crude number of events cannot be used to estimate the risk" of
Celebrex or any other drug, Valois said in a telephone conference
with reporters.
</P>
<P>
Health Canada has asked Pfizer for more safety data, Valois said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Pfizer shares fell to $27.20, a 52-week low. But
by the end of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday,
Pfizer's stock had largely recovered, closing at $29.06, down 39
cents.
</P>
<P>
Top FDA officials have said that the agency had no data indicating
that Celebrex or Bextra resulted in elevated risks to the heart.
Early next year the agency will convene a panel of outside experts to
review the evidence regarding the entire COX-2 class of medicines.
