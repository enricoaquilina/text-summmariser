ARUBA: Police search for clues of missing U.S. teen after seizing items from
young man's home
</P>
<P>
NOORD, Aruba (AP) _ Police on Thursday searched for clues into the disappearance
of an Alabama teen a day after conducting a late-night helicopter flyover of the
Dutch Caribbean island and seizing items from the home of a Dutch justice
official whose son was with her the day she went missing.
</P>
<P>
A judge was expected to rule Thursday on a petition from the official, Paul van
der Sloot, to see 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot in jail.
</P>
<P>
Joran remains in police custody with two other young men in the May 30
disappearance of Natalee Holloway, 18.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for van der Sloot and brothers Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18,
of Suriname, also filed legal motions Wednesday asking to see the evidence
against their clients.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Caren Janssen said the judge considering the petitions is from
Curacao, and a court there would rule sometime Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Holloway was celebrating her graduation from Mountain Brook, Alabama, High
School with 124 other students and seven chaperones when she vanished during the
early hours of May 30. Her U.S. passport and packed bags were found in her
room.

ST. KITTS: International nursing school opens amid shortage provoking crises
from California to Ireland
</P>
<P>
BASSETERRE, St. Kitts (AP) _ People like Kate Zajdel are desperately needed amid
a worldwide shortage of nurses.
</P>
<P>
Yet she was among tens of thousands of qualified applicants turned away from
U.S. nursing programs last year because they do not have the teachers or space.
The dilemma brought the 22-year-old New York native to a new international
nursing school in the Caribbean country of St. Kitts and Nevis.
</P>
<P>
"I got put on a waiting list at four community colleges," Zajdel said. "I
decided that instead of waiting, I would come here. ... I will actually be able
to save lives."
</P>
<P>
American entrepreneur Robert Ross inaugurated the International University of
Nursing on Wednesday, inspired by staffing shortages that are forcing nurses to
work overtime in hospitals from the United States to Japan. The US$10 million
(euro8.3 million) institution, surrounded by sugar cane fields and overlooking
the Caribbean sea, accepted 200 students for the autumn semester and aims to
enroll 3,000 by 2008.

GUANTANAMO: Detention of terror suspects poses rising challenge to Bush and
allies in Congress
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON (AP) _ The indefinite holding of foreign terrorism suspects at
Guantanamo Bay is creating new political headaches for President George W. Bush
and his allies on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
At a time when the administration is trying to mend fences with its European
allies and heal wounds with the Muslim world over Iraq, the treatment of
prisoners at the U.S. military prison in Cuba is commanding more and more world
attention.
</P>
<P>
It could put Bush in an awkward position next month in Scotland at the annual
meeting of the world's leading industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
International human rights groups have decried prisoner-treatment practices and
policies at Guantanamo Bay, with Amnesty International calling the prison "the
gulag of our time" and former President Jimmy Carter adding his voice to those
seeking its closure.
</P>
<P>
Many Republicans in Congress readily echoed the administration in arguing to
keep the prison open, asserting that instances of prisoner abuse were isolated
and that many detainees were dangerous individuals bent on harming the United
States.

CUBA: Fidel Castro blasts consumer societies in letter regretting absence at
summit of developing countries
</P>
<P>
HAVANA (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro blasted wealthy consumer societies _
with the United States topping the list _ in a letter regretting his absence at
a summit of small developing nations this week in Doha, Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Castro complained of a global economic system he said defends the interests of
an opulent minority while pushing out all others. The letter was read Wednesday
by Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage at the Group of 77 gathering of 132
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Never before has there been so much inequality in the world, and never before
has it been so profound," Castro wrote. "In today's economic order, our
countries are utilized for exploitation but excluded from development."
</P>
<P>
The Cuban leader said much of the economic woes of the developing world can be
blamed on consumer-driven societies of the "North," referring primarily to the
United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted what he called the "ravenous consumption" of oil in the United
States, where, despite housing just 5 percent of the world's population, he said
more than 26 percent of the planet's oil is consumed.

CUBA: Cuban delegation eyes U.S. cows, hoping to improve herds' genetic
composition
</P>
<P>
BARNET, Vt. (AP) _ Three officials from Cuba circled around the four young
Jersey heifers in a barn in Vermont, more than 2,000 miles from their Caribbean
homeland.
</P>
<P>
They sized up the animals for weight, age and the progress of their pregnancies
and examined their heads, rumps and ribs.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban delegation _ which also includes a cattle expert and a veterinarian _
is in Vermont this week inspecting animals that were lined up for them by the
Brattleboro-based Holstein Association. In all, the Cubans plan to purchase 500
head from Vermont, Maine and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans hope to improve the genetic composition of their herds and increase
the number of cattle with the goal of becoming self-sufficient in milk
production, said Tatiana Taboada Gonzalez of the Cuban import agency
Alimport.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Cuba has imported US$1.4 billion (euro1.2 billion) in
agricultural products from the United States, said Florida cattle dealer John
Parke Wright IV, who is arranging the deal.
</P>
<P>
Food, agricultural products and medical supplies are the only items exempt from
the 43-year-old U.S. trade embargo with the Caribbean nation of 11.3 million
people.

BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS: Dutch marine engineer found guilty of manslaughter in
boat accident
</P>
<P>
ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands (AP) _ A British Virgin Islands jury has found
a Dutch marine engineer, whose powerboat rammed into a dinghy and killed two
teenagers, guilty on two counts of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
A nine-member jury rendered its verdict in the High Court on Wednesday night,
after deliberating for two and a half hours in the case of Arjaan
Hendricksen.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution argued that Hendricksen had been grossly negligent when, on Aug.
5, 2004, near Saba Rock, he drove his 17-foot (5-meter) Boston Whaler through a
mooring field and hit a dinghy with four young men aboard. Hendricksen's boat
climbed over the dinghy, spilling the youths into the water.
</P>
<P>
Hendricksen then left the scene, ignoring the cries for help, said public
prosecutor Terrence Williams. Luke Noble, 15, a British national, and Dennis
Campbell Harty, 19, a U.S. national, drowned.
</P>
<P>
Hendricksen, 40, pleaded innocent and remains on bail pending sentencing next
week.

ATHLETICS: World-record holder Powell receives hero's welcome in
Jamaica
</P>
<P>
KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ World record holder Asafa Powell arrived to a hero's
welcome when he returned to Jamaica this week.
</P>
<P>
Powell, who set the record in the 100 meters Tuesday, is confident that he can
beat his mark of 9.77 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"I think that it can be lowered. The way I'm running this season, it's given me
a lot of confidence," Powell, 22, said shortly after arriving at Norman Manley
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
"I've run 9.8 every time I've been on the track," said Powell, who was met by
government officials, including sports minister Portia Simpson Miller, and
cheering supporters from his school, the University of Technology.
</P>
<P>
Powell broke the record at the Tsiklitiria Super Grand Prix meet in Athens,
Greece. He beat the previous mark of 9.78 set three years ago by American Tim
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
Powell was one of the favorites to win the gold medal at the Olympics in Athens
last summer but finished fifth in the final. He will next compete in Jamaica's
National Championships to select the country's squad for the World Championships
in Helsinki, Finland, in August.
