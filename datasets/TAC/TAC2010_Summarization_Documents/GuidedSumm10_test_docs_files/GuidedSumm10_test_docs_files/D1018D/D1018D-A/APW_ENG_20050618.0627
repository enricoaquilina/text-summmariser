Searcher: Missing teen's family found suspects before Aruban police
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
MOUNTAIN BROOK, Alabama
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Natalee Holloway's family, not Aruban police, first identified and located a
Dutch youth now held as a suspect in the disappearance of the Alabama teen,
according to a friend who helped with the search.
</P>
<P>
The family's amateur detective work _ based on a combination of hunches and tips
on the Caribbean island _ also led to two of the youth's friends who also were
taken into custody. But it ultimately led to frustration when authorities failed
to immediately arrest the trio, which included the son of a prominent Dutch
ministry official.
</P>
<P>
"She had been missing less than 24 hours and we had all three names and
addresses, so it's just disappointing that they weren't able to move faster,"
said Jody Bearman, who organized the graduation trip to Aruba for 125 students
from Mountain Brook High School and seven chaperones.
</P>
<P>
The three weren't taken into custody until 10 days after Holloway's family knew
of them. The search for Holloway was still under way on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Aruban authorities have defended their work in the nearly three weeks since
Holloway failed to show up for the trip home to Alabama. Police work takes time,
they have said.
</P>
<P>
Mariaine Croes, a spokeswoman for the attorney general's office in Aruba,
declined comment Saturday on how authorities initially learned of the three
suspects.
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait for the investigation to finish," she said. A fourth suspect,
the disc jockey from a party boat, is also in custody.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Bearman said Aruban
authorities couldn't be faulted completely for failing to identify van der Sloot
and the others more quickly, something she said the amateur sleuths did in less
than three hours in Aruba.
</P>
<P>
"They did not know what was going on," she said. "We were there on a
mission."
</P>
<P>
Terrified after hearing news any parent dreads, Beth Holloway Twitty landed in
Aruba about 12 hours after learning her daughter Natalee had
vanished.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by her husband and friends including Bearman on a donated corporate
jet, Holloway Twitty had a few bits of information from Mountain Brook graduates
who were on the trip, most importantly a physical description of a Dutch
teenager _ a judge's son, they thought _ with whom Natalee was seen leaving a
bar, Carlos' N Charlies', on May 30, the night she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Bearman said the group also was told that Holloway's friends had seen the same
teenager in the casino at the hotel where they were staying.
</P>
<P>
With help from some locals, Holloway's mother and the others determined the
youth had been in the casino playing in a poker tournament, according to
Bearman. Players had to sign in, she said, and that gave them a name and
initial: Joran V.
</P>
<P>
"After talking to enough people, we were able to deduce that it was Joran van
der Sloot," she said. "Once we got the name we were able to track the address
through people and we got the police. They escorted us and we went straight to
the house."
</P>
<P>
Van der Sloot's father, Aruban judge-in-training Paul van der Sloot, said his
son was out playing poker when the group first arrived at the house around 1
a.m., Bearman said. Still accompanied by police, the group went to a couple of
places looking for van der Sloot before returning to the father's house and
finding Joran van der Sloot there with one of the two Surinamese brothers who
later were detained, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Basically we interrogated him," Bearman said. "He never denied being with
her."
</P>
<P>
Van der Sloot described dancing with Holloway at the bar and said "she wanted to
go with me" at closing time, according to Bearman.
</P>
<P>
Van der Sloot claimed he left Holloway outside the Holiday Inn resort where the
group was staying after they took a late-night trip to a scenic lighthouse,
Bearman said, and he even accompanied the family to the hotel to show them the
exact spot where she was dropped off.
</P>
<P>
His story didn't add up, though, according to Bearman.
</P>
<P>
"We started pressing him on that because we had students who were in the lobby
until 5 a.m., and she never arrived," she said.
</P>
<P>
While Aruban police were present during the questioning of van der Sloot, which
lasted until about 3 a.m., officers left the talking to Holloway's family until
things began to get "heated," Bearman said.
</P>
<P>
Van der Sloot and the Surinamese brothers _ Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish
Kalpoe, 18 _ were interrogated by police the next day and released. Although
they were later taken into custody, no one has been charged.
</P>
<P>
Two one-time security guards were taken into custody because van der Sloot and
the brothers said they saw Holloway outside the hotel with a security guard, but
both have since been released.
</P>
<P>
The fourth person in custody, Steve Gregory Croes, 26, played music on a tourist
party barge called the "Tattoo," but none of the Mountain Brook teens were known
to have gone on the boat, Bearman said. An employer of Croes said the disc
jockey knew one of the Surinamese brothers through an Internet
cafe.
