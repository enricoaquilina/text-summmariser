<P>
A fourth man, a tour boat disc
jockey, was arrested Friday as the latest suspect in the
case of missing Alabama teen Natalee Holloway.
</P>
<P>
The man, identified by his aunt as Steve Gregory Croes, 26,
was questioned and remains in jail. Police did not impound
his automobile, a late model Honda, or remove anything from
his home, according to his aunt, Mary Croes.
</P>
<P>
"He has lived here about three months with his grandparents," Croes
said. "We don't have too much contact with him, because
he is so young. When he left (the home Friday)
he said, 'I will be back this afternoon.' "
</P>
<P>
Croes said he was contacted by police Thursday night and went
to the station voluntarily to give a statement, his employer,
Marcus Wiggins, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Croes said he knew one of two Surinamese brothers being held
in the case because they went to the same Internet
cafe, Wiggins said.
</P>
<P>
Croes was a DJ on the Tattoo, which offers nightly dining,
dancing and swimming, Wiggins said.
</P>
<P>
In Alabama, a woman who helped organize Holloway's graduation trip, Jody
Bearman, said students did not go on the Tattoo as
a group, although some could have taken a boat ride
without the seven adult chaperons knowing. "The chaperons were not
supposed to keep up with their every move," Bearman said.
</P>
<P>
A judge heard motions Friday from lawyers for the two brothers,
Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, and a Dutch
youth, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17 -- the three prime
suspects in the case, who were the last people known
to have seen Holloway before she disappeared in the wee
hours of May 30.
</P>
<P>
The judge in the case, Bob Kit, will decide by Sunday
whether there is enough evidence to keep them in jail.
No one has been charged in the case, and lawyers
for all three men say they are innocent.
</P>
<P>
Holloway disappeared the day she was to return from a five-day
trip with 124 other students celebrating their graduation from high
school in Mountain Brook, Ala., a suburb of Birmingham. Her
disappearance, unsolved despite scores of searches of the island by
volunteers and police, has increasingly become a source of discord
on the island, where the slogan on auto tags is
"One Happy Island."
</P>
<P>
Many locals believe news coverage has been overblown, and others believe
Holloway is still alive.
</P>
<P>
"This is not fair what the American press is saying," said
Denny Scoop, a lifelong resident, sipping a beer Friday afternoon
at J&amp;J Snacks in Noord. "It is tarnishing our reputation.
How many people have gone missing in the U.S. in
the last three weeks?"
</P>
<P>
The missing girl's mother, who refuses to leave the island until
she learns her daughter's fate, said she is unhappy with
the progress of the investigation. "This case is not that
hard to figure out," Beth Holloway Twitty said. "Those boys
have the answers."
</P>
<P>
Holloway Twitty has said that if investigators do not make progress
soon, she might start believing they are trying to protect
the detainees. Van Der Sloot is the son of a
Dutch judge.
</P>
<P>
"We are in day 18 with no answers," she said Friday.
"I want my daughter and I want her now."
</P>
<P>
Holloway Twitty said she would "believe my daughter is alive until
I find out otherwise."
