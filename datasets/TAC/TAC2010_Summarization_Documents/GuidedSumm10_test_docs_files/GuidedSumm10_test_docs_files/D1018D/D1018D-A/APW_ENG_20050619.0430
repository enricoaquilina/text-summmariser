Police questioned the father of a Dutch teenager detained in connection with the
case of a missing American teenager, hoping he may have seen something to help
resolve the mystery, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Paul van der Sloot, a judge-in-training on the island, was questioned Saturday
night, said Police Superintendent Jan van der Straaten.
</P>
<P>
"He was questioned as a witness, no more or no less," van der Straaten told The
Associated Press, declining to give details.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's spokeswoman, Mariaine Croes, said witnesses are
questioned when prosecutors believe they may be able to add something to the
case.
</P>
<P>
"You may know something more or you may have seen something more, but you are
not a suspect or thought to be part of any crime," said Croes.
</P>
<P>
Van der Sloot is the father of 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot, one of the last
people seen with 18-year-old Natalee Holloway the night she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Three other men have been arrested. No one has been charged.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday a judge ordered the Dutch teenager and his two friends, brothers
Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, to stay in jail for at least another
week while investigators continue their search for clues.
</P>
<P>
A fourth detained man was to appear before a judge Monday, said
Croes.
</P>
<P>
He was identified by his boss as Steve Gregory Croes, a 26-year-old disc jockey
on the party boat "Tattoo." He was arrested early Friday, a day after giving
police a statement, "Tattoo" owner Marcus Wiggins said Friday. Croes is not
related to Mariaine Croes.
</P>
<P>
Under Dutch law, which Aruba follows as a Dutch protectorate, authorities can
detain people for up to 116 days without charging them.
</P>
<P>
Holloway, of Mountain Brook, Alabama, disappeared in the early hours of May 30,
the last day of a five-day vacation with 124 students celebrating their high
school graduation.
</P>
<P>
Searches by authorities, volunteer islanders and tourists have led nowhere.
Investigators were refusing to say if they thought Holloway was dead. Her
mother, Beth Holloway Twitty, has said she will continue to believe Natalee is
alive until she has proof otherwise.
</P>
<P>
In Alabama, a friend of Holloway's family said Natalee's relatives, not Aruban
police, first identified and located Joran and the Kalpoe brothers _ less than a
day after the young woman disappeared, and only three hours after family members
started looking.
</P>
<P>
"She had been missing less than 24 hours and we had all three names and
addresses, so it's just disappointing that they (authorities) weren't able to
move faster," Jody Bearman, who organized the graduation trip and went to Aruba
to help in the search, said in an interview with the AP on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three young men weren't taken into custody until 10 days after Holloway's
family first knew of them.
</P>
<P>
Aruban authorities have defended their investigation, saying police work takes
time.
</P>
<P>
Holloway Twitty, 44, has insisted that Joran and the Kalpoes hold the key to the
investigation and that authorities pressure the young men harder to tell the
truth. She said if there is not significant progress soon, she may start to
believe that authorities are protecting them.
</P>
<P>
Aruban authorities have said they are pursuing all leads and protecting no
one.
</P>
<P>
Holloway Twitty sat on the front pew during a Mass dedicated to her family
Saturday night at a Pentecostal church.
</P>
<P>
"We admire the strength and courage you've shown as a mother," pastor Gilbert
Martes told Holloway, who listened to the sermon with her eyes
closed.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a judge ruled on a petition from the elder van der Sloot to visit his
son, whom he has not been allowed to see since Joran was detained on June 9, and
from the Kalpoes' attorneys requesting to see any evidence prosecutors may have
gathered, Croes said. Officials refused to reveal the rulings.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, investigators searched the van der Sloot home in Noord, outside
the capital, Oranjestad, and towed away two vehicles. Joran lived in an
apartment attached to the main house. Authorities have not released the results
of the search.
</P>
<P>
It was not entirely clear how Croes might be connected to the other detainees.
He told Wiggins that he knew one of the Kalpoe brothers because he went to the
same Internet cafe, Wiggins said.
</P>
<P>
Holloway Twitty remarked Friday that Croes' arrest was "just the beginning," and
that she believed more people might be brought into custody.
</P>
<P>
"There is a chance we'll have more suspects, but it's impossible to speculate
now because we are still investigating," said the attorney general's
spokeswoman.
