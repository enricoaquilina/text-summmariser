NO SIGNS THAT CASE OF MISSING ALABAMA TEEN IS CLOSER TO BEING SOLVED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
ORANJESTAD, ARUBA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Sunday, the family of missing Alabama teen
Natalee Holloway searched the caves on the southwest corner of
this island in Arikok National Park, while in downtown Oranjestad
life was slower than
</P>
<P>
The country's tourism office had cancelled the annual "The Party Goes
On Parade" of people dressed in costumes streaming through the
streets in a kind of small scale Mardi Gras to
attract vacationers in June, the low season for this tropical
island in the Caribbean visited by about half a million
Americans a year.
</P>
<P>
It has been a hard week in paradise.
</P>
<P>
And three weeks into the search for Holloway there are no
clear signs the mystery of the missing teen, not seen
since the early morning hours of May 30, is about
to be solved -- nor are Aruba's image woes.
</P>
<P>
In the past week authorities released the first two suspects arrested
in the case, then arrested a fourth Friday. They staged
a highly-publicized spectacle of a search of a beach where
a local DJ claimed to have found a pair of
women's underwear and condoms. They searched the island by helicopter
using infrared technology.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night -- in a scene that seemed to sum
up every bizarre aspect of the investigation and press frenzy
-- TV crews chased Paulus Van Der Sloot, a judge,
and the father of one of four detained suspects in
the case, Joran Van Der Sloot, 17.
</P>
<P>
The elder Van Der Sloot was coming out of the downtown
Oranjestad police station, where he had been brought for questioning
in connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
Seeing the camera crews, he broke into a sprint and a
cameraman for CNN caught up to him as he frantically
tried to unlock the door of his Mercedes and drive
off.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Van Der Sloot!" yelled a CNN cameraman. "Why are you
running?"
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Rueben Trappenberg said Sunday there are no signs the
worldwide publicity, much of it bad, has hurt tourism on
Aruba where automobile tags bear the slogan "One Happy Island."
But he conceded the furor over Holloway's disappearance has dented
Aruba's image as the safest island in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
"I can run you through the list of things we've been
misportrayed of, fantastical things, from a high level government cover-up,
to drug cartel, to prostitution and slavery," said Trappenberg." We
are not Pirates of the Caribbean."
</P>
<P>
Through the weekend CNN and FOX -- each with crews of
about 10 -- showed few signs of losing interest in
the story that continues to spike ratings even though government
officials and lawyers offer few comments or details of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Camera crews sometime spend hours just waiting outside the courthouse to
hoping to get a shot of a suspect leaving, and
a what usually turns out to be a no-comment from
lawyers and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the latest suspect, tour boat disc jockey Steve Croes,
26, is expected to come before a judge who will
rule whether prosecutors have enough information to hold him on
suspicion of premeditated murder, murder, and kidnapping with fatal consequence.
</P>
<P>
Those are the same suspicions prosecutors have used to hold three
suspects who have been in custody for eleven days: Joran
Van Der Sloot, 17, and brother Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and
Satish Kalpoe, 18.
</P>
<P>
The elder Van Der Sloot was called into police headquarters again
Sunday for questioning and was released. His wife, Anita Van
Der Sloot, said Friday her husband duty's as a lower
level judge have been suspended during the the investigation; but
that could not be confirmed Sunday through officials.
</P>
<P>
Island authorities said they are exerting every effort to crack the
case, which is why the Oranjestad parade was cancelled Sunday.
The parade gave the wrong impression Aruba officials still place
promoting tourism as a top priority, said Trappenberg, and it
would have put about 300 officers on streets to manage
crowds and traffic.
</P>
<P>
"Those police should be searching or investigating the case instead," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Resentment of the media's dogged pursuit of the Holloway investigation has
angered some. Elvis Weert, a disc jockey on Aruba Radio
Top 95, is one of the most vocal opponents of
what he sees as disproportionate coverage of an aberrant incident.
</P>
<P>
He said the American media should scrutinize its own country as
thoroughly as it has examined Aruba. "How many children have
gone missing in the United States in the last month?"
he said. "You don't hear anything about that."
</P>
<P>
Another radio host, Dick Miller, who, for 16 years has hosted
an nightly music and talk program Canal 90 FM and,
for a time, served as "Honorary goodwill ambassador to Aruba,"
said listeners have called saying they are distraught that Holloway
is missing and distraught that it has happened in Aruba.
</P>
<P>
"This is a place of hospitality, not hostility," he said. "Nothing
like this ever happens and people just don't know how
to cope with it. They are extremely concerned about Natalee
and her family, but everybody is affected. People can't sleep.
It's terrible."
</P>
<P>
As FOX and CNN have pushed to scoop each they have
both made missteps. At one point a week ago there
were reports of a body found, a stain identified as
blood in the automobile Natalee Holloway allegedly rode in, and
a confession from one of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
None turned out to be true -- but that hasn't slowed
pursuit of the story. The tabloid TV show "A Current
Affair" plans to air an entire program on Aruba on
Monday. The National Enquirer had a reporter on the island
all week researching a piece.
</P>
<P>
Authorities point to the island's crime statistics -- one murder and
six rapes were recorded on Aruba last year -- as
an evidence that Holloway's disappearance is out of character for
an island renowned as one of the safest places on
earth.
</P>
<P>
As much as the media obsession has distorted perceptions of the
island, the authorities reluctance to release information has fueled speculation
and disconnect. It's not clear how the latest suspect, Steve
Croes, is involved.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported that Croes might have known one of
the suspects, Deepak Kalpoe, through meeting him at an internet
cafe, but the spokeswoman for the prosecutor, Mariaine Croes declined
to comment on that.
</P>
<P>
Croes ex-wife, Jeanet Gei, said Friday she sees no way her
ex-husband could be involved in a violent crime. The father
of her three-year old son, he doesn't smoke, he doesn't
drink, and he is a gentle. "If he stepped on
a lizard, he would cry," she said.
