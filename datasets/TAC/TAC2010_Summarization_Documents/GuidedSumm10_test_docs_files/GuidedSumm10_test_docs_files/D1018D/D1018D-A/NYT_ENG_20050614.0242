Police launched a new search for a missing
Alabama teenager Tuesday after a man detained earlier in the
investigation said another suspect told him in jail the girl
was not taken back to her hotel.
</P>
<P>
A three-block area of beach near the Aruba Marriott Resort was
closed as police combed the sand and nearby dunes and
drained a nearby swampy area while searching for 18-year-old Natalee
Holloway.
</P>
<P>
Holloway was on the last day of a five-day graduation trip
with 124 classmates and seven adult chaperons from Mountain Brook
High School in Birmingham to this Dutch Caribbean island. Holloway's
passport and packed bags were found in her hotel room.
</P>
<P>
Three suspects -- Joran Van Der Sloot, 17, the son of
a prominent judicial official, and brothers Satish Kalpoe, 18, and
Deepak Kalpoe, 21 -- are still being held and are
now the focus of an intensifying investigation into the disappearance
of the girl.
</P>
<P>
Security guard Antonius "Mickey" John, 30, who spent nine days in
jail as a suspect, said Tuesday that Deepak Kalpoe told
him a different story than what he first told police.
</P>
<P>
John's attorney, Noraina C. Pietersz, said she had copies of the
Kalpoe brothers' statements given to police, but authorities would not
let her read the statement given by Van Der Sloot.
</P>
<P>
The trio initially told investigators they dropped Holloway off at her
Holiday Inn hotel at about 2 a.m. May 30 and
last saw her being approached by a security guard.
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday, John said Deepak Kalpoe told him in jail this
weekend that he and his brother dropped Van Der Sloot
and Holloway off at the Marriott hotel before they went
home. The Marriott is less than a mile north of
the Holiday Inn on the same beach.
</P>
<P>
Pietersz said the trio could not have dropped Holloway off at
the Holiday Inn because their vehicle was not captured by
hotel surveillance cameras.
</P>
<P>
"It just didn't make any sense, and it never made any
sense," she said, characterizing the arrest of her client as
"a joke -- they just went off on the wrong
case."
</P>
<P>
Abraham Jones, 28, was also released by police Monday. His attorney,
Chris Lejuez, said authorities didn't give a reason for his
client's release.
</P>
<P>
Lejuez said the stories of the three suspects in custody are
beginning to change because authorities "have stepped up the speed
of the interrogations."
</P>
<P>
Aruba's attorney general, Caren Janssen, refused to comment on John's allegation
"or anything else."
</P>
<P>
Cars full of ogling tourists choked L.G. Smith Boulevard, the two-lane
road outside the hotel in Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
Tourists Tyde Meadows and his new wife, Kelley, 23, from Hartselle,
Ala., said the huge gathering of media attracted them to
the site where they watched police pick through the shrubbery.
</P>
<P>
"We saw something going on and thought this was about Natalee
Holloway," said Kelley Meadows. "We hope she is found alive."
