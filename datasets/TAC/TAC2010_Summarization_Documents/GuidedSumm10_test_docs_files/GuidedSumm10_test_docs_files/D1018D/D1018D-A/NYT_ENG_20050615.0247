SUSPECT'S HOME SEARCHED IN ARUBA

<P>
Almost a week after arresting the son of
a prominent Dutch judge in the disappearance of Alabama teen
Natalee Holloway, officials in Aruba searched his home Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police -- including what appeared to be forensic investigators in protective
clothing -- searched the family home of Joran Van Der
Sloot, the 17-year-old son of Judge Paul Van Der Sloot.
</P>
<P>
Investigators towed two vehicles from the property, a blue SUV and
a red Jeep, and removed garbage bags of items while
media trained cameras on the modest, one-story yellow stucco home.
</P>
<P>
"The search is part of the investigation," said Mariaine Croes, a
spokeswoman for Attorney General Caren Janssen. Croes said both cars
belonged to the family.
</P>
<P>
Janssen, who also went into the house, declined to comment as
investigators wrapped up their search at about 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
"We are just looking for evidence at the house but have
nothing yet," police spokesman Edwin Comemencia said.
</P>
<P>
The search came shortly after Paul Van Der Sloot filed a
motion in court Wednesday morning seeking permission to see his
jailed son, who along with brothers Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and
Satish Kalpoe, 18, are the last known people to have
seen Holloway.
</P>
<P>
Also at Wednesday's hearing, defense attorneys filed motions to see the
evidence warranting the continued incarceration of their clients, and prosecutors
sought the removal of lawyer Antonio Carlo, who is representing
Joran Van Der Sloot.
</P>
<P>
The judge did not immediately rule on the motions.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Ruben Trapenberg said prosecutors asked that Carlo be removed
because "they believe he broke a rule" in representing his
client, according to Dutch law.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what that rule might be," Trapenberg said after
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
The three young men, who today will have been in custody
for a week, were loaded into vehicles hidden from view
and driven away. Their next court appearance is Sunday. They
have not been charged with any crime.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday afternoon, Aruba police blocked off several hundred yards of
beachfront beside the Marriott Hotel while several dozen officers and
U.S. FBI agents searched shrubbery-dotted dunes with two bloodhounds and
a nearby swampy area was drained.
</P>
<P>
"There were no concrete results from the search yesterday," Croes said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Holloway was celebrating her graduation from Mountain Brook, Ala., High School
with 124 other students and seven chaperons when she vanished
during the early hours of May 30. Her passport and
packed bags were found in her room. She was last
seen by friends leaving the Oranjestad nightclub Carlos 'N Charlie's
with Van Der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers.
