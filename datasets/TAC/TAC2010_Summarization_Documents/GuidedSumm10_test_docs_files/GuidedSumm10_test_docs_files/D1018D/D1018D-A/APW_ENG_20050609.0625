Three young men who acknowledged partying with an 18-year-old honors student
from Alabama before she went missing last week told police that a man dressed in
a security uniform approached her as they dropped her off at her hotel, a source
close to the investigation said Thursday.

The men were arrested Thursday in connection with the disappearance of Natalee
Holloway, who they said they last saw in front of the Holiday Inn shortly before
2 a.m. on May 30.

Two of the suspects, identified as Surinamese brothers Satish and Deepak Kaploe,
told police Natalee had been drinking and fell down as she got of the car in
front of the hotel, the source told The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.

When the third suspect, Dutch citizen Joran Andreas Petrus Van Der Sloot, tried
to help her, she refused, saying, "'I can stand on my own,'" the source
said.

<P>
At that moment, the Surinamese brothers told police, a black man dressed in a
black security uniform and carrying a Walkie-Talkie went up to Natalee,
seemingly to offer his assistance. The suspects then drove off, and did not see
Natalie again, they told police, according to the source.
