<P>
A judge on Saturday ordered the teen son of a prominent justice official and his
two friends to stay in jail for at least a week more while investigators
continue their search for clues in the disappearance of a young U.S.
woman.
</P>
<P>
A fourth man detained in the case was to appear before a judge Monday, said
Attorney General spokeswoman Mariaine Croes.
</P>
<P>
The man was identified by his boss as Steve Gregory Croes, a 26-year-old disc
jockey on the privately owned party boat "Tattoo." He was arrested early Friday,
a day after being contacted by police and giving them a statement, "Tattoo"
owner Marcus Wiggins told The Associated Press on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under Dutch law, which Aruba follows as a Dutch protectorate, authorities can
detain individuals for up to 116 days without filing formal charges. A judge
must review the case after the first 10 days, and then periodically after
that.
</P>
<P>
Judge Bob Wit, who was sent in from the neighboring Dutch island of Curacao,
extended the detention of Joran van der Sloot, 17, and brothers, Deepak Kalpoe,
21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, for eight days, said Mariaine Croes, who is not
related to the fourth detainee.
</P>
<P>
Natalee Holloway, 18, of Mountain Brook, Alabama, disappeared in the early hours
of May 30, the last day of a five-day vacation with 124 other students to
celebrate their high school graduation.
</P>
<P>
Searches by authorities, volunteer islanders and tourists have led nowhere.
Investigators were refusing to say if they thought Holloway was dead. Her
mother, Beth Holloway Twitty, has said she will continue to believe Natalee is
alive until she has proof otherwise.
</P>
<P>
Van der Sloot is the son of Paul van der Sloot, of the Netherlands, who is
training to be a judge in Aruba.
</P>
<P>
In Alabama, a friend of Holloway's family said Natalee's relatives, not Aruban
police, first identified and located Joran and the Kalpoe brothers _ less than a
day after the young woman disappeared, and only three hours after family members
started looking.
</P>
<P>
"She had been missing less than 24 hours and we had all three names and
addresses, so it's just disappointing that they (authorities) weren't able to
move faster," Jody Bearman, who organized the graduation trip and went to Aruba
to help in the search, said in an interview with the AP on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three young men weren't taken into custody until 10 days after Holloway's
family first knew of them.
</P>
<P>
Aruban authorities have defended their investigation, saying police work takes
time. Mariaine Croes declined comment Saturday on how authorities initially
learned of the three young men. "We have to wait for the investigation to
finish," she said.
</P>
<P>
Holloway Twitty, 44, has insisted that Joran and the Kalpoes hold the key to the
investigation and that authorities pressure the young men harder to tell the
truth. She said if there is not significant progress soon in the case, she may
start to believe that authorities are protecting the detainees. Aruban
authorities have said they are pursuing all leads and protecting no
one.
</P>
<P>
Holloway Twitty sat on the front pew during a Mass dedicated to her family
Saturday night at a Pentecostal church.
</P>
<P>
"We admire the strength and courage you've shown as a mother," pastor Gilbert
Martes told the missing teen's mother, who listened to the sermon with her eyes
closed.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a judge ruled on a petition from the elder van der Sloot to visit his
son, whom he has not been allowed to see since Joran was detained on June 9, and
from the Kalpoes' attorneys requesting to see any evidence prosecutors may have
gathered, Croes said. Both Croes and Court secretary Isella Wernet refused to
reveal the rulings. Defense attorneys did not return calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, investigators towed two vehicles and searched the premises of the
van der Sloot home in Noord, outside the capital of Oranjestad. Joran lived in
an apartment attached to the main house. Authorities have not released the
results of the search, but Attorney General Caren Janssen has said that Paul van
der Sloot is not under investigation.
</P>
<P>
It was not entirely clear how Croes might be connected to the other detainees.
He told Wiggins that he knew one of the Kalpoe brothers because he went to the
same Internet cafe, Wiggins said.
</P>
<P>
Wiggins did not comment on Croes' possible involvement in Natalee Holloway's
disappearance. He said he had never seen any of the three young men aboard the
"Tattoo," a party boat offering dining, dancing and swimming whose patrons must
be 18 and older.
</P>
<P>
Holloway Twitty remarked Friday that Croes' arrest was "just the beginning," and
that she believed additional people might be brought into custody. She did not
elaborate, however, and also declined to say what she knew about
Croes.
</P>
<P>
"There is a chance we'll have more suspects, but it's impossible to speculate
now because we are still investigating," Mariaine Croes said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Police Superintendent Jan van der Straaten refused to identify Croes by name
Friday but said that the latest detainee was arrested based on information
provided by one of the three young men already in custody. The attorney
general's office released a statement Friday identifying Croes' only by his
initials, S.G.C., age 26.
