A judge on Sunday ordered the release of
two suspects in the disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway,
including the father of a youth last seen with the
young woman before she vanished.
</P>
<P>
Paul van der Sloot, 52, was freed after being held for
three days, apparently on suspicion that he had coached his
son, Joran, 17, about what to tell police.
</P>
<P>
"A little bit of the nightmare clouds are now disappearing," van
der Sloot's wife, Anita, told the Associated Press. "The truth
will always come forward. From the beginning I trusted everything
would be fine."
</P>
<P>
The judge also ordered the release of party boat disc jockey
Steve Gregory Croes because "there was not enough proof he
was involved," said his attorney, Eleni Lotter-Homan. Croes was expected
to be released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"He has nothing to hide," Lotter-Homan added, saying her client's only
connection to the case was that he knew one of
the other suspects from an internet cafe.
</P>
<P>
Three other suspects remained in custody late Sunday afternoon, although the
judge also reviewed their cases and was expected to rule
soon on whether they should remain in detention or be
released.
</P>
<P>
Still in jail were brothers Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe,
18, along with Joran van der Sloot. No formal charges
have been filed against any of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
The Kalpoes and the younger van der Sloot were seen leaving
a popular bar with Holloway, 18, on May 30, which
was to be her last night in Aruba before flying
home to Alabama. She came to the upscale Caribbean island
with a large group of classmates to celebrate her graduation
from Mountain Brook High School.
</P>
<P>
No trace of Holloway has been found, despite an exhaustive four-week
search that is still on-going.
</P>
<P>
The youths initially told police they dropped off Holloway at her
hotel, but have since changed their stories, saying the younger
van der Sloot went for a walk with her on
a beach near her hotel.
</P>
<P>
Joran van der Sloot has told his mother that he left
the young woman there, alone and unharmed, and does not
know what happened to her. His father, a judge-in-training on
Aruba, was arrested last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"He told them he doesn't have anything to hide and his
son is not involved in any crime," Paul van der
Sloot's attorney, A.J. Swan, said Sunday. "But he cannot evade
the impression that they are using criminal procedure laws in
an improper way to put pressure on his son."
</P>
<P>
Under Aruban law, suspects can be jailed upon a "reasonable suspicion"
of their involvement in a crime, a lesser standard than
American law, which requires "probable cause." Suspects can be held
without formal charges for up to 116 days, although a
judge periodically reviews their cases to determine whether the facts
justify their continued incarceration.
</P>
<P>
Aruban authorities are prohibited from releasing details of the investigation, and
the hearings in the case have all been held behind
closed doors.
</P>
<P>
The lack of information seems only to have deepened the mystery
surrounding Holloway's disappearance, fueling a flurry of rumors on the
island and intense media coverage.
</P>
<P>
In its July 4 edition, People Magazine reported that one of
the Kalpoe brothers received a text message from young van
der Sloot after the youths told police they left the
young woman alone on the beach.
</P>
<P>
The cryptic message said they needed to talk, People reported.
