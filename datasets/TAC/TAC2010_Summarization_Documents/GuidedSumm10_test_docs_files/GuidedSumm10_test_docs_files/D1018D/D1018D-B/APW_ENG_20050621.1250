A volunteer Texas rescue group said Tuesday it will bring special dogs and sonar
equipment to Aruba to help search for a missing U.S. teenager more than three
weeks after she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Dickinson-based Texas EquuSearch will arrive Wednesday with 17 volunteers,
including three search-and-rescue divers to look for 18-year-old Natalee
Holloway, said volunteer diver Joe Huston in a telephone interview from Houston,
Texas. The volunteers will stay five to seven days depending on how much they
can raise in donations for trip expenses, Huston said.
</P>
<P>
"It's not that anybody has botched this search so far, but we have extensive
experience finding individuals, alive or deceased," he said. "Somebody has to
find Natalee for this family to have closure."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway Twitty, told The Associated Press
that she had a "positive" exchange Tuesday with the parents of one of three
friends detained in the case, 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot.
</P>
<P>
Van der Sloot and his friends Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and Satish Kalpoe, 18, are
believed to be among the last people to see Natalee Holloway the night she
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Holloway Twitty was distributing prayer cards for her daughter around the island
Tuesday when she found herself in Noord, a town in northwestern Aruba where van
der Sloots' parents, justice official Paul van der Sloot and his wife, Anita van
der Sloot, live.
</P>
<P>
Close to the house, Holloway Twitty said something inside pushed her to go the
door.
</P>
<P>
"It was nothing other than Natalee's mother delivering prayer cards and if
things happen along the way, well, they happen," she said. "All I want is the
truth about what happened to Natalee, and I'm willing to do anything to get
it."
</P>
<P>
Holloway Twitty described the interaction with Paul and Anita van der Sloot as
"positive," but declined to give more details.
</P>
<P>
"There was an interaction and there is nothing else I want to disclose right
now," she said.
</P>
<P>
Holloway Twitty met with Paul and Joran van der Sloot on the night of May 30,
about 12 hours after Natalee missed her plane back home. She has described that
meeting as tense and uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
Holloway's uncle, Paul Reynolds, who lives in Houston, asked for the Texas
search group's help because the family was frustrated that three weeks of
searches on the island had turned up nothing.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, the search team planned to meet with Aruban authorities and FBI
officials to review past search routes and plot new areas, Huston
said.
</P>
<P>
Specialists in land searches will cover rough terrain in jeeps while divers,
using specialized sonar equipment and boats, will comb the coastline, he said.
The group also will bring infrared cameras to search at night, Huston
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have found remains of people three to four years after they disappeared,"
Huston said.
</P>
<P>
Aruban authorities accompanied by FBI observers have scoured the island on foot,
in vehicles and using a helicopter with infrared equipment at night. Tourists
and Aruban civilian volunteers also have conducted searches, but none has turned
up any trace of Natalee.
</P>
<P>
Aruban government spokesman Ruben Trapenberg said authorities welcomed the Texas
group's help.
</P>
<P>
"In the end, they are just going to be tourists searching and that's OK,"
Trapenberg said. "And they have specialized equipment, so that's even
better."
</P>
<P>
Attorney General spokeswoman Mariaine Croes said the search team would be under
the guidance of Aruban authorities.
</P>
<P>
"They will be like the FBI, in an advisory role, because the Aruban police force
does the investigation," Croes said.
</P>
<P>
She said it was critical that Aruban authorities be present at any search that
turns up possible evidence to make sure it can be used legally in any future
trial. Evidence collected without such supervision wouldn't likely be accepted
by a judge, she said.
</P>
<P>
Holloway, of Mountain Brook, Alabama, disappeared in the early hours of May 30,
the last day of a five-day vacation with 124 students celebrating their high
school graduation. Her passport and packed bags were found in her
room.
</P>
<P>
Four men have been arrested on suspicion but no one has been
charged.
