The father of a Dutch teenager arrested in the disappearance of a young U.S.
woman told his son and his two friends that "when there is no body you don't
have a case," Aruba's attorney general said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Paul van der Sloot, a judge in training in Aruba, gave his 17-year-old son Joran
van der Sloot and two Surinamese brothers legal advice the day after 18-year-old
Natalee Holloway disappeared, District Attorney Caren Janssen told MSNBC in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
"They spoke about the situation that when there is no body you don't have a
case, and that was already in the first day after the disappearance," Janssen
said.
</P>
<P>
Janssen said that the elder van der Sloot had obstructed the investigation by
asking a friend of Joran, who had been interrogated by police, what he had told
them.
</P>
<P>
Paul van der Sloot, 52, was arrested last Thursday in the disappearance but
released Sunday when a judge ruled there wasn't enough evidence to hold
him.
</P>
<P>
Janssen told MSNBC that the arrest was not based on the father's obstruction of
the investigation, but rather because investigators believed he was also a
suspect in the disappearance.
</P>
<P>
Janssen also said that a month after Holloway's May 30 disappearance,
investigators had found nothing to suggest she had been murdered.
</P>
<P>
"There are no traces, no facts, no circumstances (on which) we can base the
opinion that we are assured that Natalee is not alive anymore," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Calls to Janssen seeking further comment late Wednesday were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
Joran van der Sloot and his Surinamese friends, brothers Deepak Kalpoe, 21, and
Satish Kalpoe, 18, were arrested June 9. No one has been charged.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, Steve Croes, a disc jockey who was arrested and held 10 days
before being released Monday, told The Associated Press that his detention was
based on a lie he told police.
</P>
<P>
Croes, 26, said he told police he had seen Joran van der Sloot and the Kalpoe
brothers drop Holloway off at the Holiday Inn the night she disappeared, as the
three originally told police.
</P>
<P>
"That was a lie," Croes told the AP during an interview Wednesday night. "I
didn't even know those guys and they didn't know me."
</P>
<P>
Croes said that while he was at an Internet cafe a few days after Holloway's
disappearance, he heard Deepak Kalpoe talking on a cell phone about how the
young men had dropped Holloway off. Croes said the story seemed plausible and he
went around repeating it, adding that he had seen them drop her off. Police
questioned and then arrested him, Croes said.
</P>
<P>
"I learned that if you don't know something, keep your mouth shut," said Croes,
who added that after being released from jail, he was fired from his disc jockey
job on the Tattoo party boat.
</P>
<P>
A volunteer rescue group from Texas on Wednesday completed its fifth day of
searches for Holloway but found no sign of her.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers led a Border Collie tracker dog over large swaths of land while sonar
technicians and two scuba divers scoured a handful of coastlines.
</P>
<P>
The searches, which began Saturday, have allowed the private rescue group to
eliminate many areas and prepare for more intense investigations of other places
where Holloway's remains could be found, said Jessica Marish, assistant director
of Dickinson-based Texas EquuSearch.
</P>
<P>
Marish said the group also began a partial pullout from Aruba on Wednesday, with
nine of the 27 volunteers returning home, including five of the original seven
divers and three of the four dogs.
</P>
<P>
"Many people had to go back to their families and jobs," Marish said. "But we
are working on getting more people and dogs back down here."
</P>
<P>
Marish said the 17 remaining volunteers would be on the Caribbean Dutch island
at least through Sunday and possibly longer.
</P>
<P>
Each day leaders had to assess their chances of finding Holloway against how
much money they had to continue working, said Marish, declining to give funding
details.
</P>
<P>
Massive searches by FBI agents, Dutch Marines, Aruban police and thousands of
islanders have produced no trace of Holloway, a recent high school graduate from
Mountain Brook, Alabama.
