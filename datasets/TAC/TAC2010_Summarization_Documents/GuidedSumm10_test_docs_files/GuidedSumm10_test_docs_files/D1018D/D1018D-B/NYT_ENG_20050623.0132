FATHER OF SUSPECT ARRESTED IN CASE OF MISSING ALABAMA TEEN
</HEADLINE>

ORANJESTAD, Aruba
</DATELINE>

<P>
Police on Thursday arrested the father of one
of the suspects in the case of missing Alabama teenager
Natalee Holloway, saying he may have knowledge of her mysterious
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
"There is a reasonable suspicion that he knows something and is
involved in the disappearance," Mariaine (CQ) Croes, a spokeswoman for
the Aruban attorney general's office, told CNN. "He's being interrogated
as a suspect."
</P>
<P>
Paul van der Sloot, a judge-in-training on Aruba, was taken into
custody about 2 p.m., bringing to five the number of
suspects now jailed in the case. His son, Joran, 17,
was last seen with Holloway, 18, on the night of
May 30, hours before she was scheduled to depart Aruba
after a graduation trip with classmates and chaperones from Mountain
Brook High School near Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
Van der Sloot's wife, Anita, told the Associated Press that her
son admitted to her that he changed the story he
told police. After first saying he and two other suspects
dropped Holloway off near her hotel, he now says he
was alone on the beach with the young woman, but
left her there and did not harm her.
</P>
<P>
"He says, 'Mom, I dropped the girl at the beach," Anita
van der Sloot told the AP. "I walked with her.
I left her there because she wanted to stay there.
I left and I don't know what happened. There my
statement ends."'
</P>
<P>
The elder van der Sloot was questioned twice by police last
weekend but was not detained then.
</P>
<P>
His son has been in custody since June 9 when he
was picked up by police along with brothers Satish Kalpoe,
18 and Deepak Kalpoe, 21, who were seen with him
and Holloway shortly before she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The fifth suspect is Steve Gregory Croes, 26, a party-boat disc
jockey who reportedly knows the other suspects and spent time
with them in an internet cafe. Croes is not related
to the attorney general's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Despite intensive searches by hundreds of volunteers, no trace of Holloway
has been found.
</P>
<P>
The new arrest stirred speculation on this resort island of about
100,000 that the baffling case might be nearing a climax.
Police have been extraordinarily tight-lipped about their evidence, but CNN
cited unnamed sources close to the investigation who said the
elder van der Sloot may have been arrested on suspicion
that he helped his son concoct a story about what
happened on the night Holloway disappeared.
</P>
<P>
The legal standard for holding suspects in the early stages of
an investigation is looser under Aruban law than in the
United States. While American police must have probable cause that
a suspect was involved in a crime, in Aruba police
can arrest and question suspects based on a mere reasonable
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
Under Aruban law, Paul van der Sloot can be held for
48 hours for questioning, during which he has the right
to refuse to speak and can ask for an attorney.
At the end of that period, a judge must review
the case and determine whether he can be held for
an additional 8 days.
</P>
<P>
Suspects can be held for a total of 116 days without
formal charges, although their cases are reviewed periodically by a
judge who determines whether their continued incarceration is justified.
</P>
<P>
Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway Twitty, who flew immediately to Aruba and
has not left since learning of her daughter's disappearance, has
said in media interviews that she believes the youths in
custody are the key to the case. She also has
told reporters she has strong feelings that the elder van
der Sloot should be questioned more closely by police for
possible knowledge of the case.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by police, Holloway Twitty spoke with the van der Sloots
the day after her daughter disappeared. The younger van der
Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers, however, were not arrested by
police until 10 days into the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Aruban officials have been sharply criticized in the media for the
slow pace of the investigation, although Holloway's father, Dave Holloway,
said in a recent television interview that he was optimistic
about the progress. American FBI agents, who are assisting in
the case, told him the Aruban police were doing a
good job, Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
The case has set off something off an international media furor,
prompting high school students and parents across the U.S. to
re-think the foreign trips that have become commonplace among American
youths, either as individuals or in groups.
</P>
<P>
Aruba gets about 70 percent of its gross domestic product from
tourism, with about 70 percent of its visitors coming from
the United States. Although the island's extremely low crime rate
is the envy of many other Caribbean destinations, officials worry
that the continued coverage of the Holloway disappearance might eventually
curtail future bookings.
