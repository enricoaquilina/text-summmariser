Volunteer rescuers from Texas led a sniffer dog over large swaths of land and
combed the ocean bottom with sonar Saturday in the latest search for a U.S. teen
who disappeared almost a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Tim Miller, director of Texas EquuSearch, based in Dickenson, Texas, said
searchers were focusing on "five or six areas of interest" on land, but declined
to give details about that or where they were looking in the
sea.
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, the lawyer for one of two Surinamese brothers being held in
connection with Holloway's disappearance confirmed that Satish Kalpoe admitted
lying to police when he told them that he and his brother and their Dutch friend
dropped Holloway off alone at her hotel, the Holiday Inn, the night she
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Satish now claims that he and his brother, Deepak Kalpoe, 21, dropped Holloway
and 17-year-old Joran van der Sloot off together at the Marriott hotel and then
went home.
</P>
<P>
He lied initially "to help his friends, but said at a certain moment, 'I can't
help you anymore,'" his lawyer, David Kock, told The Associated Press. He did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Joran's mother, Anita van der Sloot, 49, told the AP last week that he, too, had
changed his story, acknowledging now that he and Natalee were alone together at
a beach near the Marriott, but she said he insists he left her there and did not
hurt her.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a former security guard detained and released in the case
told reporters that Deepak Kalpoe made the same admission in jail about dropping
off the young couple at the Marriott.
</P>
<P>
A court hearing for the Kalpoes, van der Sloot and van der Sloot's father,
52-year-old Paul van der Sloot, a high-ranking justice official in Aruba, was
postponed Saturday until Sunday because the judge was unable to make it to Aruba
on Saturday from nearby Curacao. The judge must decide whether there is
sufficient cause to continue holding the four. Also in custody is Steve Gregory
Croes a 26-year-old party boat disc jockey.
</P>
<P>
Satish Kalpoe has lost weight and grown a beard in jail, Kock said. He said his
client has told investigators everything he knows and "from what I see there is
no reason to keep detaining him."
</P>
<P>
"Criminal proceedings are not (meant) to keep people under stress so someone
else will confess," Kock said.
</P>
<P>
Deepak Kalpoe's lawyer, Ruud Oomen, told the AP outside the courthouse that his
client also has given police all the information he has "and is
innocent."
</P>
<P>
"If my client knew what happened, he would have told the judge a long time ago,"
Oomen said.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer representing Paul Van der Sloot, A.J. Swann, declined to comment as
he left the courthouse Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Texas EquuSearch's 24 volunteers, including eight rescue divers, arrived late
Friday at the request of Natalee's uncle, Paul Reynolds, who lives in Houston.
They brought four specialized dogs as well as the sonar equipment, which
technicians could be observed testing on a dock near the Holiday Inn, the same
hotel Natalee had stayed in.
</P>
<P>
Ralph Baird, a petroleum engineer from Houston helping in the search, said the
mission would involve pulling a probe with sonar sensors through the ocean at
various depths to create a picture of the sea floor. Baird said those scans
would help divers eliminate areas that didn't have objects appearing in the
shape of a cadaver.
</P>
<P>
"It's sad, but we know we are not going out there to find someone alive," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Miller said the search could cost up to US$100,000 (euro83,000) and that his
group had already raised about US$25,000 (euro21,700).
</P>
<P>
"No matter what happens, we can't leave without Natalee," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Previous searches by Aruban police, Dutch Marines and thousands of volunteer
islanders and tourists have yielded no trace of the honors student, who went
missing May 30, the last day of a five-day trip with 124 fellow students to
celebrate their high school graduation.
