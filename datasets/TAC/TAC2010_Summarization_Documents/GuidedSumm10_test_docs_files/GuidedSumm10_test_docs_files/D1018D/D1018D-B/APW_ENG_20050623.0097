<P>
The parents of a Dutch youth held in the disappearance of an Alabama teen said
Wednesday they believe he is innocent, adding that they don't know how to deal
with this "big nightmare."
</P>
<P>
Paul van der Sloot, a judicial official whose 17-year-old son has been arrested
in the disappearance of Natalee Holloway, offered his first public statements
since Holloway vanished three weeks ago, telling Fox News: "I still believe my
son. It's all very hard."
</P>
<P>
Joran van der Sloot and two friends were arrested 10 days after Holloway, 18,
went missing on May 30. Police say Joran van der Sloot met Holloway at a casino
two days earlier. They say the three young men testified that they took her from
a popular restaurant to a beach, where the Dutch boy and Holloway were kissing
in the back of the car, then dropped her at her Holiday Inn around 2
a.m.
</P>
<P>
Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway Twitty, has insisted that the three know what
happened to her daughter and that police should press them harder to tell the
truth. She has asked why the three were initially released after only a couple
of hours of questioning, and arrested more than a week later.
</P>
<P>
In the Fox interview, Anita van der Sloot, the Dutch teen's mother, said: "Joran
should have been interrogated from the beginning. But they let the kids
go."
</P>
<P>
Mrs. van der Sloot said when she saw her son in jail one night this week "he
still didn't believe it was true. He said 'Mom, the truth will come forward, and
I know that I did not do anything to the girl.' "
</P>
<P>
Mr. van der Sloot has been barred from seeing his son, the attorney general's
office said, because police fear it could harm the investigation. He was
interrogated by police for seven hours over Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. van der Sloot said her son has been interrogated for sometimes hours at a
time, with authorities "calling him psychopath, murderer."
</P>
<P>
George Twitty, Holloway's stepfather, told Fox that in the initial days after
the teen's disappearance, Mr. van der Sloot _ and one of two Surinamese brothers
arrested with Joren van der Sloot _ advised his son not to talk to her
family.
</P>
<P>
"He and the other boy kept saying 'you say nothing,'" Twitty said. "I know that
the father and I know that the son knows a lot more than they're
saying."
</P>
<P>
Mrs. van der Sloot said: "I love my child. I believe in him 200 percent and it's
like a big nightmare." She said her son is an avid athlete who does well in
school.
</P>
<P>
Holloway's father, meanwhile, said Wednesday he was confident that the
investigation into her disappearance was close to being resolved. But dozens of
searches by officials and volunteers have failed to turn up any
trace.
</P>
<P>
His daughter disappeared on the last day of a five-day trip to celebrate her
high school graduation with other students. Her passport and packed bags were
found in her room.
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic," Dave Holloway said during an interview with Associated Press
Television News. "The FBI indicated to me that the (Aruban) police are very
adequate and doing a good job. "
</P>
<P>
Dave Holloway said he also believed the three young men held the key to his
daughter's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
"These three guys cannot commit a perfect crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
A fourth man detained in the case, 26-year-old party boat disc jockey Steve
Gregory Croes, said he knew one of the two Surinamese brothers arrested with
Joren van der Sloot from an Internet cafe, his boss, Marcus Wiggins, has said.
Wiggins' boat, the Tattoo, docks near the Holiday Inn.
