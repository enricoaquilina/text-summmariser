Pro-whaling nations suffer setback at IWC meeting

Pro-whaling countries led by Japan failed to muster a majority Monday at the
annual whaling commission meeting, in a setback for their hopes to control its
agenda and eventually overturn a nearly two-decade ban on commercial whale
hunts.
</P>
<P>
A pair of Japanese proposals were defeated. The first, to delete discussion of
whale sanctuaries from the five-day meeting's agenda, was voted down 29-28 while
the second, to introduce secret balloting, failed 30-27. Both tallies were seen
as a test of whether whaling advocates have built a majority among the 66
members of the International Whaling Commission.
</P>
<P>
A majority would give pro-whaling countries broad authority to set the
commission's agenda. However, it would still fall far short of the
three-fourth's vote required to overturn the moratorium on commercial
whaling.
</P>
<P>
The Cambridge, England-based commission that regulates whaling banned commercial
hunts in 1986, handing environmentalists a major victory in protecting species
that were near extinction after centuries of whaling.
</P>
<P>
Norway holds the world's only commercial whaling season in defiance of the ban.
Japan kills whales for what it describes as scientific research, but sells the
meat. Japan, Norway and other nations this year are expected to take more than
1,550 whales.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand, Australia and conservationist groups such as Greenpeace oppose any
expansion of whaling.
</P>
<P>
Japan is against new whale sanctuaries and proposed that this issue _ and others
opposed by pro-whaling countries _ be pushed off the agenda at the opening of
the commission's annual general assembly in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"That was a defeat for Japan," New Zealand Conservation Minister Chris Carter
said after the first vote.
</P>
<P>
A simple majority of pro-whaling nations would be able to pass resolutions
favoring their stance at the IWC, including ones that express support for
Japan's research program or voice backing for the resumption of limited
kills.
</P>
<P>
"Transparency and democratic principles at the IWC are safe for another year,"
said Patrick R. Ramage, director of communications at the U.S.-based
International Fund for Animal Welfare, after the motion on secret ballots was
rejected.
</P>
<P>
Japan and its allies, which include many small island nations such as the
Solomon Islands and St. Kitts and Nevis, say secret ballots protect smaller
countries from intimidation by larger ones.
</P>
<P>
In a widely expected move, Japan said Monday it would potentially double its
scientific whaling in the Antarctic Ocean, killing as many as 935 minke whales
annually _ up from 440 _ in a new program beginning later this
year.
</P>
<P>
It also said it would add humpback and fin whales to its research whaling, the
first time those varieties would be included.
</P>
<P>
The United States earlier this month urged against any expansion in Tokyo's
research hunt, with its research agency National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration saying any increase in the "number or type of whales killed and
marketed under the guise of science is unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Last year's whaling panel meeting ended with a resolution for Japan to halt its
research program. That generated angry calls in Tokyo for the country to
retaliate by quitting the group, or at least withhold funding.
