   The 62 members of the International Whaling 
Commission meet in South Korea's former whaling port of Ulsan next 
week for what is expected to be a showdown between pro-hunting 
countries and their critics.
   With warnings that a 19-year ban on commercial whaling is at 
risk of disintegrating, whaling nations led by Japan are expected to 
announce an increase in the size of their so-called scientific 
catches.
   Anti-whaling countries led by Australia are promising to do all 
they can to uphold the ban and pressurise Japan into ending its 
cull.
   Ahead of the week-long meeting opening Monday, Agence 
France-Presse will move the following stories:

   Japan is ready to battle "fanatic" anti-whaling nations at an 
upcoming international meeting and could stage a walk-out, believing 
the hunt is an inseparable part of its culture.
