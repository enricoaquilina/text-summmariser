Anti-whaling nations 
Australia, New Zealand and Britain on Monday tore apart Japan's 
proposal to expand its whale hunt, saying the practice had no 
scientific justification and should be consigned to history.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the International Whaling Commission 
meeting in Ulsan, South Korea, Australian Environment Minister Ian 
Campbell said Japan's research whaling programme was an "outrage".
</P>
<P>
Voting at the meeting, he said, "will come down to a clash 
between those who want to continue to whale and to expand whaling in 
this millennium and those of us who want to see whaling relegated to 
an historic fact from the last millennium."
</P>
<P>
Japan on Monday informed the meeting it intended to double its 
catch of minke whales to some 880 and enlarge the cull to include 
endangered fin and humpback species.
</P>
<P>
The scientific programme is allowed under a special clause in a 
19-year moratorium on whaling that critics say allows commercial 
hunting by the back door but which Japan, Norway and Iceland want to 
be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's Conservation Minister Chris Carter launched an 
outspoken attack on Japan's plan: "New Zealand totally rejects 
Japan's proposals to double the number of whales slaughtered in the 
Southern Ocean," he told journalists.
</P>
<P>
"Where is the science from 18 years of scientific whaling? Where 
is the science? It doesn't exist."
</P>
<P>
He said New Zealand's whale watching tourist sector, which earns 
tens of millions of dollars a year, would likely suffer as a result 
of the extension in the cull to humpbacks.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very healthy whale-watch operation in New Zealand... 
These are our whales, they're Fiji's whales, they're Tonga's 
whales... What right does Japan have to go into the Southern Ocean 
and slaughter these rare marine mammals?
</P>
<P>
"I say to Japan it's an outrage. I say shame that you are 
preparing to slaughter a species that is already in danger."
</P>
<P>
Responding to Japan's contention that whaling is part of its 
cultural heritage, he said tradition had never extended to the 
antarctic waters where Japan now caught most of its whales.
</P>
<P>
"Is Japan a poor nation? Does it need the protein...? No it does 
not. Japan says it is a cultural tradition... Japan has no cultural 
tradition of hunting whales in the Southern Ocean. We say shame!"
</P>
<P>
Ben Bradshaw, the British minister responsible for fisheries 
said the kind of suffering that many whales were subjected to, was 
"totally unacceptable in 2005."
</P>
<P>
"We don't think there's a humane way to kill a whale," he said, 
adding: "This is an absolutely vital IWC meeting... Future 
generations will not forgive this meeting if we go backwards in our 
conservation of whales."
