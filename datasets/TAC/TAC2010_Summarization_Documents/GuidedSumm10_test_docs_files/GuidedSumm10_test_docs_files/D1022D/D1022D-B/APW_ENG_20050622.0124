Australia urges Japan to stop expanded research whaling

Australia condemned Japan's plan to more than double the number of whales it
kills in the name of scientific research, pushing for a vote on the issue
Wednesday at the annual meeting of the commision that regulates global
whaling.
</P>
<P>
An Australian resolution submitted to the International Whaling Commission's
annual gathering calls for Japan to review its plan announced earlier this week
to boost its annual take of minke whales in the Antarctic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Japan on Monday said it would annually kill as many as 935 of the small,
non-endangered species, up from 440 this year, under an expansion of the
research whaling program it began one year after the IWC banned killing whales
for profit. Critics call Japan's program commercial whaling in
disguise.
</P>
<P>
Japan says it must kill whales to study them. It then sells the meat, which is
allowed under commission rules. The United States has criticized the decision to
expand the research hunts, saying scientific advances make it unnecessary to
kill whales to study them.
</P>
<P>
"There's no justification for lethally based science," Australian Environment
Minister Ian Campbell told The Associated Press. "We need to be
cautious."
</P>
<P>
Japan plans its own resolution in support of the expanded hunt, which for the
first time would also allow the killing of humpback and fin whales.
</P>
<P>
Australia's motion comes one day after the commission resoundingly rejected a
proposal to end the ban on commercial whaling, dealing a blow to Japan and other
pro-whaling nations that say stocks of some species have recovered enough to
allow limited hunts.
</P>
<P>
Commission members voted 29-23 against the Japanese plan for regulated
sustainable whaling, which needed a three-fourths majority to pass. There were
five abstentions, including countries such as Pacific Island nation Kiribati
that have voted with Japan on other issues at the annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
Norway holds the world's only commercial whaling season in defiance of the ban.
Commission rules allow members to reject decisions they oppose. In all, whaling
nations are expected to kill more than 1,550 of the mammals this
year.
</P>
<P>
The IWC banned commercial hunts in 1986 because species were near extinction
after centuries of whaling.
</P>
<P>
Japan and other pro-whaling nations knew they had virtually no chance of
garnering the votes needed to overturn the moratorium at this year's gathering,
which runs through Friday in the South Korean port city of Ulsan.
</P>
<P>
Still, they were hoping for a simple majority in support of the proposal, which
would have indicated that opinion among commission members had turned in favor
of supporting commercial whale hunts.
</P>
<P>
Japan maintains that whaling is a national tradition and a vital part of its
food culture. It says whale stocks have sufficiently recovered since 1986 to
allow the resumption of limited hunts of certain species.
</P>
<P>
Countries led by Australia and New Zealand and conservation groups including
Greenpeace reject that view. They advocate protecting all whales and encouraging
alternative ways of profiting from them, through tourism and
whale-watching.
</P>
<P>
Japan says it is considering leaving the commission.
