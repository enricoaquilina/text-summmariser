Whalers brace for battle with anti-hunt critics

<P>
Whaling nations are set for a showdown 
with their critics in South Korea next week, and frustration on both 
sides is threatening to scupper an international agreement designed 
to protect whale stocks.
</P>
<P>
The emotive issue pits pro-whaling nations such as Japan, Norway 
and Iceland against anti-catch countries led by Australia and New 
Zealand and backed by a raft of environmental organisations and 
conservationists.
</P>
<P>
At stake is a 19-year-old moratorium on commercial whaling that 
pro-catch nations say is no longer necessary because of recovering 
whale herds, arguing sustainable hunts should be resumed under a 
strict system of quotas.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have been busy lobbying support in the run-up to the 
International Whaling Commission meeting, with Australian 
Environment Minister Ian Campbell saying ahead of a visit to three 
member states this month he was on a "life and death mission for 
whales".
</P>
<P>
But in private, delegates concede that with neither the pro- nor 
anti-whaling side likely to be able to count on the three quarters 
majority needed to change the status quo, the meeting in South 
Korea's former whaling port of Ulsan will likely result in a 
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
The risk is Japan and other whaling nations will opt to leave 
the commission out of frustration at what they increasingly see as a 
dysfunctional body and create their own bloc for commercial 
whaling.
</P>
<P>
"If all anti-whaling countries become like Australia, we would 
have no reason to stay at the IWC. We would have to take a 
withdrawal card out of our pocket," said Hideki Moronuki of Japan's 
Fisheries Agency told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"We keep it as an option."
</P>
<P>
One pro-whaling nation, Denmark, has already said it will push 
for the whaling ban to be lifted at the meeting, with Foreign 
Minister Per Stig Moeller warning this week: "If we stick to the 
ban, the IWC will fall apart."
</P>
<P>
The 62-member IWC has since 1986 held together the moratorium on 
commercial whaling, although Norway opted out of the ban and 
continues to hunt while Japan, Iceland and two Danish territories 
conduct whaling under exclusions.
</P>
<P>
Both Japan and Iceland use a get-out clause in the moratorium 
allowing whaling for scientific research to cull some 700 whales a 
year between them, with the meat mostly ending up in Japanese school 
dinners and in markets.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's Greenland and Faroe Islands hunt within the framework 
of what the IWC calls "aboriginal subsistence whaling."
</P>
<P>
Japan is expected to argue at this year's meeting that the 
recovery in whale populations over the last 20 years means its 
scientific cull of minke whales can be doubled to some 880 and 
extended to humpback and fin whales.
</P>
<P>
Both are endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Conservationists counter that modern scientific means to monitor 
whale populations mean that, if anything, the cull should be 
scrapped and non-lethal means used to conduct experiments on the 
animals.
</P>
<P>
Any extension of the cull to humpback whales would be sure to 
anger Australia and New Zealand, where whale-watching tours bring in 
hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Japan proffers the argument that whaling is an essential part of 
its heritage that if conducted sustainably and through strict quotas 
should be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
Recovering whale stocks, it says, are increasingly swallowing up 
its fishing industry's profits.
</P>
<P>
A group of environmental organisations including Greenpeace and 
the International Fund for Animal Welfare this month urged Japan to 
halt scientific catches, arguing nothing short of the future of 
whale populations was at stake.
</P>
<P>
"Japan chooses to ignore the fact that since the original treaty 
on whaling was written, science has moved into the 21st century. The 
vast majority of information once gathered from dead whales can now 
be obtained using modern non-lethal scientific methods," they said 
in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
It labelled Japan's research programme "outdated and 
questionable" and said expansion of the cull should not be allowed 
to continue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the WWF conservation group laid into the 
hunt, saying the science it relied on "would not pass peer review by 
scientists associated with any reputable journal."
</P>
<P>
"It is extraordinary that Japan, one of the most 
technologically-advanced nations in the world, continues to kill an 
estimated 650 whales a year using 1940s science in the 21st 
century," said Susan Lieberman, director of the WWF's Global Species 
Programme.
</P>
<P>
"We call on Japan to live up to its reputation as a 
technologically and scientifically advanced nation, and put an end 
to 'scientific' whaling," she said.
</P>
<P>
The WWF described Japan's argument that whales threatened fish 
stocks as Japan's "biggest myth," saying: "Not one of their studies 
on this has been accepted for publication in any international 
scientific journal."
