Australian government foils court challenge against Japanese 
whaling

<P>
The Australian government on Friday 
foiled a court bid by international animal rights activists to stop 
a Japanese company from killing whales inside the country's 
Antarctic sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
The Humane Society International went to a federal court in 
Sydney seeking permission to take legal against the whaling company 
Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha.
</P>
<P>
The group accuses the company of unlawfully hunting more than 
400 minke whales over the past four years in Australian waters near 
Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
But federal court justice Jim Allsop dismissed the application 
because a government submission said legal action against the 
company could damage relations with Tokyo and jeopardise Australia's 
national interests.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian government has the view that the attempt to 
enforce the EPBC Act (to stop the killing of whales) may upset the 
diplomatic status quo ... and may be contrary to Australia's long 
term national interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said in the submission given to 
the court in January that the government had no right to enforce its 
law on Japan because Tokyo did not recognise Australia's claim of 
territorial sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory.
</P>
<P>
"The submissions of the attorney-general appear to have great 
force," Allsop said in his ruling.
</P>
<P>
Humane Society campaign director Michael Kennedy said he was 
"bitterly disappointed" by the ruling but said his group may appeal 
the decision to the full bench of the Federal Court.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party assailed the government's 
intervention in the case, which coincides with efforts by Japan to 
gain permission from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to 
double the number of whales it can kill each year.
</P>
<P>
A statement by Labor foreign affairs spokesman Kevin Rudd said 
Friday's court ruling "has confirmed the Howard governments 
spineless and hypocritical response to the slaughter of whales in 
the Australian Whale Sanctuary".
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week Prime Minister John Howard personally wrote to 
his Japanese counterpart, Junichiro Koizumi, urging him to scrap the 
plan to increase Japan's whale kill.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese plan is due to go before the International Whaling 
Commission (IWC) when it meets in South Korea next month.
</P>
<P>
Japan, where whale meat is part of the traditional cuisine, 
reluctantly accepted a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling by the 
IWC.
</P>
<P>
But it resumed catches in 1987 using a loophole that allows 
"research whaling" and selling the meat on the market, a practice 
condemned by environmentalists as commercial whaling in disguise.
</P>
<P>
"For the past week Labor has been calling on the government to 
take action against Japan in the International Court of Justice," 
Rudd said.
</P>
<P>
"This position has only been reinforced today by the decision of 
the Federal Court."
