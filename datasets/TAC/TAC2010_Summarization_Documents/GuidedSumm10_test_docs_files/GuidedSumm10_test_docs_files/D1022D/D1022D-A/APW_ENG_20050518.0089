Japan's bid to harvest more whales is "very bad," Australia's PM says

Australia's prime minister on Wednesday criticized a move by Japan to increase
its whale harvest in the Antarctic as a "very bad decision," but stood by his
policy of not intercepting Japanese whaling boats.
</P>
<P>
The International Whaling Commission, or IWC, banned commercial whaling in 1986,
but grants limited permits to countries such as Japan that maintain whaling
programs for scientific purposes.
</P>
<P>
Japan announced in April it plans to seek permission to extend its research
whaling program in the Antarctic when the IWC meets later this
month.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Prime Minister John Howard on Wednesday defended his decision not to
intercept whaling boats found in Antarctic waters, saying Japan and many other
countries do not recognize Australian territorial claims in Antarctica and a
whaling sanctuary that is protected under Australian law.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian claim is not recognized by a lot of countries around the world,"
Howard told Southern Cross radio in the Queensland state capital, Brisbane. "If
there were any attempt by force to interfere with whaling activities otherwise
sanctioned by international agreements, it would be a breach of international
agreements."
</P>
<P>
Howard said he would prefer to use diplomatic measures to encourage Japan not to
kill whales in Antarctic waters, and said Australia was working with the United
States, New Zealand and England to urge Tokyo to reconsider its
proposal.
</P>
<P>
"There are other ways of trying to change what I regard as a very bad decision
by the Japanese, a very bad decision," he added.
</P>
<P>
Howard also criticized Japan _ which kills about 400 minke whales in Antarctic
waters each year _ for reported plans to harvest humpback whales, which were
severely depleted by commercial whaling in the early part of last
century.
</P>
<P>
"It is not science to harvest 400 whales. It is not," Howard said. "The decision
to go after the humpback whales as well _ the decision cannot be justified on
scientific grounds."
</P>
<P>
Whaling opponents say Japan is using research as a pretext to continue the
commercial sale of whale meat. Proceeds of about US$52 million (euro41.15
million) go back into funding the annual hunts.
</P>
<P>
The 57-member IWC is scheduled to hold its annual meeting in Ulsan, South Korea,
from May 27 to June 24. Japan has threatened to withdraw from the commission if
it does not get approval for increased whaling.
