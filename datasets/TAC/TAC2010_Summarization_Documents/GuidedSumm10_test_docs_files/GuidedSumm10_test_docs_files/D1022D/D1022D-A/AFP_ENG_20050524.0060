<P>
Tokyo will not yield to foreign pressure 
seeking to stop it from whaling, a fisheries official said Tuesday 
after Australia stepped up a campaign against Japan's annual hunt in 
the name of scientific research.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard took the unusual step of 
intervening personally. He wrote to his counterpart Junichiro 
Koizumi, urging Japan to scrap reported plans to include species 
considered endangered among those hunted.
</P>
<P>
But the Fisheries Agency, without commenting on plans to kill 
more whales near Australian waters, said Japan would continue the 
whaling which it argues is done for scientific research.
</P>
<P>
"Our position on research whaling will not change just because 
of foreign pressure," said Takanori Nagatomo, deputy director at the 
Far Seas Fisheries Division of the agency.
</P>
<P>
"We have been engaging in research whaling to collect scientific 
data so we can resume commercial whaling," he said, adding the 
agency has not been under any pressure from Koizumi's office or the 
foreign ministry. 
</P>
<P>
"Whaling is also part of the Japanese culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
Japan, where whale meat is part of the traditional cuisine, 
reluctantly accepted a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling by the 
International Whaling Commission (IWC).
</P>
<P>
But it resumed catches in 1987 using a loophole that allows 
"research whaling" and selling the meat on the market, a practice 
condemned by environmentalists as commercial whaling in disguise.
</P>
<P>
Japan says lethal research is necessary for accurate data on 
whales' ages, eating habits and other details and to prove its view 
that such whale species as minkes are thriving and consuming 
valuable fish stock.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo will reportedly tell the IWC at a meeting starting this 
month in South Korea that it intends to nearly double its annual 
catch of minke whales in the Antarctic Ocean, currently set at 440.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to catch the larger humpback and fin whales which 
are considered endangered by the World Conservation Union, Japanese 
news reports said.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Koizumi, Howard challenged the Japanese claim 
that it needs to expand its whale kill for research purposes.
</P>
<P>
"Given that non-lethal methods exist for scientific research, 
Australia believes that there is no basis for killing whales," wrote 
Howard, noting that 1.6 million tourists flock to Australian shores 
to watch the whale migration each year.
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Ian Campbell said Australia was "prepared 
to raise this at levels that it's never been raised before."
</P>
<P>
"The sort of efforts that the prime minister has put in and the 
efforts I've been putting in over many months will continue over the 
next few weeks, and we won't stop until we achieve success," 
Campbell said on ABC radio.
</P>
<P>
"We're working internationally. We're working bilaterally. We're 
very, very keen to see firstly, no reopening of commercial whaling, 
and very importantly, no scientific whaling in the future," he 
said.
</P>
<P>
Howard recently agreed to dispatch 450 troops to guard Japanese 
army engineers in southern Iraq despite domestic opposition to the 
move. He visited Tokyo last month and said relations between the two 
countries had never been closer, but that "good friends should 
always feel free to disagree".
