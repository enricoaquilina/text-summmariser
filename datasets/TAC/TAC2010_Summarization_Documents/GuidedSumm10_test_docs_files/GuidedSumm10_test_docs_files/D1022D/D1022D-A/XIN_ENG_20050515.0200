New Zealand is seeking all 
options including a possible legal fight against Japan's plan to 
kill endangered humpback whales, local media said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Conservation Minister Chris Carter told NZPA, a news agency, 
that he understands the Japanese want to add 80 of each of 
hampback and fin whales to its legal kill lists.
</P>
<P>
Japan plans to go to the meeting of the International Whaling 
Commission (IWC) in South Korea in June asking to double its kill 
of about 440 minke whales a year for so-called scientific purposes,
and also add humpback and fin whales to the list.
</P>
<P>
Carter, who is to attend the IWC meeting, said New Zealand is 
fighting the proposal on a number of counts, and taking a case to 
the World Court is one option.
</P>
<P>
Green Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons said only words are 
not enough to stop Japan's plans for the slaughter and the New 
Zealand "Government must take serious action against Japan."
</P>
<P>
Challenging the plans in the World Court should be considered, 
said Fitzsimons.
</P>
<P>
"The humpback whale was almost hunted into extinction. We 
cannot allow it to become a target for Japanese harpoon guns," she
said.
