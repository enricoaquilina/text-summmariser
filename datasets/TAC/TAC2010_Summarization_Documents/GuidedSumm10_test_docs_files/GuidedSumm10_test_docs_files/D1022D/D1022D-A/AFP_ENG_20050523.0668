Australia vows unprecedented drive to curb Japan whale kill

<P>
Australia said Tuesday it was engaged in 
an unprecedented diplomatic campaign to disuade Japan from trying to 
escalate its killing of whales.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard intervened personally, writing to his 
Japanese counterpart Junichiro Koizumi at the weekend to urge Tokyo 
to reconsider its position on whaling, Environment Minister Ian 
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo has applied to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) 
for permission to nearly double its annual catch of Minke whales, 
currently set at 440, and to catch the larger humpback and fin 
whales which are considered endangered by the World Conservation 
Union.
</P>
<P>
Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly 
halted commercial whaling in line with a 1986 IWC moratorium, but 
the next year resumed catches under a loophole that allows "research 
whaling".
</P>
<P>
Tokyo is believed to have the votes needed to get its request 
approved at the next IWC meeting which begins Friday in South 
Korea.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Koizumi, Howard challenged the Japanese claim 
that it needs to expand its whale kill for research purposes.
</P>
<P>
"Given that non-lethal methods exist for scientific research, 
Australia believes that there is no basis for killing whales," 
Howard wrote in the two-page letter, excerpts of which were 
published in The Daily Telegraph Tuesday and confirmed by Campbell.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who recently agreed to dispatch 450 troops to guard 
Japanese army engineers in southern Iraq despite domestic opposition 
to the move and visited Tokyo last month, said relations between the 
two countries had never been closer, but that "good friends should 
always feel free to disagree".
</P>
<P>
The IWC meeting coincides with the start of Australia's whale 
watching season, when hundreds of humpbacks swim up the east coast 
seeking warmer waters during the southern winter.
</P>
<P>
Howard noted in his letter that some 1.6 million tourists flock 
to Australian shores to watch the whale migration each year.
</P>
<P>
"This is clear evidence of the extent of public interest in the 
continued health and welfare of whales and considerable public 
concern could be expected, not only in Australia, but across the 
globe, were whaling to increase," he said.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said Howard's strongly-worded letter underscored 
Australia's determination to fight Japan's whaling plan.
</P>
<P>
"The sort of efforts that the prime minister has put in and the 
efforts I've been putting in over many months will continue over the 
next few weeks, and we won't stop until we achieve success," 
Campbell said on ABC radio.
</P>
<P>
"What the prime minister has demonstrated is that we are 
prepared to raise this at levels that it's never been raised 
before," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We're working internationally, we're working bilaterally, we're 
very, very keen to see firstly, no reopening of commercial whaling, 
and very importantly, no scientific whaling in the future," he 
said.
