Cleaning Up the Bay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C., and
several states vowed that the Chesapeake Bay would be cleaned up
within 10 years. Since then, experts on the bay say it has become only
slightly healthier. The blame is laid on a bureaucracy that spent the
first half of the 10-year window on a marathon planning process. Here
is the progress on a few of the important goals for the bay, based on
information from the EPA's Chesapeake Bay Program.

Goals Off Track
</P>
<P>
Subject ... Goal ... Progress
</P>
<P>
Oysters ... Tenfold increase by 2010 ... Harvests declining
sharply, falling 92% between 2000 and 2004
</P>
<P>
Underwater grasses ... 185,000 acres by 2010 ... After some
increases, pollution swept down by heavy rains in 2003 destroyed many
grasses; at last count, there were about 64,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
Pollution ... Reduce problems so the bay can be removed from the
EPA's ``impaired waters'' list by 2010 ... Behind schedule; pollution
continues to cause large areas of ``bad water'' lacking enough oxygen.

<P>
Goals On Track
</P>
<P>
Subject ... Goal ... Progress
</P>
<P>
Land conservation ... Permanently preserve from development 20
percent of the land area in the watershed by 2010 ... 19.5% preserved
</P>
<P>
Brownfields (areas with polluted soil) ... By 2010, rehabilitate
and restore 1,050 brownfield sites to productive use ... 414
