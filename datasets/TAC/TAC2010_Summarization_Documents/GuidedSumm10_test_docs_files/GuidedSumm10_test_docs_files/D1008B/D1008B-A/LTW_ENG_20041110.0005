Advocates for Bay to Sue EPA

<P>
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation will file a lawsuit
against the Environmental Protection Agency Wednesday, signaling a
more aggressive strategy for a group that has grown increasingly
frustrated over the slow progress in cleaning up the bay.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, a copy of which was released Tuesday, accuses the
federal agency of dragging its feet as sewage plants across the region
pollute the bay's waters. Specifically, the suit asks that the EPA
respond formally to the bay foundation petition submitted in December
seeking limits on the amount of nitrogen released from such plants.
</P>
<P>
``Our only recourse is to litigate,'' said William C. Baker, the
bay foundation's president. ``We've tried ... to give EPA a chance to
fulfill its promises.''
</P>
<P>
The suit is one of several recent legal steps initiated by
environmental groups, which traditionally have relied on consensus,
rather than confrontation, with government agencies in the effort to
clean up the bay.
</P>
<P>
The foundation already is suing Virginia over what it believes were
lax pollution permits issued for a sewage plant in Onancock and a
Philip Morris industrial plant. And Maryland watermen are considering
a class-action lawsuit against polluters, including sewage treatment
plants and manufacturers that dump into the bay's watershed.
</P>
<P>
The key issue in the legal action to be filed Wednesday is
nitrogen, which along with phosphorus serves as food for huge algae
blooms in the bay. Scientists blame these algae for creating ``bad
water'' where fish and crabs cannot breathe.
</P>
<P>
For those trying to clean the bay, the problem is that nitrogen
comes from everywhere, including from animal manure that washes off
farm fields and from leaky septic systems. The more than 350 sewage
plants in the Chesapeake Bay watershed account for about 21 percent of
its nitrogen, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
In its petition filed in December, the bay foundation noted that
almost none of those sewage plants had permits that limited nitrogen
pollution and asked the EPA to remedy that.
</P>
<P>
EPA regulators responded with a draft proposal that eventually
would impose such permits on most of the plants. That plan, if
authorized by EPA leaders, could be implemented by spring, agency
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
``There's no disagreement with the bay foundation that this is a
necessary next step,'' said Jon Capacasa, an official at the EPA
regional office that oversees the bay.
</P>
<P>
But the federal agency has not provided a formal answer to the bay
foundation's demands, and Baker said the draft proposal contains
``weasel words'' that might allow the EPA to back out of key
provisions.
</P>
<P>
So the bay foundation decided to go to court, asking a federal
judge in Washington D.C. to speed up the EPA's formal response.
</P>
<P>
Baker said that environmentalists are frustrated that the bay has
made so little progress in the three decades since the cleanup began,
and particularly in the four years since the signing of the landmark
Chesapeake 2000 agreement.
</P>
<P>
That agreement -- signed by the EPA, the D.C. mayor and the
governors of Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania -- set a goal of
removing the Chesapeake from the national ``impaired waters'' list by
2010. With nearly half the time gone, most of the efforts are still in
the planning stages, and Baker said his organization has lost patience
with the EPA.
</P>
<P>
``We think that 41/2 years is enough time to determine that they
are not interested'' in moving more quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Still, some observers, including Bill Matuszeski, who formerly
oversaw the EPA's Chesapeake cleanup effort, worry that lawsuits might
bog down the process further. ``Tying this whole issue up in court
isn't going to move it forward at all,'' he said.
