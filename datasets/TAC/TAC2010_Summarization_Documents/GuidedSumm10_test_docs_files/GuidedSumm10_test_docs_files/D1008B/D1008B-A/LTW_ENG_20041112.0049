Md. Family Clings to Oyster Despite Prospects
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For weeks this fall, even as St. Mary's County celebrated the
beginning of oyster season with festivals and contests, Tucker and
Agnes Brown couldn't find oysters. Most days, the stainless steel
sinks and tables inside their shuck house were shining, untouched.
</P>
<P>
Leaves yellowed and crab apples fell, and often the radio played
country songs to no one, echoing through the empty cinderblock
building.
</P>
<P>
``We're dead in the water,'' Tucker Brown said.
</P>
<P>
The decline of the region's oyster population has changed life on
the water, but the Browns keep looking ahead. Maybe the government
will bring in a new kind of oyster that can survive in the bay. Or
maybe, once again, they'll think of something new with which to patch
their business together.
</P>
<P>
For decades, the Browns, like most watermen, have adapted as
diseases, pollution and commercial fisheries have taken their toll on
the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers. Oysters, an important filter for
the water and once the mainstay of the region's fishing industry, have
been decimated, their numbers dropping to historic lows.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s and '80s, before diseases started their rampant spread
through the bay, the average harvest reported to the Maryland
Department of Natural Resources was more than 2 million bushels. This
year, DNR officials expect about 15,000. Just a few years ago, there
were thousands of people oystering in Maryland; this year, they expect
fewer than 150.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Virginia Marine Resources Commission issued more than
2,000 licenses for oystering; in 2003, it issued about 300. And on the
Potomac -- famous for its Oyster Wars five or six decades ago, when
shots were fired over fishing rights and fast boats slipped past the
authorities at night -- little or no harvest is anticipated this year.
</P>
<P>
The effects are deeply felt in St. Mary's, where so much of life
once revolved around oysters. Generations of watermen worked long
winter days gathering them; shuckers spent nights cracking them open;
families scalded, fried, steamed and ate them.
</P>
<P>
At the Blessing of the Fleet, where for decades St. Mary's
residents have marked the beginning of the season, there were hardly
any workboats to sanctify this year. And at the recent St. Mary's
County Oyster Festival, which draws thousands and crowns a national
shucking champion, organizers had to ship in shellfish from Texas and
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the Browns have shifted more and more to
buying from the Gulf of Mexico. This year, even the gulf couldn't fill
their early orders after heavy rains closed some oyster beds.
</P>
<P>
By early next year, state and federal agencies expect to complete
research on restoring the native oyster to the Chesapeake Bay. The
studies will also examine the potential impact of introducing a new
species of oyster that appears resistant to the diseases.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists worry they won't have answers that quickly, but the
Browns are tired of waiting. ``If something goes wrong, what's any
worse than what we've got?'' Tucker Brown asked.
</P>
<P>
He said if the scientists don't start putting the non-native oyster
into Maryland waters soon, someone else could throw some overboard.
</P>
<P>
``We have to try to make it work,'' he said. The bay needs oysters.
``When one part of it dies, you have to figure out, how am I going to
get to another part?''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
That's how it's always been in Avenue, a St. Mary's neighborhood
with stacks of just-chopped firewood, sheds, wheelbarrows and tarps.
St. Patrick Creek curls around the Browns' land, with family and
friends living along both shores. People remember favors there.
</P>
<P>
Tucker Brown grew up a waterman in a family of watermen, and in his
67 years, he said, he's just about tried it all.
</P>
<P>
He's fished. He's eeled. He's dropped pots for crabs. He's helped
move seed out of hatcheries to oyster bars, and he's kept a hand in
the Maryland Watermen's Association. He's hopeful about aquaculture.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Out on the water, the oysters have kept dying.
</P>
<P>
``It started to dwindle down, and then it just, like -- dropped,''
said Kim Beveridge, 38, the Browns' middle daughter, who works with
her parents in the shuck house. ``It dropped so bad. Suddenly, nobody
had it. Dad wasn't able to fill his orders.''
</P>
<P>
This year, even the harvest of gulf oysters was stalled by storms.
</P>
<P>
``We're desperate,'' Agnes Brown said one morning this fall when
people kept calling and knocking on their door, looking for oysters,
and the couple spent much of the night driving to deliver bait. ``Some
days I sit here, I don't want to do this anymore. ... But you know
what's behind you. Just look ahead. ... You find something else to
take its place.''
</P>
<P>
Finally, this week, they got a shipment. On Wednesday morning,
shuckers stood on wooden boxes, spraying mud as they pried open
oysters, dropping the slippery meat into dripping pails. Beveridge
shoveled ice around jars of sealed oysters. Toogie Copsey of
Mechanicsville, Md., who works for the Browns, smashed shells down a
metal chute with a long pole, clearing space to shuck some more.
</P>
<P>
Tucker Brown pulled off his rubber apron and gloves to check on the
empty shells pouring out as his wife walked in with a clipboard of
orders. For now, they're busy. And just in case, they're thinking of
ideas for a new business -- another try.
