PATUXENT RIVER, Md.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sun had just risen over the Patuxent
River when the crew of the Aquarius launched its routine: casting a
30-foot net off the trawler's bow, hauling it in and flinging its
contents of writhing fish and crabs onto a wooden slab. Members
measured each creature and weighed it, then headed back to the lab to
dissect each one and study what it had eaten.
</P>
<P>
It's a ritual that scientists and anglers have performed for ages
in an effort to understand the world beneath the water's surface.
</P>
<P>
But what happens to the data collected on the Aquarius is totally
new, a small part of an ongoing revolution in how humans manage marine
life. The new way of thinking comes after the numbers of cod, scallops
and oysters have declined precipitously.
</P>
<P>
``Many people feel fisheries management has generally failed to
preserve fish, and they're looking to a`new holy grail,'' said Michael
Orbach, who teaches marine policy at Duke University and has advised
the government on fisheries management and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Government regulators had set population targets for each species
and type separately, aiming only to maintain certain numbers. But now
regulators say they want to manage the nation's fisheries as one big
ecosystem, basing their targets on many elements, including the diet
of water birds, the quality of the water and whether predator fish
have enough prey.
</P>
<P>
``Our classical approaches have been like trying to understand
traffic problems by focusing on the cars without focusing on the
road,'' said Thomas Miller, an ecologist with the University of
Maryland's Chesapeake Biological Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the movement is the Chesapeake Bay, where federal
regulators are launching a test case for ``ecosystem-based
management.'' At issue are two of the nation's most important fish:
the striped bass and the Atlantic menhaden. Each has its champions.
</P>
<P>
The bass spawn in the bay and are favorites of gourmets and
recreational anglers, who bring the bay area about $500 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
The menhaden -- an oily, inedible, bony little fish -- is the basis
of this country's second-largest commercial fishing industry. It is
used in a variety of products from cattle feed to vitamin supplements.
About a third of the menhaden caught in the United States are caught
in Virginia and off the North Carolina coast, the two East Coast
states that allow menhaden processing.
</P>
<P>
As a key source of food for other fish and a major filter for the
algae and other particles in the bay, the menhaden ``ecologically
speaking, (is) the most important animal'' in the bay, the Chesapeake
Bay Foundation says.
</P>
<P>
``We should look at menhaden as a keystone of the Chesapeake Bay,
rather than a little, oily, bony thing out of which you can make cat
food,'' said David Festa, director of the Oceans Program at the
Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
Many conservation and anglers groups accuse the menhaden industry,
which uses spotter planes to locate schools, of catching too many fish
-- starving the striped bass and upsetting the bay ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
The industry has responded by blaming the bass. As their numbers
grow, industry officials said, bass are eating too many menhaden.
</P>
<P>
As federal biologists begin to test ecosystem-based management, the
debate around menhaden and bass is heating up. Conservation and
anglers' groups each have said they are sure the new approach will
prove their points.
</P>
<P>
Industry advocates said that they also favor viewing the fisheries
as one interconnected system but that current data aren't sufficient
to limit fishing for menhaden in the bay.
</P>
<P>
Advocates who last were together 20 years ago, when declining
stocks of striped bass prompted an East Coast ban on catching the
fish, are reuniting to take on the menhaden industry.
</P>
<P>
``I never thought I'd be back fighting this fight,'' said Dick
Russell, a Los Angeles writer who was fishing for striped bass off
Martha's Vineyard in the 1980s when he was sucked into the striper
movement. His book ``Striper Wars: An American Fish Story'' will be
released next year.
</P>
<P>
In the past couple of years, Russell again has started attending
meetings of the federal Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission
and has reunited with advocate friends during Chesapeake Bay fishing
trips.
</P>
<P>
Ken Hinman, 52, was living in Savannah, Ga., when he joined the
fight to limit the striped bass catch 20 years ago. Today he is
president of a Leesburg, Va.-based anglers' group, the National
Coalition for Marine Conservation.
</P>
<P>
``A lot of people have come back to try and address these issues,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
All the players were at the table last month at fisheries
commission meeting in which conservationists pressed the agency to
limit the menhaden catch.
</P>
<P>
But the commission refused, citing a dearth of data linking bass
and menhaden.
</P>
<P>
``Right now, we just don't know. We don't have enough
information,'' said Nancy Wallace, the commission's coordinator for
menhaden management. ``We don't have any other models of (ecosystem
based management) to go off of. This is a new thing.''
</P>
<P>
The industry has said that the matter centers on social priorities
and that menhaden farming is an important business.
</P>
<P>
``Why shouldn't the striped bass be managed for the benefit of the
menhaden?'' said Toby Gascon, director of government affairs for Omega
Protein Corp., which produces oil and feed from menhaden and is the
largest employer in Virginia's Northern Neck. ``Special-interest
groups are trying to twist this to get the outcome they want and will
give ecosystem-based management a bad name.''
</P>
<P>
To Dave Loewensteiner, chief scientist aboard the Aquarius,
everything is at stake.
</P>
<P>
``If we don't do ecosystem-based, we may as well give up,'' he
said. ``But it's part getting the data and part the will, since no one
has done this before. A lot is on the line.''
