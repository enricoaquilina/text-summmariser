-- Don't trash the bay! That soda cup or dog poop you toss on the
street could end up in the Chesapeake.
</P>
<P>
-- Kill that light ... and GameCube and fan when you leave the room!
Power plants burn coal to make electricity, spewing nitrogen (plus
mercury and other pollutants). The particles return as raindrops or
dust and get into the water. About 11 percent of the bay's nitrogen
comes from power plants.

<P>
-- Hold the lawn fertilizer, Mom and Dad! It winds up in the bay,
where it's like giving Big Macs to the algae. On the Internet you can
you can find some other ways to have a pretty green yard.
</P>
<P>
-- Drive less! Vehicles also spew nitrogen into the air -- and the
bay. Walk, bike or take public transportation when you can. If your
family is getting new wheels, ask your folks to check out those cool
clean-running cars.
