If you've ever visited the Chesapeake Bay -- to sail or have a
picnic at Sandy Point State Park -- the blue water probably seemed
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
But below its sparkling surface, the Chesapeake is becoming
increasingly unhealthy. For the plants and animals that live there,
things are not so beautiful:
</P>
<P>
-- Oysters are almost gone from the Chesapeake. The yearly catch
fell from 1 million bushels in 1990 to 26,500 last year.
</P>
<P>
-- Crabs also are at an all-time low. In just one year, 2003, the
bay lost about a third of its underwater grasses, the only place where
baby crabs and little fish can thrive.
</P>
<P>
Now there is a ``dead zone'' in the bay that in the summer
stretches for hundreds of square miles, scientists say. In that zone,
there is so little oxygen in the water that plants and animals can't
survive. (Picture your fish tank if the filter stopped working!)
</P>
<P>
What has happened to the Chesapeake Bay, America's largest estuary?
(An estuary is a coastal area where fresh water and salt water mix.)
What could produce enough pollution to mess up 18 trillion gallons of
water?
</P>
<P>
To understand the Chesapeake's troubles, you have to know that six
major rivers and thousands of small creeks (in six states and the
District of Columbia) flow into it. This area is known as the bay's
watershed.
</P>
<P>
Chicken and cow poop, trash, fertilizer from farms and lawns, human
waste that hasn't been properly treated, dirt that washes away from
construction sites -- all make their way along those rivers and creeks
into the bay. That causes big problems, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
About 16 million people live in this area. That's double the
population of 50 years ago. And the number is expected to keep
growing. All those people have to live somewhere@. So the challenge --
for scientists, politicians, farmers and everyone else -- is to figure
out how all of us can live, eat, shop, flush and get to school and
work without@ destroying the bay.
</P>
<P>
People who have begun tackling the problem know that it's tough.
Fixing aging sewage systems costs billions of dollars. Passing laws or
spending big bucks to get farmers to switch to less-polluting ways
isn't an easy answer either.
</P>
<P>
Recently, 16 students from Turner Ashby High School in Rockingham
County, Va., took a 30-day, 350-mile canoe-and-kayak trip through the
Potomac River Basin to better understand how people are hurting -- and
helping -- the bay.
</P>
<P>
The teens shared what they saw, heard -- and smelled -- along the
way. Trip leader Kelsey Brunton, 17, advises kids to be aware ``that
the bay needs help and that everything you do affects it.''
