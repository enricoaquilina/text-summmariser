Effort to Put Eastern Oysters on Endangered List

A Maryland environmentalist alarmed by the decline of
the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster population is trying to get it on
the federal Endangered Species list -- sparking an uproar of opposition
in the oyster industry from Maine to Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
Wolf-Dieter Busch, an environmental consultant, believes bay
pollution and ineffective regulations could prove fatal to the eastern
oyster. Ravaged in the past by overfishing, and now undermined by
disease, 99 percent of the eastern oyster population in the bay has
disappeared since the late 19th century, according to federal
fisheries statistics.
</P>
<P>
In January, Busch petitioned the National Marine Fisheries Service
to list the oyster as an endangered species, despite the existence of
millions of oysters living in the bay and thriving oyster populations
elsewhere along the East Coast and in the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
``It was the only thing I could see that would get people's
attention,'' Busch said.
</P>
<P>
It certainly has. If the petition succeeds, those in the oyster
industry say it could stop all harvesting of the species and render
obsolete a large segment of the national seafood economy.
</P>
<P>
Richard Pelz, chief executive of the Circle C oyster ranch on St.
Jerome Creek in St. Mary's County in Southern Maryland, believes an
endangered species designation would destroy his business. Oysters
behave as a natural filter for polluted waters, and Pelz markets his
floating oyster reefs as a way for shoreline homeowners to clean up
the bay while growing a delicacy. He estimates the brood line of
oysters he's created, named the Lineback, alone is worth $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
``They'd have to come up with that if they shut me down,'' Pelz
said. ``There will be lawsuits if they do this, I can guarantee you.
Because I'll have nothing else to do.''
</P>
<P>
The petition has made it past the first hurdle, a 90-day review by
NMFS to assess whether there is a valid concern over the future of the
species. The answer was yes, and the decision set off a more
comprehensive investigation by a 12-member team of experts. This
biological review team begins meeting Monday and Tuesday in Annapolis,
Md., and a final decision will be made by Jan. 11 by the head of the
fisheries service, which is part of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
``Oysters in the Chesapeake Bay are in serious, serious trouble.
They've had such a drastic decline in the past century,'' said Jamie
King, an oyster specialist in the NOAA's Chesapeake Bay office. ``And
things are not getting better under current management strategies.''
</P>
<P>
While federal fisheries officials will not speculate on the chances
of the petition's success, some at the state level view it with
growing concern.
</P>
<P>
``We still have tens to hundreds of millions of animals in the
Chesapeake Bay. It's pretty difficult to justify an endangered tag
when you have so many of them and they continue to reproduce,'' said
Michael Slattery, assistant secretary for the Maryland Department of
Natural Resources, which does not support listing the oyster.
</P>
<P>
The main problem, Slattery said, is that 90 percent of Chesapeake
oysters are killed off by diseases before they reach an age and size
at which they can be commercially harvested. Some say the oyster
industry in the Chesapeake is more endangered than the animal itself.
Virginia had more than 400 shucking houses in the 1950s, and only
about 15 remain, said James Wesson of the Virginia Marine Resources
Commission in a congressional hearing in July.
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, a stream of marine biologists, seafood industry
representatives and state officials told the House Resources Committee
about the stable populations outside the Chesapeake and the economic
importance of the oyster. In Louisiana alone, the 14 million pounds of
oyster meat produced in 2003 provided more than 3,000 full-time jobs
and generated $286 million in economic impact, said William Perret,
marine fisheries director of the Mississippi Department of Marine
Resources.
</P>
<P>
If the oyster were a vertebrate, it would be possible under the
Endangered Species Act to protect it solely in the Chesapeake and
leave it unrestricted elsewhere, as some biologists have suggested. No
such regional specificity is allowed for invertebrates. Rep. Bobby
Jindal, R-La., has sponsored a bill to allow segments of the eastern
oyster population to be treated as a separate species.
</P>
<P>
In the Chesapeake, the eastern oyster once was so bountiful that
more than 100 million pounds a year were pulled from the bay in the
late 19th century, a time when Baltimore was the world's largest
supplier. That number had dropped to 236,512 pounds by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The attempts at rebuilding the oyster population have been
manifold, from constructing oyster reefs to breeding disease-resistant
oysters to establishing shellfish sanctuaries. In Virginia, $40
million in government money has been spent on reef projects alone,
said Wesson.
</P>
<P>
In St. Mary's, the oyster once was central to the culture and
economy; shucking houses dotted the shoreline, and oyster pirates
sailed the Potomac River at night. Today, the industry is little more
than a relic.
</P>
<P>
Still, after hearing about the petition, the St. Mary's Board of
County Commissioners wrote NOAA to protest, claiming that the listing
``would have a devastating impact on local aquaculture operations and
our local seafood industry.''
</P>
<P>
They said it could shut down the annual St. Mary's County Oyster
Festival, which brings in more than 15,000 tourists a year to watch
the National Oyster Shucking Championship.
