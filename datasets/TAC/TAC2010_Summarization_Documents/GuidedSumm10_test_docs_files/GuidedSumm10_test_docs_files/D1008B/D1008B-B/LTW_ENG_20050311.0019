Research Comes Fresh From U-Md. Lab
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The University of Maryland's Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge,
Md., is home to research on the Chesapeake Bay's native oyster,
Crassostrea virginica,@ and an Asian oyster that some officials want
to introduce into the bay.

Donald Meritt, a scientist there, said that each year the lab
produces about 100 million tiny native oysters, which are called spat.
These spat are grown in a bath of water taken from the Choptank River,
with their food sometimes supplemented by specially grown algae. They
are then transported to laboratories and oyster-seeding programs
around the state.

The laboratory's work with the Asian oyster, Crassostrea
ariakensis,@ is part of a larger scientific and political debate. Some
officials in Maryland look to the Asian oyster as a potential
replacement for the native oyster, which has been decimated by disease
and pollution. But others, including several state legislators and
federal scientists, have said that much more research is needed before
the Asian oyster can be certified as safe for the bay.
</P>
<P>
At the Horn Point Lab, Meritt said, researchers are trying to
determine whether the Asian oyster's reproduction would interfere with
the reproduction of the native oyster, and how well it would fare in
the less-salty waters of the upper Chesapeake.
