The following editorial appeared in Friday's Washington Post:

Anyone looking for evidence of skullduggery in the recent
Government Accountability Office report on the Chesapeake Bay Program
will be disappointed. Newspapers across the region quoted the report's
most damning conclusions -- that the program's annual State of the
Chesapeake Bay report does not ``provide credible information on the
bay's current health status'' and that the program's reports are
confusing. But this isn't the first time that outsiders have
complained about the bay program -- a consortium of the Maryland,
Virginia, District of Columbia and Pennsylvania governments, plus the
Environmental Protection Agency -- and it isn't the most damning
complaint. As recently as last week, the nonprofit Chesapeake Bay
Foundation also noted that the bay, despite $6 billion in spending
over the past decade, continues to deteriorate and that a lack of
financial and political commitment from all parties involved has
hampered progress.

But have we learned anything new from these reports? The GAO points
out that the Chesapeake Bay Program has come up with more than 100
ways to measure pollution in the bay, but the GAO complains that the
lack of an ``integrated'' measurement makes it hard for the public,
and the politicians, to understand the seriousness of the problem.
Well, yes -- but the size of the bay and its vast watershed, which make
pollution measurement and control so difficult, have hampered the
cleanup of the bay from the beginning. It isn't clear that integrated
measurements would solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
There have been several moves to help the bay in recent years, most
notably the ``flush tax'' pushed by Maryland Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich
Jr. (R) to fund sewage treatment plants. This week, Virginia Gov. Mark
R. Warner (D) announced plans to spend $150 million to upgrade water
treatment plans, too. But the most intractable source of pollution is
agricultural and urban runoff throughout the watershed, which
stretches as far as New York. Every time it rains, the water that
falls on dirty streets and fertilized lawns in Washington, Baltimore
and every other city, town and suburb in the region flows into gutters
and eventually into streams that enter the Chesapeake. Water from
agricultural land, from Maryland poultry farms to Pennsylvania dairy
farms, also runs into the system, carrying nutrients from agricultural
fertilizer and animal waste into the bay.
</P>
<P>
Addressing these deeper sources of pollution requires a level of
creativity not seen in approaches to the cleanup of the bay. The
federal government might, for example, consider using the farm subsidy
program (since it has one anyway) to encourage farmers not to use
fertilizer containing phosphorus, one of the most dangerous pollutants
of the bay. Local governments might pass laws protecting wetlands near
cities that can absorb runoff. This is not just a question of getting
the language of the reports right or even of having enough money. It
is a question of greater commitment at both the federal and state
levels, up to and including mandatory controls, and of giving higher
priority to the issue. Twenty years after its founding, the Chesapeake
Bay Program, and the bay itself, still need more political clout and
more political support.
