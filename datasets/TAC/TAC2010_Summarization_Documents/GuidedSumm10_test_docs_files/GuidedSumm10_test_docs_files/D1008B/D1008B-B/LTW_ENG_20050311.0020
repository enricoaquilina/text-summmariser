Dredging for an Oyster Solution
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A decision about whether to introduce a new species of Chinese
oyster into the Chesapeake Bay has been put off a few months longer
because of delays in a scientific study, Maryland officials say.
</P>
<P>
The study, by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is intended to
guide the governors of Virginia and Maryland as they decide whether to
allow the oyster Crassostrea ariakensis@ to reproduce in the
Chesapeake. First expected this month at the latest, the report is now
due in June or July because of a delay in creating a computer model of
how the oysters might spread and reproduce, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a new oyster is already stirring controversy,
though. In Annapolis, Md., several state legislators have been pushing
bills that would delay any oyster introduction to allow for more
research. The worry, said Maryland Del. Peter Franchot is that the new
oyster, which can grow to a mammoth eight inches across, will bring
``eight-inch viruses.''
</P>
<P>
The oyster debate is part of a larger, multibillion-dollar struggle
to return the bay to its 1950s condition by 2010. Environmentalists
say the effort has been consumed by bureaucracy that has allowed the
bay to decay further.
</P>
<P>
Among the bay's problems, one of the worst has been the decline of
the native oyster Crassostrea virginica,@ once so populous that its
reefs poked out of the water. Even after European colonization, its
harvests were bountiful enough that the Eastern Shore town of
Crisfield, Md., was built on a foundation of discarded oyster shells.
</P>
<P>
But over the past three decades, the bay's oysters have been
ravaged by pollution and a pair of diseases.
</P>
<P>
The pollution, from farms and sewage plants across the bay's
64,000-square-mile watershed, causes algae blooms that suck oxygen
from the water. Oysters, unlike fish and crabs, can't swim away from
``bad water'' areas, so they are weakened or killed.
</P>
<P>
The diseases, one of them introduced when another strain of Asian
oyster was placed in the bay decades ago, kill oysters before they
grow large.
</P>
<P>
Combined, these factors have caused a stunning decline in Maryland
oyster harvests: from about 2,600,000 bushels in 1974-75 to about
26,000 bushels last year.
</P>
<P>
In desperation, the two bay states have turned to the Chinese
oyster, which has been grown for about 30 years in Oregon and is
believed to be immune to the Chesapeake's oyster diseases. The hope is
that the new species could take the native oyster's former role in the
bay: as a moneymaker for watermen and a natural filter for polluted
water.
</P>
<P>
As optimism about the new oyster has grown in the administration of
Maryland Gov. Robert Ehrlich, a Republican, pessimism has spread among
scientists. Among their questions: Will the new oyster bring a new
disease? Will it multiply so rapidly that it overtakes native species?
Will it fail to multiply and instead die, leaving the bay no better
off?
</P>
<P>
Previous outside studies have warned that perhaps more years of
research are necessary before the oyster can be declared safe. But
Maryland and Virginia have held the hope that the one-year study
underway by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be sufficient. When
the results are released this summer, they will be forwarded to an
independent committee for an evaluation that is expected to take six
weeks, said Pete Jensen, an official with the Maryland Department of
Natural Resources.
