A POLITICAL POISONING AND SUSPECTS APLENTY, BUT LITTLE PROGRESS

<DATELINE>
KIEV, Ukraine
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The presidential candidate appeared for a secret meeting an hour
before midnight on Sept. 5, arriving in a black Mercedes-Benz at a
dacha -- a suburban villa -- outside the capital here.
</P>
<P>
He was accompanied by a campaign manager. He had left his bodyguards
behind.
</P>
<P>
Waiting for the candidate, Victor A. Yushchenko, were two leaders of
the Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, the country's successor to
the Soviet-era KGB, including Ihor P. Smeshko, its chairman.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko was leading in Ukraine's presidential race. He had
requested this meeting to discuss, among other things, death threats
he had been receiving.
</P>
<P>
The session was friendly. The four men drank beer and ate boiled
crayfish from a large common bowl, as well as a salad made of
tomatoes, cucumbers and corn. Later they selected vodka and meats,
and then cognacs for a last drink. Still, Yushchenko ate lightly.
When the meeting ended at about 2 a.m., he went home to bed, and
began, his supporters say, to die.
</P>
<P>
More than three months later, the dinner at the dacha has assumed the
character of an Agatha Christie mystery mixed with a Cold War spy
tale. Yushchenko, his doctors say, was suffering from poisoning. But
how? And by whom?
</P>
<P>
In interviews with investigators, members of Yushchenko's campaign
team, toxicology experts, and a son-in-law of Ukraine's president, as
well as with three of the four men at the dinner, a picture of
confusion and frustration emerges at a criminal investigation that is
laden with complexities and obstacles.
</P>
<P>
The day after Yushchenko ate the late-night crayfish, a meal one
Russian newspaper has dubbed "The Last Supper," he was showing
symptoms of illness. By the time he had been stabilized and stood in
the Ukrainian parliament on Sept. 21 to accuse the administration of
outgoing President Leonid D. Kuchma of plotting his murder ("Do not
ask who is next," he said. "Every one of us will be the next."), his
face was blossoming into a grotesque mask of cysts.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko was also racked with pain and weakened by what his doctors
in Vienna, Austria, now call a surreptitious dose of TCDD, the most
toxic of a group of organic compounds known as dioxins, and a
contaminant in the defoliant Agent Orange.
</P>
<P>
That much is known. But the most popular theory to date -- that
Yushchenko was poisoned at the dacha -- notable flaws, strong enough
that even the candidate's own supporters raise questions about it.
And as investigators seek deeper insight into the case, they say a
chief obstacle has been Yushchenko himself, who has used the
poisoning almost as a theme in his campaign, but has thus far not
fully cooperated with the authorities, even as his would-be
assassin's trail grows cold.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is headed for a repeat presidential runoff election that will
likely decide the direction this nation of 48 million heads as it
continues its evolution from a post-Soviet state. But since the
political crisis set off by the disputed Nov. 21 runoff election was
defused by court and parliamentary decisions to conduct a new vote,
this dinner has overshadowed almost all else.
</P>
<P>
With a plot that would make Agatha Christie proud, much of Ukraine's
leadership finds itself in the role of suspect, including Smeshko,
the SBU chairman, who met with a Western reporter for what he
described as the first time in a 32-year career.
</P>
<P>
"The main message is this: Our security service did not do Yushchenko
any harm, and did not try to do him any harm," Smeshko said. "This we
know for sure. All other versions we will check."
</P>
<P>
When asked how he reacted to being publicly suggested as a suspect,
Smeshko, who has two young sons, answered with a question. "How would
you like it if your kids asked you, 'Did you do it, Dad?"' Smeshko
said, locking eyes with a reporter for several seconds.
</P>
<P>
Smeshko added: "It is really painful. We will do everything to know
the truth. Basically, this is a case for the dignity of our whole
service."
</P>
<P>
To achieve that, the SBU must navigate the demands of Ukraine's most
intense criminal investigation while weathering a popular belief that
it may have been involved in the crime. It faces a case in which the
principal theories are many, varied and thus far impossible to prove
wrong. And politics are visible at every turn.
</P>
<P>
Depending on who is talking, Yushchenko was poisoned either by his
enemies in Kuchma's government or by members of his own inner circle.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, he was poisoned by Russia's intelligence services, or
by organized crime figures working for any of the above.
</P>
<P>
Some say the failed assassin was Vladimir N. Satsyuk, Smeshko's
former first deputy and a member of the parliament. He was the host
of the dinner, at his dacha. The food was prepared by his personal
cook. Satsyuk resigned from the SBU last week. (Officially, the cases
are unrelated; Satsyuk resigned his SBU post after a court ruled he
could not hold both an executive position in government and a seat in
the legislature.)
</P>
<P>
Satsyuk bristles at the subject. "It deals with my honor and the
honor of my family," he said. "I am ready to cooperate in order to
find the real cause."
</P>
<P>
Finding the real cause seems unlikely for now. A thorough
investigation would require reconstructing of Yushchenko's meetings,
movements and meals, but Yushchenko, busy with his campaign, has not
been of much help.
</P>
<P>
Volodymyr Sivkovych, chairman of a parliamentary commission that has
reopened its investigation into Yushchenko's illness, complained that
Yushchenko has declined even to give a proper statement to his
commission or to investigators. Nor have Ukrainian investigators
received the latest test results from Vienna, which they say are
essential evidence.
</P>
<P>
David V. Zhvaniya, the Yushchenko campaign manager who arranged the
meeting with Satsyuk and Smeshko and attended it himself, said he and
Yushchenko had refused to appear because they had no faith in the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Sivkovych, he said, is aligned with Kuchma or Prime Minister Viktor
F. Yanukovich, the rival to Yushchenko in the presidential race.
Sivkovych called this "lies."
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials also remain frustrated, even after the
former general prosecutor, whom Yushchenko did not trust, was fired
this month.
</P>
<P>
The investigation has been reopened by the new general prosecutor,
with support from the SBU. But Lt. Gen. Igor V. Drizhchany, head of
the SBU's legal department, said investigators were still learning of
medical assessments through the news media.
</P>
<P>
"All the political goals have been achieved," he said. "But those who
most need the evidence -- the people who must catch a murderer -- do
not have it."
</P>
<P>
He continued: "I cannot reproach anybody, because I know that the
presidential race is taking place. But these are still the facts."
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko declined requests for an interview on this subject; in a
statement through a spokeswoman he said he relied on private medical
information because he did not trust the commission or the former
prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted the first word to be said by the doctors," he said in a
statement. "Only then would come the turn of the investigators."
</P>
<P>
One senior law enforcement official said that after doctors found
dioxin in Yushchenko's blood, the candidate met informally on Dec. 16
with a newly assigned prosecutor and pledged to cooperate, but only
after the election on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
Without the cooperation, the case has taken the form of theories, and
for the news media the most popular has been the dinner at the dacha.
But as details and a greater understanding emerge, this version
remains open to question.
</P>
<P>
First, Smeshko said, Yushchenko was ill and in pain before the
meeting, and had postponed the dacha visit a day because of
exhaustion and a backache. Zhvaniya confirmed this, but said
Yushchenko has a history of back troubles, and his pain the previous
night might not have been related to poison.
</P>
<P>
A second, more intriguing, complication is that toxicologists say
that after a person is contaminated with dioxins, it typically takes
three days to two weeks before symptoms appear. Yushchenko was racked
with pain hours after the dacha dinner, which understandably cast
initial suspicion on the meal. But the theory was weakened this month
when doctors in Vienna announced that the poison was dioxin; his
would be the only known case of a dioxin acting so fast.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arnold Schecter, a specialist in dioxin contamination at the
University of Texas and co-editor of "Dioxins and Health," a medical
reference, said it was possible but highly unlikely that Yushchenko
was poisoned on Sept. 5. "It doesn't make sense, medically," he said.
"I would go back 14 days before that."
</P>
<P>
Zhvaniya agreed. "It is a stupid theory," he said. "The poisoning
could have happened at any moment. He was always touring. He met
hundreds of people in hundreds of places. To link it to that evening
can be called only paranoia."
</P>
<P>
Zhvaniya said that if Yushchenko had been intentionally poisoned, he
believed it probably occurred while he was in Crimea in late August.
He also said the most likely suspect was an organized crime figure,
perhaps collaborating with Russia and members of Kuchma's
administration.
</P>
<P>
Zhvaniya, a member of the legislature and a commission on organized
crime, said he had listened to a taped conversation of a Russian
crime figure offering to help a member of the Kuchma administration.
"He more than once offered his services in poisoning, or removal," he
said.
</P>
<P>
When pressed for a copy of the audiotape, Zhvaniya declined. "After
the election," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's special services scoff at suggestions of their involvement.
"I consider it below my dignity to comment on," said Boris N.
Labusov, the senior spokesman of the SVR, Russia's foreign
intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma's family, which too has said it was not involved, also said
the dacha theory was foolish. Any government wanting to kill an
opponent, the family's line of thinking goes, would not make the
attempt at a meeting with government officials. "I think they are not
kamikazes," said Victor M. Pinchuk, Kuchma's son-in-law and a member
of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Elements of the popular dacha theory are also inconclusive or wrong.
</P>
<P>
Among them are suggestions that Yushchenko was vulnerable because it
was the only time his guards did not check his food -- a function of
questionable value for a poison that is said to be odorless and
tasteless, and takes days to manifest itself. The news media has also
written, based on a comment by one of Yushchenko's doctors, that
dioxin might have been slipped into his soup. No soup was served at
the dacha that night, the three men who dined with Yushchenko said.
</P>
<P>
Zhvaniya also dismissed statements by Yushchenko's wife, who is an
American citizen, that she tasted something medicinal on his lips
after he returned from the dacha. "She is a normal woman, and to her
with the words KGB and SBU comes an unreasonable reaction, the more
so because she was brought up in the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
Toxicologists say dioxins are tasteless, although Schecter pointed
out the provenance of this assertion is uncertain; he knew of no one
who had ever tried tasting them.
</P>
<P>
Still, public attention remains focused on the late-night meal,
frustrating investigators who say a larger window of time needs to be
examined, and infuriating Satsyuk, the host, who challenged the
opposition leader to accuse him to his face.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to meet live on the air with Mr. Yushchenko," he said. "I
would like him, looking into my eyes, to say that he was poisoned at
my dacha. I can do this at any press conference at any time."
