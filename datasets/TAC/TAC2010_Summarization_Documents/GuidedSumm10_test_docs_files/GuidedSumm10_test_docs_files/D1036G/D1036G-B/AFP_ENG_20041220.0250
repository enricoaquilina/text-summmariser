Ukrainian presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned by
the same form of the toxic chemical dioxin as the one found in a 1976
disaster at a factory in Seveso, Italy, an Austrian doctor said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The results of analysis carried out in three different laboratories
in the Netherlands and Germany agree... that it is was TCDD" or
tetra-chloro-dibenzo-dioxin, Michael Zimpfer, head doctor at Vienna's
Rudolfinerhaus said.
</P>
<P>
He refused to comment further, saying Yushchenko's family did not
want more details revealed.
</P>
<P>
On December 11, Zimpfer had told a press conference that Yushchenko
was suffering from dioxin poisoning and that this may have been
intentionally done.
</P>
<P>
French toxicologists said however that they were at a loss to explain
why presumed assassins would use dioxin, a chemical that is a
progressive killer, as a weapon against Yushchenko.
</P>
<P>
At extremely high doses, dioxin causes liver failure and death, but
at smaller doses, it causes organ damage and cancer, which can kill
but usually years down the road, they said.
</P>
<P>
Dioxin also causes a severe skin disease, chloracne, which is the
most visible of Yushchenko's problems, but this is usually not a
fatal condition.
</P>
<P>
"If someone was trying to kill him, cyanide or bacterial toxins would
have been more effective," Professor Jean-Francois Narbonne from
France's University of Bordeaux said.
</P>
<P>
"Dioxin is not the only substance capable of producing such lesions,"
he said, referring to the severe form of acne which has disfigured
Yushchenko's face.
</P>
<P>
"There is not one dioxin but 210," Dr. Jacques Descotes from the
southern French city of Lyon said.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know much about most of them, except for Seveso dioxin,"
Descotes said, referring to the 1976 disaster in Italy, in which more
than 1,200 people were poisoned by gas that seeped from a chemical
factory.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko said last Friday that he was not accusing the SBU secret
services of trying to poison him despite suspicions that he ingested
a massive dose of dioxin during a dinner with two of its agents.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko had told reporters that he suspected that he swallowed the
poison during a dinner he had with SBU chief Ihor Smeshko and his
deputy.
</P>
<P>
"The SBU chief and his deputy were present during the last business
dinner (on September 5), but... I don't say that I am directly
blaming, or directly suspect these people of my poisoning,"
Yushchenko said.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko fell ill on September 6, while holding a comfortable lead
over his chief presidential rival Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich in
opinion polls just weeks before a first round presidential election.
</P>
<P>
A repeat election is to be held on December 26, with the pro-Western
Yushchenko, 50, seen as the likely winner.
