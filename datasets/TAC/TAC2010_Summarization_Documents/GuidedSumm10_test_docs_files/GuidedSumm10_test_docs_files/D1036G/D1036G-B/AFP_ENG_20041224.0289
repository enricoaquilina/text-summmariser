<P>
Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko suggested Friday that
the dioxin with which he was poisoned several months ago may have come
from outside the country.
</P>
<P>
"Today there is lots of both direct and indirect proof of how this
poison got into Ukraine and to my table," he said at a press
conference on the last day allowed for official campaigning before a
rerun election being held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader declined to comment on assertions from several
of his allies that Russian intelligence agencies had a hand in his
poisoning in September, which kept him from the campaign trail and
disfigured his face weeks before a first-round presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to create new myths. There is a prosecutor general,
where there are people whom I trust. I want the courts to put the
final point in this affair, which has been tragic for me," Yushcheko
said.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko has previously voiced suspicions that he ingested the
poison during a dinner with the chief of Ukraine's SBU intelligence
services, Ihor Smeshko, and his deputy on September 5.
</P>
<P>
The following day he fell ill and his condition steadily deteriorated
during the next five days until on September 10 he was rushed to the
Rudolfinerhaus clinic in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The clinic doctors confirmed earlier in December that Yushchenko's
illness resulted from swallowing a massive dose of dioxin.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko said he was certain he would win the historic rerun vote
on Sunday, which was set after the supreme court stripped his
opponent, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, of his victory in a
November 21 poll because of fraud.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question in my mind that I will win," he said. "Because
I won the first round and the second round and I will win the next
round too."
</P>
<P>
But he warned that Sunday's vote could be disrupted or even scuttled,
if the constitutional court rules that changes to electoral law
passed several weeks ago were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Those changes were passed as part of a compromise between Yushchenko
and outgoing President Leonid Kuchma to resolve a tense standoff over
the November poll.
</P>
<P>
A group of 46 deputies has appealed to the court to annul the
changes, which include strict limitations on home voting.
</P>
<P>
"That's one way of disrupting the election," Yushchenko said. "I know
the pressure that the presidential administration is putting on the
constitutional court and its judges to uphold this scenario."
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not a counterrevolution will happen in Ukraine depends on
the constitutional court," he said. "I think that people who
represent the constitutional court are well aware of their
responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
"There is a certain threat that if the constitutional court finds the
law unconstitutional ahead of the election, the legitimacy of the
poll will be put in question and it will be impossible to change the
rules of the game," said Ihor Popov, the head of a Ukrainian
non-government organization monitors elections.
