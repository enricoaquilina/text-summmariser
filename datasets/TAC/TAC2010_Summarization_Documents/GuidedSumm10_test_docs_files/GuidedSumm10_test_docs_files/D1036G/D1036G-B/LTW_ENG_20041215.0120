Intentional Poisonings May Be More Common Than Expected
</HEADLINE>

Power struggles, political intrigue and the street mettle of the
Ukrainian people have kept that faraway country's election drama in
the news for weeks. But it's the poisoning that most people are
talking about.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, an Austrian clinic confirmed what Viktor Yushchenko's
grotesque features had long suggested: The presidential candidate had
been sickened and disfigured by a toxin called dioxin. To Western
readers, especially, the poisoning may seem like an outlandish plot
twist ripped off from Renaissance history.
</P>
<P>
But some toxicologists and students of chemical crimes say poison
probably is wielded more often than people think.
</P>
<P>
The use of dioxin in particular against Yushchenko, however, was a
rare choice, experts say.
</P>
<P>
``This guy is in uncharted territory,'' says Robert Middleberg, a
forensic toxicologist at National Medical Services, a bioanalytical
laboratory in Pennsylvania that specializes in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
``If he did receive it as an oral poison, he'd be one of the only
cases we'd be aware of,'' he says. ``It's not a good poison to use if
you're trying to acutely kill someone. If you want to make someone
sick, it's certainly a good poison.''
</P>
<P>
Dioxins are a family of toxic compounds usually produced as
byproducts of industrial processes. The most notorious type was
discovered in Agent Orange, the defoliant used in the Vietnam War. And
in the early 1980s, the U.S. government evacuated the town of Times
Beach, Mo., due to the high levels of dioxin in the soil resulting
from waste oil that had been sprayed on dirt roads to settle dust.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have studied the effects of human inhalation or skin
exposure to dioxin, but ingestion is more mysterious. Yet Yushchenko's
symptoms -- especially the facial cysts, called chloracne -- were the
next best thing to a smoking gun.
</P>
<P>
``If it wasn't for that, nobody would look for dioxin,'' Middleberg
says, noting that dioxin is not one of the 3,000 or so compounds
(among the 22 million registered by the American Chemical Society)
that his lab routinely tests for in suspected poisonings.
</P>
<P>
The peculiarity of the poisoner's choice could also lend clues to
his or her identity. ``When you start talking about obscure poisons
like this, you have to not only know how to procure the pure material,
but also how to dose it,'' Middleberg says. ``You could do a lot of
damage with one milligram.''
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko could suffer from the effects of the crime for years to
come. Dioxin does organ damage and is known to be carcinogenic.
</P>
<P>
``It's a nasty little chemical,'' says John H. Trestrail III,
managing director of the DeVos Children's Hospital Regional Poison
Center in Grand Rapids, Mich. The author of a manual on investigating
criminal poisonings, he has conducted numerous workshops on the
subject for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
Though the substance used in the crime against Yushchenko may be
unique, to Trestrail it's just another poisoning to put on his list.
More than a decade ago he started a database of intentional poisonings
reported around the world. By studying more than 1,000 cases,
Trestrail has tried to make it easier to profile poisoners.
</P>
<P>
``I think when you take a look at poisoners, they fall into one or
two groups,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
The first type is the most common: the person who wants to
eliminate someone standing in the way of a goal, whether love, money
or power. (``These people don't want you to ever know that poison is
the cause of death,'' Trestrail says.)
</P>
<P>
``The other group is more like what we see (in Yushchenko's case).
They use it and really don't care if you know it or not,'' he says,
referring to it as an attack by a ``chemical sniper.''
</P>
<P>
Trestrail, for one, suspects that many murderous poisonings go
undetected.
</P>
<P>
``I've always contended that poisonings are more common than people
think,'' he says. His database suggests that about 40 percent of
documented poisoners had multiple victims.
</P>
<P>
For example, Trestrail points to the case of Charles Cullen, a
nurse who last year admitted to administering fatal overdoses to as
many as 40 patients in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Despite the
suspicions of some hospital staff members, his crimes went undetected
for years.
</P>
<P>
``It's an invisible death,'' Trestrail says, noting that many
poisonings are only discovered after the fact by exhuming the victim's
body.
</P>
<P>
``These are not weapons of opportunity. You don't find two guys
fighting at a bar on Friday night reaching for cyanide,'' Trestrail
says. ``A poisoner is a planner.''
