The following editorial appeared in Tuesday's Baltimore Sun
</P>
<P>
The affliction that has disfigured Viktor A. Yushchenko, the
Ukrainian presidential candidate, calls to mind a similar malady that
befell a crusading member of the Russian Parliament, Yuri
Shchekochikhin, last year. The one significant difference is that Mr.
Yushchenko got to a hospital in Vienna, and lived; Mr. Shchekochikhin
went into one in Moscow, and died.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of both men believe they were poisoned by the
authorities. Mr. Yushchenko fell ill after having dinner with the head
of the Ukrainian KGB; he went through enormous pain, and today his
face is bloated and cratered with what Austrian doctors have
determined is chloracne, from dioxin ingestion. Mr. Shchekochikhin was
rushed to the hospital in the course of an investigation into rumored
involvement by the Russian security services in the apartment house
bombings that killed 300 people in 1999. Before he died, his skin
blistered and began falling off. Russian doctors publicly suggested it
was the result of a food allergy.
</P>
<P>
We bring this up because Mr. Yushchenko's political opponents --
who have the enthusiastic backing of Russian President Vladimir V.
Putin -- believe that Ukraine, Russia and neighboring Belarus belong
together in a ``common space.'' A hallmark of the sort of common space
they have in mind is a disregard for legal niceties.
</P>
<P>
The idea, for instance, that the Russian federal security service,
or FSB, might have played a role in the 1999 bombings was at first too
monstrous to believe. But the evidence in hand was troubling.
Parliament launched a probe, led by Mr. Shchekochikhin and Sergei
Yushenkov, and Mr. Yushenkov was the first to die -- shot dead outside
his apartment. The parliamentary investigator was packed off to prison
just days before he was to release his report, on a charge of
revealing state secrets. An FSB man who reportedly had rented an
apartment in each of the demolished buildings was killed in a car
wreck in Cyprus. The investigation was shut down.
</P>
<P>
More recently, when terrorists seized a school in Beslan, a Russian
journalist named Anna Politkovskaya, who had criticized the war in
Chechnya, was hospitalized after trying to fly to the scene from
Moscow -- she recovered, and believes she, too, was poisoned.
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Belarus, four of the president's opponents have
simply disappeared: Yury Zakharanka, Viktar Hanchar, Anatol Krasouski
and Dzmitry Zavadski.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, to be sure, has not been immune. Georgy Gongadze, a
crusading journalist who had annoyed outgoing President Leonid D.
Kuchma, was found beheaded. But this is the common space that Mr.
Yushchenko would like to leave behind. He used to be a handsome and
mild man, but last week his chief of staff, Oleh Rybachuk, said it was
as though he had been to the far side of the moon and back, and now
nothing will stop him. Let's hope he's right, because the perils have
by no means subsided in the still-unfolding Orange Revolution.
