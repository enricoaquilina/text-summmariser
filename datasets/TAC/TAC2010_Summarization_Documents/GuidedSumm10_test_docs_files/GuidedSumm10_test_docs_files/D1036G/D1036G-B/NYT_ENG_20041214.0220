COMMENTARY: THE POISON PUZZLE

<P>
In these long winter nights, a headless horseman is roaming Russia's
"near abroad," threatening independent countries and raising fears of
a renewed Cold War.
</P>
<P>
This specter is Vladimir Putin. Let's hope he finds his head soon.
</P>
<P>
In traveling around Eastern Europe lately, people keep telling me
what a menace Putin is becoming, and they're right. There are plenty
of examples of Putin's bullying neighboring countries, from Georgia
and Estonia to this lovely little Baltic nation of Latvia, but the
most egregious example was Putin's recent plotting to install a new
pro-Russian stooge in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
If the pro-reform candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, does not die in a
"car accident" before the new Ukrainian election on Dec. 26 (vehicle
accidents are a preferred method for disposing of Ukrainian
democrats), we may find out who poisoned him with dioxin.
</P>
<P>
On the night before he showed his first symptoms, Yushchenko dined
with the head of the SBU, Ukraine's secret service. Hmm. The director
himself has seemed to be a reformer, so was the large nonreformist
wing of the SBU up to its old tricks? Maybe. And did Russian agents,
who have close ties with that nonreformist wing of the SBU, offer
their expertise in toxins?
</P>
<P>
There's no evidence that Russia was involved in the poisoning, or
even that he was poisoned at that dinner. But Russia managed to
insert itself into every other aspect of the campaign, so it's a
possibility that Ukrainians are murmuring about.
</P>
<P>
It's clear that Russia doesn't blanch at murder. Two Russian secret
agents assassinated a former president of Chechnya (whom Moscow
called a terrorist) in the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar in February
by blowing up his car as he drove away from a mosque. "The Russian
leadership issued an order to assassinate the former Chechen leader,"
the Qatari judge said after examining all the evidence and convicting
the two men.
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that the West has been suckered by Putin. He is
not a sober version of Boris Yeltsin. Rather, he's a Russified
Pinochet or Franco. And he is not guiding Russia toward free-market
democracy, but into fascism.
</P>
<P>
In effect, Putin has steered Russia from a dictatorship of the left
to a dictatorship of the right (Chinese leaders have done much the
same thing). Mussolini, Franco, Pinochet, Park Chung Hee and Putin
all emerged in societies suffering from economic and political chaos.
All consolidated power in part because they established order and
made the trains -- or planes -- run on time.
</P>
<P>
That's why Putin still has 70 percent approval ratings in Russia: He
has done well economically, presiding over growth rates of 5 to 10
percent. Polls by the Pew Research Center suggest that Russia is
fertile soil for such a Putinocracy: Russians say, by a margin of 70
to 21, that a strong leader can solve their problems better than a
democratic form of government.
</P>
<P>
Still, a fascist Russia is a much better thing than a Communist
Russia. Communism was a failed economic system, while Franco's Spain,
Pinochet's Chile and the others generated solid economic growth, a
middle class and international contacts -- ultimately laying the
groundwork for democracy. Eventually we'll see pro-democracy
demonstrations in Moscow like those in Kiev.
</P>
<P>
We need to engage Russia and encourage economic development to
nurture that political evolution -- and reduce the risk that Russia,
embittered and humiliated, will spiral into the kind of
conspiratorial xenophobia found in parts of the Arab world. And,
frankly, we need to engage Russia for our own purposes -- such as
fighting nuclear proliferation. But we also must stay on the right
side of history.
</P>
<P>
So we need to speak out much more forcefully against brutality in
Chechnya, the continued Russian military interference in Georgia and
Moldova, the suppression of the news media in Russia, and lately the
pillaging of companies that don't bow deeply enough to Putin.
</P>
<P>
It was good to see that Colin Powell didn't let Putin push us around
over Ukraine. We need to stop letting him bully us on other issues --
and help him find his head again. If the Baltic citizens and those
brave Ukrainians can stand up to Putin, so can we.
</P>
<P>
In my last column, I misspelled the name of the Latvian president.
She's Vaira Vike-Freiberga.
