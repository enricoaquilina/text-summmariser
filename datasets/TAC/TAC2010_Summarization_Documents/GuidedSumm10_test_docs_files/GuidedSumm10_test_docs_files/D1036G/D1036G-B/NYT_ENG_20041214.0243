POISON'S USE AS POLITICAL TOOL: UKRAINE IS NOT ALONE

<P>
With speculation running rampant in Ukraine over who was behind the
mysterious dioxin poisoning of the presidential candidate Viktor A.
Yushchenko, the use of poisons as a sinister tool of statecraft has
again entered the public arena in a former Soviet republic. Some
former officers of the Russian security services argue that it never
left.
</P>
<P>
On several occasions in the past decade, the successor agencies to
the KGB in Russia and other countries once in the Soviet sphere have
come under suspicion of giving drugs or poisons to prominent critics.
And while authorities have repeatedly denied ordering such actions,
the former intelligence officials say they find many of the
allegations credible.
</P>
<P>
"The view inside our agency was that poison is just a weapon, like a
pistol," said Alexander V. Litvinenko, who served in the KGB and its
Russian successor, the Federal Security Service, from 1988-99 and now
lives in London. "It's not seen that way in the West, but it was just
viewed as an ordinary tool."
</P>
<P>
Litvinenko said a secret KGB laboratory in Moscow, still operated by
the Federal Security Service, which is known by its Russian initials
FSB, specializes in the study of poisons.
</P>
<P>
In analyzing what is known of Yushchenko's case, Oleg D. Kalugin, a
former KGB general who now lives outside Washington, said it appeared
to be "certainly an attempt to remove him from the political scene."
</P>
<P>
Kalugin speaks from unusually direct experience. In 1978, he passed
along orders directing Soviet agents to supply the Bulgarian secret
service with a spring-loaded umbrella that was later used to deliver
a dose of the poison ricin, killing the Bulgarian dissident Georgi I.
Markov in London.
</P>
<P>
Litvinenko and Kalugin both said they believed Yushchenko was
poisoned with the involvement of the Ukrainian security service,
which has maintained close relations with the FSB, and they suspect
that Russian security services may have been involved. Yushchenko
fell ill after having a meal on Sept. 5 with the head of Ukraine's
security service, Gen. Ihor P. Smeshko.
</P>
<P>
Russian and Ukrainian authorities have vehemently denied being
involved. In Washington a spokesman for the Russian Embassy, Yevgeny
Khorishko, said, "There is no evidence to support such claims."
</P>
<P>
In making their cases, Litvinenko and Kalugin describe alleged cases
of poisoning or drugging in recent years in which Russian authorities
have come under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims were a Russian banker, Ivan Kivelidi, and his
secretary, who died in 1995 after using a telephone apparently dosed
with poison. In 2002, a Saudi militant known as Khattab who fought
with Chechen rebels against Russian forces died after opening a
poisoned letter. And a former speaker of the Russian Parliament, Ivan
Rybkin, who disappeared for several days in February during his race
against President Vladimir V. Putin, later accused the FSB of
drugging him and spiriting him away.
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 1, in an incident that received widespread media attention
in Russia and Britain, Anna Politkovskaya, a prominent Russian
journalist with the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, lost consciousness after
drinking tea aboard a flight to Beslan, in the Caucasus, where
militants had seized a school. She later said she thought FSB agents
on the plane had poisoned the tea. When she regained consciousness in
the hospital, she wrote in The Guardian, a nurse whispered to her,
"My dear, they tried to poison you."
</P>
<P>
There are other theories about who was behind Yushchenko's illness,
of course. Milton Leitenberg, an expert on Russian biological weapons
at the University of Maryland, said that although "intelligence
agencies are the first possibility," Yushchenko might have been
poisoned by a political enemy or a criminal group.
</P>
<P>
In any event, "this case is of enormous significance," Leitenberg
said. "Poison was used to go after a likely future head of state."
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, doctors in Vienna, Austria, confirmed that Yushchenko
had ingested dioxin, producing a severely disfiguring skin condition
on his face. The level of dioxin in his blood was measured at more
than 1,000 times normal, the doctors said. In response, Ukraine's
prosecutor general, Svyatoslav Piskun, announced that a criminal
investigation into the poisoning was being reopened.
</P>
<P>
Western experts say the dioxin findings all but prove that Yushchenko
was deliberately poisoned. Dioxin is the name for a class of
chemicals produced as a byproduct of the burning of refuse, the
manufacture of pesticides and other industrial processes.
</P>
<P>
Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University
of Leeds, said dioxin was an unlikely choice if the intent was to
kill. But if the attacker's motive was to drive Yushchenko from the
race by producing extreme facial disfigurement, dioxin might make
sense. "It's fat-soluble, so you would want to put it in a fatty
medium such as a soup," Hay said.
</P>
<P>
Vil S. Mirzayanov, a one-time dissident Russian scientist who lives
in New Jersey, said a secret unit inside a Moscow chemical institute
studied dioxin for many years while developing defoliants for the
military.
</P>
<P>
He said he had never heard of dioxin being studied as a weapon in the
former Soviet Union, but Dr. Paul M. Wax, vice president of the
American College of Medical Toxicology, said that at a 2002
conference in Volgograd, Russian scientists told him such research
had been conducted.
</P>
<P>
There have been similar cases around the world in the past few
decades. South African authorities were accused of using clothing
impregnated with organophosphates to try to poison anti-apartheid
activists. In 1997 Israeli agents injected a poison into Hamas leader
Khaled Meshal in Jordan, later delivering an antidote under
international pressure to save his life.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s and '60s, a secret U.S. Army program, working closely
with the CIA, developed assassination weapons designed to use toxins
to kill and leave no trace. CIA plots to poison Patrice Lumumba, the
prime minister of Congo, and Fidel Castro of Cuba failed, but were
later exposed by congressional investigators.
