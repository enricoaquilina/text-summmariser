Yushchenko Diagnosed with Dioxin Poisoning
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VIENNA, Austria
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ukrainian presidential hopeful Viktor Yushchenko
was poisoned with dioxin, most likely intentionally, doctors in Vienna
who have been struggling to diagnose his mystery illness confirmed
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko, a pro-Western opposition leader engaged in a bitter
presidential contest, has alleged since suddenly falling ill in
September that he was poisoned in an assassination attempt intended to
eliminate a key critic of Ukraine's government. Authorities have
denied the charge, and some government supporters have ridiculed it.
</P>
<P>
Michael Zimpfer, director of the private Rudolfinerhaus clinic that
has been treating Yushchenko, said tests concluded in the last 24
hours prove that dioxin caused the illness that has disfigured the
Ukrainian candidate's face.
</P>
<P>
``There is no doubt about the fact that Mr. Yushchenko's disease
has been caused by dioxin poisoning,'' he told reporters at a news
conference at the clinic. The doctors, Zimpfer said, ``suspect the
involvement of an external party,'' and that the dioxin was given
orally. ``The criminal investigation does not fall within our
purview,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
The diagnosis was based on clinical observations, skin changes and
findings from tissue and blood samples, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he had reported his findings to the Ukrainian
authorities, Zimpfer replied that Austrian justice officials have been
in direct contact with Ukraine since Yushchenko's second
hospitalization in late September.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko fell sick Sept. 6, the day after having late-night food
and drinks with the head of the Security Service of Ukraine, among
other people. Yushchenko's wife, Kateryna Chumachenko, said she
noticed a strange taste on his lips when she kissed him that night.
``I tasted some medicine on his breath, on his lips,'' she said in an
interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``And I asked him about
it. He brushed it away, saying there is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko has suffered problems that affected several internal
organs and caused severe back pain, according to his doctors. The most
visible symptom has been disfigurement of his face with pockmarks,
cysts and darkened areas. In recent weeks, medical experts in various
countries have said the facial condition appeared to be chloracne,
which is associated with dioxin poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The explosive allegation of attempted murder, now backed by fresh
medical evidence, could have an unpredictable effect on a repeat
presidential runoff election pitting Yushchenko against Prime Minister
Viktor Yanukovych on Dec. 26. The revote was set after the Supreme
Court ruled the Nov. 21 balloting, narrowly won by Yanukovych, invalid
because of fraud.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko supporters, however, already believed he had been
poisoned, and it was not immediately clear how many Yanukovych backers
would be willing to believe the Vienna doctors.
</P>
<P>
Some people in the opposition camp remained nervous whether the
Dec. 26 balloting really would take place. Saturday's announcement
potentially raised the stakes by increasing the possibility that if
the poisoning were an assassination attempt, those responsible might
be caught and punished under a Yushchenko presidency.
</P>
<P>
``I don't want all of us to have the impression that the Yanukovych
campaign and Yanukovych himself have relaxed and stopped fighting,''
Yulia Tymoshenko, a key opposition leader, said at a Saturday news
conference in Kiev, the capital. ``They will try everything for the
presidential elections not to happen, or not to have a result.''
</P>
<P>
Under Ukrainian law, if a presidential election is so flawed that
it is impossible to determine the result, it is possible for the
incumbent to remain in power while new balloting is organized.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a rally in the eastern city of Luhansk before the
Vienna announcement, Yanukovych expressed sympathy for Yushchenko.
``He really is a sick person,'' Yanukovych replied. ``I had a little
talk with him concerning this topic. I'm sorry for him as a person. I
wish him to get well soon. As for the reasons, I know nothing. Let the
specialists work on that.''
</P>
<P>
Yanukovych's campaign manager, Taras Chornovyl, has rejected any
possibility that the prime minister was involved in the alleged
poisoning. There is ``no logic in such an accusation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko first checked into the Vienna clinic Sept. 10, at which
point, according to Zimpfer, he had been ill for five days. The
effects of dioxin poisoning are swift as the substance rapidly is
absorbed by the body, Zimpfer said. Yushchenko's dioxin levels in
blood and tissue samples taken in September but only recently tested
specifically for that substance were at least 1,000 times higher than
normal, a level Zimpfer said required a dose of just milligrams.
</P>
<P>
``It would have been easy to put it in a cream soup, for example,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimpfer said that Yushchenko's dioxin levels have returned to
normal and that he probably would leave the clinic Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zimpfer said the doctors did not know for sure whether Yushchenko
had been poisoned by just one substance or by a combination of
substances. ``It is possible that we only found the dioxin,'' he said.
Damage to the digestive system suggested that the poison had been
ingested orally, he said.

In an Oct. 7 statement to Ukraine's parliament, Volodymyr
Sivkovych, chairman of an ad hoc commission that looked into
Yushchenko's illness, reported on the opposition leader's activities
the day before he became ill. On the evening of Sept. 5, Yushchenko
first had dinner at the summer house of a businessman, where sushi was
served that had not been refrigerated for more than three hours,
Sivkovych said. From late that evening until 2:00 a.m. the next day,
``Yushchenko was visiting the summer house of Volodymyr Satsyuk, the
first deputy chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine,'' he said.
The security service head, Ihor Smeshko, was also present, he said.
The commission understood this meeting was held at the request of a
Yushchenko associate, he said.
</P>
<P>
``Food was served on common plates, and drinks were served . . .
from bottles that were uncorked in the presence of the company,''
Sivkovych reported. ``Yushchenko started to complain of splitting
headaches early on Sept. 6.''
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko outlined his allegations of an attempted assassination
in a Sept. 21 speech to Parliament.
</P>
<P>
``Friends, this is not a problem of cuisine as such,'' Yushchenko
said then. ``We are talking about a Ukrainian political kitchen, where
assassinations are ordered!'' Yushchenko cited the suspicious but
unexplained deaths of several prominent figures, including Vyacheslav
Chornovil, a former presidential candidate who died in a traffic
accident several years ago.
</P>
<P>
``In 1999 Vyacheslav Chornovil was here alive,'' he said. ``We
pretend we don't know who killed him with a Kamaz truck. In 2000,
(campaigning journalist) Georgi Gongadze was sitting on the balcony
over there and writing political reports. Who cut his head off? Well,
we don't seem to know, although one prosecutor said once that the
killer has already been found, and that his surname begins with the
letter K. He wasn't brave enough to give us a few more letters.''
</P>
<P>
Gongadze's death has been the darkest shadow trailing Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
Tapes purportedly recorded secretly by a former Kuchma bodyguard
disclose that the president made repeated complaints about Gongadze to
his former interior minister, Yuri Kravchenko. Gongadze disappeared
the night of Sept. 16, 2000, shortly after going out to empty the
trash. An autopsy showed that he died within hours. His head has not
been found.
</P>
<P>
A former police officer, Ihor Honcharov, said last year that he had
information that police working with a criminal gang had abducted the
journalist on orders from Kravchenko, who was following orders from
Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
Honcharov had been arrested on charges of being a member of a rogue
police gang that had been involved in contract killing. He died in
prison last August. The prosecutor general's office said he died of
spinal trauma as a result of being beaten.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko has said that if he is elected president, prosecutors
will pursue investigations into the death of Gongadze and other
high-profile criminal cases.

Nikolai Korpan, the doctor who oversaw Yushchenko's treatment, said
no ``functional damage'' would remain as a result of the dioxin
exposure. But the doctors said that Yushchenko's facial disfigurement
would remain for a long time as follow-up treatments continue.
