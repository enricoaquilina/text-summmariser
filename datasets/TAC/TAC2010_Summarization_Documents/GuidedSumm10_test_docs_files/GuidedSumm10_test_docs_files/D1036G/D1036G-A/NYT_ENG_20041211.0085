POISON FOUND IN CANDIDATE FROM UKRAINE

New tests conducted Friday night at a hospital in Vienna, Austria,
confirmed that Viktor A. Yushchenko, the Ukrainian opposition
candidate for president, had been poisoned with dioxin, providing an
explanation for a broad array of painful and disfiguring conditions
that plagued him during the past three months of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
There was "no doubt" that Yushchenko's disease "has been caused by a
case of poisoning by dioxin," Dr. Michael Zimpfer, president of the
Rudolfinerhaus Hospital said at a news conference on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have proved the source of his problem, and we clearly suspect
third party involvement," Zimpfer said in a subsequent interview. But
he said law-enforcement authorities would have to determine how the
poisoning occurred.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko and his aides had long insisted that he had been poisoned,
a charge that his opponents ridiculed, saying that the once-telegenic
candidate had been stricken by bad sushi or too much drink.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Yushchenko said: "It is my growing conviction that what
happened to me was an act of political reprisal against a politician
in opposition. The aim, naturally, was to kill me."
</P>
<P>
Zimpfer, who has been part of Yushchenko's medical team since he was
first rushed to Rudolfinerhaus in early September, said that
Yushchenko's blood dioxin level was "more than 1,000 times" the upper
limits of normal and that his initial severe abdominal pain suggested
that he had eaten the poison.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko has always been vague on the topic of who tried to poison
him.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Yushchenko, Irina Gerashchenko, said in a telephone
interview that the diagnosis compelled prosecutors to reopen a
criminal investigation into his poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Dioxin, a waste product of various industrial chemical processes, is
a highly toxic chemical that remains in the body for years after
exposure, so doctors were able to test their patient Friday, long
after the near-fatal poisoning occurred. Initially the poison often
produces severe abdominal pains, nausea and vomiting -- and, in the
long term, very high doses can produce the kind of skin cysts and
discoloration that have disfigured Yushchenko.
</P>
<P>
Such cysts can persist for years after the initial dose, as do
several other more subtle medical effects. Dioxin causes a strong
predisposition toward developing cancer later in life and can also
affect the body's fat metabolism. But none of that would affect
Yushchenko's political aspirations today. "If you survive the initial
attempt, you can do all right," Zimpfer said. "He is perfect
condition, in perfect mental shape."
</P>
<P>
An extremely unusual cause of poisoning, dioxin exposure most often
comes from industrial accidents where it is inhaled or absorbed
through the skin.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Vienna declined to speculate on exactly how Yushchenko was
poisoned.
</P>
<P>
"We weren't there and we will have to leave that to the legal
authorities to decide," he said.
