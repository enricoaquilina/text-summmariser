UKRAINE CANDIDATE'S ILLNESS STUMPS DOCTORS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
VIENNA, Austria
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the once-robust, telegenic man was wheeled in through the
sliding glass doors of the plush Rudolfinerhaus hospital in early
September, he was severely ill, conscious but groggy and complaining
of terrible abdominal pain. Multiple blood tests were abnormal,
doctors here say; his skin was covered with odd-looking lesions; and
his digestive tract was dotted with ulcers from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
Europe's most illustrious doctors were stumped; the patient's many
symptoms defied a unifying diagnosis. Eight days later, Viktor A.
Yushchenko, Ukraine's opposition leader, checked out against medical
advice, determined to return to the business of winning the
presidential election in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
In less than two weeks he was back, crippled by excruciating back
pain that required such huge doses of morphine to control that he
almost ended up on a ventilator. Once again, a week of testing found
no medical explanation.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko and his doctors agreed on a risky plan: Doctors threaded a
small tube through the skin of his upper back, into his spinal canal,
so he could receive constant pain-killing medication while
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
So it was that Yushchenko flew back to Kiev with a catheter lodged in
his back, escorted by a team of Austria's most elite doctors. He
campaigned with the tube in place for a week, attending several large
rallies, according to his press secretary, Irina Gerashchenko.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Zimpfer, the medical director at the hospital here,
personally supervised Yushchenko. "I went with him because I had
serious security concerns and I wanted to make sure he was handled
properly," he said. Indeed, the doctors had become increasingly
suspicious that foul play, possibly an unusual poisoning, could be
the cause of their patient's problems, a charge that Gerashchenko
repeated.
</P>
<P>
In interviews this week, the Austrian doctors were quick to emphasize
that, scientifically, they could not say that the candidate had been
poisoned. They tested only for common agents, and found none. But the
medical team became so concerned about the possibility of an
unconventional agent that they consulted biological and chemical
weapons experts.
</P>
<P>
"A poisoning without the poison is like a murder without a gun,"
Zimpfer said. "But if someone said to me, 'Look what we found!' I
wouldn't be at all surprised.
</P>
<P>
"In this case, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He continued: "As I've said to the family, If this is a poisoning,
it's going to be very tricky and tough to discover. They are not
going to use some regular household agent."
</P>
<P>
Gerashchenko said that Yushchenko was continuing to receive treatment
from Ukrainian doctors. "He feels much better than he did two months
ago, but he's far from ideal," she said.
</P>
<P>
New details of Yushchenko's hospital admissions in Vienna raise
disturbing questions: Was the candidate poisoned or infected with
some biological agent, and, if so, with what? What is his current
state of health, in the middle of a pivotal battle for power?
</P>
<P>
In September, Yushchenko immediately said he had been poisoned, but
that charge was lost among the heated political debates and
demonstrations in the final weeks of the campaign, which culminated
in the disputed election.
</P>
<P>
"Look at my face," Yushchenko told the Ukrainian parliament on Sept.
21, after his first stint in the Vienna hospital. "Note my
articulation. This is one-hundredth of the problems that I've had.
This is not a problem of political cuisine as such. We are talking
about the Ukrainian political kitchen where assassinations are
ordered."
</P>
<P>
Opponents dismissively suggested that the cause of Yushchenko's
hospitalization was bad sushi or too much alcohol; doctors here said
there was no evidence of either. But some doctors point out that it
is conceivable Yushchenko had the bad luck to develop a rare illness,
difficult to diagnose, at the height of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The issue has persisted because of the obvious disfigurement and
discoloration of his face, which is swollen and pocked with large
bumps and cysts, and is a dusky grayish color. The left eye is
bloodshot and sometimes waters.
</P>
<P>
Last week a British toxicologist, Dr. John Henry, suggested that
Yushchenko's symptoms were consistent with dioxin poisoning, which
causes a severe form of acne called chloracne. The condition occurs
months to years after exposure, when the body seeks to eliminate
residue of the chemical through the skin. But cases of dioxin
poisoning are extremely rare. Scientists debate whether a huge
one-timedose could be delivered as a poison.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Rudolfinerhaus said they did not test Yushchenko for
dioxin in part because his skin changes were much milder in
September, not suggestive of dioxin. The candidate refused a biopsy
of his face -- which doctors suggested to try to narrow down the
causes -- because he did not want to campaign with stitches. But
dioxin and related toxic chemicals are detectable in the body years
after exposure. Gerashchenko said tests for such substances had still
not been performed.
</P>
<P>
Some doctors not involved with the Yushchenko case, consulted for
their opinions, said that he could be suffering from an unusual
immune disease. Scleromyxedema, for instance, is an extremely rare
progressive disorder that produces facial symptoms much like
Yushchenko's. But it is not known to produce pain.
</P>
<P>
Dermatologists at Rudolfinerhaus initially suggested that the facial
lesions could represent a slightly unusual case of a well-known
condition called rosacea, where the face becomes swollen and lumpy.
But Zimpfer said Yushchenko's skin nodules no longer indicated that
disease.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Political intrigue is not the norm at Rudolfinerhaus, an elite
private hospital that caters to wealthy Austrians and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Zimpfer provided extensive details of Yushchenko's hospitalizations.
He arrived first on Sept. 10, severely ill and unable to walk, after
five days of terrible abdominal pain. Initial testing showed that he
had a high white cell count, as well as elevated liver and pancreas
enzymes, suggesting inflammation of those organs. His tests were
negative for all the obvious possibilities, like hepatitis caused by
a virus.
</P>
<P>
Scans showed that his liver, pancreas and intestine were, indeed,
swollen. Internal examinations of the intestine using an endoscope
found that he had ulcerations -- essentially bleeding abrasions -- of
the stomach and throughout his intestine and bowel as well. Ulcers
are typically not spread out in that way.
</P>
<P>
The doctors gave him supportive care, like intravenous fluid and a
restricted food intake to rest the digestive tract. As he gradually
recovered strength, he opted to get back to the campaign trail.
Already, doctors noticed that he was developing odd lesions on his
face and trunk.
</P>
<P>
Ten days later, the candidate returned, after three days of what he
called excruciating back pain. Its source was again a mystery, since
related lab tests and scans were normal.
</P>
<P>
The pain was so severe that doctors had to place a large-bore
intravenous line into Yushchenko's chest and essentially nearly
anesthetize him with huge doses of opiates. Because opiates depress
respiratory functions, his breathing rate slowed, and his vital signs
had to be constantly monitored. More medicine would have required
that Yushchenko be placed on a respirator, Zimpfer said.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko and his doctors made a difficult choice: They decided to
place an epidural catheter between his shoulder blades into the
membranes of the upper spine so that medicines could be delivered to
the nerves in his back without compromising his mental abilities.
</P>
<P>
Epidural catheters are common for pain relief in childbirth, but they
are far riskier when they are placed for longer periods and in the
upper back, closer to the brain and vital nerves.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko was discharged three days later, leaving with a retinue of
doctors and cartons of medical supplies. He was still on "plenty" of
medication, said Zimpfer. They arrived in Ukraine, and, after a few
hours, Zimpfer returned to Vienna, leaving Yushchenko in the care of
another Austrian doctor.
</P>
<P>
"He was severely ill, but this does not all add up to a single
disease or even a known syndrome," Zimpfer said. "At this point his
diagnosis is just a description of all his symptoms."
