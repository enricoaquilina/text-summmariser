Yushchenko Was Poisoned, Doctors Say

The illness that disfigured the face of opposition
presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko resulted from poisoning by
the toxic substance dioxin, which might have been placed deliberately
in his food, Austrian doctors who treated him told reporters in Vienna
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
``The criminal investigation does not fit within our purview but
... there is suspicion of third-party involvement,'' said Michael
Zimpfer, director of Vienna's private Rudolfinerhaus clinic, where the
candidate went for treatment in September after falling ill while
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
The face of the once youthful-looking Yushchenko, 50, was
mysteriously transformed into a blotch of lesions after he reached
Austria. He also suffered severe abdominal and back pain and paralysis
on the left side of his face. His appearance has continued to worsen,
raising public concern about his health despite his claims he is fully
recovering.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko contends he was poisoned in an assassination attempt by
``government officials'' who feared that he would defeat Prime
Minister Viktor Yanukovych in runoff elections held on Nov. 21. His
opponents have dismissed the charge, saying he got sick after gorging
himself on bad sushi and too much alcohol.
</P>
<P>
Yanukovych was officially declared the winner of the Nov. 21 vote.
The country's Supreme Court soon overturned that finding, citing
widespread poll fraud, and a new election will be held on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian doctors, addressing reporters in Vienna on Saturday,
said Yushchenko's long-term prognosis was good, though it could take
several years for his face to heal. For now, Yushchenko is ``fully
capable of working,'' said Nikolai Korpan, another doctor.
</P>
<P>
``If this dose had been higher, it may have caused death,'' Zimpfer
said, noting the dioxin could have been administered through food,
such as soup.
</P>
<P>
Dioxins are a group of organic compounds that contain chlorine.
They are a common byproduct in the manufacture of many industrial
chemicals, and are also a common contaminant from waste incineration.
They are a component of the Vietnam-era defoliant Agent Orange and
many researchers have labeled them a cause of cancer and other
diseases among people who were exposed to the defoliant.
</P>
<P>
Debate over dioxins' potency as a poison, as opposed to a
cancer-causing agent, has swirled for decades. But the compounds are
known to cause reproductive and developmental problems, in addition to
extreme skin eruptions known as chloracne.
</P>
<P>
Documented cases of acute dioxin poisoning are rare.
</P>
<P>
One notable case occurred in Seveso, Italy, in 1976, when an
explosion at a Hoffman-LaRoche chemical plant released a cloud of the
herbicide 2,4,5-T, exposing several thousand people to the chemical
and an estimated 45 pounds of dioxins, which typically arise as a
byproduct in the synthesis of 2,4,5-T.
</P>
<P>
Many people near the plant developed severe skin problems within
hours. In the months that followed, many who experienced heavy
exposures developed chloracne. Another case occurred in 1997 in
Vienna, where two employees of a textile institute developed chloracne
on their bodies, according to Olaf Paepke, a scientist at a Hamburg
institute, who conducted chemical analysis for the investigation. The
employees had levels of dioxin in their systems thousands of times
higher than normally found. Police were never able to determine how
the poisoning occurred, including if it was deliberate or accidental,
Paepke said. The employees survived.
</P>
<P>
Dioxins are not commercially available, Paepke said, but can be
obtained through industry contacts or made in a laboratory by people
with the proper skills. A tiny, unnoticeable amount placed in food is
sufficient to cause severe illness, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arnold Schecter, a dioxin expert at the University of Texas School
of Public Health at Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said
dioxins can be highly effective poison in people who are sensitive to
their effects. If Yushchenko was deliberately given dioxin, it was
done by ``someone was very clever and very knowledgeable,'' Schecter
said.
</P>
<P>
``If someone put a drop of pure dioxin in his food, he wouldn't
taste it, he wouldn't see it and a few days later he'd start to get
sick,'' Schecter said.
</P>
<P>
``If you are trying to kill someone quickly, it's not the way to
go,'' he said. ``But if you want to disable someone and want to do it
subtly and have it happen days or weeks or months after you have
contact with someone, this can do it,'' Schecter said. ``Plus there
are very few labs in the world that can accurately detect dioxin in
the blood.''
</P>
<P>
Paul M. Wax, with the American College of Toxicology, said two
scientists he met in Volgograd, Russia, in 1992, told him that during
the Soviet era they had investigated the potential of developing
dioxin as a chemical weapon.
</P>
<P>
Wax expressed doubts that dioxin could be used in that way. ``It
was never on anyone's list,'' said Wax, who now teaches courses on
chemical terrorism. ``We don't think about it as an acute poison that
can kill you. ... It's not going to cause someone to keel over on a
battlefield,'' but could cause long-term illness.
</P>
<P>
A Russian government specialist challenged the Vienna doctors'
findings. ``It is impossible to get a dose of dioxin today and get
poisoning tomorrow,'' said Yury Ostapenko, head of the Toxicology
Information Center at the Russian Health Ministry, speaking on the
Echo Moskvy radio station. ``Dioxins do not belong to immediate-effect
poisons: poisoning develops for years and decades.''
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the Austrian clinic had declined for weeks to issue a
finding on the cause of the illness, but said Saturday that tests
conducted in an Amsterdam hospital had confirmed the presence of
dioxin.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko flew to Austria on Friday for further tests at the
clinic. ``What happened to me was an attempt to politically destroy a
politician with opposing views,'' he said at a news conference in Kiev
on Friday, shortly before his departure. ``The aim was to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
Speaking to 5,000 supporters in the city of Luhansk before the
announcement in Vienna, Yanukovych said of Yushchenko: ``He certainly
is ill and I sympathize. Let him get well soon. As for the reasons, I
know nothing. Let the specialists work on that.''
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko supporters said the finding bore out what they had long
believed.
</P>
<P>
``This official confirmation is another opportunity to speak the
truth to the Ukrainian people and to show one more time the dirty
methods that were used by the authorities,'' said Yuri Yekhanurov, a
member of parliament, in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
In Vienna, Yushchenko struck an upbeat note Saturday. ``I plan to
live for a long time and I plan to live happily,'' he said. ``I am
getting better ... every day.''
