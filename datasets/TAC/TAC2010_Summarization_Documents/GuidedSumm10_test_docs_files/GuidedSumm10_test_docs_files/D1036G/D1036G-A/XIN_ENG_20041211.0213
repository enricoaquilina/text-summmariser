Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said
Saturday.

"There is no doubt about the fact that the disease was caused by
poisoning of dioxin," said Michael Zimpfer, director of the Vienna
Rudolfinerhaus hospital, where Yushchenko has been receiving
treatment.

"There were high concentrations of dioxin, most likely orally
administered," the doctor told a news conference at the hospital. "We
suspect a cause triggered by a third party."

Yushchenko, 50, spent a period at the Rudolfinerhaus clinic in
September and October after falling ill for unknown reasons. The
symptoms include severe stomach ulcers, spinal pains and disfiguring.

Yushchenko, who repeatedly claimed that he was poisoned by his
political rivals,  returned Friday to Austria to receive further
treatment.
