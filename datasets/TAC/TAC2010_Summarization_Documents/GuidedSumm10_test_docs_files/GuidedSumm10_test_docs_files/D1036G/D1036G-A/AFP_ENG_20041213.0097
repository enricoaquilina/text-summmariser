The poisoning of Ukraine's opposition icon Viktor Yushchenko
overshadowed the country's presidential election campaign Monday after
the Western-leaning candidate accused the government of trying to kill
him, and his pro-Russia rival denied any knowledge of the case.
</P>
<P>
"This is the work of the government," Yushchenko said upon his return
to Kiev late Sunday from an Austrian clinic where doctors confirmed
for the first time that he had somehow swallowed massive amounts of
the toxin that can cause cancer and death.
</P>
<P>
"If the prosecutor general keeps to the law and acts accordingly,
then soon Ukraine and the whole world will find out who did this,"
said Yushchenko, who underwent a new round of tests at the clinic
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the Rudolfinerhaus clinic determined that the pro-West
opposition leader was poisoned by ingesting a dioxin dose that
exceeded 1,000 times the safe limit -- possibly by eating spiked soup
-- causing his face to be disfigured weeks before the first round of
a presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko has previously charged that the hardline regime of
outgoing President Leonid Kuchma poisoned him to take him out of the
contest against Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, whom the opposition
leader comfortably led in the polls when he was struck.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Yushchenko refused to name any specific officials and said
the inquiry should determine the culprit.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very delicate question and one should not be accusing
anyone at this point -- this should be determined by the
investigation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yanukovich said Monday he could not have known anything about the
alleged government plot because as prime minister he did not oversee
the security structures that could have possibly orchestrated the
attack.
</P>
<P>
"In my job as prime minister, I did not have anything to do with the
work of law enforcement agencies. That was not my competence,"
Yanukovich told reporters when asked to comment on Yushchenko's
charges.
</P>
<P>
"I am insisting that law enforcement agencies get to the bottom of
this," he said when asked to respond to Yushchenko's charges.
</P>
<P>
"I sympathize as a person with Mr Yushchenko that he is sick. I hope
that he gets better soon."
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency reported Monday that the prosecutor
general's office has re-opened a criminal investigation into the case
after closing an earlier inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko will face Yanukovich on December 26 in a rerun vote after
the supreme court stripped the prime minister of his victory in the
November 21 runoff because of massive ballot fraud.
</P>
<P>
Before the doctors' confirmation, presidential administration
authorities have said that Yushchenko may have fallen ill from eating
spoiled food or perhaps drinking too much bad liquor.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the White House urged Ukraine to fully investigate the
"terrible" poisonin  Meanwhile Yanukovich pressed on with his message
that he would no longer represent the ruling regime in the December
26 vote after what he has called Kuchma's "betrayal" of him during
the talks with Yushchenko to resolve the standoff over the November
21 poll.
</P>
<P>
"I was deeply disappointed in this man," he told reporters. "This
crisis showed his true character and he began defending the interests
of himself and his family."
</P>
<P>
"The battle against me is being waged by the old government and
people who once served in government... those who robbed Ukraine and
drove her people to poverty," he said.
