Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych is urging Ukraine's parliament to
set up a special commission to see whether the United States financed
opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko's presidential campaign, his
spokesman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Evidence of American support (for Yushchenko) has surfaced more than
once. Therefore, Yanukovych is asking for a parliamentary
investigation," said Yanukovych's spokesman, Oleh Ternovsky.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine was plunged into a political turmoil after the presidential
runoff on Nov. 21, when both candidates claimed victory.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Supreme Court on Dec. 3 annulled the official results of
the runoff, with Yanukovych being the winner and ruled that a re-run
would be held on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the US Bush administration has spent more than
65 million US dollars in the past two years to aid political
organizations in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
US officials say the activities do not amount to interference in
Ukraine's election but are part of the 1 billion dollars the US State
Department spends each year trying to build democracy worldwide. They
say no American funds were sent directly to Ukrainian political
parties.
</P>
<P>
Yanukovych has often accused the United States of meddling in
Ukraine's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yushchenko, who is popular in the West, called for an
investigation to determine how he was poisoned by dioxin, but said it
should be conducted after the Dec. 26 re-run to avoid influencing the
results.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at a Vienna clinic in Austria said tests proved beyond doubt
that it was dioxin poisoning that caused a mystery illness in
September that left Yushchenko disfigured and in pain.
</P>
<P>
After the diagnosis, Ukraine's prosecutor general's office said it
had reopened the criminal investigation that it closed in November
for lack of evidence at the time.
</P>
<P>
Yanukovych campaigners rejected suggestions that the prime minister
could have been involved in poisoning Yushchenko.
</P>
<P>
There is "no logic in such an accusation," said Taras Chornovyl,
Yanukovych's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko fell ill on Sept. 5 and has been treated at the Vienna
clinic twice before.
</P>
<P>
Hospital director Michael Zimpfer said Yushchenko's blood contained
more than 1,000 times the normal amount of dioxin. He said tests
showed the toxin was taken orally.
</P>
<P>
Dioxin is a byproduct of industrial processes such as waste
incineration and chemical and pesticide manufacturing.
