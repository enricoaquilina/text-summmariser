The United States on Monday urged the Ukrainian government to fully
investigate the "terrible" poisoning of opposition leader Viktor
Yushchenko with the highly toxic substance dioxin.
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible news to hear, and it's certainly disturbing
reports," White House spokesman Scott McClellan said when he was
asked at a news briefing about the US reaction to the poisoning of
Ukrainian presidential candidate Yushchenko.
</P>
<P>
"I know the Ukraine government is investigating this matter fully, as
they should," McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor, Michael
Zimpfer, said Saturday. "There were high concentrations of dioxin,
most likely orally administered," said Zimpfer, director of the
Vienna Rudolfinerhaus hospital, where Yushchenko has been receiving
treatment."
</P>
<P>
Dioxin is a by-product of industrial processes such as waste
incineration and chemical and pesticide manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Yushchenko repeatedly claimed that he was poisoned by his political
rivals.
</P>
<P>
In response to reports the US is intervening Ukraine's election and
funding the opposition, McClellan claimed that "We do not and have
not supported any particular candidate in Ukraine's presidential
election."
</P>
<P>
"Our assistance is to support free and fair elections that reflect
the will of the people, and that's what we do all over the world,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has been in a political crisis since the Nov. 21 presidential
election, victory in which has been claimed by both pro-Moscow
candidate, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich, and pro- Western
candidate, opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Supreme Court has ordered to have a new runoff vote on Dec.
26.
