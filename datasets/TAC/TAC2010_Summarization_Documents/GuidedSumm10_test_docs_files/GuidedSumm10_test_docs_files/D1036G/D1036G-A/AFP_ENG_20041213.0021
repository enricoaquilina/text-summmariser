<P>
The White House Monday urged Ukraine to fully investigate the
"terrible" poisoning of opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko with the
highly toxic substance dioxin.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the diagnosis, made at an Austrian clinic, spokesman
Scott McClellan replied: "It was terrible news to hear, and it's
certainly disturbing."
</P>
<P>
"I know the Ukraine government is investigating this matter fully, as
they should," the spokesman said after doctors at the clinic
confirmed for the first time that Yushchenko had swallowed relatively
large amounts of dioxin.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader has charged that the hardline regime of
outgoing President Leonid Kuchma poisoned him to take him out of the
December 26  presidential re-vote pitting him against Prime Minister
Viktor Yanukovich.
</P>
<P>
McClellan also denied anew that US money that went to
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Ukraine ended up supporting
the Western-leaning Yushchenko directly.
</P>
<P>
"We do not and have not supported any particular candidate in
Ukraine's presidential election," he said. "The United States
strongly supports a democratic process that reflects the will of the
people of Ukraine."
</P>
<P>
"We have provided assistance to organizations supporting such a
process in Ukraine, and that includes NGOs, as well as other
international organizations, but that's to assist in voter education
and political party training, and it is also assistance which is made
available to all political parties in Ukraine."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he was sure that no US assistance ended up directly
helping Yushchenko, McClellan replied: "Yes."
</P>
<P>
"Our assistance is to support free and fair elections that reflect
the will of the people, and that's what we do all over the world," he
said.
