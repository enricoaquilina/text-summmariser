<HEADLINE> Hurricane Floyd Lashes the Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd vented its fury on the  
Bahamas on Tuesday -- toppling trees and power lines, stripping 
roofs off homes and shoving a roiling sea into streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Bearing down on Florida, Georgia and South Carolina -- where  
nearly 2 million people were urged to leave its path -- Floyd flung 
trees and debris into buildings in the Bahamas and chased 
frightened tourists from exposed hotel rooms to more enclosed 
space. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nassau, the capital, authorities lost telephone links  
throughout the vulnerable, low-lying archipelago -- including 
Eleuthera, San Salvador and Cat Island -- where winds reached 110 
mph and damage was feared to be extensive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't get through to San Salvador or Cat Island, but we  
expect it to be bad,'' said Melanie Roach, an official at a 
government command center. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd ripped roofs off homes and flooded some streets in  
Eleuthera Island, which has a population of 10,000, Roach said. 
Most residents were safely inside shelters; the island's popular 
Club Med resort had closed for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 380 Club Med guests of vacation chain's 11-story glass  
building in San Salvador were sitting out the storm, and there were 
no injuries reported, the main office in Miami said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Bahamas most populated island, New Providence, rescuers  
fought through driving rain to reach residents of battered homes. 
But the debris-strewn streets and 3-foot-high flooding in places 
made the job difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane uprooted 30-foot trees and sent blinding,  
horizontal sheets of rain through deserted streets. It shoved cars 
around and snapped palm trees in half. High winds set car alarms 
screeching throughout the capital, Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
	Several people in Nassau, which is on New Providence, were  
reportedly being treated for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's winds eased somewhat to 140 mph, down from 155 mph, but  
it was still a dangerous Category 4 storm capable of causing 
extensive damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In northern Nassau, residents reported flooding a quarter-mile  
inland. Officials warned that storm surges up to 20 feet could 
inundate parts of New Providence six miles inland, a daunting 
prospect for an island just seven miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 p.m. EDT, Floyd's center was over the Abaco Islands, or  
about 235 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. The hurricane 
had turned to the northwest and was moving at 12 mph, the U.S. 
National Hurricane Center said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vacationers throughout the Bahamas sought shelter inside secure  
hotel lobbies and enclosed rooms. As the power flickered on and 
off, they dozed on couches and floors, sipped coffee, played cards 
and waited for the storm to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	On Grand Bahama, worried residents took rooms at Freeport's  
Victory Inn, 2 miles from the nearest shore, which had been vacated 
by tourists fleeing the storm. Most brought their own canned food. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be really bad,'' said the inn's manager,  
Wenzel Armbister. To get through it, he said, ``we're having a 
hurricane party. We've got the bar open and everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Paradise Island, 2,000 guests at the sprawling Atlantis  
Resort sought refuge inside a convention center, along with 500 
resort workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's really cooperative. They know how serious this  
is,'' said Atlantis spokesman Ed Fields. 
</P>
<P>
	With one exception -- a man who watched the hurricane from his  
8th-floor balcony -- residents evacuated their beachfront homes and 
passed the hours with tourists inside the ballroom of Nassau's 
Marriott Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Enough! Let's get this over with,'' said a bored Paul Rodamol  
of Cannes, France, who tried and failed to get a flight out on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most hotel guests were frightened out of their rooms when  
Floyd's winds began howling and pelting the windows with tree limbs 
and debris. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was woken by what sounded like tin crashing down and got  
worried when I could feel the whole bed shaking,'' said Jeannine 
Bixby of Rumney, New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd also has forced hundreds of flights to and from Florida to  
be canceled, disrupting air traffic throughout the Caribbean.
