	MIAMI (AP) -- Authorities urged nearly 2 million people to  
evacuate coastal areas stretching from Florida to North Carolina 
today as Hurricane Floyd, one of the most powerful and biggest 
storms to ever threaten the United States, roared through the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's eye was expected to pass within 90 miles of southern  
Florida today, and perhaps come within 50 miles of north Florida's 
coast by Wednesday morning, before striking land somewhere farther 
north. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this thing parallels us, it could act like a weedeater  
going up the coast,'' said Craig Fugate of the Florida Emergency 
Operations Center in Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's top sustained wind eased today to 140 mph -- down from  
Monday's 155 mph but still a Category 4 storm, the second most 
powerful designation for a hurricane. Forecasters, however, said 
fluctuations in speed were expected. It would be Category 5 if wind 
speed reached 156 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Storm surges in the Bahamas were reported at 20 feet above  
normal as trees were snapped by the wind and communications lines 
were knocked out. Showers and sustained 36 mph from the 
600-mile-wide storm reached the Florida coast today. Gusts reached 
42 mph south of West Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those fleeing were Phyllis Cusack and her daughter, Lynda  
Patton. Caught in bumper-to-bumper traffic as they headed west out 
of Daytona Beach on Interstate 10, they didn't know where they were 
going to end up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are getting out of Dodge,'' Cusack said.  
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. EDT, Floyd was about 195 miles east-southeast of Palm  
Beach, or near Abaco in the Bahamas, and moving to the 
west-northwest at about 14 mph. A gradual turn toward the northwest 
was expected later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was most likely to make landfall in Georgia or the  
Carolinas, but ``we're so close to the coast that just about any 
small deviation could bring the hurricane onshore anywhere from 
central Florida northward,'' hurricane specialist Miles Lawrence 
said at the National Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane-force wind of at least 75 mph extended 125 miles from  
Floyd's center. Tropical storm-force wind of 39 mph was expected to 
reach Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach County this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	At Orlando, Walt Disney World was closing today for the first  
time because of weather. Universal Studios also was closing and 
SeaWorld shut down. Airlines canceled virtually all flights into 
and out of southern Florida, and the military sent aircraft inland 
and ships out of port to ride out the storm at sea. Crews of big 
civilian ships were told to get ready to leave port at Charleston, 
S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marine Corps was moving 7,000 recruits out of its Recruit  
Depot at Parris Island, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a skeleton crew was left at NASA's Kennedy Space Center.  
Three space shuttles were in the shuttle hangar, which is designed 
to withstand wind of only up to 105 mph, and the fourth was in the 
Vehicle Assembly Building, built to withstand 125 mph wind. Four 
multimillion-dollar rockets stood exposed on launch pads. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd was much larger than Hurricane Andrew -- another Category 4  
storm -- which smashed into South Florida in 1992, causing $25 
billion in damage, killing 26 people and leaving 160,000 homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane warning was in effect today from Florida City, south  
of Miami, to Brunswick, Ga., about 400 miles. A warning means 
hurricane conditions could be felt within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	A hurricane watch stretched northward to North Carolina, and a  
tropical storm warning was in effect for most of the Florida Keys. 
High surf advisories were in effect as far north as New York's Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1.8 million people were told to seek shelter along the  
coasts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, including all of 
Savannah, Ga. Nursing homes in coastal South Carolina started 
moving residents inland on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no reason for anyone to stay,'' said Charleston, S.C.,  
Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Highways were jammed today as coastal residents headed inland.  
Georgia closed a 90-mile stretch of Interstate 16 to eastbound 
traffic so people fleeing inland from Savannah could use every 
lane. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges said shelters would be open as  
far inland as Columbia, about 100 miles from the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther north, residents of North Carolina's Ocracoke Island,  
still drying out from Hurricane Dennis a week earlier, also were 
urged to evacuate, along with Bald Head Island at Cape Fear, 
because both are reachable only by ferry. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Ocracoke's 700 residents had stayed to ride out Dennis.  
However, said Hyde County Manager Jeff Credle, ``I think most 
people are going to leave this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National Guard forces were being activated in Florida, Georgia  
and both Carolinas. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina residents with memories of Hurricane Hugo 10  
years ago packed up as best they could. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you prepare for a storm that's going to wipe you out?''  
asked Buster Browne, a McClennanville, S.C., resident who rode out 
Hugo's Category 4 wind of 135 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``Category 1 or 2, you run out and buy plywood and do what you  
can,'' he said. ``If a Category 5's going to hit you, what the hell 
are you going to do? Get the stuff you want to save and leave 
town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States since  
record-keeping started: the 1935 Labor Day storm that slammed the 
Florida Keys, killing 423 people, and Hurricane Camille, which 
killed 256 people in Mississippi and Virginia in 1969.
