	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Storm-weary residents in the Bahamas  
braced for a brush with Hurricane Floyd as it swelled and powered 
up to a major storm, packing winds of up to 145 mph on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	By mid-afternoon, all of the Bahamas -- a 600-mile-long line of  
islands -- was under hurricane warnings or watches. Forecasters said 
they might also issue a hurricane watch for part of eastern Florida 
Sunday night or Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	If it stays on its current path, Floyd would hit the coast of  
Florida between West Palm Beach and Cocoa Beach. Forecasters 
expected the hurricane to begin turning north before landfall, 
though perhaps not much before. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said that by Tuesday the storm could approach the Abacos  
Islands and Eleuthera, which were blasted last month by Hurricane 
Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just got back on my feet from last month's scare,'' sighed  
Marie Johnson of Nassau as she pulled out a few bills to pay for 
flashlight and radio batteries at the City Market grocery store. 
Customers streamed into the store to pick up hurricane supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. hurricane hunter airplane reported Sunday evening that  
Floyd's winds had topped the 131 mph mark of a very dangerous 
Category 4 storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. National Weather Service recommended people along the  
southeast coast monitor the storm's course. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, emergency management officials began mobilizing,  
with the state's Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee calling 
in essential personnel for 'round-the-clock staffing. In Fort 
Pierce, officials began to analyze needs for residents who are 
disabled or need medical supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Floridians took advantage of the weekend's final day to  
take careful inventory of their hurricane supplies. Osvaldo Ibarra, 
hardware manager at a Home Depot in Miami, said sales were brisk 
for batteries, nails, rope and hurricane shutter fasteners. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are really buying the extra screws, the rope, and we've  
seen a lot more generator sales,'' Ibarra said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, south of the storm's  
center, meteorologists warned that the terrain was already 
saturated, and that there could be heavy flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials posted warnings for Hurricane Floyd across the central  
Bahamas and hurricane watches throughout the northwest Bahamas. 
Tropical storm warnings were in effect for the southeast Bahamas 
and Britain's Turks and Caicos Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm swelled in size during the weekend. Hurricane-force  
winds had broadened to 115 miles from Floyd's center by Sunday. 
Tropical storm force winds extended another 175 miles, and 
forecasters said the storm would likely strengthen overnight 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 p.m. EDT, Floyd was about 370 miles east of San Salvador in  
the central Bahamas, and was headed almost due west at 14 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's center is likely to pass close to the capital, Nassau,  
on Tuesday morning, said Arthur Rolle, deputy director of the 
Bahamas Meteorological Department. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, tourists in Nassau watched weather reports nervously.  
Honeymooners Michael and Julie Smith of Reynoldsburg, Ohio, 
lamented their bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this doesn't mean our marriage is going to be like this  
-- messed up,'' Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents Jean and Jerry Isaacs said they had canceled plans to  
spend a few days in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could get over okay today, but by the way things are going,  
it'll be tough getting back,'' Jean Isaacs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Floyd was joined Sunday by Tropical Storm Gert, which  
formed midway between Africa and Barbados. Forecasters said it was 
gathering strength quickly and could become a hurricane Sunday 
night or Monday.
