 &HT;    FEMA: HURRICANE DISASTER AID ALREADY IN PLACE
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN

   WASHINGTON - Wherever Hurricane Floyd hits, the federal agency
responsible for emergencies says it won't be as tardy as it was
after Hurricane Andrew, seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things going on that were not going on six
years ago,'' said Lacy Suiter, Federal Emergency Management
Agency's executive associate director.
</P>
<P>
   When Andrew slammed into Florida just south of Miami in August
1992, the tardy and disjointed federal response sparked cries of
anger from state and local authorities and prompted then-President
Bush to name his transportation secretary to coordinate the federal
effect.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA officials Monday said the agency has changed dramatically
since then. They said they were ready to roll and could have
supplies into an affected area within hours after the Floyd's
passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government is being not just reactive to events
and the requests of the governors, but we're being pro-active,''
Suiter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not waiting until the hurricane comes ashore to buy the
ice and buy the water and get the generators ready and get the
other things ready to move out to the area. We're doing it now in
anticipation of what the requirements might be,'' Suiter said.
``We've been through this enough to know what to anticipate and
what to plan for.''
</P>
<P>
   FEMA emergency response centers have been activated in Atlanta,
Ga., and Washington, D.C., and it has representatives at state
emergency centers from Florida to North Carolina. A hurricane
liaison team of federal emergency officials is also stationed at
the National Hurricane Center in Miami to monitor the latest
forecasts of the storm's path and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, FEMA has positioned ice, water, plastic sheeting,
cots, tents, and emergency food and medial supplies in Atlanta
where they can be delivered within hours wherever Floyd hits land,
said Bruce Baughman, FEMA director of response.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 30,000 rolls of plastic sheeting -- enough
to cover 25,000 roofless houses -- and some 100 tons of ice, he
said. The supplies are being kept in Atlanta, rather than closer to
where the hurricane might hit, in order to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on the track (taken by the storm) you don't want to
get it too far forward because the supplies themselves may become a
victim,'' Baughman said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the supplies on hand, FEMA has contracted with
suppliers to provide additional support such as debris removal,
roofing repairs and bulk water if needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the federal government is urging individuals to
prepare by making their property as hurricane-proof as possible
such as removing lawn furniture and listening to local government
warnings. Residents also are urged to check the FEMA website for
other tips at www.fema.gov.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious storm,'' Suiter said. ``It may be the worst
storm that we have had in many, many years.''
