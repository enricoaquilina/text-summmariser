WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Tropical storm Floyd
strengthened Friday to become the fourth Atlantic hurricane this
year, moving through the north Atlantic on a path that will take
it north of the Caribbean islands and toward the eastern United
States.

"The center of Floyd is still in the formative stage, but it
has intensified," said Richard Pasch, a hurricane specialist with
the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami. "We think it
could continue to strengthen and become a major hurricane in three
days."

At 14:00 GMT, the center of the hurricane was about 330
kilometers east-northeast of Barbuda at latitude 19.1 north,
longitude 58.9 west, the NHC said.
