PRECAUTIONS NEEDED AS YOUNG BALLPLAYERS TAKE THE FIELD

When 11-year-old Robert Hobbs steps up to the plate
this week, he won't have to worry about ducking a
curveball. They're not allowed. And he'll be wearing a plastic
guard over his face, covering his mouth and nose, in
case a "heater" is too fast to duck. Face guards,
like helmets, are required by the East Marietta National Little
League program.

As tens of thousands of metro Atlanta kids start baseball season,
parents and coaches for both Little League and church leagues
are taking steps to prevent accidents and injuries. But there
isn't any one set of standards: The use of face
guards, athletic cups and cleated shoes depend on individual league
guidelines and the level of skill. Four-year-old T-ballers might not
need the same safety equipment as older players dodging and
hitting balls traveling at about 60 mph.

<P>
Even so, from limiting the number of times a child can
pitch to having portable automated defibrillators on the field, everyone
is trying to make sure that the youngest "boys of
summer" have a good, safe time.

"We have a lot of rules, and they work wonderfully," says
Christine Hartney, 32, the league's security officer and whose son
Nicholas, 10, is one of its 320 players ranging in
age from 4 to 12.

Three portable automated external defibrillators are available at East Marietta whenever
kids are at the parks. The devices, which cost several
thousand dollars each, are designed to allow even novices to
jump-start a person's heart after a sudden cardiac arrest --
heart attacks that can strike spectators or even players.

<P>
About 15 kids a year worldwide die from being struck in
the chest with a ball, according to an international registry
established by the Minneapolis Heart Institute.
</P>
<P>
Richard Hilton, 71, who was at the helm in 1983 when
East Marietta won the Little League World Series, says all
parks should have defibrillators, and that most injuries suffered by
players could easily be avoided.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, about 30 million kids under 15 play youth league baseball.
And every year, more than 3 million suffer injuries that
require medical attention.
