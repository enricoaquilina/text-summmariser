TOURING WASHINGTON THE SEG-WAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a new way for visitors to tour the
nation's capital, and it doesn't involve walking, riding a bus
or taking a yellow, motorized "duck boat." Washington tourists can
now see the city by riding a Segway, a two-wheeled,
self-balancing scooter that -- if you haven't see one already
-- looks a lot like a futuristic chariot.
</P>
<P>
City Segway Tours, a company that began in 2003 in Paris,
offers tourists in Atlanta, Chicago, New Orleans, Vienna, Austria, and
now Washington a different way to see the sights.
</P>
<P>
For $65, tourists can spend four hours cruising down Pennsylvania Avenue
past the J. Edgar Hoover FBI building and the National
Archives before pulling up at the west end of the
U.S. Capitol, near the reflecting pool set in front of
it. After pausing to snap photos of the Capitol's famous
white dome, guests then zip along the National Mall, where
they pass the National Air and Space Museum, the National
Gallery of Art and the National Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
Riders cannot enter most of the tour stops. But after looping
around the Washington Monument, they can hop off their Segways
to explore the World War II, Vietnam, Korean and Lincoln
memorials on foot. Tour guides give the riders about 40
minutes to see the memorials, which surround the Reflecting Pool.
</P>
<P>
The tour concludes at the White House, where guides let guests
speed around freely on a section of Pennsylvania Avenue that
is closed to traffic. The entire ride covers about 7
miles.
</P>
<P>
On the Washington tour, guides atop Segways often carve the pavement
with skier-like moves, without gripping the handlebars. But for those
learning to ride a Segway for the first time --
myself included -- it's a test of faith with unfamiliar
technology.
</P>
<P>
With two wheels the size of medium pizzas, a raised platform
and a Razor scooter-like handlebar, the Segway doesn't look like
it could keep people standing. But gyroscopes and tilt sensors
inside the scooter keep them balanced.
</P>
<P>
Riders move the scooter forward and backward by shifting their weight
between their toes and heels. They turn or spin in
circles by using a throttle-like control on the left handlebar.
</P>
<P>
"You're a little tense when you first start out because you
don't know how it's going to react. But after five
or 10 minutes, it seems so natural. It's just like
walking," said Mark Shaw, 54, of Minneapolis. Shaw took a
Segway tour of Washington on Thursday with his wife and
two teenage sons.
</P>
<P>
Jim Woodhams, 67, of Silver Spring, Md., agreed that it was
easy to learn to use the Segway. He said a
police officer who uses a Segway at Baltimore Washington International
Airport told him he could learn it in five minutes.
</P>
<P>
"It turned out to be true," said Woodhams, who works at
the airport and took a Segway tour Wednesday. "I guess
I was surprised at how easily you can pick it
up."
</P>
<P>
Tour guides give guests a 40-minute training session and teach them
how to get on and off the Segway, and how
to make it go, stop and turn.
</P>
<P>
But riding a Segway is not without safety risks. On a
recent tour of Washington, one rider accidentally jumped a curb
while turning. Guides also told guests about a woman who
hit a small, concrete block, fell forward and cut her
lip.
</P>
<P>
Washington City Segway Tours manager Brian McNeill said most accidents happen
when the scooter's wheels hit obstacles like flower pots and
barricades that now surround most major sights in Washington. Sometimes
riders turn too quickly, he added. Riders must wear bicycle
helmets, and McNeill said tour guides warn guests about trouble
spots and places accidents have happened before.
</P>
<P>
Although Segways can travel up to 12.5 miles per hour, McNeill
said he gives tourists a certain key that allows them
a top speed of only 8 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, guests must be at least 16 years old. In
all other U.S. cities where City Segway Tours are given,
riders can be as young as 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
Shaw of Minneapolis said the Segway tour was a good tour
for his two teenage sons.
</P>
<P>
"Teenagers tend to get bored on tours but this was great.
They definitely weren't bored," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shaw's 16-year-old son, Steve, said the Segway tour was more fun
than a bus or walking tour.
</P>
<P>
"(Other tours) take a long time and you don't get to
see as much," he said. "With this you can go
really fast. It doesn't take much energy or as much
time, and you can see a lot more."
</P>
<P>
Not only do Segway tours allow riders to see the sights,
but they also make riders a spectacle themselves. Passersby sometimes
stop to photograph or videotape riders. Others just stop and
stare.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone we saw wanted to do it," said Shaw's wife, Anne,
54. "The little kids (we saw) said, 'Dad, can we
get one of those?"
