</HEADLINE>

SARASOTA, Fla.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We're all way too busy this time of year to have to deal with an
emergency-room visit or a 911 call.
</P>
<P>
Yet, hundreds of folks will end up sidelined by emergencies because
of candles, inline skates, age-inappropriate toys, improper food
handling and other common hazards.
</P>
<P>
Health and emergency officials say the pre-holiday rush is the
perfect time for each of us to take a deep breath and review some
basic survival skills so that we can focus on our "To Do" list
without a tragedy that easily could have been prevented.
</P>
<P>
USE CANDLES SAFELY
</P>
<P>
Candles can add a romantic touch during the holidays -- until
firefighters arrive. Sarasota County firefighters responded to 40
candle-related fires and Christmas tree fires in the past three years
that charred more than $240,000 in property.
</P>
<P>
Fire officials advise against placing lit candles in windows, where
curtains and blinds can knock them over or catch fire. Don't put
candles where pets can knock them over. Use sturdy candleholders that
won't tip over. And extinguish all candles in an unoccupied room or
when going to bed.
</P>
<P>
INCLUDE PROTECTIVE GEAR
</P>
<P>
Bicycles, inline skates, skateboards and scooters are popular holiday
gifts that should also include protective gear, such as helmets or
knee pads.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, more than half a million emergency room visits nationally
were made by people ages 14 and under for injuries from recreational
toys.
</P>
<P>
HEED LABEL RECOMMENDATIONS
</P>
<P>
Some toy-related injuries result from family members and friends who
overestimate a child's ability to handle a toy designed for older
children. Pay particular attention to the safety labeling on
packaging, such as "This toy is not appropriate for children under
the age of 3."
</P>
<P>
PRACTICE KITCHEN SAFETY
</P>
<P>
No point in making yourself, your family or your guests sick by
careless hygiene or food handling.
</P>
<P>
Florida Department of Health Secretary John Agwunobi offers these
reminders:
</P>
<P>
"Wash your hands before preparing or eating food, after using the
bathroom or changing a diaper, after handling uncooked food, after
playing with a pet, after handling garbage, after tending to someone
who is sick or injured, after blowing your nose and after coughing or
sneezing.
</P>
<P>
"When defrosting frozen foods, it's best to thaw the food in the
refrigerator, where it will remain at a safe, constant temperature of
40 degrees or below. If that's not possible, food can be defrosted in
the microwave, or by running cold water over the food item.
</P>
<P>
"Store leftovers within two hours of cooking. And when in doubt about
a food's safety, throw it out."
</P>
<P>
BEWARE OF REPTILES AS PETS
</P>
<P>
If you're like me, you may be unaware that many reptiles and
amphibians can pose a health hazard by spreading salmonella.
</P>
<P>
State health officials warn that lizards, snakes, turtles and other
amphibians and reptiles all carry and shed the bacterium which causes
diarrhea in humans.
</P>
<P>
Health officials say reptiles and amphibians should be kept ouf of
child-care centers and households with young children because minimal
direct contact can lead to illness.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms can include a fever, abdominal cramps and diarrhea
within 12 to 72 hours of exposure and can last for four to seven
days. The elderly, people with compromised immune systems and those
under age 5 can suffer more serious complications.
</P>
<P>
Experts recommend thoroughly washing hands with soap and water after
handling a reptile or amphibian or any object they've come in contact
with.
