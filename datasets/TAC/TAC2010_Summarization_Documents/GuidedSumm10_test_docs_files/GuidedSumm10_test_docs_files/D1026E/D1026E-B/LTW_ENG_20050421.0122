Older Riders Add to Rise in Motorcycle Fatalities

Margit Showalter's son lost his life in a motorcycle
accident. He wasn't a young kid out being reckless; he was a
41-year-old construction worker riding on a suburban Florida street on
a sunny day in January.
</P>
<P>
Michael Showalter's age made him part of a deadly trend on U.S.
highways, with over-40 riders accounting for a significant increase in
motorcycle fatalities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,900 people died on motorcycles in the United States in
2004, up 7.3 percent from the year before, according to preliminary
highway safety numbers released Thursday by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration. That's the seventh straight year of
increases in motorcycle deaths on U.S. roadways, for an 85 percent
overall rise since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the increase in motorcycle deaths -- 60 percent --
involved riders over age 40, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
More Americans are riding motorcycles than ever as aging, affluent
Baby Boomers recapture the Easy Rider dreams of their youth. In 2003,
the median age of all motorcyclists in the United States was 41,
according to the Motorcycle Industry Council. In 1985, the median age
was 27.
</P>
<P>
Total ridership hit 8.8 million in 2003 from 6.57 million just six
years before. The trend has led to the rebirth of the classic American
cycle builder Harley-Davidson and spawned a host of imitators out to
grab a share of the middle-aged market for full-throated, big-tired
cruising bikes. But along with that surge has come an increase in
motorcycle casualties among older riders.
</P>
<P>
``It has always been a presumption that young people are the ones
most over-involved in motorcycle crashes,'' said Joan Claybrook,
president of safety advocacy group Public Citizen. ``A lot of states
passed laws saying you have to wear a helmet if you're 18 or younger,
assuming that if you're over 18 you'll have good judgment and of
course you'll wear a helmet. Well, people don't.''
</P>
<P>
In fact, older riders have spearheaded a push to eliminate or
weaken mandatory helmet laws in states that have them, which safety
groups say has directly led to the increase in motorcycle fatalities.
</P>
<P>
Showalter, the Florida cyclist, was not wearing a helmet when he
was killed in a collision with a car. Though his mother says doctors
told her a helmet might not have saved her son, Margit Showalter can't
help approaching motorcyclists in parking lots to urge them to cover
up.
</P>
<P>
Florida repealed its mandatory motorcycle helmet law in 2000 under
pressure from cycle enthusiasts, capping a 30-year trend in which most
of the states that once required such safety equipment made helmets
voluntary. Today only Washington D.C. and 20 states, including
Virginia and Maryland, mandate motorcycle helmets.
</P>
<P>
``When we lived in Maryland (in the 1980s), he wore a helmet,''
Showalter said. ``We tell little kids, when they ride their tricycles,
to wear a helmet. But we're letting a motorcycle that drives on a main
road with Hummers and trucks go without it? To me, I have a problem
with that.''
</P>
<P>
But many motorcycle enthusiasts argue that personal freedom is
central to their love of cycling and that governments shouldn't tell
them how to take care of themselves. ``Personal choice is what we
want,'' said Jim Cannon, 45, of Richmond, head of the Virginia
Coalition of Motorcyclists. ``In my case, I feel a lot more aware
without a helmet. I feel unencumbered. Truth be known, I'm probably a
safer rider without a helmet.''
</P>
<P>
Cannon worked on legislation to repeal Virginia's mandatory helmet
law during this year's General Assembly session. Though the effort
failed, he said the keys to improving motorcycle safety lie in better
training -- both for riders and for car and truck drivers, who need to
pay more attention to cyclists.
</P>
<P>
The reason fatalities rise in states that repeal helmet laws, he
said, is that motorcycle ridership increases. With more bikes on the
road, there are bound to be more accidents, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm of the
auto insurance industry, disagrees. ``Motorcyclists are at risk
because they don't have the protection that's built into cars, SUVs
and pickups,'' said institute chief operating officer Adrian Lund.
``There's one thing that would help all motorcyclists of all ages, and
that's to get universal helmet laws in all states.''
</P>
<P>
NHTSA's statistics, which will be revised later this year, showed
that motorcycles accounted for more than 9 percent of the 42,800 total
fatalities projected nationwide for 2004. In 1997, motorcycles
accounted for 5 percent of all fatalities.
