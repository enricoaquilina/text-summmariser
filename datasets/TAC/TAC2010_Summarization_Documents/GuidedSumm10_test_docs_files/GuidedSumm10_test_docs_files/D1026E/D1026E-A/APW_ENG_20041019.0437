More than 2,500 motorists hit with tickets in seatbelt crackdown in
Argentine capital
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Police ticketed more than 2,500 people in the Argentine capital for
failing to wear seatbelts in the opening days of a campaign that had
motorists fuming as they reluctantly buckled up.
</P>
<P>
Police handed out 2,184 tickets on Monday alone to unbuckled drivers
and passengers, the first day of the crackdown. That was nearly
double the number of tickets issued in the first six months of this
year. Authorities said they issued over 520 additional tickets by
midday Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Why do we have to buckle up? It makes no sense," grumbled taxi
driver Eduardo Latorre, adding he had not seen such a zealous seat
belt campaign in 17 years of navigating through the capital's chaotic
streets. "Maybe this would be a good measure on the open highway
where it would save lives, but not in Buenos Aires."
</P>
<P>
The law, which has been in force since 1997, requires all occupants
of cars, including taxis, to wear seatbelts. But it was rarely
enforced until the campaign began Monday.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Silveira, president of a road-safety advocacy group, said he
welcomed the crackdown on violators, but feared the enforcement
effort might not last.
</P>
<P>
"It's very typical here that authorities announce a campaign for
something ... and after a few days all is forgotten," said Silveira,
who heads the group "Let's Fight For Life."
</P>
<P>
More than 7,000 people were killed in road accidents in Argentina in
2003, according to Silveira, a death rate reported to be at least
seven times higher than in most industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
Victims have included the Duchess of York's mother, Susan Barrantes,
killed in a 1998 car accident in Argentina. Two years ago, thousands
of music fans gathered to mourn the death of pop music star Rodrigo
Bueno, killed in a car crash near Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
Many of the city's drivers weave erratically between lanes and
routinely ignore red lights and stop signs. Speeding and drunken
driving also contribute to the country's high death rate, Silveira
said.
</P>
<P>
With the new crackdown, motorists were hastily buckling up to avoid
fines of up to 500 pesos (US$175, euro140), said highway safety
officer Fabian Dente.
</P>
<P>
"The message is getting out. We had more than 2,000 tickets issued
Monday but today there were only 520 issued by midday," said Fabian,
who was manning a seatbelt checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
He said most violators were being ticketed, though a few only
received warnings.
</P>
<P>
Dente said highway authorities are determined to enforce basic road
safety measures. This year, police are continuing a crackdown against
motorcyclists riding without helmets. Authorities are also using
cameras to catch traffic violations at key intersections.
</P>
<P>
Many in Buenos Aires praised the enforcement effort.
</P>
<P>
Liliana Echegaray, 44, said most people don't appreciate the danger
posed by reckless driving.
</P>
<P>
"Almost no one uses seatbelts. No one respects the law," she said. "I
think it's very good for safety."
</P>
<P>
Gustavo Doglio, 35, predicted the crackdown would cause more people
to buckle up to avoid being fined. Still, he warned the initiative
wouldn't necessarily lead to more responsible driving.
</P>
<P>
"We Argentines are just like that, we fly through the air," he said.
