CHILLS THAT FEVER
</P>
<P>
Even though colds are called colds, most people know that viruses are
to blame, not the temperature. But a small group of people come down
with fevers when they experience chills, according to an article
published Saturday in The Lancet, the medical journal.
</P>
<P>
One of the study's authors, Dr. Hal Hoffman of the University of
California at San Diego, estimates that about 300 people, most in the
United States, suffer from the disorder, familial cold
autoinflammatory syndrome, or FCAS, which is caused by a single
genetic mutation.
</P>
<P>
In FCAS, what matters is not the actual temperature but the feeling
of being chilled. "It doesn't have to be very cold," Hoffman said.
"The biggest complaint of FCAS patients is air-conditioned rooms."
</P>
<P>
To track the disease, Hoffman visited reunions of families carrying
the affliction. It appears likely that most of the cases stem from a
single immigrant in the 1600s, he said, although a few result from
more recent mutations. Along with their symptoms, the patients also
share a common family folklore. The story is that the disease started
when an ancestor fell into cold water.
</P>
<P>
The new study tested an arthritis drug, anakinra, which blocks the
effect of a protein that is part of the chain of reactions identified
in the cold syndrome. First, three women with the disorder were
monitored after they sat in a 36-degree room for 45 minutes. All
three developed fevers and rashes in the hours that followed. But
none did when given an injection of anakinra before a second
chilling.
</P>
<P>
Though word of the drug's effectiveness has spread, only a few use it
regularly, Hoffman said. Some can't afford it -- it's not covered by
most insurance -- and others prefer to continue to bundle up.

REFLUX TRIGGERS
</P>
<P>
A new study from Norway adds smoking and eating salty food to the
list of habits that can lead to chronic acid reflux.
</P>
<P>
The study found that coffee, alcohol and tea appear to have no effect
on the odds of developing the disorder, which is marked by heartburn
and frequent regurgitation, while exercise and high-fiber bread
appeared to offer some protection.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for coffee or wine lovers who already suffer from
reflux, the study's lead researcher said the findings did not mean a
green light for their consumption.
</P>
<P>
Coffee and alcohol, along with favorites like chocolate and spicy
foods, can still bring on symptoms in reflux patients even if they
play no role in its development, said the researcher, Dr. Magnus
Nilsson of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
The study, published on Thursday in Gut, a journal of the British
Medical Association, was based on two surveys, carried out a decade
apart, that included the bulk of the population of a rural county in
central Norway.
</P>
<P>
A group of 3,153 people who reported reflux were compared with 40,210
people who reported no significant symptoms.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that the odds of developing reflux were 70
percent higher for longtime smokers than for nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
People who ate a lot of salted fish and meat -- traditional foods in
the area -- and those who always added salt at meals were
significantly more likely to develop reflux than those who never did.
</P>
<P>
A half-hour session of strenuous physical activity once a week or
more, and regular consumption of high-fiber bread both appeared to
cut the risk of reflux in half, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Nilsson said that other research conducted by his team showed that
people with reflux and people worried about developing it would both
also benefit from losing excess weight.
</P>

EPILEPSY AND INJURIES
</P>
<P>
Many people with epilepsy restrict their activities, fearing injury
during seizures, even if the disease is well controlled. But those
fears appear to be overblown, a new Mayo Clinic study concludes.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the journal Neurology, examined the medical
records of 247 epilepsy patients who were followed for an average of
10 years. It found that only 39 of them suffered seizure-related
injuries and that most of them were minor, usually bruises to the
head.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the injuries occurred among people with the most serious
cases: those with uncontrolled seizures, with generalized convulsions
or drop attacks, or those who had suffered injuries in falls in the
past, according one of the study's authors, Dr. Elson L. So of the
Mayo Clinic. Frequency of seizures was the strongest predictor of
injury, he said.
</P>
<P>
So said that being too cautious carried its own risks, possibly
resulting in "social isolation, physical inactivity and psychological
dependency."
</P>
<P>
He advises people with epilepsy outside the high-risk category to
take basic safety measures like wearing helmets while biking. They
may also consider having companions or supervision for more dangerous
activities like swimming.
</P>
<P>
Those at higher risk should work with their doctors to bring their
seizures under the tightest possible control, he said. They should
avoid driving and stress and should modify their homes to reduce the
chance of accidents or injury, he said.
</P>
<P>
An editorial accompanying the article noted that a loosening of
restrictions for drivers with epilepsy had not been accompanied by
noticeably higher accident rates.
</P>
<P>
THE LANGUAGE OF POSTURE
</P>
<P>
The brain reacts more powerfully to the body language of a person in
a posture denoting fear than it does to a fearful facial expression,
according to a study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The study found that fearful postures activated areas of the brain
that happy or neutral postures did not, said the study's lead
researcher, Dr. Beatrice de Gelder of Massachusetts General Hospital
in Boston. And the reactions to body language involved several areas
of the brain not activated by reading faces, including some that
process emotions and others that prepare for action.
</P>
<P>
"You could almost say that when you see a fearful body you react with
your whole body," de Gelder said. She said the study, published
online in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
offered support to Darwin's theory that emotions are useful in an
evolutionary sense because they predispose us to actions that
increase the chance of survival.
</P>
<P>
For the study, actors were asked to depict scary situations like
opening a door and finding a robber, along with happy or emotionally
neutral ones like pouring water. Still pictures of these, with the
actors' faces blurred out, were presented to seven test subjects
while their brains were scanned with equipment to detect what regions
of the brain were being activated.
</P>
<P>
De Gelder said the brain might react more powerfully to emotions
signaled through body language than to faces because faces also
convey other information, like personal identity, that could slow
down mental processing in a moment of danger.
