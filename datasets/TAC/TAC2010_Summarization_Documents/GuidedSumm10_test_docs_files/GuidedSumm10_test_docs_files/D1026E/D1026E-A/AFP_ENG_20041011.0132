ss problems with the way transportation is organized, factors
contributing to accidents, the need to create better safety devices
for vehicles and passengers and to build a better mechanism to
respond to accidents, Kurg said.
</P>
<P>
By mandating the use of seat belts and helmets for motorcyclists,
cracking down on speeding and drunken driving and ensuring good
visibility on all roads, China would be able to reduce road
fatalities, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These are five important elements that can be effective and that are
not expensive to implement," Kurg said.
</P>
<P>
China's growing love with the autocar has resulted in its car market
growing by up to 80 percent in 2003 to the world's fourth largest,
but which on the street has meant increasingly treacherous roads
jammed with inexperienced and unsafe drivers.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on statistics provided by the Chinese government,
estimated that some 250,000 people died on Chinese roads in 2002,
while more than 16 million a year are injured.
</P>
<P>
Official Chinese statistics, however, say that around 104,000 people
died in traffic accidents in the country in each of the years 2002
and 2003, an average of about 285 people a day.
</P>
<P>
WHO officials said that the number of fatalities officially published
by China is based largely on data provided by the Public Security
Bureau alone and not on inter-agency data as was tabulated in the WHO
report.
</P>
<P>
"These are all estimates, the numbers are possibly underestimated (by
China), and maybe overestimated by the WHO," Kurg told AFP.
</P>
<P>
"But what we do know is that the problem is very big, that China has
the highest rate in the world and the number of deaths is going up
very rapidly."
</P>
<P>
Road traffic fatalities in China are predicted to increase to almost
half a million deaths each year by 2020 unless urgent action is
taken, the WHO said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The side effects of these road accidents is that families are driven
into poverty as most of the victims are the breadwinners of their
families," said Richard Scurfield, head of the World Bank's
transportation sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the economic impact of China's poor road safety is
enormous, costing the country between 12 to 21 billion dollars
annually, or between one and two percent of China's GNP.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a transportation specialist and I have worked with (China's)
Ministry of Communications to jointly try to tackle the road safety
issue, but I think that my colleagues agree with me that we weren't
very successful," Scurfield, who lived and worked in China for many
years, said.
