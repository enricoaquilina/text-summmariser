LAW REQUIRES CHILDREN TO WEAR HELMETS WHILE SKATEBOARDING

New York state's politicians have been accused of leaving most major
legislative business unfinished this year. But they did accomplish
one thing that will have far-reaching implications for young
daredevils: passing a law requiring that children under 14 wear
safety helmets while riding skateboards in public areas.
</P>
<P>
The measure, which Gov. George E. Pataki signed on Nov. 16, mirrors
the state laws already in place to protect bicycle riders and those
who use in-line skates against serious head injuries.
</P>
<P>
"Skateboards can be at least as dangerous to ride as bicycles or
in-line skates," according to a legislative memorandum in support of
the bill. "This is because many skateboard riders practice dangerous
stunts and flips on flat surfaces or walls."
</P>
<P>
The law takes effect on Jan. 1. J. Stephen Casscles, the counsel to
Sen. William J. Larkin, Jr., a Republican from the Hudson Valley,
said the senator pushed the issue after a police chief in his
district raised concerns about the safety of child skateboarders who
mimic stunts from video games. Pataki's action means that New York
has joined other states, including California, a center of
skateboarding in the country, in requiring helmets.
</P>
<P>
Though many people who skateboard said they could understand the need
for safety in their sport, some wondered if it the law went too far.
</P>
<P>
Brad E. Kodesh, president of the A1skateboards.com Web site, which
sells skateboard equipment, said he did not think the law was
necessary, because "ultimately, I think, wearing a helmet is the
rider's decision; it should be enforced by the parents."
</P>
<P>
Kodesh, 25, said he uses a helmet and kneepads only when he goes to a
special skate park, and said he has suffered, "some broken bones but
no major injuries, thank goodness."
</P>
<P>
Josh Rabinowitz, the publisher of the SkateboardDirectory.com
skateboard directory and search engine, said he saw the law chipping
away at civil liberties and parents' rights to raise their children
the way they want to. . Rabinowitz, 34, of Manhattan, said the law
was just another way for government to raise revenue, "like all of
these ticketing laws that are supposedly for our safety."
</P>
<P>
For a first violation, a skateboard rider would be warned of the need
for a helmet, but on subsequent violations, the rider's parent or
guardian could be fined up to $50, said Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman
for the governor, who noted that judges would have discretion.
