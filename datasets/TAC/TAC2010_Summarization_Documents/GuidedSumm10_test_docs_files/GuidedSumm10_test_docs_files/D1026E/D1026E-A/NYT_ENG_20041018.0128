PERSONAL HEALTH: WINNING IS GOOD, PLAYING SAFELY IS BETTER
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Few people would question the value of participating in sports for
young people. With proper training, supervision, protective equipment
and techniques, and an appropriate emphasis on winning, sports can
foster a healthy body and spirit and a lifelong interest in being
active and fit. Without such measures, childhood sports can lead to
disillusionment, injuries and even paralysis or death.
</P>
<P>
Even in the best circumstances, no activity can be risk-free. But
most serious hazards are preventable. Cyclists and football players
can reduce their risks by wearing helmets; hockey players by wearing
masks; basketball and tennis players by wearing eye guards; baseball
players by wearing batting helmets.
</P>
<P>
In addition, risks to individual players can often be detected, and
thus prevented, through a properly performed medical exam before a
child plays. For accidents that may not be preventable, having an
emergency plan and first-aid equipment available, and someone trained
to use the equipment, can be lifesaving.
</P>
<P>
Still, each year, according to the American College of Sports
Medicine, more than 775,000 children under 14 are treated in
emergency rooms for sports injuries, nearly half of them preventable.
An estimated 300,000 athletes experience exercise-related heat
illnesses each year, and almost all of them should have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
Further, from half to three-fourths of sports-related concussions are
never even diagnosed; the injured are often sent back into play too
soon and put at risk of another more serious brain-damaging
concussion. To help reduce these risks, the National Center for
Sports Safety, with the National Athletic Trainers' Association,
offers a three-hour online safety course for coaches for $28 at
www.SportsSafety.org.
</P>
<P>
Now, fewer than 10 percent of the 2.5 million volunteer coaches and
33 percent of the interscholastic coaches receive any type of
coaching education, the National Youth Sports Safety Foundation
reports.
</P>
<P>
In March, in a lacrosse game at Cornell University, a shot by a
Binghamton player struck Cornell's defenseman George Boiardi above
the heart, killing him.
</P>
<P>
His death, from a fatal cardiac disturbance called commotio cordis,
was the second in four years for a Cornell athlete that resulted from
a chaotic heart rhythm. The other death, of a freshman wrestler named
Graham Morin in November 2000, was a result of a rare, previously
undetected heart disorder called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
</P>
<P>
In each case, if an automatic external defibrillator had been
available and used within four minutes of the athlete's collapse,
there was a good chance that he would have been saved, with his brain
intact. Likewise for Ryan Boslet who died at 17 in February 2003,
during football drills in the high school gym in Alpharetta, Ga. His
grandmother, Carol Boslet of Annapolis, Md., is campaigning for
improved physicals for teenage athletes before they take part in
sports and better education, especially among coaches and trainers.
</P>
<P>
Had Boslet's coaches been well informed about this hazard and paid
closer attention to him, the outcome would probably have been
different. Carol Boslet reports that her grandson was constantly
short of breath after physical activity, that he was intolerant of
the summer heat at football camp and that he felt faint during a
football practice. Such symptoms warranted a closer look at his
cardiovascular system by a knowledgeable doctor. (The exam to detect
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an echocardiogram, costs about $800. It
is not likely to be used to screen all teenage athletes, who are the
ones most at risk, although Italy does such screening routinely.)
</P>
<P>
A number of cardiac problems can result in sudden death in a young
athlete, including myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart), mitral
valve prolapse, long QT syndrome and Marfan syndrome. A careful
family and personal history, with a well-done physical exam, can help
detect these problems early. Young athletes should be asked about
occurrences of chest pain on exertion, passing out during physical
activity and excessive shortness of breath or fatigue in exercise.

</P>
<P>
Another potentially disastrous injury, paralysis from the neck down,
can result from the use of an improper technique in football tackles.
</P>
<P>
Called spearing, it involves one player tackling another using the
top of his helmet, either intentionally or inadvertently, when a
player lowers his head in a tackle. The result can be a permanent
paralyzing compression injury to the cervical spine. Defensive
players are most at risk, but others also risk paralysis by lowering
their heads at contact.
</P>
<P>
Better training is needed -- players should use their shoulders or
chests and keep their heads up during tackles -- and penalties for
helmet contacts must be enforced. Although children today are
generally more sedentary than ever before, more youngsters are
involved in organized sports and at ever-younger ages. Pushing
children to play too early or to take part in a sport chosen by the
parents can backfire.
</P>
<P>
Placing excessive physical and psychological demands on children that
they are unable or unwilling to handle can turn them off activities
for life. Be sure that your child has the desire, strength,
coordination and ability to perform the activity and that the coach
is able to teach the skills. Another hazard is overtraining, often
from pressures to win when the goals should be fun, fitness,
friendship and sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
When an athlete overtrains, the risk of overuse injuries increases
sharply. The result can be long-lasting and painful damage to bones
and joints. Tune in to the signs of overtraining: The child's
performance may slack off, motivation to practice may be lacking and
the child may tire easily or become irritable or unwilling to
cooperate. Dr. Lyle Micheli, director of the sports medicine clinic
at Children's Hospital Boston, suggests starting with an emphasis on
athletic technique, and only when that is mastered should power or
speed be addressed.
</P>
<P>
He recommends increasing a young athlete's training time by no more
than 10 percent a week to reduce the risk of injury. Another concern,
he said, is nutritional abuse, which afflicts as many as 250,000
young American men who starve themselves every year to make weight in
wrestling, along with an untold number of figure skaters, gymnasts
and dancers who struggle to remain slim through undernutrition,
dehydration and eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
All can impair normal growth and development and, in the long run,
their basic health. At the opposite extreme are young football
players who gorge on sweet and fatty foods to bulk up, but put on
body fat, not muscle, setting the stage for future problems with
obesity.
</P>
<P>
Exercise-induced heat illness can be devastating, especially for
those who start football practice in late summer. Every coach should
insist on frequent breaks for water and rest in the shade, plan
practices for early or late in the day and avoid use of full uniforms
in hot weather.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the consistent use of proper-fitting and well-maintained
protective athletic equipment is a must for every young athlete.
Playing surfaces should be well maintained and someone well trained
in emergency medical services should be onsite at games and practice
sessions.
