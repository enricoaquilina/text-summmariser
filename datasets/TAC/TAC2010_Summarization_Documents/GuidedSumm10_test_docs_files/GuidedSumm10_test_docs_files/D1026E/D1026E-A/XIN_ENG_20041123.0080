ASEAN Transport Ministers issued a ministerial declaration on ASEAN
road safety Tuesday to enhance the road safety and reduce the traffic
casualties in member countries.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was issued at the 10th ASEAN Transport Ministers
Meeting held here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With the road safety problem in the region has reached alarming
proportion, Ministers determined to establish an ASEAN Multi- Section
Road Safety Working Group to coordinate and oversee the
implementation of the ASEAN Road Safety Strategy and Action Plan
2005-2010, adopted by the ministers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They also vowed to commit to raise the safety standards on ASEAN
roads, identify the most dangerous sections on the ASEAN road
networks and implement systematic programs for accident prevention.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, ASEAN countries will promote the gradual
harmonization and amendment of the key road safety regulations and to
promote awareness and steady enforcement of traffic rules and
regulations among the citizens, such as those pertaining to speed
limits, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and the
wearing of safety helmets and safety seat belts.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by Asian Development Bank (ADB), Motorcyclists
and pedestrians are by far the biggest proportion of those killed or
injured. Many of these motorcyclist casualties could be avoided if
there was widespread wearing of safety helmets.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the ministers agreed to foster the development of a new
culture of road safety among citizens especially the young,
school-age or child population.
</P>
<P>
The figures from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Monday showed
that some 75,000 persons were killed and more than 4.7 million were
injured in road crashes in Southeast Asian countries during 2003. The
annual economic losses from road crashes are estimated to be around
15 billion US dollars, or 2.2 percent of the region's total gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
ADB warned that "if Southeast Asian nations don't start taking road
safety seriously, there will be 385,000 road deaths and 24 million
injuries in the next five years, incurring more than 88 billion
dollars in economic losses."
