SOCCER HEADGEAR CAUSES CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most soccer players on the Santa Clara University women's team will
enter the NCAA quarterfinals on Saturday wearing protective equipment
-- headgear -- that is as controversial as it is lightweight.
</P>
<P>
In the 15 months since FIFA, soccer's world governing body, began
permitting its use, headgear has been used by thousands of American
players from youth leagues to high school to colleges to the pros.
The headgear gained international visibility during the 2003 Women's
World Cup and the Athens Olympics.
</P>
<P>
This has triggered alarmed skepticism within the U.S. Soccer
Federation, which contends that marketing to the fears of parents has
trumped science regarding the effectiveness of headgear in preventing
concussions.
</P>
<P>
This resistance, though, has not dissuaded a small number of youth
clubs from requiring the use of headgear.
</P>
<P>
"I remember when baseball players didn't wear batting helmets," said
Steve Ryan, commissioner of the Major Indoor Soccer League, which
approves of headgear. "You see some resistance in soccer, which is
natural. But I expect over time, you will see it broadly accepted."
</P>
<P>
The founder of a San Diego-based company called Full90 said he has
sold 100,000 headgear, which resemble an enlarged headband, weigh
less than 2 ounces, and cover the forehead, temples and occipital
bone in back of the head. The device is made of shock-absorbing foam
situated between an outer layer of Lycra and an inner layer of
sweat-absorbing polypropylene. Several models are available at prices
ranging from $24 to $39.
</P>
<P>
Full90 does not claim that its headgear prevent concussions. But the
company does say the headgear can reduce, by up to 50 percent, the
peak impact forces that occur during typical collisions when a
player's head strikes another head, the ground, an elbow or a goal
post.
</P>
<P>
The headgear debate is occurring at a time when some studies indicate
that concussions occur in soccer at a rate similar to football.
</P>
<P>
This is also a moment supercharged with disagreement on whether
heading of the ball can cause concussions or long-term brain
impairment. Studies have presented contradictory results, and the
matter remains disputed as the soccer federation undertakes a
long-term examination of head injuries.
</P>
<P>
The resolution of these head-related issues could have far-reaching
health and financial impact, given that nearly 18 million people play
soccer in the United States.
</P>
<P>
On one side of the headgear argument is Jeff Skeen, founder of
Full90. He said he developed the protective device after his daughter
Lauren suffered two soccer-related concussions in high school,
causing her to quit the sport.
</P>
<P>
At 46, Skeen possesses the righteousness of the aggrieved parent. He
believes his product can reduce head injuries without giving an
illicit advantage in heading the ball.
</P>
<P>
The soccer federation, which permits headgear but does not endorse
it, fears that its wide use would undermine the assertion that soccer
is a safe alternative to football, Skeen said. He likens the doubt of
soccer officials to familiar but failed arguments once made against
the use of bicycle helmets, automobile seat belts and soccer shin
guards.
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to thwart the evolution of headgear in soccer
because they think it will scare soccer moms away from the sign-up
table," Skeen said of soccer federation officials. "And because they
think it could be viewed as an admission that heading the ball itself
is dangerous."
</P>
<P>
Calvin Williams, founder of the Kangaroo headgear company, said he
thought soccer officials resisted the equipment because they felt "it
is sissified."
</P>
<P>
Soccer federation officials disagree, saying their caution is based
on scientific uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
Insufficient independent evidence exists to confirm that headgear can
reduce the risk of head injuries, they say. Doctors affiliated with
the federation also say that headgear is being marketed primarily to
children, who least need them because there is little incidence of
concussions in players under the age of 12.
</P>
<P>
Players might develop a false sense of security, relying on headgear
instead of proper medical evaluation after suffering a concussion,
federation doctors say. Or, they say, players might feel invincible
in headgear and play with reckless aggressiveness, displaying
behavior known as the Superman effect.
</P>
<P>
Rather than headgear, federation officials advocate better technique,
stricter rules enforcement and improved officiating to reduce the
number of head injuries. Some also recommend mouth guards and padded
goal posts instead of padded headgear.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence headgear are going to help, and some
theoretical stuff that it could hurt," said Dr. Gary Green, a
clinical professor at the UCLA division of sports medicine and a
member of the soccer federation's medical advisory committee. "Why
take a chance until this gets studied?"
</P>
<P>
Because Full90 pays some pro players (the equivalent of $50 to $100
per game, it says) and some state soccer associations ($4,000 to
$10,000) to endorse its product, the soccer federation says the
company's claims are suspect. Federation officials compare the use of
soccer headgear, which lack an industry safety standard, to the
largely unregulated business of nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about marketing and fear and manipulation," said Dr.
Bert Mandelbaum, team physician for the U.S. national teams.
</P>
<P>
Not all medical soccer experts oppose headgear.
</P>
<P>
Dr. J. Scott Delaney of McGill University in Montreal said laboratory
data, not yet published, does indicate that headgear could reduce
impact forces by 10 to 30 percent. (The soccer federation says this
involves low-level forces that don't cause concussions.) Delaney said
an industry standard for headgear has been drafted and could be
instituted in May.
</P>
<P>
In a study, published in the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine,
Delaney questioned 380 Canadian university football players and 240
university soccer players as they reported to fall training camp in
1999. He found that 70.4 percent of the football players and 62.7
percent of the soccer players had experienced symptoms of a
concussion in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"We've shown concussions are a problem and in the lab these things
work," Delaney said of headgear. "What else do you need? Why wouldn't
you start protecting people?"
</P>
<P>
Scientific studies involving large numbers of players can occur only
after headgear is used widely, said Delaney, who is team physician
for the McGill soccer team and the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian
Football League.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody waited for the data for football and hockey" before requiring
helmets in those sports, Delaney said.
</P>
<P>
The concern over concussions, and whether headgear can protect
against them, has become a growing issue for youth soccer
associations. In September, the New York State West Youth Soccer
Association, which governs more than 200 clubs and 80,000 kids in the
Buffalo-Rochester area, voted to require headgear for all players
under 14.
</P>
<P>
The association later retreated over concerns about liability and
protests from some coaches and officials. Several coaches interviewed
in Rochester wondered why headgear were proposed for young kids and
not for older teenagers, who were more likely to get concussions.
</P>
<P>
Others said risk was inherent in any sport.
</P>
<P>
"Where are you going to draw the line? Make everyone wear knee
braces?" said Tom Maines, who coaches an under-10 boys team in
Brockport, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
Fashion aside, Ross Paule, a midfielder for the Columbus Crew of
Major League Soccer, wore a Full90 headgear for a dozen games in the
recently completed season, seeking some security after suffering
three earlier concussions.
</P>
<P>
"I'm on the fence," said Paule, who was not paid to endorse the
headgear. "I don't agree it should be mandated. If something makes
you comfortable, why not?" He added: "I can't tell you if it was a
huge help. When I got hit one time, maybe it gave me a little extra
cushion."
</P>
<P>
(END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
Any club or association that makes headgear compulsory risks losing
its affiliation with the U.S. Soccer Federation, Dr. S. Robert
Contiguglia, its president, said.
</P>
<P>
But that threat is either unknown or ignored by the Temecula Valley
Soccer Association in southern California, which for three seasons
has required headgear for players under 8. Peter Schilperoort,
president of the association, said headgear prevented bumps and cuts
previously suffered by his players, calling the equipment "the best
thing since sliced bread."
</P>
<P>
The De Anza Force soccer club of Cupertino, Calif., will require
headgear for players under 17, beginning in March, said Tom Pridham,
a club official. Both the Temecula and De Anza clubs are sponsored by
Full90.
</P>
<P>
"We require protecting of the shin, and the head is a far more
precious part of the body than the shin," Pridham said.
</P>
<P>
Jerry Smith, coach of the Santa Clara women's team, which received
free headgear from Full90, said the equipment made his players more
confident in challenging balls in the air, and more assertive, but
not overly so.
</P>
<P>
Anson Dorrance, who has coached 18 women's national championship
teams at North Carolina, also sponsored by Full90, said compulsory
use of shin guards had not changed the nature of soccer, as many
feared. He predicted that headgear would not, either.
</P>
<P>
"I'd challenge any of these doctors who feel this has no value to run
into the goalpost without a Full90 and with it, then tell me, if they
were forced to do it a third time, whether or not they would wear
it," Dorrance said.
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
Several players interviewed, including Joy Fawcett of the U.S.
women's national team, who endorses the Full90, discounted the
so-called the Superman effect, saying the headgear did not make them
dangerously aggressive.
</P>
<P>
"It's like a flag that reminds you not to go up for stupid plays,"
said Jill Conaboy, a defender at Downingtown West High in suburban
Philadelphia, who wore a headgear last weekend as her team won the
Pennsylvania Class AAA state championship.
</P>
<P>
Kathy Conaboy, Jill's mother, said she held no illusion that her
daughter, who has suffered two concussions, would never be hurt again
while wearing a headgear. What she hopes, she said, is that a blow
that might have caused a third concussion will result in only a
bruise.
</P>
<P>
"A seat belt is not going to save a life in a 90-mile-per hour crash
into a wall," Kathy Conaboy said. "A 30 mile-per-hour crash, a fender
bender, it helps. I'm looking at this as a seatbelt."
