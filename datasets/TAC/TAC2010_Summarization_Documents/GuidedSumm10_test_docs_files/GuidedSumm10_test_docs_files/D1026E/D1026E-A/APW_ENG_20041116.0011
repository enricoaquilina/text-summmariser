Court case may mean cowboy hats making way for helmets in Australia's
Outback
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sweat-stained felt hats worn by Australian cowboys, as much a
part of the Outback as kangaroos and sun-baked soil, may be heading
for the history books. They fail modern industrial safety standards.
</P>
<P>
It all stems from the death of a cowboy, who suffered massive head
injuries after being trampled in a fall from a horse while mustering
bulls in July 2001. His sole protection was the tattered hat provided
him for shading from the sun.
</P>
<P>
The New South Wales state government brought charges against the
ranch owner, who employed 23-year-old Daniel Croker, convicting and
fining the company 95,000 Australian dollars (US$72,000; euro56,000)
last month for breaches of safety, including failure to provide the
horseman with an equestrian helmet.
</P>
<P>
Ranch manager Nicholas Ennis told investigators he knew of no ranch
in Australia that made cowboys wear helmets except while mustering on
motorbikes.
</P>
<P>
Since the tragedy at the ranch in Merriwagga, about 500 kilometers
(300 miles) west of Sydney, helmets have become compulsory for
working in the saddle there, but ranchers are calling for industrial
laws to be changed to reflect the differences between working in the
Outback and in a city factory.
</P>
<P>
News South Wales Farmers' Association president Mal Peters warned
that substituting helmets for broad-brimmed hats would increase the
hazards of skin cancer and heat stroke.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no helmet a farmer can use when the temperature
reaches 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). "For a farmer
who's mustering a mob of sheep, moving very slowly behind them
without any air circulation, he or his employee may be subject to
heat stroke," Peters said.
</P>
<P>
Since the tragedy, the dead cowboy's father, Neil Croker, has become
a campaigner for safer work practices on farms.
</P>
<P>
"I think we can still have that fantasy of romantic, wild west-type
attitude but with safety added on," Croker told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio
</P>
<P>
National Farmers Federation chief executive Anna Cronin said
Australia's leading farmers' association supported initiatives to
develop lightweight, broad-brimmed hard hats as an alternative to
helmets.
</P>
<P>
But ex-cowboy Hayden Bostock blamed apathy in the ranching industry
for inadequate safety equipment for cowboys. Bostock said he has been
developing a lightweight, broad-brimmed hard hat that met Australian
safety standards but has failed to attract enough support in the
cattle and sheep industry to get the hat into production.
</P>
<P>
"The stockman's hat is an icon of Australia. You can't replace it
with an ice-cream container on the head," Bostock said. "Being a
bushman myself, we're not going to wear anything that doesn't look
any good."
