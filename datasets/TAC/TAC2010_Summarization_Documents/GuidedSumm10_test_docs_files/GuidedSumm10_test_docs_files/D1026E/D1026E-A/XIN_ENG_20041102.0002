The Ugandan police has warned to enforce strict traffic regulations
beginning from Tuesday, saying that passengers who will travel in
vehicles without wearing safety belts will be arrested.

<P>
Inspector General of police Katumba Wamala advised public to shun
taxis without seat belts, or risk being arrested and fined.

The warning was given after one month extension granted by the
government. The implementation of the strict traffic law was supposed
to start on Oct. 1 but the government extended it for one month.

<P>
According to traffic regulations, passengers in public and private
vehicles will face arrest and up to one month in jail or an on-spot
fine of 20,000 shillings (11.6 US dollars) if they travel without
fastening their safety belts.

Motorcycle riders will face a penalty of between 40,000 shillings (33
dollars) and 80,000 shillings (66 dollars) if arrested without crash
helmets under the regulations.

"We have given these people enough time. We cannot have a law that
cannot be applied," Katumba told a press conference on Monday after
the expiry of one month grace period given to all motorists.

<P>
The total cost of road accidents is estimated at 2.3 percent of the
gross domestic product in Uganda, according to the official
statistics.
