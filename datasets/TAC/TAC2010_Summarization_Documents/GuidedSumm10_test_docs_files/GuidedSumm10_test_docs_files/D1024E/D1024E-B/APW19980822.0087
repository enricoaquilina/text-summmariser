	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ With protests and marches, Sudan's
beleaguered government has sought to rally a people weary of war
and economic hardship against an American attack that destroyed a
factory in the Sudanese capital.
	   While Khartoum residents expressed surprise at the Thursday
missile strike, many said they thought there was little their
government could do.
	   ``We are not strong enough to face the west,'' said Mamoun
Rahama, a 29-year-old who works at a textile factory near the
destroyed plant. ``We cannot face a greater force.''
	   Sudanese flocked to a rally Friday after Muslim prayers outside
the office of Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir in the muddy
streets of Khartoum. Crowds shouted ``Down, Down USA!'' and burned
an American flag.
	   The podium at the rally hit on a theme sounded time and again by
Sudanese: U.S. President Clinton launched the attack to draw
attention from his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a White House
intern. The podium was decorated with pictures of Clinton and
Lewinsky and bore the slogan ``Clinton: Screw Monica, not Sudan.''
	   Another rally was planned in the capital Saturday.
	   ``Clinton and America will have to pay,'' el-Bashir told the
crowd. ``Sudan is for Islam, and we will not be bullied by
Americans.''
	   He said Sudan could ``prove that the factory is specifically for
pharmaceutical production'' and not chemical weapons as described
by U.S. officials.
	   Sudan planned to lodge complaints with the Arab League and the
Organization of African Unity, and its diplomats asked the Security
Council Friday to convene an urgent meeting to consider a U.N.
investigation into the attack.
	   The government, he said, was ``opening all training camps'' for
volunteers for the national militia, a move Sudan's Islamic leaders
have often taken in response to a surge in fighting in the 15-year
civil war or when tension rises with its east African neighbors.
	   The Islamic leaders in Sudan, where as many as nine out of ten
of the country's 28 million people live in poverty, oversee a
network of well-organized cadres who can bring thousands into the
streets. Their security network is pervasive, keeping a close eye
on dissent.
	   Ten people were wounded, including four in critical condition,
in the strike in an industrial area of north Khartoum, hospital
officials said. Damage was estimated at dlrs 100 million, said
Sidahmed Hajj Hamed, administrative director at the factory.
	   Clinton ordered the Thursday attack on the factory in
retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es-Salaam, Tanzania. U.S. missiles also
struck suspected camps of Muslim militant Osama bin Laden in
Afghanistan.
	   El-Bashir said that the factory _ El-Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. _ was hit by six Tomahawk cruise missiles. He said a
seventh fell short of the target, but did not indicate if it did
any damage.
	   The factory was virtually destroyed. Brown glass jars sat in
piles amid crushed red bricks and twisted sheet metal. Soldiers in
green helmets and civil defense guards in surgical masks milled
around the site, which was enveloped by a white haze caused by
smoldering fires.
	   A white box for latex gloves and blue cartons for antibiotics
lay soaking in pools of water from Friday's rains. A metal door was
hurled to the ground by the explosion.
	   There was little security, and visitors, including foreigners,
were allowed to enter the wrecked factory at all hours unhindered.
	   The U.S. government said the factory produced precursors for
chemical weapons. State-run Sudan Television said that the factory,
which opened in 1996, produced about half of the medicine in Sudan,
Africa's largest country and one of its poorest. It described its
main products as antibiotics and drugs to treat malaria and
tuberculosis.
	   ``This is for medicine,'' said Mohammed Ali el-Bashir, a civil
defense guard, pointing to a collapsed floor propped up by still
standing pillars. ``That was for medicine.''
	   ``The factory was only there to help a pitiful people,'' he
said.
	   Civil defense workers said the fires burned until Friday night
and their pungent fumes hung over the site like a cloud. Some
workers said they had arrived the night before to help move
chemicals away from the fires, working 24 hours or more.
	   ``God destroy America,'' said Taher Ibrahim Moussa, one of the
soldiers at the site. ``America is the terrorist state.''
	   In Cairo, a Sudanese opposition group accused the government of
backing what it described as terrorism and said it had provided
refuge to followers of bin Laden, who lived in Sudan for five years
before he was forced to move to Afghanistan.
