Arab League to convene emergency meeting on US strike in Sudan
</HEADLINE>

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League will convene an emergency
meeting Monday to discuss the U.S. missile attack against Sudan,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency said Saturday.
	   The meeting is to ``support Sudan in this crisis,'' and has been
called at the request of the Khartoum government, the assistant
secretary-general of the League, Ahmed Ben Hulei, told the official
news agency.
	   U.S. missiles devastated a factory in north Khartoum on
Thursday, killing one person and wounding nine others. Washington
said the factory produced the ingredients of chemical weapons, but
Khartoum said it manufactured only pharmaceutical products.
	   The 22-member League's permanent representatives will meet at
the organization's headquarters in Cairo.
	   Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir cast doubt on the significance
of the meeting Saturday.
	   In an interview with Qatar's Al-Jazeera television, el-Bashir
said ``we don't expect much from the Arab League, which in the past
took stances that cannot be described as positive towards many Arab
causes.''
	   The Arab League condemned the U.S action on Friday, calling it a
``Rambo'' strike in reference to the macho-man film of that name.
	   ``American Rambo tactics will not solve the problem of
international terrorism, and will not put an end to the reasons
behind the violence,'' the deputy secretary-general of the League,
Mohammed Zakariya Ismail, told reporters in Cairo.
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Saturday that action
against terrorism should be ``within the framework of international
legitimacy ... and under the auspices of the United Nations.''
	   The minister spoke to reporters after meeting Sudan's ambassador
to Egypt.
