<HEADLINE> Jordan Expresses Reservation Over U.S. Attack on Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Responding to the U.S. air raid on
Sudan, Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan said Friday that disputes
should be solved through dialog rather than the use of force.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone conversation with Sudanese Vice President
Ali Osman Mohammed Taha, Hassan said that Jordan believed that
force could not be used at all times and places, the official
Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Taha called Hassan to brief him on the U.S. attack Thursday
night on a pharmaceutical factory in the Sudanese capital
Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
Taha said the factory was for producing only medicines and
not chemical weapons as the U.S. has alleged.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. said that it launched air raid on the Sudanese plant
for fear that the chemical weapons could be used by Islamic
militants to launch new attacks against U.S. targets. The U.S. has
been accusing Sudan of supporting international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also fired cruise missiles at suspected terrorist
bases in Afghanistan to retaliate for the twin bombings on August
7 against its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Hassan, on behalf of King Hussein who is in the U.S. for
cancer treatment, said that Jordan condemns any form of terrorism
whatever its causes or sources.
