<HEADLINE> Arab League Condemns U.S. Attack on Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Friday
condemned the United States air raid on a Sudanese facility as
"serious aggression against a sovereign Arab country."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the AL General Secretariat
expressed "shock and resentment" at the U.S. attack Thursday night
on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan's capital Khartoum, which
injured several civilians.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member AL accused the U.S. of flagrantly violating
international laws and conventions and the United Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched missile attacks Thursday on suspected
terrorist bases in Sudan and Afghanistan in retaliation for the
August 7 bombings of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Over 250 people were killed and 5,000 others wounded in the
twin bombings against the U.S. embassies in Kenya's capital
Nairobi and Tanzania's capital Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. held the Saudi Arabian millionaire Bin Laden, son of a
wealth Saudi construction magnate, responsible for the embassy
bombings. Laden, who had once resided in Sudan, is living in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. justified its air raid against the al-Shifa
Pharmaceutical Factory in Khartoum on its assessment that the plan
was manufacturing chemical weapons agents, that could be used by
Islamic militants to launch new attacks against U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has denied the U.S. allegation, saying the factory
produces half of the medicine needed in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League voiced support for Sudan in the face of threats
to its stability, unity and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
It urged the U.S. to respect international laws and desist from
acts that endanger the sovereignty of other countries and
jeopardize the world peace and security.
