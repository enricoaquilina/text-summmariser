	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ America's missile barrage on a
pharmaceutical plant in the outskirts of Sudan's capital was called
a strike against outlaw states that support terrorism.
	   For Sudan's government, it has provided an opportunity, one that
has become woefully rare, to rally its weary people around the
flag.
	   Since Thursday's strike on a factory the United States said was
producing precursors to chemical weapons, protesters encouraged by
the government have poured into Khartoum's muddy, desolate streets.
Sudanese leaders have saturated the airwaves _ in Arabic for
consumption at home and English for an audience abroad _ and
officials have vilified the opposition as collaborators of America.
	   Opposition and government figures said that in the end, Sudan's
isolated Islamic leaders may be the ones to gain.
	   ``It would have been better if they had not done it,'' said
Ghazi Suleiman, a Sudanese dissident imprisoned earlier this year.
``The danger of such attacks is that it keeps people looking toward
the sky and not toward the actual problems.''
	   The problems in Sudan are plenty.
	   Already one of Africa's poorest countries, where as many nine
out of 10 people struggle with miserable poverty, Sudan was hit in
July and August with the worst floods of the Nile River in 10
years.
	   Electricity that on good days lasted half the day now is cut
after six hours, often fewer, a result in part of the floods'
effect on hydroelectric power. Dire economic conditions, coupled
with the blackouts, have sent people into the streets of several
cities.
	   A civil war with southern rebels grinds on after 15 years, and
angry women whose sons are drafted to fight the battles _ what one
general called ``advanced training'' _ have clashed with police in
Khartoum and Omdurman, the capital's sister city across the Nile.
	   But for Sudan's Islamic leaders, who took power in a military
coup in 1989 that overthrew the democratically elected government,
these are days of patriotism and fervor _ and plenty of it.
	   And Washington, which has declared Sudan a sponsor of terrorism,
faces a government using the attack to bolster its standing.
	   Oddly, the first time electricity had not been cut for more than
six hours was the night of the attack, allowing Sudanese to watch
live footage of the burning factory and a protest at the U.S.
Embassy.
	   The government, long renowned for its ability to turn out
well-organized and dedicated cadres, went into action.
	   Thousands flocked to a square behind the presidential palace
Saturday. Boys let out from high school wore loose-fitting brown
camouflage, girls in veils donned a light blue version. Bureaucrats
at the presidential palace turned out, as did employees of the Bank
of Sudan _ all on a break mandated by the government.
	   Throughout the rally, crowds chanted, ``God is greater than
America'' and denounced U.S. President Clinton as immoral,
degenerate and a liar. But special scorn was held out for the
Sudanese opposition, particularly its leaders in exile.
	   One sign read, ``No to the lackeys.'' Nearby were pictures of
former Prime Minister Sadiq el-Mahdi and Mohammed el-Mirghani,
another leader of the opposition National Democratic Alliance.
Across the pictures were blue Stars of David, the symbol of Israel.
	   ``There are those who are much worse than Clinton,'' President
Omar el-Bashir told the crowd. ``And they are Sudanese.''
	   On the day of the attack, Bashir promised that there would be no
room for what he called fifth columnists.
	   The standing of Sudan's opposition had, in fact, improved in
recent months. Long with a substantial following inside Sudan, it
received a boost abroad from Egypt, Sudan's northern neighbor, when
it invited the main Sudanese opposition leaders to Cairo this
month.
	   It was a show of prominence for a movement that has the
difficult task of uniting Muslim parties in the Arabized north with
the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which seeks autonomy and
religious freedom for the south's Christians and animists.
	   Already the movement has taken a lower profile.
	   In Omdurman, at Wad Nubawi Mosque, long a stronghold of
el-Mahdi's followers, the sermon at Friday prayers was noticeably
mild. Rather than stinging attacks on government repression, the
sermon scolded the United States for carrying out the strike.
	   Such reluctance was even evident at Saturday's rally.
	   ``It's foreign aggression,'' said Idris Mohammed Idris, a
63-year-old who was distinctly unenthusiastic. ``Even if a citizen
has problems with the government, no electricity and no water, when
it comes to foreign aggression, you have to forget about it.''
	   ``The government,'' he added, ``is stronger than before.''
