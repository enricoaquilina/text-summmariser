	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Sudan asked the Security Council to
convene an urgent meeting to authorize a fact-finding investigation
into the ``barbaric, unjust'' U.S. airstrikes on a Khartoum
factory.
	   The Security Council was expected to take up the matter on
Monday, council sources said Friday.
	   Washington's justification that Thursday's bombing raids were an
act of self-defense were ``very naive, lacking in logic and
baseless because Sudan did not carry out any act or threat against
the United States,'' said a letter from the state minister at the
ministry of external relations.
	   The minister, H.E. Bishop Gobrial Roric, urged the council to
``condemn this barbaric, unjust aggression and make the United
States responsible for the human and material damage.''
	   The letter, sent to council president Danilo Turk of Slovenia,
was intended to lodge Sudan's formal complaint that Thursday's U.S.
airstrikes on a Khartoum pharmaceutical factory were a breach of
the U.N. charter and a violation of its sovereignty.
	   U.S. officials have said they were targeting a terrorist
chemical plant linked to a suspect in the U.S. embassy bombings in
east Africa.
	   Bahrain, the lone Arab on the council, was expected to raise the
issue at the council meeting Monday. The Arab Group of states and
another group of Islamic states met Friday at the United Nations to
express support for Sudan's effort.
	   The United States hadn't decided what it's response would be,
said a U.S. official.
	   U.S. forces carried out the strikes in retaliation for the
bombings at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, which killed over 250 people.
	   U.S. officials have said the cruise missile attack on the
Khartoum factory was designed to wipe out a terrorist chemical
plant linked to Osama bin Laden, whom U.S. officials accuse in the
embassy bombings.
	   In his four-page letter, Roric denied that bin Laden owns the
pharmaceutical factory and described accusations that the factory
produces chemical weapons as ``untrue,'' adding ``the United States
government does not have evidence.''
	   The United Nations confirmed Friday that it had contracted the
el-Shifa plant to supply 100,000 liters of veterinary
pharmaceuticals for Iraq under the oil-for-food program. The
pharmaceuticals haven't been delivered, U.N. officials said.
	   Roric called for an ``emergency Security Council meeting to
discuss this aggression, and send a technical fact-finding mission
to investigate the American claims and take the necessary measures
to guarantee (the attack) won't be repeated and guarantee the
safety and security of my country.''
	   Sudan's efforts to rally an investigation came as Pakistan
criticized Washington for acting unilaterally for what it said was
an international problem.
	   ``The problem here is not the right of self-defense. It is how
the scourge of terrorism can best be eliminated from the world,''
said Pakistan's U.N. ambassador, Ahmad Kamal. ``And that requires
an international consensus and that requires all of us sitting on
the same side of the table.''
	   In a statement, Sudan's mission said ``the aggression is a
flagrant violation to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Sudan,'' that violated Article 2 of the U.N. charter, which says
member states must refrain from using force against other states.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson defended the air strikes in a
letter Thursday to Turk that said the moves complied with the
rights of states to self-defense as enshrined in the U.N. charter
and international law.
	   He cited Article 51 of the U.N. charter, which states have the
right to self-defense if attacked.
	   Afghanistan's U.N. ambassador, Raban Farhadi, in an interview
with the AP called for a formal investigation into the strikes and
was consulting with council members to raise the issue before the
council.
	   ``We insist on the necessity of diplomatic action because
military action may lead to harming civilians,'' said Farhadi, who
represents the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani,
ousted by the Taliban in 1996.
