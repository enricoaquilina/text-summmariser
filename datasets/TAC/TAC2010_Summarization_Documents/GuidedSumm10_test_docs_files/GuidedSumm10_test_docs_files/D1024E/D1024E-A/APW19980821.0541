	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ still on
crutches from a recent hip operation _ led hundreds of chanting
Libyans in a Friday rally condemning U.S. missile strikes on Sudan
and Afghanistan.
	   ``Down, Down USA!'' and ``God is Great, Oh Sudan!'' the crowd
chanted as Gadhafi punched the air with his fist in Martyrs' Square
in the Libyan capital Tripoli.
	   The sentiment was echoed around the Middle East, where leaders
and many citizens roundly criticized Thursday's American attacks on
a factory in Sudan and camps associated with Muslim radical Osama
bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   Much of the harshest criticism came from countries opposed to
the United States, but even in perceived U.S. allies like Saudi
Arabia, some people said the attack would add to and not lessen the
threat against Americans.
	   U.S. President Clinton said the strikes were ordered to avenge
the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa and because of
reports that more anti-American attacks were being planned. U.S.
officials said the factory in Sudan made chemical weapons agents;
Sudan maintains it's a pharmaceutical plant.
	   Clinton's actions were widely seen by Arabs as an effort to
distract public opinion in the United States from his travails over
a relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``Clinton tries to cover up his scandal with attacks against
Sudan and Afghanistan,'' the main headline in the leftist As-Safir
daily in Lebanon said.
	   A front-page editorial in Beirut's Al Kifah Al Arabi paper said
that ``Lewinsky's dress is no longer the preoccupation of the world
after Clinton has discovered Osama bin Laden's dishdasha (Arab
robe).''
	   In Saudi Arabia, Abeer Hamza, a 26-year-old homemaker, said the
American campaign ``is not self-defense, this is a senseless
action.''
	   She added: ``This violence will only beget more violence.''
	   Mohammed al-Turki, a Saudi visiting the neighboring island of
Bahrain, criticized Clinton but added that bin Laden _ who is
himself a Saudi was ``no better.''
	   In Cairo, Shaaban Ahmed Mohammed, 34, owner of a newspaper
stand, was among a minority who said he believed the United States
attacks were justified.
	   ``It has the right to protect itself. If it remains silent after
the last attack (in Kenya and Tanzania) it will be the victim of
numerous blows,'' he said.
