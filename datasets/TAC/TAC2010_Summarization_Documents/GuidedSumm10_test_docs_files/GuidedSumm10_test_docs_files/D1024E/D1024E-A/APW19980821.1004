	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Diplomats from more than a dozen nations
were taken on a tour Friday of the Sudanese factory struck a day
earlier by U.S. missiles.
	   Firemen still rushed about, their faces covered with surgical
masks to keep out the smell of burning plastic as they tried to put
out blazes that persisted more than 24 hours after the attack.
	   ``We ask the American people to push their government to stop
interfering in our internal affairs,'' said Bishop Gabriel Rorej,
minister of state for foreign affairs who showed the diplomats
around. ``We are innocent people, and we renounce terrorism, and we
are not a safe haven for terrorists and we will never be so.''
	   President Clinton ordered the attack on the El-Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries Co. on Thursday on grounds the factory
was producing precursors for the deadly VX chemical weapon.
American missiles also struck suspected bases of Muslim extremist
Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   The factory complex is in an industrial zone that is surrounded
by mud and brick houses, mainly for factory workers.
	   At least three dozen anti-riot police guarded the road leading
to the site to try to keep away gawkers.
	   The pharmaceutical factory complex consists of a half-dozen
buildings, two of which _ a cafeteria and a storage building _ were
still smoldering on Friday.
	   Two floors of the four-story administration building were
flattened in the missile attack, and half of the main two-story
factory was destroyed. A warehouse also sustained heavy damage from
a missile hit.
	   One missile that landed between buildings left a crater about 2
meters (yards) in diameter and two meters deep. It was quickly
filling up with water from the fire-fighting efforts.
	   Pills, smashed plastic medicine bottles and paper cartons were
scattered over the ground, along with concrete rubble and shards of
glass.
	   Sidahmed Hajj Hamad, administrative director at El-Shifa,
estimated the damage to the 2-year-old factory at dlrs 100 million.
He said the owner was Sudanese businessman Salah-Eddin Ahmed
Idriss, who lives in Saudi Arabia.
	   He described El-Shifa as ``the largest pharmaceutical factory we
had in this country'' and added: ``We never produced any chemical
material.''
	   As the diplomats toured, about 100 Sudanese women _ most in the
head scarves of devout Muslims _ protested outside the factory
gate, shouting ``America should be destroyed!'' and ``The factory
should be rebuilt!''
	   Khadisha Ali, a sophomore from an Islamic university who led the
chanting, told The Associated Press: ``We condemn this American
aggression on our country. We call on the world community to come
to the aid of Sudan.''
