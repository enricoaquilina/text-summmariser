	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Hundreds of Sudanese trudged through the
mud on a rainy Friday to gather by the twisted rubble and concrete
of the factory heavily damaged by U.S. missiles.
	   Civilians in trucks heading toward the plant chanted ``Down
USA'' in English. White smoke still rose from the rubble of the
four-story building, which the United States said was making
chemical weapons agents.
	   Many of the people said they were shocked that the United States
struck a factory in the heart of the capital. Police tried to block
many of the civilians, mostly women and children, from entering the
factory compound.
	   ``Are these people crazy? Do you think this is really a weapons
factory?'' said a young woman who worked at the factory. She
refused to give her name.
	   Officials at Khartoum Teaching hospital said 10 people were
injured in the raid, including four in critical condition.
	   Workers at the site said they feared that some people may be
trapped under the debris.
	   Early Friday, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S.
Embassy compound in Khartoum and pulled down the American flag to
protest the attack.
	   The State Department ordered local staff to leave the U.S.
Embassy after the Aug. 7 bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya,
and Dar es-Salaam. American diplomats were pulled out of Khartoum
in 1996.
	   Sudanese officials charged that President Clinton ordered the
missile attack to distract attention from his troubles in the
Monica Lewinsky sex case.
	   President Omar el-Bashir said on state-run Sudan Television that
Clinton was a ``liar and morally decrepit.'' He said Sudan was
recalling its diplomats from Washington.
	   He also warned that Sudan ``reserves the right to respond to the
American attack using all necessary measures,'' Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported Friday.
	   ``We will retain the right to protest, and will ask the Security
Council to investigate the truth ... about this factory,''
el-Bashir said on Sudanese television.
	   He said he would call for an emergency meeting of the council to
discuss the U.S. attack and asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to send a delegation to Sudan to investigate whether the plant was
used to produce chemical weapons.
	   The television said the factory produced about 50 percent of the
country's pharmaceuticals.
