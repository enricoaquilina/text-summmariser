 DESTROYED FACTORY BECOMES STAGE FOR DEMONSTRATIONS  (See also:(jw)

<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan _ Not quite 24 hours after American cruise
missiles hit a factory in a decrepit industrial area of this
capital, clouds of white smoke and acrid smells still hovered over
the site Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen Sudanese soldiers lounged on the ground at the
entrance of the destroyed factory, which the Sudanese say made
pharmaceuticals, but which the Americans contend was a cover for
the making of chemical weapons. Deep puddles of water on the muddy
ground attested to the fire-fighting efforts after the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic government, accused by the Clinton administration of
assisting in the terrorist activities of Osama bin Laden, used
these fiery remnants of the factory as a backdrop for a
well-organized anti-American demonstration during the day.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday prayers in the city's mosques, worshipers were
urged to attend rallies, including a particularly vocal one at the
plant, where leading figures of the government accused the United
States of being a ``terrorist'' state.
</P>
<P>
   At one rally, pictures of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky
were on prominent display, a juxtaposition of a man and his
mistress that is interpreted in this very conservative society as
the ultimate mockery.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said that Sudan would
remain a ``tomb for its enemies whatever this costs us in human
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most important Sudanese leader, Hassan al Turabi, who is
the speaker of Parliament and the ideological power behind the
ruling National Islamic Front, remained silent Friday. American
intelligence officials have called Turabi a close comrade of bin
Laden, whom the administration has accused of being the mastermind
of the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa that left
hundreds dead.
</P>
<P>
   Turabi has been a mysterious figure of the fundamentalist
government, which grabbed power in the coup in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Sudanese president, made up for
Turabi's silence. Bashir said that he would prove that the
pharmaceutical plant hit by the American missiles was not a cover
for making the precursors of nerve gas as Washington claimed. ``We
have undeniable proof'' that the plant was only used for
pharmaceutical products such as children's and anti-malarial
medicines, he said. International companies that had provided
equipment for the plant that opened two years ago would back him
up, he added. The general did not name them.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the reasons for destroying the plant, Sandy
Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said bin Laden had
given key financial help for the plant that was part of the
``Sudanese military industrial complex.'' Bin Laden lived in Sudan
from 1994 to 1996, a period when Washington says he invited
international terrorists to train at camps here.
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to leave Sudan in 1996 when the government decided
that he was too much of an embarrassment and his presence too
costly. After telling bin Laden to leave, the government hoped to
win some concessions from the Clinton administration, including
economic aid, but failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its case that the plant was a benign operation,
government officials said that it was owned by a Sudanese
businessman, Salah Idrisse, who is also a citizen of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the factory where most of the smoke was still
billowing was off bounds to reporters Friday and it was impossible
to tell what was made there. In the rubble at the front of the
compound were wrappers from a veterinary solution made at the plant
and leaflets on how to take Profenil, a trade name for ibuprofen, a
widely used pain reliever. Trays of small empty brown bottles,
apparently used for medicine, were scattered about on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Hussein, 23, a builder who lives about a mile from the
plant, said he saw bright lights and then heard the swoosh of about
six missiles during the attack. At first, he thought the nearby
power station had been struck, he said. Then he thought a plane had
crashed. Then, he said, it occurred to him that John Garang, the
leader of a southern rebel group that has been waging a civil war
for more than a decade, had finally struck the capital.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plant's managing director, Sayed Hamed, the
factory employed 360 workers. He said the enterprise made 30
varieties of drugs for humans, and 23 kinds of veterinary
medicines. A hospital spokesman said earlier that 10 people wounded
from the strike were admitted to the wards. Four of them were
critically hurt, he said. The plant does not operate at night and
there were apparently few workers around during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sudanese opposition political parties based in
Cairo, Faruq Ahmed Adam, said he agreed with Washington that the
plant was a cover for the manufacture of chemical weapons. He said
that another factory in the suburb of Kafouri also made chemical
weapons. He added that Sudanese security forces were investors in
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Washington and the Sudanese government have
gone from bad to worse in the nine years of the fundamentalist
regime. But even so, ordinary people seem to be bewildered why
American should send cruise missiles here.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they were skeptical that the pharmaceutical plant was
a cover for preparing chemical warfare agents. ``Most people here,
even those who are anti-government, do not believe this particular
factory was making chemical weapons,'' one man said.
</P>
<P>
   But another longtime opposition supporter, a lawyer, said he
believed the Americans knew what they were doing. ``Bin Laden has
never built a factory for medicines in his life,'' said the lawyer.
``He's only interested in killing and terrorism.'' &QL;
