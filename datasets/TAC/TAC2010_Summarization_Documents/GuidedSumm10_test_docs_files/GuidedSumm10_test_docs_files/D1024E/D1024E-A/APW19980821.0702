	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir on Friday
recalled Sudan's diplomats from Washington to protest the U.S.
missile strike on a factory in the Sudanese capital a day earlier.
	   After an emergency meeting with his Cabinet, el-Bashir also
announced that Sudan would file complaints with the United Nations,
the Arab League and the Organization of African Unity.
	   He said Sudan could ``prove that the factory is specifically for
pharmaceutical production'' and not the chemical weapons facility
described by U.S. officials.
	   El-Bashir later spoke at a rally outside his office. Sudanese
who poured to the rally from Friday prayers at the city's mosques
chanted ``Down, Down USA!'' and burned an American flag.
	   The final casualty toll in the missile strike remained unclear.
	   Khartoum Hospital officials said 10 people were being treated
for injuries, including four in critical condition.
	   Workers at the site said there was still concern that some
victims could be buried under the rubble. They told The Associated
Press that the factory's janitor and his family still hadn't been
accounted for.
	   Sidahmed Hajj Hamad, administrative director at the factory,
estimated the damage at dlrs 100 million.
	   Clinton ordered the attack on the factory in Khartoum in
retaliation for the Aug. 7 bombings of the American embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania. U.S. missiles also struck suspected camps of
Muslim militant Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   El-Bashir said that the factory _ the El-Shifa Pharmaceutical
Industries Co. in the North Khartoum neighborhood _ was hit by six
Tomahawk missiles.
	   He said a seventh fell short of the target but did not indicate
if it did any damage.
	   State-run Sudan television said that the factory, which opened
in 1996, produced about half of the country's medicines. Its main
products were reported to be antibiotics and drugs to treat malaria
and tuberculosis.
	   Sudan continued to charge that Clinton took the action to divert
public attention from the grand jury investigation into his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   A statement issued by the Sudanese Embassy in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi said that ``the timing was chosen to serve the wish of a
sexual pervert and maniac to divert attention away from his
crumbling credibility and reputation.''
	   The podium at the rally el-Bashir addressed was decorated with
pictures of Clinton and Lewinsky and bore the slogan ``Clinton:
Screw Monica, not Sudan.''
	   El-Bashir said that ``Clinton and America will have to pay. ...
Sudan is for Islam, and we will not be bullied by Americans.''
	   He pledged to ``pursue all diplomatic channels'' over the
missile attack but also said the government was ``opening all
training camps'' for volunteers for the national militia.
	   Overnight, Sudanese demonstrators stormed the empty U.S. Embassy
compound in Khartoum and pulled down the American flag to protest
the attack.
	   The State Department ordered local staff to leave the U.S.
Embassy after the bombings of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar
es-Salaam two weeks ago. American diplomats were pulled out of
Khartoum in 1996.
	   Earlier in the day, hundreds of Sudanese trudged through streets
made muddy with rain to view the twisted steel and concrete rubble
of the four-story factory.
	   Police tried to block the civilians, mostly women and children,
from entering the factory compound.
	   ``Are these people crazy? Do you think this is really a weapons
factory?'' said a young woman who worked at the factory. She
refused to give her name.
