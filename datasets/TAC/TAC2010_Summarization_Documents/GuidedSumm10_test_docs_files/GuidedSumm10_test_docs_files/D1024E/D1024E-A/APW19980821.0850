	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ In mosques and in McDonald's, Arabs on
Friday criticized U.S. missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan as
driven more by President Bill Clinton's need to escape scandal than
by a battle against terrorism.
	   Many said, too, that the attacks would only increase hatred and
violence by Muslims against the United States.
	   Even among the few Arabs interviewed who defended the U.S.
attacks, some questioned whether the targeted Sudanese factory
really made chemical weapons ``precursors'' as U.S. officials say _
or medicines as Sudan maintains.
	   ``The U.S. ... has the right to defend its interests, but it
must be certain,'' said Egyptian airline clerk Somaya Farouk, 23.
``If there was a 1 percent chance that this was a pharmaceuticals
plant, then it should have held off.''
	   Clinton said the missiles hit terrorist camps in Afghanistan run
by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi millionaire blamed by Washington for
the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and a
factory linked to bin Laden in Sudan.
	   The reaction to the attacks from U.S. opponents in the Middle
East was predictable, and American allies mostly remained silent.
The Cairo-based Arab League condemned the attack in Sudan, calling
it ``an unjustified and flagrant aggression on ... an Arab
country.''
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ still on crutches from a hip
operation _ led a protest early Friday in the capital Tripoli,
thrusting his fist in the air and shouting, ``Down, down USA.''
	   The strikes were harshly criticized by both Iraq and non-Arab
Iran which _ along with Libya and Sudan _ are on the U.S. list of
terrorist sponsoring states.
	   ``We condemn terrorism, but nothing justifies these attacks,
especially these random American attacks against Muslim nations,''
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi told state-run
radio.
	   In newspapers, and from Arabs on the street, the repeated theme
was that Clinton ordered the attacks to draw the spotlight off his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   Reading a newspaper in a McDonald's branch in Bahrain,
25-year-old Saudi citizen Mohammed al-Turki called the American
missile strikes ``a plot to divert public attention from Clinton's
wrongdoings.''
	   But asked if he sympathized with bin Laden, he said ``he's no
better.''
	   Shaaban Ahmed Mohammed, 34, owner of a Cairo newspaper stand,
was the only Arab interviewed who saw the strikes by the United
States as likely to decrease, not spur, violence.
	   ``It has the right to protect itself. If it remains silent after
the last attack (in Kenya and Tanzania), it will be the victim of
numerous blows,'' he said.
	   More typical was the view of Hussein Rashid, 41, a bookkeeper
from the sprawling Cairo neighborhood of Boulaq.
	   ``When you wash your hands in blood repeatedly, they will never
be clean,'' he said. ``Clinton and the U.S have for years been
killing indiscriminately, so this is not new. But it certainly
won't go unanswered by the Muslim world.''
