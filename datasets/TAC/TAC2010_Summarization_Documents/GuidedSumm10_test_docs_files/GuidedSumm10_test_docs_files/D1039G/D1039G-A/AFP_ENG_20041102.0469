Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh, who had received threats over a
controversial film he made about Islam, was shot and stabbed to death
Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam street, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The alleged assailant, identified as having dual Dutch and Moroccan
nationality, was arrested and two people were injured in a shootout
with police after the attack in broad daylight early Tuesday, police
said.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old filmmaker, who was the great great nephew of the late
19th-century artist Vincent van Gogh, caused an uproar this summer
among the Dutch Muslim community with his short film "Submission"
about Islam and women.
</P>
<P>
The film featured four women in see-through robes showing their
breasts with texts from the Koran daubed on their bodies and talking
about the abuse they had suffered.
</P>
<P>
After the film was shown on Dutch television in August, Van Gogh
received death threats and police stepped up measures to protect him,
much against his will.
</P>
<P>
Dutch chief prosecutor Leo de Wit said the suspect arrested at the
scene was a 26-year-old Amsterdam man with dual Dutch and Moroccan
nationality. No further details were given and the police would say
nothing about a possible motive.
</P>
<P>
Amsterdam mayor Job Cohen announced that a memorial gathering for Van
Gogh would be held Tuesday at 8:00 pm in Amsterdam's central Dam
square, with two minutes of silence to be observed in Van Gogh's
memory.
</P>
<P>
"We will show loud and clear that freedom of speech is important to
us. We do not want silence, we want noise," the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
As the nation reeled from another daylight killing following the
assassination of outspoken politician Pim Fortuyn in 2002, Dutch
Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende condemned the attack.
</P>
<P>
He called Van Gogh "a champion of the freedom of speech" and lamented
the polarization of Dutch society.
</P>
<P>
"There is a climate that sees people resorting to violence. That is
worrying," Balkenende told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely terrible and reminds everybody of what happened to
Pim Fortuyn," Dutch Europe Minister Atzo Nicolai told EU foreign
ministers in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh himself had said in an interview with Dutch public radio on
Friday that he "could not imagine" that anyone would want to harm
him.
</P>
<P>
"I believe they think 'that's the village idiot why would you shoot
him?'," he said. "If it happens, it happens."
</P>
<P>
The suspected gunman was shot in the leg by police while fleeing the
scene. He was being treated in hospital and would be questioned
later, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
He left a note on the body of the victim, De Wit confirmed, while
declining to reveal the contents.
</P>
<P>
Moroccan organisations in The Netherlands condemned the murder and
called for calm. "Escalation is in nobody's best interest," the
Moroccan Municipal Assemby in Amsterdam said.
</P>
<P>
"I abhor his views on Islam and find them hurtful for the Islamic
community, but there is no motive that can justify a murder," added
Ayhan Tonca of the Dutch organ for contact between Muslims and
government.
</P>
<P>
Many commentators in the Netherlands immediately drew parallels
between the murder of Van Gogh and the assassination of Fortuyn on
May 6, 2002. Both men had controversial views and took part in heated
political debate.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh made his film with a controversial liberal politician of
Somalian descent, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who is a vocal critic of women's
treatment in Islamic culture and who was also under police protection
after receiving death threats.
</P>
<P>
He also directed television series, wrote columns and books, and had
just finished a movie about the assassination of Fortuyn.
</P>
<P>
Environmental activist Volkert van der Graaf shot Fortuyn as he came
out of a radio studio. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison for the
murder.
