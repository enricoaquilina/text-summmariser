<P>
Dutch politicians and commentators were united Tuesday in their
condemnation of the murder, in broad daylight on an Amsterdam street,
of controversial filmmaker Theo van Gogh and called for calm together
with representatives of the Dutch Muslim community.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh was widely known for his criticism of Islam and recently
caused uproar with a short film linking domestic abuse with the
perceived subservient position of women in the Islamic faith. Many
here fear the fact that Van Gogh's alleged killer is of Moroccan
descent could lead to ethnic tensions in Dutch society.
</P>
<P>
"We ask the inhabitants of Amsterdam to keep cool and cope calmly
with this murder and to bid farewell in a dignified manner to Theo
van Gogh," the Moroccan Municipal Assembly in Amsterdam said, calling
the murder despicable.
</P>
<P>
The organisation called on its supporters to come to the special
memorial gathering for Van Gogh in Amsterdam Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the suspect in the killing was a 26-year-old man
with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality. Several witnesses said the
man was dressed in an Islamic robe with a long beard.
</P>
<P>
Ayhan Tonca, chairman of the Dutch association for contact between
Muslims and government, denounced the killing as "horrific".
</P>
<P>
"I abhor his views on Islam and find them hurtful for the Islamic
community, but there is no motive that can justify a murder," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh made many enemies within the Dutch Muslim community with his
often-insulting descriptions of Islam.
</P>
<P>
The filmmaker and columnist not only attacked Muslims but also Jews
and gays. Despite his controversial views Dutch commentators were
quick to condemn the murder as an attack against the freedom of
speech.
</P>
<P>
Many immediately drew parallels between the murder of Van Gogh, was
shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling on an Amsterdam
street, and the assassination of outspoken politician Pim Fortuyn on
May 6, 2002. The men are hailed as champions of the freedom of
expression, who said what they believed in.
</P>
<P>
"Is this what we want? Do we want to live in such a country? We have
to do something," was one of the typical reactions that flooded the
Dutch public radio that had interrupted its program on the US
election to bring the news of Van Gogh's death.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sad day for the freedom of speech which is the cornerstone
of democracy and the rule of law," Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter
Balkenende said.
</P>
<P>
Muslim organisations in the Netherlands also rushed to reject the
killing in similar terms.
</P>
<P>
"It is an attack against the freedom of speech, the freedom of
religion, the freedom that allows us all to live together in this
country," several big Muslim organisations said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The Forum institute working for a multicultural society in the
Netherlands called on "Dutch nationals together with citizens of
foreign descent to unite for the preservation of democracy and the
rule of law".
</P>
<P>
Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot stressed that the murder "should
not lead to animosity between certain groups in society".
</P>
<P>
"There are also Dutch people who do bad things," he said.
</P>
<P>
Most Dutch radio and television stations have changed their schedules
for Tuesday night to pay homage to Van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
His short film "Submission" about Islam and women caused uproar in
the Muslim community this summer. Van Gogh received many threats
after the film was shown but always laughed them off.
