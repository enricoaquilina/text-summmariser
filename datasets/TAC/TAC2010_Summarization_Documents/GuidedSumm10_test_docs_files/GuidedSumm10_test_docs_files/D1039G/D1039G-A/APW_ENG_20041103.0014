Dutch filmmaker who criticized Islam slain in Amsterdam
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Dutch filmmaker who received death threats after his recent movie
criticized the way women were treated under Islam, was shot and
stabbed to death in Amsterdam on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested a man with dual Moroccan and Dutch citizenship in the
killing of Theo van Gogh after a shootout which left the suspect with
a gunshot wound to the leg and a police officer slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
Police did not release the suspect's identity, but said he had a
record of violent crime.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner said the suspect "acted out
of radical Islamic fundamentalist convictions," and added that he had
contacts with a group that was under surveillance by the Dutch secret
service.
</P>
<P>
The film by Van Gogh, 47, the great-grandson of painter Vincent Van
Gogh's brother, was aired in August on Dutch television, drawing the
ire of some Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Muslim groups _ despite disagreeing with Van Gogh's views on
Islam _ condemned the killing and called for reconciliation. They
expressed fears of possible reprisals against Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The national news service NOS said the suspect was friends with an
18-year-old Muslim, Samir Azzous, who is awaiting trial on charges of
planning a terrorist attack on targets including a nuclear reactor
and Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. Donner did not confirm the report,
which did not cite a source.
</P>
<P>
Donner said the suspect's fundamentalism was evident "from his past
and environment."
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 people poured onto Amsterdam's central square in an
emotional demonstration of support for Van Gogh and against violence.
</P>
<P>
The crowd blew horns, whistles and banged pots and pans.
</P>
<P>
"We won't gather for a moment of silence, but to say loud and clear:
freedom of expression is dear to us, and it must continue," the
city's mayor Job Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
An award-winning filmmaker, television producer and newspaper
columnist, Van Gogh was a controversial figure. He once mocked a
prominent Dutch Jew, referred to Jesus as "the rotten fish" of
Nazareth and called a radical Muslim politician "Allah's pimp."
</P>
<P>
His murder came at a time of increased tensions in the Netherlands,
where many blame violent crime on the Muslim minority, mainly made up
of immigrants. Muslims, in turn, say new anti-immigration and
anti-terrorism laws unfairly discriminate against them.
</P>
<P>
Police said Van Gogh was shot twice as he biked along an Amsterdam
street. The assailant then shot him several more times at close range
before stabbing him and placing a note on his body.
</P>
<P>
The killing instantly recalled the assassination of anti-immigration
politician Pim Fortuyn, who was killed in 2002 by an animal rights
activist. His death had shocked the people of a country where violent
political crime is extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
"This has to end, once and for all," said 20-year-old student Orinta
van Lent at the demonstration. "You cannot just kill people on the
street in a brutal way when you disagree with them."
</P>
<P>
About 20 people were detained at another gathering in The Hague after
chanting nationalist and anti-Muslim slurs.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh said he had received threats after the airing of his movie
"Submission," which he made with a right-wing Dutch politician who
had renounced the Islamic faith of her birth.
</P>
<P>
In the fictional story, a veiled Muslim woman spoke about her violent
marriage, being raped by a relative and later brutally punished for
adultery. In parts of the movie, the actress' naked body is shown
through a transparent gown. Her body had Quranic verses written on it
in one scene _ further angering some Muslims.
</P>
<P>
In a recent radio interview, Van Gogh dismissed the threats as "not
something I worry about."
</P>
<P>
Police kept watch on Van Gogh's house immediately after the film's
airing but dropped that precaution because there was no concrete
evidence of a threat, public prosecutor Leo de Wit said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende described Van Gogh as "a man who
got involved in public debate and expressed strong opinions."
</P>
<P>
"He did not keep quiet about his convictions, even when they were
controversial," Balkenende said in a national address.
