<P>
Theo van Gogh, a Dutch filmmaker and writer who had recently made a
television film critical of Islam, was shot and stabbed to death on
an Amsterdam street on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The killing shocked the Netherlands, already apprehensive over
large-scale Muslim immigration, which has provoked an angry public
debate. Van Gogh's film added to that debate after it was broadcast
in September.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the killing, the police arrested a 26-year-old man of
dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality, whom they refused to name. It
was not immediately clear if he had any connections to militant
groups, but the police said he was not known to any Dutch law
enforcement agency and that he had not been under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
Before fleeing, the man left a note on the body of the victim, said
Eric Vermeulen, a spokesman for the Amsterdam police. The police
declined to describe the contents of the message. The Dutch news
media reported that it contained passages from the Quran.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh, 47, a distant relative of the 19th century painter Vincent
van Gogh, had received death threats after the broadcast of the short
TV film, "Submission." He made the movie with Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a
Somali-born refugee who fled an arranged marriage and ended up in the
Netherlands, where she is now a member of the Dutch Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh and Hirsi Ali, who wrote the script, have both criticized
the conservative Muslim clergy for perpetuating views that are
anti-women and anti-homosexual. Their 10-minute film presented the
stories of four women who, while saying their prayers, describe to
God the sexual and physical abuse they have suffered at the hands of
the men in their lives. The actresses have Quranic verses dealing
with women written on their bare skin, and some have traces of
lashings painted on their bodies.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh, a prolific filmmaker, columnist and writer who dealt with a
wide range of subjects but always mocked hypocrisy, also published a
book titled "Allah Knows Better," a scathing critique of Islamic
militants and clergy, whom he called woman haters. Hirsi Ali, who has
lived under police protection for two years, said she and Van Gogh
had received death threats after the film was broadcast. "Theo did
not want any police protection," she said of van Gogh in a telephone
interview. "He often insisted on the need to preserve our freedom of
speech. He said he would only report the threats to the police."
</P>
<P>
Asked if she and van Gogh had discussed the death threats, she said:
"He told me, 'Ayaan, if they kill me, remember the rule of law has to
be protected against extremists."'
</P>
<P>
The man suspected of killing van Gogh fired several shots at about
8:30 a.m., then crossed the street and stabbed van Gogh several times
with a knife, a police spokesman said. Witnesses told the police that
the assailant then stuck a note on his victim's chest with the knife.
</P>
<P>
He then ran into a nearby park, which was quickly cordoned off by
police. As he emerged, he fired at the police. In a brief ensuing
gunfight, both the suspect and a policeman were wounded, the police
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende called for calm and asked people
to let investigators do their job before jumping to conclusions.
"Nothing is known about the motive," he said in written statement.
Balkenende described the filmmaker as a man of "outspoken opinions,"
and added that it would be deplorable for a difference of opinion to
lead to murder.
</P>
<P>
A memorial called by the mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen, was held
Tuesday night on Dam Square, in the center of the city. The crowd was
estimated at more than 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"We are all so sad and baffled that you can get killed for your
opinion," Tilly Hermans, director of the Augustus Publishing, said in
a telephone interview. "Theo had strong opinions, but in our
democracy we had become used to fighting for our opinion with our
voices or our pens."
</P>
<P>
She said people were worried about possible repercussions and the
political mood in the country. In a recent survey, many Dutch said
they fear the growing number of Muslims and the possibility that
Islamic militants may be among them. Close to a million of the
country's 16 million people are Muslim immigrants or their
descendants.
</P>
<P>
The center-right government has recently tightened immigration laws
and pressed immigrants to try harder to integrate by taking language
and citizenship classes. Immigrants often say it is hard to
assimilate in a country where many people do not want them.
</P>
<P>
Members of immigrant groups in Amsterdam representing Moroccan and
Turkish associations condemned the killing and pleaded for dialogue.
"Escalation is in no one's best interest," a spokesman for a Moroccan
group said.
</P>
<P>
The killing evoked the slaying of the populist right-wing politician
Pim Fortuyn, who, like van Gogh, talked openly about taboo subjects,
including Islam and immigration. Fortuyn, who had gained a large
following and wanted to become prime minister, was killed by an
environmental activist in May 2002, just days before national
elections.
</P>
<P>
By coincidence, van Gogh had just completed a lengthy film about the
life and ideas of Fortuyn, which was to be released in December.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, friends and associates of van Gogh debated on radio and
television why he had not taken the death threats seriously.
</P>
<P>
"Either he underestimated the danger or he did not want to be scared
by it -- I rather think the latter," said Nelleke Noordervliet, a
writer who knew van Gogh well.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh had many admirers and critics. "Life will be a lot more
boring without him," said Eveline van Dijck, a producer who worked
with him.
