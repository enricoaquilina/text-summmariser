<P>
A day after the brutal killing of controversial Dutch film-maker Theo
van Gogh by a suspect linked to Islamic extremists, many were left
wondering what happened to the Netherlands' famed tolerance and fear a
society deeply divided.
</P>
<P>
"The murder could be the start of a spiral in which different
communities come to view each other as enemies," the Christian Trouw
daily warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Theo van Gogh, who had received threats over a controversial film he
made about Islam, was shot and stabbed to death Tuesday while cycling
on an Amsterdam street. His alleged assailant, identified as having
dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality, was arrested shortly after the
attack.
</P>
<P>
Public prosecutor Leo de Wit told a news conference in Amsterdam that
the motive was believed to have been his radical Islamic views,
basing the assumption on the content of two papers, one stuck on the
dagger used to attack the director, the other found on the suspected
killer during a search.
</P>
<P>
The judicial authorities declined to give further information on the
content of the papers, with the prosecutor declining to confirm a
report that the one found on the suspect's body was a farewell
letter.
</P>
<P>
The suspect is being held in isolation and cannot receive anybody
except his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday Dutch Interior Minister Johan Remkes said the suspect
had ties with Islamic extremists in the Netherlands but did not
belong to the hard core group of some 150 extremists being monitored
by the intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
Amsterdam police chief Bernard Welten said late Wednesday that a
total of eight men aged between 19 and 27 had been arrested in
connection with the murder. They were six Moroccans, one Algerian and
a man having dual Moroccan and Spanish citizenship.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made after police searched five apartments and
seized computer equipment and fundamentalist writings.
</P>
<P>
All eight people had already been arrested for suspected terrorist
activities in October 2003 but were later released. Van Gogh's killer
was said to have had contacts with the group and allegedly stayed at
each of the five homes searched.
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday night some 100 witnesses had been questioned by police.
</P>
<P>
After it became known that van Gogh's alleged killer was of Moroccan
descent, politicians and commentators feared ethnic tensions and
called for calm.
</P>
<P>
Later Wednesday an Internet condolence register set up for van Gogh
was closed down because it was flooded with racist remarks.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh, 47, was widely known for his outspoken criticism of Islam
and recently caused uproar with a short film linking domestic abuse
with the perceived subservient position of women in the Islamic
faith.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh, the great great nephew of 19th-century Dutch painter
Vincent van Gogh, was a staunch critic of multicultural society as a
whole. Many Jewish organisation branded him an anti-Semite and he was
generally known as a arch provocateur.
</P>
<P>
Out of a population of 16 million the Netherlands has some 900,000
Muslims and of those some 300,000 are of Moroccan descent. In the
Moroccan community there is a growing fear that they will be singled
out for revenge.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is shocked by the murder. On the other hand ... there are
people who wonder if there will be a war against Moroccans," Abdou
Menabi, chairman of the Urban Assembly of Moroccans in Amsterdam
said, voicing the concerns of many.
</P>
<P>
At a short memorial gathering for Van Gogh in Amsterdam, attended by
some 20,000 people, many Muslims showed up especially to demonstrate
that they condemned the killing.
</P>
<P>
Ikram, a 31-year-old mother, came to the rally with a sign saying
'Muslims against violence'.
</P>
<P>
"I was debating whether or not to come, but I decided that as a
Muslim and as a Moroccan I should take up my responsibility to show
that we do not support this act," she told AFP.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday many papers compared the killing of van Gogh to the
assassination of rightwing populist politician Pim Fortuyn on May 6,
2002.
</P>
<P>
Both men had outspoken views on Islam and many other issues and were
always trying passionately to stir public debate.
</P>
<P>
"After Pim Fortuyn, another person has been killed who held strong
views on controversial issues and did not hide them," the popular
daily Algemeen Dagblad said.
</P>
<P>
"A mass demonstration of Dutch Muslims could be the symbolic start of
a necessary cleansing," it suggested.
</P>
<P>
In Amsterdam several Moroccan organisations held a protest rally.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh's film production company announced Wednesday that he would
be cremated next week Tuesday in a memorial service open to the
public.
