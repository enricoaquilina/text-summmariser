Some 20,000 people gathered in Amsterdam late Tuesday to pay homage to
controversial Dutch filmmaker and columnist Theo van Gogh who was
murdered in the street.
</P>
<P>
Instead of holding a silent wake protesters on Amsterdam's central
Dam Square made as much noise as possible, banging pots and pans and
blowing horns and whistles. The friends and family of Van Gogh had
asked for people to make as much noise as possible in support of the
freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
"The freedom of speech is a foundation of our society and that
foundation was tampered with today," Amsterdam mayor Job Cohen said,
after the deafening noise had subsided.
</P>
<P>
"Theo van Gogh picked fights with many people, myself included, but
that is a right in this country," he added to cheers from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
In his final column Van Gogh even likened Cohen, who is Jewish, to a
collaborator with the Nazi regime at the time of the German
occupation of the Netherlands in World War II.
</P>
<P>
The massive gathering in Amsterdam came after Dutch society reacted
with shock and outrage to the killing of Van Gogh, shot and stabbed
to death on Tuesday as he cycled in broad daylight on an Amsterdam
street.

<P>
Van Gogh was widely known for his criticism of Islam and recently
caused uproar with a short film linking domestic abuse with the
perceived subservient position of women in the Islamic faith.
</P>
<P>
It is assumed that Van Gogh was killed because of his outspoken
criticism of Islam after police said the alleged gunman was a
26-year-old man with dual Dutch and Moroccan nationality. Officially
the authorities will not comment on the motives for the brutal
killing.
</P>
<P>
The murder of Van Gogh immediately brought back memories of the
assassination of rightwing populist politician Pim Fortuyn on May 6,
2002 for many Dutch.
</P>
<P>
Both men had outspoken views on Islam and many other issues and were
always trying passionately to stir public debate.
</P>
<P>
"Van Gogh was provocative but you have to be allowed to provoke
people, that is freedom of speech," said Koos, a 21-year old
political science student at the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Many here fear the fact that Van Gogh's alleged killer is of Moroccan
descent could lead to ethnic tensions in Dutch society.
</P>
<P>
"We are at a crossroads: do we follow the spiral of alienation,
polarisation, fear and hate ... or do we make a stand and say 'no
more'," asked Dutch Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk, who spoke on
behalf of th	     sb/wdb
