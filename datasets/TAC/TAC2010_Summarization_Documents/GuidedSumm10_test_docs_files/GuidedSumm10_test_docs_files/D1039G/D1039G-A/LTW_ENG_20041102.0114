A suspected Muslim extremist on Tuesday
ambushed and killed an outspoken Dutch filmmaker who had received
death threats because of his recent movie denouncing the abuse of
women in Islamic societies, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Writer-director Theo van Gogh, a descendant of the artist Vincent
van Gogh, was attacked shortly before 9 a.m. as he rode his bicycle
through Amsterdam's tree-lined streets toward the offices of his
production company. Another cyclist, described as bearded and wearing
Islamic-style clothes, pulled up behind him and opened fire, police
said.
</P>
<P>
The wounded van Gogh dropped his bike and stumbled away, but the
gunman gave chase, shot him again and stabbed him, police said. Police
cornered the gunman in a nearby park and a gunfight ensued, during
which the suspect was wounded in the leg and an officer suffered minor
wound, authorities said. The attacker was arrested.
</P>
<P>
The suspect's name was not released, but law enforcement officials
said they knew the 26-year-old Dutch-Moroccan for his ties to accused
Muslim extremists and his criminal record. Police found that he left a
document attached to a knife he used to stab the victim, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
The document is believed to be the suspect's will, a sign that he
planned to die in the attack that was apparently driven by religious
extremism, a law enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
``This suspect was at least known to the authorities. He was known
as a Muslim activist,'' said the official, who asked not to be
identified. ``He had indirect contacts with people under investigation
for Islamic extremism.''
</P>
<P>
Thousands gathered Tuesday night for a memorial rally called by
Amsterdam's mayor, an event that was accompanied by loud drummers as
the rowdy van Gogh would have wanted.
</P>
<P>
For many Dutch, the slaying revived painful memories of the 2002
assassination of maverick political leader Pym Fortuyn, another
explosive crime mixing Islam and Dutch politics.
</P>
<P>
A feminist politician who starred in van Gogh's film accused
authorities of failing to prevent a crime foretold.
</P>
<P>
Congressional deputy Ayaan Hirsi Ali has lived with
around-the-clock bodyguards for several years because of threats
arising from her campaign against abuse of women in Islamic immigrant
communities. Van Gogh had been inundated with threats since the airing
of the film, ``Submission,'' in August, said Ali, a Somali refugee.
</P>
<P>
``Everyone knew that this could happen,'' Ali told the NRC
Handelsblatt newspaper Tuesday. ``He's been threatened almost
constantly since the summer. I know how the Arabic culture of revenge
works. I've had security around me, so Theo was the easiest target.
</P>
<P>
''It's incredibly stupid that the local authorities in Amsterdam
didn't protect van Gogh,`` she added. '' ... It makes me cynical.
Apparently in this country, the habit is to wait until someone dies
before taking action.``
</P>
<P>
But van Gogh, a chain-smoker with a defiant, irascible style,
dismissed the dangers during a radio interview last week.
</P>
<P>
''If it happens, it happens,`` van Gogh said. Then he added: ''The
bullet won't come for me. People think, `He's the village idiot, so
why would I shoot him?' ``
</P>
<P>
Police had looked into the threats against van Gogh but decided
they were not solid enough to assign him guards, a Dutch prosecutor
told journalists Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende issued a written
statement asking the public not to jump to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
''The facts have to be carefully examined,`` he said. ''Let's allow
the investigators to do their jobs. Van Gogh was someone who took part
in the public debate with outspoken opinions, a champion of free
speech. It's unacceptable if expressing a free opinion was the reason
behind this brutal murder.``
</P>
<P>
The crime was the latest wake-up call for the Netherlands'
low-crime but increasingly troubled society, which has struggled to
integrate Muslim immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh's hard-edged rhetoric drew criticism; he shared Fortuyn's
typically Dutch mix of social liberalism and political conservatism,
commentators said. Van Gogh admired President Bush and his
self-declared ''war on terrorism,`` according to Emerson Vermaat, a
Dutch investigative journalist writing a book on al-Qaida in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Some Muslim activists called van Gogh's film blasphemous. The
10-minute short tells the fictional stories of four women who endure
incest, rape, beatings and forced marriages. It features images of
women with Koranic verses painted on their bodies under see-through
chadors.
