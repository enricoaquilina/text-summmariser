A Dutch filmmaker who outraged members of the Muslim
community with his works' attacks on the treatment of women in Islamic
society was gunned down and stabbed to death on an Amsterdam street
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said a gunman opened fire on Theo van Gogh, 47, as the
filmmaker bicycled down Linnaeus Street in the eastern part of the
city, then chased him on foot, shot him again and stabbed him. Some
reports said the killer slit van Gogh's throat with a knife as the
victim lay helpless on the pavement.

After a shootout in which one policeman and a bystander were
slightly wounded, police wounded and captured the alleged assailant,
whom they identified only as a 26-year man of dual Dutch and Moroccan
nationality. Chief prosecutor Leo de Wit confirmed that the killer had
left a note on Van Gogh's body, the contents of which were not
disclosed.

Friends and associates said van Gogh had received anonymous death
threats after Dutch television aired his controversial short film
``Submission'' in August. The film featured four women who claimed to
have been abused by their Muslim husbands and who wore see-through
robes showing their breasts, with texts from the Koran scrawled on
their bodies.

<P>
It was the second political killing to shake this socially tolerant
European country in recent years. Pim Fortuyn, an outspoken politician
critical of open immigration and Islam was gunned down in May 2002 by
an environmental activist who labeled Fortuyn a ``danger'' to society.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's killing set off a new round of soul-searching and dismay
among many people in the Netherlands. ``There is a climate that sees
people resorting to violence -- that is worrying,'' Prime Minister Jan
Peter Balkenende said at a news conference in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
He called van Gogh ``a champion of the freedom of speech,'' and
warned against polarization and intolerance in Dutch society. ``On a
day like this we are reminded of the murder of Fortuyn,'' he added.
``We cannot allow bullets to rule our society because then dialogue is
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
Amsterdam residents held a memorial gathering Tuesday evening at
Dam square in the city center. ``We will show loud and clear that
freedom of speech is important to us,'' declared Job Cohen,
Amsterdam's mayor. He said van Gogh would not have wanted a silent
vigil. ``We do not want silence,'' he said, ``we want noise.''
</P>
<P>
Among those who planned to attend were Muslim groups who condemned
the killing as barbaric. ``People are rather shocked and
embarrassed,'' said Yassin Hartog, coordinator of the Islam and
Citizenship Foundation, a group that promotes peaceful dialogue.
``Everybody wants to make sure we all stick together, Muslims and
non-Muslims. Tonight's meeting is for everyone who is outraged at this
event.''
</P>
<P>
Hartog, a convert to Islam, said van Gogh's film had deeply
insulted many Muslims but that he had been invited to address a
meeting of the Moroccan community in Amsterdam. ``He was very
outspoken, but he was not a racist,'' Hartog said. ``He was attempting
to show in his own way where religious views and liberal views
clashed.''
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh made ``Submission'' in collaboration with Ayaan Hirsi Ali,
a Dutch politician and former Somali refugee who said she had fled an
arranged marriage and physical abuse in her native country. Ali, who
has renounced Islam, has been under police protection since the film
was aired because of threats against her life.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh also wrote a book entitled ``Allah Knows Better'' that
criticized Islamic extremism and claimed Muslim clerics hated women.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 1 million Muslims in the Netherlands, about 5.5
percent of the population, and recent opinion polls suggest that many
Dutch citizens feel threatened by their presence.
</P>
<P>
The government has pressed for Dutch language tests and citizenship
classes and has announced plans to repatriate up to 26,000 immigrants
-- some of them long-time residents -- whose applications for political
asylum have been rejected.
