<P>
The first results of an investigation into the murder of controversial
Dutch film-maker Theo van Gogh, whose suspected assailant has ties to
radical Islamists, point to a "terrorist conspiracy," prosecutors said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor charged seven suspects with ties to Islamic groups in
the Netherlands, including the alleged murderer, with involvement in
a conspiracy over the killing of Van Gogh and with plotting to kill
Dutch liberal politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, but late Friday a judge
ruled that two of the suspects should be released.
</P>
<P>
The alleged killer, identifed by Dutch media as Mohammed B., was
remanded in custody for 10 days together with four men of Moroccan
and Algerian descent.
</P>
<P>
Two other suspects, both of Moroccan origin, were released because
the judge ruled the evidence against them was not substantial enough.
</P>
<P>
One of them was immediately re-arrested by the Dutch immigration
services because he was residing illegally in the country, a court
official told Dutch ANP news agency.
</P>
<P>
Dutch deputy prime minister Gerrit Zalm vowed after a meeting of all
cabinet ministers Friday to fight Muslim extremism.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed B., is a 26-year-old with dual Moroccan and Dutch
nationality.
</P>
<P>
Police said he was arrested shortly after he allegedly shot and
stabbed Van Gogh while the film-maker was cycling in Amsterdam
Tuesday. The suspect has so far refused to speak to investigators.
</P>
<P>
A letter left on the body of Van Gogh threatened Somalian-born Dutch
liberal politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali because it said she had turned
away from Islam, as well as Amsterdam's mayor Job Cohen whom it said
had pitted Jews against non-Jews.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh was widely known for his criticism of Islam and recently
caused an uproar with a short film made together with Hirsi Ali
linking domestic abuse with the perceived subservient position of
women in the Islamic faith.
</P>
<P>
Zalm said the government saw new developments in Muslim extremism
"where thoughts are translated into blood and murder". The government
has decided to set aside extra funds for the intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
They will also see if current legislation needs to be changed to make
it easier to crack down on radical Muslims who use violence.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor's working on Van Gogh's murder are investigating whether
the men arrested were part of a larger network.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dutch intelligence service there are between 100 and
200 Islamic extremists active in the country who try to recruit
immigrant youths for a jihad, or holy Islamic war.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Cohen of Amsterdam called on the intelligence services to work
together with local authorities to fight Muslim extremists.
</P>
<P>
"As mayor I want to know what goes on in my city. I want to know who
is engaged in recruiting for jihad," he said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor stressed that he would not hesitate to close down mosques
if evidence showed they were inciting hatred.
