Muslim Extremist Is Arraigned in van Gogh's Death

<P>
A suspected Islamic extremist of
Dutch-Moroccan descent was arraigned Friday on charges of murder and
terrorism, accused of killing a director whose film denounced the
mistreatment of women in Muslim communities.
</P>
<P>
Police were also holding six other suspects who could face
terrorism charges in Tuesday's slaying of filmmaker Theo van Gogh. The
case increasingly appeared to be the first Islamic terrorist attack in
The Netherlands, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have focused on the international connections of the
suspects, several of whom were detained briefly last year for possible
ties to a Moroccan militant network suspected in suicide bombings in
Casablanca in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The accused killer, identified only as Mohammed B., wrote a will
stating his attack on van Gogh was a suicide mission, and a five-page
letter threatening Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Dutch woman legislator whose
script van Gogh's film is based on, authorities said. The North
African suspects allegedly had plans to kill Ali and possibly other
prominent figures, said chief Amsterdam prosecutor Leo de Wit.
</P>
<P>
``It's a group of radicals who see us as the enemy, and with whom
we've actually been drawn in into a war,'' said Jozias Van Aartsen of
the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, or VVD party, to which
Ali belongs, in the Het Parool newspaper. ``There's a jihad in the
Netherlands. Ayaan Hirsi Ali indicated this danger a year and a half
ago, and now we've crossed a threshold.''
</P>
<P>
The killing of van Gogh has shocked people who see it as the second
European strike by Islamic militants this year. In March, train
bombings in Madrid, Spain, killed 191 people; the van Gogh killing
followed a different strategy: a high-impact assassination of a
well-known artist apparently chosen because the plotters felt he had
insulted Islam.
</P>
<P>
``It's a small version of a terrorist attack,'' a law enforcement
official said in an interview. ``The police are out there working this
very hard and looking for people. They are certainly looking at
involvement of groups like the'' Moroccan Islamic Combat Group, a
network suspected in the Casablanca and Madrid bombings.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh's killing had a ritualistic, execution-like quality
reminiscent of this year's videotaped beheadings in Iraq, analysts
said. The killer ambushed the filmmaker as he rode on a bicycle,
shooting him repeatedly, then slit his throat as he lay wounded and
used a second knife to pin the letter to the body.
</P>
<P>
That document, ``An open letter to Ayaan Hirschi Ali,'' threatens
politicians, has anti-Semitic diatribes, calls for global jihad and
predicts the downfall of the Netherlands, Europe and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
``What's disturbing is that the suspect, born and raised in the
Netherlands, went through a radicalization process here that brought
him to this unimaginable deed,'' Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The letter written by Mohammed B. gives the impression of speaking
for a group, Donner said. Investigators said the language reflects the
influence of the radical Takfir Wal Hijra movement, an ideology that
is widespread among radicalized Muslim criminals in Europe and North
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Takfiris dominated the cell that carried out the Madrid train
bombings. At least two fugitives in the Madrid attacks made phone
calls to associates in the Netherlands and may have fled here.
</P>
<P>
As the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday, investigators have
confirmed that Mohamed was known to the Dutch intelligence service for
some time. His associates include Samir Azzouz, 18, who awaits trial
on charges of planning a terrorist attack against a nuclear reactor
and Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. Like several of Mohamed's accused
accomplices in the van Gogh case, Azzouz was first detained in October
2003 because of suspected ties to the Casablanca suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
But they were all released under Dutch laws that are among Europe's
most protective of defendants. Dutch anti-terror investigators have
150 men identified as hard-core jihadis under surveillance because
police consider them dangerous but don't have grounds to arrest them.
Mohamed was not among that group, but he had been investigated,
according to the law enforcement official, who asked to remain
anonymous.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch want to know whether the government did enough to protect
van Gogh, who began getting threats after his 11-minute film,
``Submission,'' aired in August. The short tells the story of Muslim
women who suffer rape, beatings and other abuse, and angered some
Muslims with images of a woman with Quranic verses painted on her
body.
