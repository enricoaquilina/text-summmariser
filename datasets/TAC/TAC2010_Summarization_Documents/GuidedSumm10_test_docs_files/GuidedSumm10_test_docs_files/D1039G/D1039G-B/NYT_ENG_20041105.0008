The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Nov. 5:

Something sad and terrible is happening to the Netherlands, long one
of Europe's most tolerant, decent and multicultural societies. The
latest warning sign is this week's brazen murder of Theo van Gogh, a
daring filmmaker and columnist descended from the same family as
Vincent van Gogh. This summer, Dutch television showed a 10-minute
film by Theo van Gogh calling attention to the horrific violence that
Muslim women can be subjected to by family members in the name of
religion. The chief suspect is believed to be an Islamist extremist,
as are eight other men also arrested in connection with the case.

<P>
The Netherlands used to be a country where artists and politicians
dared to raise even the most controversial issues without fear of
physical retaliation. But the screenwriter who worked with van Gogh,
Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali refugee who was elected as a member of the
Dutch Parliament, is now under police protection. It's just been a
little more than two years since a Dutch extremist shot Pim Fortuyn, a
rising populist politician who portrayed Muslim immigration as a grave
threat to the nation's traditions of tolerance.
</P>
<P>
Urgent efforts are needed to better manage the cultural tensions
perilously close to the surface of Dutch public life. The problem is
not Muslim immigration, but a failure to plan for a smoother
transition to a more diverse society. One very real danger is that the
public trauma over the van Gogh murder may lead to a clamor for anti-
Muslim policies that could victimize thousands of innocent refugees
and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The challenge for Dutch political leaders is to find ways to reverse
this disturbing trend of politically motivated violence without making
it harder to achieve cultural harmony.
