Dutch arrest two suspected of threatening to behead anti-immigration
politician

Police detained an additional suspect in the slaying of Dutch
filmmaker Theo van Gogh and arrested two other men accused of calling
for the beheading of a politician in a video circulating on the
Internet, prosecutors said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old arrested in connection with Van Gogh's death is the
eighth suspect in what Dutch prosecutors say was a gang of young
Muslim radicals who conspired to murder the filmmaker over a movie
critical of Islam.
</P>
<P>
In the other arrests, two men _ ages 20 and 23 _ were detained in
connection with a video promising "paradise" for the beheading of
lawmaker Geert Wilders, prosecutors said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Wilders, a right-wing conservative outspoken in his opposition to
immigration to the Netherlands, recently split from his mainstream
party because it favored a bid by predominantly Muslim Turkey to join
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the suspects used an Internet group Web site run by
Microsoft to place a video with the text: "The punishment is
beheading and the reward for doing it is paradise," prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
The video is just over a minute long and accompanied by Arabic music
and singing. The MSN group where the video originally was posted has
since been closed, but the video is circulating on other Dutch Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh, a distant relative of the famous painter Vincent Van Gogh,
was shot, stabbed and his throat slit Tuesday in Amsterdam. His
alleged killer, identified by Dutch media as Mohammed B., was
arrested minutes later.
</P>
<P>
A five-page letter pinned to Van Gogh's corpse with a knife also
threatened death to lawmaker Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who worked with Van
Gogh on a movie criticizing the treatment of women under Islam.
</P>
<P>
That letter was signed "Saifu Deen al-Muwahhied," _ the same
signature used in an open letter threatening Wilders that was written
in February and reposted recently on a mainstream Web site for
Dutch-Moroccans. The letter has since been removed from
www.marokko.nl. The phrase means "the sword of belief of those that
affirm the unity of God."
</P>
<P>
Both Wilders and Hirsi Ali are under police protection. After Van
Gogh's killing, Wilders said he would form his own anti-immigration
party, and Dutch pollster Maurice de Hond said Wilders' popularity
has since soared. De Hond estimated that Wilders would win 12 percent
of the vote in jittery Netherlands if elections were held now.
</P>
<P>
Six other suspects accused of conspiring to murder Van Gogh were
arrested shortly after the murder and have been charged with
membership in a terrorist organization and conspiring to murder. All
the suspects are of Moroccan or Algerian descent, though several hold
Dutch passports, including the alleged killer.
</P>
<P>
Judges ordered two suspects released for lack of evidence but
Mohammed B. and the others remained in custody.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of the Netherlands' Moroccan community held a
rally in The Hague to promote peace and reconciliation.
