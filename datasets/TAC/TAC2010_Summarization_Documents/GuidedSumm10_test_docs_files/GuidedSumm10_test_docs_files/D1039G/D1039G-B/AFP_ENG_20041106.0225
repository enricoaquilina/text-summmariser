<P>
The Dutch government has declared war on Islamic extremism following
the brutal killing of filmmaker and columnist Theo van Gogh by a
suspected radical Muslim, which brought the threat of Islamic violence
close to home.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh, the 47-year-old great great nephew of 19th-century painter
Vincent van Gogh, was shot and stabbed to death on Tuesday while
cycling near is home in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
A controversial figure and arch provocateur, van Gogh criticised
everything he felt was "politically correct" through his films and
articles and launched equally scathing verbal attacks on Muslims and
Jews.
</P>
<P>
In August he caused an uproar with a short film he made with
Somalian-born liberal politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, in which women
talked about being abused in see-through robes, their bodies daubed
with Koran texts perceived as hostile to women.
</P>
<P>
A letter left on the body of van Gogh threatened Hirsi Ali because it
said she had turned away from Islam, as well as Amsterdam's mayor Job
Cohen whom it said had pitted Jews against non-Jews.
</P>
<P>
Police said the suspect, a 26-year old man with dual Dutch and
Moroccan nationality who was arrested shortly after the murder, had
links to Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
Another four suspects, all of North African origin, were arrested in
the case and have been charged with belonging to a "terrorist
conspiracy" to kill van Gogh and planning to kill Hirsi Ali and
others, Amsterdam prosecutor Leo de Wit said Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday the police announced they had arrested a sixth suspect, a
23-year-old of Moroccan descent. He is also to be charged with
membership of a terrorist network and conspiring to murder Van Gogh
and planning to kill Hirsi Ali, the ANP news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The murder of van Gogh has brought the threat of Islamic terrorism
and a jihad, holy Islamic war, close to home in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"A brutal reality presents itself: jihad warriors are among us," the
centre-left Volkskrant daily writes on the front-page Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Only after the first victim of the jihad has died, it is dawning on
Dutch public opinion that politicised Islam is a serious threat to
Dutch society," the paper wrote in an analysis.
</P>
<P>
Christian daily Trouw tried to explain why the murder of van Gogh so
deeply shocked the Netherlands and completely overshadowed the US
presidential elections in the country's media.
</P>
<P>
"Great political violence always played out somewhere else, in Tel
Aviv, Belfast, New York, Madrid and Baghdad ... On November 2 in
Amsterdam's rush hour traffic the brutal outside world forced itself
into the Netherlands," Trouw wrote in its Saturday editorial.
</P>
<P>
A combative Deputy Prime Minister Gerrit Zalm vowed on Friday to hit
back at Muslim extremism.
</P>
<P>
"We are declaring war back: we will step up the fight and will make
radical Islamic movements disappear from the Netherlands," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to set aside extra funds for the
intelligence services. They will also see if current legislation
needs to be changed to make it easier to crack down on radical
Muslims who use violence.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor's working on van Gogh's murder are investigating whether
the men arrested were part of a larger network.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dutch intelligence service there are between 100 and
200 Islamic extremists in the country allegedly trying to recruit
immigrant youths for a holy war.
</P>
<P>
Out of a population of 16 million the Netherlands has some 900,000
Muslims and of those some 300,000 are of Moroccan descent. The
authorities estimate that between three and five percent of all Dutch
Muslims support radical ideas.
</P>
<P>
In the last few days the Dutch authorities have stepped up security
for a handful of politicians who have also received threats from
Muslim radicals.
</P>
<P>
Two men were arrested Friday for threats sent to rightwing politician
Geert Wilders, who argued that Islam can kill traditional Dutch
tolerance and democracy.
