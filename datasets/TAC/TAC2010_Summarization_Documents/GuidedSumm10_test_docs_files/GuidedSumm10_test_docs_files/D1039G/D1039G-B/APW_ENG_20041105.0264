Dutch politician says Islamic radicals suspected of crimes should be
deported

<P>
The arrest of an alleged Islamic extremist in the slaying of
filmmaker Theo van Gogh prompted a conservative Dutch political
leader on Friday to suggest that Islamic radicals suspected of crimes
be deported.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the VVD Party, the country's third largest party and a
member of the governing coalition, warned that the Netherlands faces
a growing problem from Islamic extremism.
</P>
<P>
"Jihad has come to the Netherlands," Jozias van Aartsen said. "I hope
that we are past the denial phase in this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Though his proposals would seem to run afoul of Dutch traditions of
tolerance and his own party's liberalism, van Aartsen said Islamic
radicals holding dual citizenship who are suspected of crimes in the
Netherlands should be deported and stripped of their Dutch passports.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to change laws, but I expect the Cabinet will do that,"
van Aartsen said.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh, a distant relative of the famous painter Vincent van Gogh,
was shot and stabbed Tuesday while bicycling through Amsterdam. His
most recent film criticized the treatment of women under Islam,
drawing outrage from Muslims and death threats.
</P>
<P>
His alleged killer, a 26-year-old man with dual Dutch-Moroccan
citizenship, is under arrest and faces murder and terrorism charges,
along with six other suspects.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh's killer left a note impaled by a knife on his body quoting
from the Quran and threatening more killings.
</P>
<P>
Mainstream Muslim groups have denounced the slaying.
</P>
<P>
Van Aartsen said police protection for politicians and artists must
be expanded and the secret service must be given more funding to
shadow suspected extremists.
</P>
<P>
Separately, maverick right-wing politician Geert Wilders said he will
form a new political party on a platform promising to crack down on
Islamic radicalism.
</P>
<P>
A poll taken before Van Gogh's killing suggested Wilders would
receive more than 10 percent of votes if new elections were to be
held in the Netherlands today.
