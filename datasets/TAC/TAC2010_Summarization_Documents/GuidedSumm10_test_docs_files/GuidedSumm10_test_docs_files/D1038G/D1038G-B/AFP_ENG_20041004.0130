MOUNT ST. HELENS, Washington, Oct 4 (AFP)

<P>
Mount St. Helens spewed out more steam on Monday after new seismic
tremors that led some experts to warn the volcano could explode at
any time.
</P>
<P>
The volcano ejected steam followed by "a small amount of ash" in an
eruption that lasted some 10 minutes at 9:47am (1647 GMT), said Tim
McBicker, a spokesman for the US Geological Survey (USGS).
</P>
<P>
Although it has stopped, McBicker said "there will be additional
eruptions."
</P>
<P>
Monday's eruption was similar to one on Friday that sent a huge cloud
of steam and some ash into the air, USGS spokeswoman Catherine
Puckett told AFP.
</P>
<P>
A tremor shook St. Helens early Sunday for 25 minutes, prompting
scientists to warn of an imminent eruption two days after the volcano
roared back to life.
</P>
<P>
Authorities elevated their alert level to the maximum third level
over the weekend and diverted flights away from the volcano's area.
Visitors were evacuated from a five-mile (8 kilometer) radius around
the mountain, including the USGS Johnson Ridge Observatory.
</P>
<P>
The volcano killed 57 people during a major eruption in 1980 after
weeks of quakes, slides and tremors and after belching smoke, steam
and ash.
</P>
<P>
St. Helens erupted again in 1986, but with nowhere near the same
intensity.
