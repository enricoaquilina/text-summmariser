Mount St. Helens has calmed down and is no longer likely
to erupt at any moment, the U.S. Geological Survey announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A day after telling residents of the Pacific Northwest that they
should get used to the idea of living with an active volcano, the
agency lowered the volcano's alert classification from the highest
level, which meant an eruption was likely within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The high level of alert was ordered last Saturday when Mount St.
Helens, the most active volcano on the West Coast, entered a period of
``very, very vigorous'' unrest, according to Willie Scott, a USGS
geologist.
</P>
<P>
That unrest, which caused the south side of the volcano's dome to
rise, crack and belch highly photogenic, but harmless columns of steam
and ash, ``slowed down greatly'' after an eruption on Tuesday, Scott
said.
</P>
<P>
He said a five-day rhythmic pattern of increasing pressure inside
the volcano, followed by a sudden venting of steam and ash appears to
have ended.
</P>
<P>
``We no longer think an eruption is imminent, in the sense of
minutes or hours,'' Scott said in a news briefing. ``We could be in
for days, weeks, perhaps even months of relative quiet.''
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that Mount St. Helens is not finished with its
season of unrest, which began 12 days ago, after the volcano had been
quiet for nearly 6 years.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have consistently said that the volcano has a near
negligible chance of another cataclysmic eruption similar to the one
in 1980 that killed 57 people and blew away much of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
``There's not necessarily going to be a big one,'' Jacob
Lowenstern, a USGS vulcanologist, told reporters. ``People have to get
that out of their minds.''
