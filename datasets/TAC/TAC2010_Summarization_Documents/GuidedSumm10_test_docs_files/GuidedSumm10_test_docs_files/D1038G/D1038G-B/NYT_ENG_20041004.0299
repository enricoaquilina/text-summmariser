ASH FROM MOUNT ST. HELENS MAY HELP DETERMINE DANGER

A sprinkle of fine ash lifted from the leaf of a tree on Mount St.
Helens and express-mailed to Lakewood may help researchers understand
if the volcano's recent eruptions are coming up from deep within the
belly of the beast or from its surface.
</P>
<P>
The answer, scientists hope, will help emergency planners and others
know if the volcano is about to erupt with a spray of rocky debris, a
river of lava or merely more steam.
</P>
<P>
"What we're looking for here is evidence -- or lack of evidence --
from fresh magma," said Tom Casadevall, regional director of the U.S.
Geological Survey in Lakewood.
</P>
<P>
Monday afternoon, researchers at the agency were still preparing
samples for fine-scale analysis, but preliminary work suggested that
ash blown into the sky Friday came from older rock inside the
volcano.
</P>
<P>
That's good news for now, because it means hot magma probably was not
racing toward the volcano's surface on Friday, Casadevall said, but
the volcano is likely changing quickly.
</P>
<P>
The geologist studied Mount St. Helens for six years, including the
volcano's deadly 1980 eruption. His "gut feeling" is that fresh magma
is rising up from below the mountain, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We might not see it in the ash from Friday, but my guess is we'll
see it in the next day or two."
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory in Washington
state collected a tiny sample of dust from the flank of the volcano
Saturday, and it arrived in this Denver suburb Monday morning, said
Lakewood geologist Geoff Plumlee
</P>
<P>
The fine dust -- collected from, yes, an ash tree -- is being
scrutinized with high-tech microscopes for its mineral composition
and the shape of particles.
</P>
<P>
Sharp shards of glasslike rock, and certain combinations of chemical
elements would suggest that magma is rising toward the surface of
Mount St. Helens, presaging a more serious type of eruption,
Casadevall said.
</P>
<P>
Weathered rock dust would suggest that smaller events at the base of
the volcano are lifting old rock into the air.
</P>
<P>
Casadevall said the ash analysis is just one piece of evidence
Washington scientists will examine as they try to understand Mount
St. Helen's behavior.
</P>
<P>
"There's dust, gases, earthquakes ... but all those are indirect
measurements of the processes that may or may not indicate new
magma," he said. "Ash, that's really the Rosetta stone."
