MOUNT ST. HELENS SPEWS STEAM, BUT MANY ANTICIPATE A BIGGER BLOW

Heightening the suspense around what a quivering Mount St. Helens may
do next -- and delighting the thousands of tourists flocking there --
the volcano on Monday morning spewed a giant column of steam and then
sputtered out another picturesque puff later in the day.

But those events, coming after the mountain erupted Friday for the
first time in 18 years, were still less serious than what scientists
closely monitoring the mountain had anticipated, and the scientists
were still saying Monday that a more significant eruption was likely.

In 1980, a massive eruption of Mount St. Helens in southwestern
Washington killed 57 people, dumped tons of ash on towns across the
region and set off one of the most powerful landslides in history.
Scientists say that even if their predictions, which have led them to
issue a "code red" alert for an imminent eruption of the mountain,
come true, any further eruptions would be far less devastating than
the explosion of 1980.

"There may be some explosions, and some of those explosions may be
relatively large, larger than we've seen," Jake Lowenstern, a
volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said during a news
conference on Monday afternoon.

At 9:47 a.m. Monday, a steam plume soaring between 1,000 feet and
2,000 feet above the lip of the mountain's crater -- or about 10,000
feet into the air -- billowed into the sky. Scientists said the
likely cause was "hot material" in the mountain coming into contact
with glacier water, causing a boiling beneath and a burst of steam.
Ash is the greatest health concern for downwind towns, but little was
emitted during the steam explosion, scientists said. But anticipated
eruptions, foreshadowed by recent tremors and a steady swarm of
earthquakes, could contain more ash, they said.

Scientists are closely watching the movement of molten rock, or
magma, which they said was slowly moving up through the mountain's
crater and could either create a dome or cause a "more explosive
event." The scientists are also measuring the presence of gases,
which could lead to a more serious eruption, rather than the more
benign steam explosions of the last week, and they said Monday that
they had detected an increased level of potentially explosive gases.

Meanwhile, visitors' centers and viewing points on the mountain --
the one closest to the mountain's crater was closed and evacuated on
Saturday -- have continued to register record numbers of tourists,
many of them traveling long distances, carting cameras, generators,
coolers and other provisions, and situating themselves on the
mountain in an obsessive quest to watch it blow.
