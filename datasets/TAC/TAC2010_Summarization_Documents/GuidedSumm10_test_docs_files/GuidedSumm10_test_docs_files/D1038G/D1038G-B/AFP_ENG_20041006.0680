MOUNT ST. HELENS, Washington, Oct 6 (AFP)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US authorities on Wednesday lowered the eruption alert around the
Mount St. Helens volcano, saying that an explosion of the simmering
peak was no longer imminent.
</P>
<P>
The alert level was dropped from three to two nearly two weeks after
the volcano in the northwestern state of Washington -- which killed
57 people in 1980 -- began shaking the earth and belching steam and
ash, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
"Seismic activity is as low as it has been as this event begun, so we
have lowered the alert level to two," said Don Strick, a spokesman
for the US Geological Survey, which has been monitoring the
mountain's dramatic rumblings and ventings.
</P>
<P>
"An eruption could still happen, but it is not imminent," he told
AFP, adding that the peak's behaviour remained unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
The alert around the mountain was raised to its highest level of
three on Saturday after the crater began spewing steam and ash a day
earlier, following a week of mounting earthquake activity.
</P>
<P>
Visitors were evacuated from an eight-kilometer (five-mile) radius
around the mountain, including at the US Geological Survey's Johnson
Ridge Observatory.
</P>
<P>
A tremor shook Mount St. Helens early Sunday for 25 minutes,
prompting scientists to warn of an imminent eruption.
</P>
<P>
The restive volcano then let off more steam and ash Tuesday as hot
rock pushing toward the surface melted the peak's glaciers, promoting
scientists to predict that an eruption could hit at any time.
</P>
<P>
But following the dramatic spewing of a huge white column of steam,
earthquake activity died down in the area and the lava dome in
volcano's crater floor slowed its dramatic rise that augured an
eruption.
</P>
<P>
"We infer that the vigorous unrest of the past few days has lessened
and that the probability of an imminent eruption that would endanger
life and property is significantly less," the USGS said on its
website.
</P>
<P>
But it warned: "Everyone should be aware that escalation in unrest
and perhaps an eruption could occur suddenly or with very little
warning."
</P>
<P>
Scientists have said that any eruption of the mountain would be much
weaker than the 1980 eruption that caused 57 deaths and thrust
millions of tonnes of ash into the sky, cloaking the cities of
Seattle and Portland in a blanket of volcanic material.
</P>
<P>
Portland is to the south in the neighbouring state of Oregon, some 80
kilometers (50 miles) from Mount St. Helens. Seattle is located to
the north, 160 kilometers (99 miles) from the rumbling volcano.
</P>
<P>
Mount St. Helens last erupted in 1986, but with nowhere near the same
intensity.
