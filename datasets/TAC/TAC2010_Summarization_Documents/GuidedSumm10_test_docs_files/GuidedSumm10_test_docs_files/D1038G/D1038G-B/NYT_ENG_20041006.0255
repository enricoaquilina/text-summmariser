MOUNT ST. HELENS NATIONAL VOLCANIC MONUMENT, Wash. -- They sit for
hours, gazing across a mud-caked valley toward the rumbling mountain.
Over the last week, since Mount St. Helens reawakened after almost
two decades with a huge plume of steam, thousands have come here from
across the West Coast and as far away as Texas.
</P>
<P>
They sleep in nearby hotels or up here in cars, camper-vans and
mobile homes and in sleeping bags laid across the rocky soil -- all
waiting for the earth to reveal its intentions. They have motored up
to this mountain carting digital cameras, barbecue grills, coolers,
wine, romance novels, telescopes, all in a sort of pilgrimage to the
place where, they say, the earth feels more alive -- and so do they.
</P>
<P>
"At our age we're racing the clock," said Gayle Boren, 66, of
Midlothian, Texas, who flew here to southwest Washington with her
friend Opal French, 75, of Lubbock, Texas. "We're trying to do and
see as much as we can before we die."
</P>
<P>
Like so many others up here who seem content to pass entire days
staring at the mostly quiet mountain -- as active as it looks on
television, it really only erupts once in a while, and then for at
most an hour at a time -- the pair said they had come in search of a
feeling.
</P>
<P>
They sat together on canvas chairs borrowed from a young couple
nearby, under the shade of an alder tree near the Castle Lake
Viewpoint, about eight miles from the mountain's crater. They
explained the feeling they were after: a thrill that was as much
about waiting for a volcano to erupt as it was about the sense of
escape.
</P>
<P>
"It's something we can enjoy without someone being hurt," said Boren,
who was staying at the Comfort Inn in Kelso, Wash.
</P>
<P>
It was taking their minds off presidential and vice presidential
debates (boring and predictable), they said, the news of the Iraq war
and terrorism (depressing) and the 9/11 Commission Report (long,
complicated and depressing). Boren brought the commission report with
her up to the mountain but has so far decided not to read it.
</P>
<P>
There is a rhythm to the volcano-watching day. For those staying in
nearby hotels, it begins with the latest reports on television, which
on both Monday and Tuesday brought what they had been waiting for:
word of eruptions, minor but dramatic. With each breathless broadcast
new pilgrims come to the mountain.
</P>
<P>
For those already up here, some sleeping here for days now, the
mountain had already delivered the news from across the valley and
into the sky.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have for days been predicting a more serious eruption of
the mountain, which in 1980 produced a large explosion that left 57
dead. But they now say it could take weeks, or may never happen, and
after seismic tremors beneath the mountain's lava dome dropped off by
Wednesday scientists lowered the volcanic alert level one notch, from
"code red" to "code orange."
</P>
<P>
The people up here seem to be finding something they need.
</P>
<P>
Colleen Grant, 46, of Coquitlam, British Columbia, said the
experience was helping her get over those "control issues" her
husband teases her about. Forced to surrender to geologic time while
waiting for the big one, she found it calming, she said, and with a
mixture of serenity and pleasant surprise, added, "We have no
control."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, in honor of the reddish lava they hoped was rising
from within the mountain, Grant, a lab technologist, and her husband,
Rod, a caterer, drank merlot with barbecued steaks and prawns. Late
Monday afternoon they sat on chairs atop a fake-grass mat outside
their 22-foot mobile home. She was sipping white wine and he was
working on a can of Coors.
</P>
<P>
"We're all here for the same common reason," Grant said.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday afternoon, after three days on the mountain forced them to
move from gourmet food to frozen fare, they had decided to leave.
They said they were satisfied after seeing two steam explosions.
</P>
<P>
But a neighbor on the mountain, Judy Ziese, 55, a "retired housewife"
from Port Angeles, Wash., said she would hold out for the big one,
sleeping in her white Ford Expedition, which she was calling her
"Ford Explosion."
</P>
<P>
Ziese's husband declined to join her on this trek more than 200 miles
from home, so she packed up almond butter, jam, sprouted-wheat bread,
string cheese and set out with her Chihuahua, Peekaboo Louise.
</P>
<P>
"I could live without a man, but I couldn't live without a dog," she
said.
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, it was the sun that Ziese could not live
without. She abandoned the mountain after heavy rains arrived Tuesday
night, and she joined many others who had apparently re-evaluated
their determination to wait for the next spectacle. By Wednesday
morning, with St. Helens veiled in clouds and word of the lull in the
rumblings spreading, the crowd on the mountain had thinned to only a
few stubborn optimists.
</P>
<P>
Brian Landry, 48, from Salem, Ore., said news that the alert level
had been lowered did not mean anything to him. "It might taper off
and then all of a sudden decide to uncork," he said.
</P>
<P>
Landry, a test-technician for a high-tech tool manufacturer, had
driven two hours to get to the mountain on Sunday with his wife. He
then drove her back home so she could work on Monday, turned around,
and returned alone. He has now been here for three days straight,
sleeping through Tuesday night's rain inside a blue tent and eating
hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
"I'd hate to leave and find something went on," he said.
