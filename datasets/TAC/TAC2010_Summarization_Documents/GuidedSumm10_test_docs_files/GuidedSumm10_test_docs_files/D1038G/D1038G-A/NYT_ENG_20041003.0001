BIGGER ERUPTION PREDICTED AT MOUNT ST. HELENS

<DATELINE>
CASTLE ROCK, Wash.
</DATELINE>

<P>
Scientists monitoring Mount St. Helens, which erupted Friday for the
first time in 18 years with a minor explosion, said on Saturday that
they were expecting a more powerful eruption within a day or so.
</P>
<P>
The government raised the advisory for volcanic activity to Level 3,
the equivalent of a "code red" and the highest stage in a system used
to indicate the likelihood of a volcanic eruption that could endanger
life or property.
</P>
<P>
The government scientists had earlier said they expected to see more
small to moderate explosions after a series of earthquakes culminated
in a plume of steam and ash on Friday, rising 10,000 feet into the
air but posing no threat to health or safety.
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday, the earthquakes intensified, and shortly after noon,
the volcano emitted a brief burst of steam, which was followed by a
continuous, low-frequency tremor that lasted 50 minutes, believed to
be caused by the movement of magma, or molten rock, underground.
</P>
<P>
That suddenly created a more serious situation at Mount St. Helens,
the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. But scientists said
they did not expect an eruption on the magnitude of the May 1980
explosion that killed 57 people and caused widespread destruction.
</P>
<P>
Officials on Saturday evacuated an observatory five miles from the
crater and warned that people with respiratory diseases could be
affected if large amounts of ash became airborne.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of excited tourists who had flocked to Mount St. Helens in
recent days were forced to move to a lookout point several miles
below, causing a deep traffic jam on the one winding road that leads
from this small town in southwestern Washington up to the mountain.
</P>
<P>
The 2,100 residents of this town and others near the mountain,
however, were not evacuated. Officials, including Interior Secretary
Gale A. Norton, who held a news conference Saturday afternoon in
nearby Vancouver, Wash., said their houses were far enough away -- 30
miles to the west -- to be safe.
</P>
<P>
"This is red alert," Norton said, adding, "Overall, we are very
fortunate that no one lives directly in the area that would be most
impacted."
</P>
<P>
C. Daniel Miller, a scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey, said he
expected an eruption "larger than what we saw on Friday, probably by
quite a bit."
</P>
<P>
The 50-minute tremor "is the kind of seismic signal that occurs not
when rock is breaking, but when magma is actually moving up in the
throat of the volcano," Miller said at a news conference Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
"That's the sort of thing that frankly sends a chill up the back of a
volcanologist," he said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said Saturday that they saw more signs of deformation at
the south side of the lava dome, a half-mile wide, 925-foot high
bulge at the center of the volcano's crater.
</P>
<P>
The crew aboard a helicopter taking measurements on Saturday reported
the smell of rotten eggs, probably hydrogen sulfide emanating from
magma. Until then, scientists had not detected significant amounts of
volcanic gases. Gas-rich magma is more likely to erupt explosively.
</P>
<P>
The greatest danger was expected to be potentially large ash plumes,
which could shoot tens of thousands of feet up. The ash could be
accompanied by lava flow and possibly blow much farther northwest,
depending on the weather, and cause health problems for anyone with
asthma or other respiratory diseases, said Dr. Thomas Pierson, a
geologist with the geological survey.
</P>
<P>
And if the mountain glacier melted as a result of an eruption, it
could create a "debris flow" cascading down the mountain, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The earthquakes recorded over the past week, subsiding briefly after
the Friday explosion, were the most intense seismic activity on the
mountain since before the massive May 1980 eruption, which killed 57
people and caused widespread destruction.
</P>
<P>
Before Friday, the mountain had been dormant for 18 years. Scientists
said they had initially expected any eruption to be fairly minor, but
were now saying it could be more serious.
</P>
<P>
Castle Rock residents, many of whom witnessed the 1980 explosion,
which dumped truckloads of ash on this town, seemed to be taking the
new development in stride and expressed little worry on Saturday,
saying nothing could compare to the 1980 event.
</P>
<P>
"I know it might sound like the strangest thing in the world," said
Laura Dodd, the owner of Lady Bug Antiques in downtown Castle Rock,
who observed scores of tourists passing through town Saturday on
their way to or from the mountain. "But the locals are not taking it
very seriously. "We're just watching," she said. "It's exciting, but
we're not really frightened or anxious."
</P>
<P>
Bobbie Stout, the cashier at North Fork Survivors, a novelty shop on
Route 504 about 25 miles west of the mountain, said she had seen cars
"rushing up the mountain" before they were evacuated Saturday
afternoon, and that there was an excitement in the air.
</P>
<P>
"I lived through the first one," Stout said, adding that she was
slightly concerned about the glacier melting but otherwise calm. "I'm
not all that nervous."
