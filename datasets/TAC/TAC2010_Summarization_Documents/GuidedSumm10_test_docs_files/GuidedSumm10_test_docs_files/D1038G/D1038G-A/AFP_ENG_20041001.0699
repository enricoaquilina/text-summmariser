Steam eruption shakes Mount St Helens

<P>
US volcano Mount St. Helens roared to life Friday, spewing a giant
plume of steam and ash into the sky and raising fears of a new larger
eruption.
</P>
<P>
After letting off steam from its lava cap in a spectacular natural
display, the rumblings stopped and the huge cloud quickly dispersed.
</P>
<P>
But the burst of activity sent scientists scrambling to establish
whether the volcano, which killed 57 people when it erupted
dramatically 24 years ago, was holding another more powerful eruption
in store.
</P>
<P>
US Geological Survey scientists said the eruption at 11:57am (1857
GMT) marked a "small explosion" following a week of intensifying
earthquakes in the area.
</P>
<P>
"This was small explosive eruption from the lava dome that lasted for
24 minutes and generated a plume that rose up to a height of just
under 10,000 feet (3,000 meters)," said USGS volcano and hydrology
expert John Major.
</P>
<P>
"The eruption was predominantly steam but containing a little bit of
ash," he said adding that there were no lava or mud flows from the
crater and that the alert level in the region had not been raised.
</P>
<P>
The steam cloud poured from the southern edge of a 300-meter tall
(1,000-foot) lava dome in the volcano's crater that has risen in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
An area of two-to-four hectares (five to 10 acres) on the lava cap
rose and fractured during the eruption, releasing glacial water and
the column of steam, Major said. The last explosion from the dome
took place in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The steam cloud drifted southwest from the mountain peak in southern
Washington state and aviation officials warned aircraft in the area
to avoid the plume, Federal Aviation Authority officials told AFP.
</P>
<P>
Seismic experts scrutinised the volcano from aircraft and from the
mountainside to determine whether further eruptions were expected
from the volcano that has been extremely active for more than 4,000
years.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to keep a very close eye on it," Major told journalists
in Seattle, adding that the level of earthquake activity in the area
would be a crucial indicator of what is to come.
</P>
<P>
"If the seismicity in the area does not ease off, it's a sign that
it's not over yet. If we do not see anything over the coming days,
then there is a good chance that that might be it," he said.
</P>
<P>
But another USGS expert Jeff Wynn warned that while the volcanic
activity had ceased for the moment, it could come roaring back at any
time.
</P>
<P>
"The history of this volcano suggests that this could be the opening
salvo of more eruptions," he said adding that the small 1986 eruption
was similar to the latest one.
</P>
<P>
Volcanic experts have been warning of a possible imminent eruption of
Mount St Helens for several days as seismic activity in the area
grew.
</P>
<P>
"This is exactly the eruption we predicted," the USGS's
