Tourists flock to St. Helens for look at rumbling volcano
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pam Morret and her husband, Lynn, missed the big eruption of Mount
St. Helens in 1980. They sure were not going to miss this one.
</P>
<P>
So they donned their leather jackets, chaps and bandanas, hopped on
their motorcycles, and began cruising up Highway 504 _ past a theater
that that airs the 1980 footage every 45 minutes, past trinket shops
hawking statues made of volcano bits, past a lodge that happily
warned travelers: "Watch your ash up there!"
</P>
<P>
When the Vancouver couple got to within five miles (eight kilometers)
of the Johnston Ridge Observatory on Friday, they pulled to the side
of the road and saw what they had been coming for: an ashen-white
cloud billowing from the volcano's crater.
</P>
<P>
"It was like a big burp," said Pam Morret, 49.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the predictive abilities of the U.S. Geological Survey, the
Morrets were not alone when they finally did make it to Johnston
Ridge, a barren shoulder of land which looks into the crater from
about five miles (eight kilometers) away. Hundreds of tourists
clogged the parking lot and visitor center, drawn by the rumblings
from the nation's most cantankerous mountain, but reassured that any
eruption would be far smaller than the one that killed 57 people more
than two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Some tourists _ like the Morrets _ smiled in giddy, guilt-free wonder
at the mountain's power.
</P>
<P>
"This one didn't involve anybody dying or any of that bad
destruction, so we could feel good about enjoying it," Lynn Morret
said.
</P>
<P>
Others were disappointed: They didn't head for the hills until they
saw Friday's eruption on television, and by the time they made it up
there, the cloud had cleared.
</P>
<P>
"I missed it by about 40 minutes. I am so disappointed," said Elva
Ahearn, 68, of Auburn. "But I am still excited to be here. I'm still
hoping I'll see something."
</P>
<P>
The eruption capped an exciting week at the mountain. Hundreds of
people visited every day, watching seismic needles chart bouncing
lines at the observatory and quietly urging the volcano to put on a
show _ just not too big a show.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a dynamic area," said Scott Hinderman, a ranger. "That's
alluring to a lot of folks. They can see the story of the 1980
eruption. It still looks like something happened here and this is
rekindling that whole wonder, that whole amazement at nature."
