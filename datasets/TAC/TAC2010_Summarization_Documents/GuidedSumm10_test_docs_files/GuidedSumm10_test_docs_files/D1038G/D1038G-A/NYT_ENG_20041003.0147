INFORMED AND AWAITING A ST. HELENS ERUPTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
TOUTLE, Wash.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lots of people here remember well how racked with fear they were in
the weeks and days leading up to the 1980 eruption of Mount St.
Helens, the volcano that rained utter havoc from 30 miles away on
this tiny town.
</P>
<P>
But 24 years later, as scientists warn of a new, imminent eruption,
the fear has not returned. For one, scientists do not believe the
eruption will be nearly as powerful. But also, residents now know the
drill, the evacuation routes and the ways to protect themselves and
their property from heavy ash fall.Residents are slightly nervous but
mostly aggravated at all the local traffic, caused by the thousands
of tourists, reporters and entrepreneurs headed through town over the
last few days on their way to a lookout point on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, once scientists knew that powerful earthquakes were stirring
Mount St. Helens, few people were visiting the mountain. Now, a spot
at the Castle Lake Lookout parking lot is a rare commodity. And far
from running away, people like Denise Horton, who lives 130 miles
away in Sandy, Ore., are traveling hours to get here, bursting with
anticipation for the eruption.
</P>
<P>
"It's like waiting for a parade that's late," said Horton, who opened
a hot dog stand on the mountain, selling mostly to reporters who were
among the dozens camped out at the lookout point. "It's like waiting
for a baby."
</P>
<P>
The fact that they are here is testament to the vast forecasting
gains of scientists, who are armed with new technology and skills
honed from the 1980 eruption, which killed 57 people, obliterated 200
houses and spawned worldwide interest in the study of volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
Seismometers pinpoint the tiny earthquakes that have been shaking
Mount St. Helens for the past week and a half. Global positioning
system sensors detect outward bulges as slight as a fraction of an
inch. Instruments aboard a helicopter sniff out gases seeping out of
the rocks below and identify hot spots.
</P>
<P>
"There's really been a revolution," said Dr. William E. Scott of the
U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver,
Wash., which is monitoring the mountain and holding twice-daily news
conferences.
</P>
<P>
But for all their high-tech gadgetry, scientists still do not have a
direct way to answer the questions they most want to answer: Where is
the molten rock beneath the volcano? And where is it going?
</P>
<P>
"We don't know where it is," said William Steele, a seismologist at
the University of Washington.
</P>
<P>
The expectation is that magma -- underground molten rock -- will
reach the surface and spill out as lava and that there will be more
eruptions like the small one that happened Friday, or larger.
</P>
<P>
"Something could happen at any time, basically," Scott said at a news
conference on Sunday afternoon. Or, he said, "It may stall out and we
may never see it."
</P>
<P>
That would disappoint Kathy Teas, who was living nearby in 1980 and
was evacuated from her home. Teas later moved to Oregon, but on
Sunday she was back, having spent the previous night at a campsite on
the mountain, eager to see an eruption.
</P>
<P>
"Here I am at 52 and I'm back here again," she said. "To have the
opportunity to witness this is something I can't pass up."
</P>
<P>
From the pattern of seismic shakings before and after the 1980
eruption, seismologists laboriously constructed a fuzzy picture of
the volcano's workings, the equivalent of a prenatal sonogram. It
indicated a deep magma chamber about four miles underground and a
shallower one perhaps a mile below the crater.
</P>
<P>
But unlike hurricanes, which allow meteorologists to make detailed
observations by airplanes and satellites, a volcano eruption develops
mostly out of sight, hundreds to thousands of feet underground.
</P>
<P>
"We can't take measurements in the interior," said Dr. Anthony Qamar,
a professor of geophysics at the University of Washington.
Information like the volcano's internal temperatures and pressures
can only be guessed at.
</P>
<P>
Instruments on or hovering above the surface offer only indirect
suggestions of what is happening. Volcanologists must sift through
competing plausible explanations for what they observe and what they
do not.
</P>
<P>
Thus, when a new event occurs, like the continuous, 50-minute,
low-frequency tremor on Saturday, the scientists sometimes need to
quickly revise their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
The swarms of earthquakes, a few a minute, have been interpreted as
the breaking of rocks by the buildup of pressure. The tremor --
accompanied by a cessation in the earthquakes -- suggested that the
magma had broken through and was rising smoothlyleading scientists to
suspect an eruption might be imminent.
</P>
<P>
After the tremor ended, the earthquakes resumed. At 3 a.m. Sunday, a
second tremor occurred, this time lasting 25 minutes. Again, the
seismic activity died down, then picked up. Through the day on
Sunday, the intensity of the earthquakes diminished somewhat. "The
larger earthquakes have dropped off," Qamar said.
</P>
<P>
That could mean the pressure had lessened, and the volcano was
quieting down. Or it could mean that the magma had broken through the
rock blockage and was now pushing its way toward the surface. Or it
could just be a lull.
</P>
<P>
"We're not interpreting much about that decrease," Scott said.
</P>
<P>
What has been unusual about the current episode is that all of the
earthquakes have been shallow, within half a mile or so of the
surface. That leaves scientists wondering whether magma is rising
from the deep chamber or whether the magma driving the tremors and
eruptions is left over from six years ago. Then, as now, a swarm of
earthquakes shook the area, and scientists believe that magma rose
upward beneath the crater, although nothing broke through as an
eruption.
</P>
<P>
Whether the magma is new or old is important, because that could
determine whether the eruptions will explosively shoot clouds of ash
that spread over a large area or, less catastrophically, just push
out lava.
</P>
<P>
"The analogy is the old Coke can that you shake up and open," Scott
said. "If you shake it a whole lot and pop it open, you're going to
get a lot of frothing and it's going to be an explosive event. But if
you pour it in a glass and let the gas come out and then you try to
shake the glass, you can't get as much fizz."
</P>
<P>
Once scientists realized this weekend that an eruption could be
imminent, spectators were ordered to leave an observatory five miles
from the crater. But lookout points farther away were not considered
to be in danger.
</P>
<P>
Here in Toutle (pronounced TOOT-el), a town of 700 that is the
closest to the mountain, many residents said that while they were not
panicking, they were concerned about an eruption causing a mudflow
into the three nearby rivers, which were flooded and full of floating
debris in 1980.
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is you better learn to respect it," Karen Meyers, 43,
who lives in Toutle and witnessed the 1980 eruption. "I mean, last
time, their worst-case scenario didn't even come close to what
happened here. Mother Nature is going to win and you'll pay hell
trying to predict it."
