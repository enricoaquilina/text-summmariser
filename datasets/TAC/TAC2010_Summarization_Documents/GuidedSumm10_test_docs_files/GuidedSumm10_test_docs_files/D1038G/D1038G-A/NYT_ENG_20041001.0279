A BURP THAT ROSE 10,000 FEET IN SKY OVER WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>

Just before noon on Friday, seismometers at the Cascades Volcano
Observatory in Vancouver, Wash., wiggled in a familiar pattern. Soon
afterward came confirmation that Mount St. Helens had erupted for the
first time since 1986.
</P>
<P>
After the mountain's cataclysmic explosion in 1980, the volcano
erupted more modestly an additional 21 times, each usually
accompanied by a characteristic seismic signal.
</P>
<P>
"Events like this were very common between 1981 and 1985, so this is
not unusual or extraordinary by any means," Dr. Jon J. Major, a
geologist at the observatory, said at a news conference on Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Mount St. Helens is one of several large volcanoes in Washington,
Oregon and California that are part of the tectonically active Ring
of Fire around the Pacific Ocean. The volcanoes can lie dormant for
centuries, then revive, sometimes catastrophically. Before 1980,
Mount St. Helens had last erupted in 1857.
</P>
<P>
The pulsations of steam and dust on Friday, described by Major as "a
relatively small burp," sent a gray-white plume nearly 10,000 feet
into the air. After the eruption, small earthquakes that had been
rumbling around the volcano for the last week stopped, suggesting
that pressures that had been building up had been relieved for now.
Seismic activity resumed later in the afternoon, Major said, but at a
quieter level.
</P>
<P>
"This event is pretty much what we expected and anticipated over the
last several days, a relatively small explosion from the lava dome,"
Major said. Scientists cannot say whether the volcano will now calm
down or whether more eruptions will occur.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the eruption, scientists aboard a helicopter were
taking measurements using a thermal imager, a device that measures
heat from a distance. The instrument's readings showed that the site
of the eruption was not particularly hot, indicating that the
eruption of steam and ash had originated from at least several
hundred feet underground.
</P>
<P>
The flow of water out of the crater increased slightly, Major said,
but there was no danger of floods or mudslides. Scientists said they
saw no signs that would lead them to worry that a larger, dangerous
eruption was imminent.
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication magma has worked its way up to the surface,"
Major said.
</P>
<P>
The belch on Friday might have instead been the denouement of some
underground indigestion from six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Then, as in the last week, a swarm of small quakes rumbled around the
dome, a bulge 925 feet high and a half-mile wide at the center of the
crater, but then the ground quieted without a new eruption. Analyzing
the patterns of shaking, scientists said fresh magma, molten rock,
had risen from deep below to the base of the dome, but had not broken
through to the surface.
</P>
<P>
Major said the working hypothesis was that the eruption on Friday was
somehow related to the 1998 events. "Exactly how it is related is
still a matter of speculation," he said.
