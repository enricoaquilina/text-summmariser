Plume of Steam, Ash Erupts From Mount St. Helens

<P>
After a week of steadily increasing seismic rumbling,
Mount St. Helens on Friday burped a tall column of steam and ash that
officials said was probably not a precursor to a large sustained
eruption from the most active volcano on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
The volcano is being closely monitored in part because of its
cataclysmic explosion in 1980. The explosion killed 57 people,
triggered the largest landslide in recorded history and blew 520
million tons of ash eastward across the United States.
</P>
<P>
The plume from Friday's 24-minute noontime eruption rose 10,000
feet before drifting away in light winds on a spectacularly clear
autumn day. No injuries or damage to property were reported.
</P>
<P>
When the eruption ended, government monitoring instruments showed a
sharp decrease in the seismic activity that in recent days had been
registering as many as four small earthquakes per minute on the
mountain, located in a sparsely populated area of southwest
Washington.
</P>
<P>
``This was a relatively small eruption,'' said John Major, a
hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He said USGS observers
near the volcano reported that no molten rock flowed from the point in
the mountain's lava dome where the steam vented.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Major said the eruption appeared to
have punched a hole about 100 feet in diameter in the glacial ice that
covers part of the mountain's horseshoe-shaped dome. He said there was
a small increase in melting ice and snow off the volcano but no
reported mudflows, or lahars, which historically have been damaging
consequences of volcanic eruptions in the Cascade Range.
</P>
<P>
After the 1980 eruption, a lahar traveled 50 miles from Mount St.
Helens, ripping out bridges and destroying homes.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, Friday's eruption was a ``hiccup,'' USGS geologist
Tom Pierson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
``This is exactly the kind of event we have been talking about and
anticipating,'' Major said. He noted there is no evidence that a major
flow of gas-rich molten rock, which could trigger a sustained
eruption, has ascended from its known location seven miles underground
to the top of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
Absent such a flow of molten rock, USGS scientists have said it is
unlikely that recent increases in seismic activity on Mount St. Helens
will result in a significant eruption that could endanger people or
property outside the immediate vicinity.
</P>
<P>
Major compared Friday's ``small explosive eruption'' to the
activity that came to be regarded as normal in the six years after the
1980 eruption.
</P>
<P>
In those years after Mount St. Helens literally blew its head off,
more than a dozen lava eruptions built a rock dome inside the
mountain's crater. That dome is now partially covered by a glacier,
which is growing because the edges of the mountain crater shades snow
and ice from summertime sun.
</P>
<P>
USGS scientists will keep a close eye on their instruments, Major
said, and if seismic activity levels off for several consecutive days
they may be able to conclude that the threat of more eruptions has
passed.
