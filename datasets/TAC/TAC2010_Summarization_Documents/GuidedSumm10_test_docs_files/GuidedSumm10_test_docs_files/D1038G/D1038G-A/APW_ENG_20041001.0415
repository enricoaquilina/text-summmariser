Mount St. Helens erupts, but nothing like 1980 disaster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mount St. Helens, the volcano that blew its top with cataclysmic
force in 1980, erupted for the first time in 18 years Friday,
belching a huge column of white steam and ash after days of
rumblings.
</P>
<P>
"This is exactly the kind of event we've been predicting," said U.S.
Geological Survey scientist Cynthia Gardner.
</P>
<P>
Still, the eruption was nowhere near what happened 24 years ago, when
57 people were killed and towns 250 miles (402 kilometers) away were
coated with ash.
</P>
<P>
About 20 minutes after Friday's eruption, the mountain calmed and the
plume began to dissipate.
</P>
<P>
The eruption was so short-lived that the ash appeared to pose no
threat to anyone. No evacuations were ordered, and there was no sign
of any lava pouring from the volcano.
</P>
<P>
Few people live near the mountain, about 100 miles south of Seattle.
The closest structure is the Johnston Ridge Observatory, about five
miles from the crater.
</P>
<P>
The eruption occurred at 12:03 p.m., when there was a small
explosion, followed by the steam and ash cloud that rose from the
southern edge of a 1,000-foot (305-meter)-tall lava dome in the
volcano's crater. Steam frequently rises from the crater, but the
8,364-foot (2,549-meter) peak had not erupted since 1986.
</P>
<P>
For the past week, scientists have detected thousands of earthquakes
of increasing strength _ as high as magnitude 3.3 _ suggesting
another eruption was on the way.
</P>
<P>
The earthquakes quit after the eruption, said University of
Washington seismologist Tony Qamar.
</P>
<P>
"That makes us think this is the end of the eruption," Qamar said.
"All this buildup was leading to that relatively small eruption."
</P>
<P>
But USGS seismologist Bob Norris said magma could be moving
underground and he would not be surprised to see more explosions in
the next days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The monitoring will definitely continue on a very intense scale
until we can determine that the thing has really gone back to sleep,"
said Tom Pierson, a USGS geologist.
</P>
<P>
Mike Fergus, a spokesman with the Federal Aviation Administration in
Seattle, said the plume had reached 16,000 feet in altitude, but did
not know whether any planes would need to be rerouted.
