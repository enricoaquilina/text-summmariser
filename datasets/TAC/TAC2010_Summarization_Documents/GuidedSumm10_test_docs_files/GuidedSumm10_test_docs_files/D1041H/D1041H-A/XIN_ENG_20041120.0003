More than half of world coral reefs threatened: conservators

More than 58 percent of world coral reefs have been threatened by
human pressure and weather change, said an press release issued on
Saturday by a world conservation meeting held here.
</P>
<P>
"With so many reefs endangered, efforts to save corals could be
overlooked," Carl Gustaf Lundin, Head of the World Conservation Union
(IUCN) Global Marine Program was quoted by the press release as
saying.
</P>
<P>
IUCN on Friday launched a report named "2004 Status of Coral Reefs of
the World" at the 3rd World Conservation Conference, which is being
held in Bangkok from Nov. 17 to Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
The report warned that the destruction of reefs would have a major
impact on the lives of more than one billion people.
</P>
<P>
"Reefs provide seafood for one billion people in Asia alone, many of
them from poor communities. Reef-based activities, principally
fishing and tourism, provide economic livelihoods for millions of
others," said the IUCN press release.
</P>
<P>
Besides human impact, coral reefs are also threatened by global
weather change.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, an El Nino global coral bleaching event caused deaths of
many coral reefs, a disaster occurring only once in 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
However, "the extreme events of 1998 will become more common in the
next 50 years," with increasing sea surface temperatures and other
factors.
</P>
<P>
"Massive global bleaching mortality will not be a 1/1000 year event
in the future, but a regular event," warned the release.
</P>
<P>
It noted that coral on many Caribbean reefs have declined by up to 80
percent, and many reefs do not resemble the reefs of 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In south Asia, over 60 percent of the reefs were killed during the
1998 mass bleaching, and today almost half of the reefs remain dead.
</P>
<P>
Even in the higher diversity areas of Southeast Asia and the Indian
Ocean, there are few encouraging signs for reefs for increasing human
pressures.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of its one-week meeting in Bangkok, IUCN declared a
red list of more than 15,000 species facing extinction if no
effective conservation measures are taken.
