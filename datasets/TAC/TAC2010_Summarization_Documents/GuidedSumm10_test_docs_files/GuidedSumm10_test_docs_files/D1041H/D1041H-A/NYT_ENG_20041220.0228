AS THE SEAS WARM, ALGAE HELP SOME CORAL STAND UP TO THE HEAT

For some time, scientists have predicted that the world's coral reefs
will be among the first ecosystems to suffer devastating damage from
global warming. Some reefs, however, are proving surprisingly
resilient, researchers say, not because of qualities of the corals,
but because of heat-tolerant algae that live with them.
</P>
<P>
It may even be possible that heat-related episodes of coral
bleaching, which had been viewed as ominous previews of mass coral
death to come, could allow these robust algae to spread, leaving
corals better able to survive in a warmer world.
</P>
<P>
The scientists say this strength in the face of warming will not be
enough to save the world's coral reefs, which are threatened by
pollution, overfishing, tourism and other human activities. But if
the findings hold up, "they essentially buy us time" to address those
issues, said Andrew C. Baker of the Marine Program of the Wildlife
Conservation Society, who led the new work.
</P>
<P>
Algae and corals live in a symbiotic relationship. Coral polyps
absorb and shelter the algae, and as the algae photosynthesize they
produce sugars that the corals use for energy. But this relationship
can falter when ocean water warms, Baker said. "Basically, algae
cells are lost from the coral host," he said. "We don't know if it's
the algae leaving a sick coral colony or a coral ejecting a defunct
algae. I suspect it's a bit of both."
</P>
<P>
The result is coral bereft of much of its power supply. The living
polyps that give coral reefs their color wither, usually leaving
lifeless white skeleton reefs of calcium carbonate. It is as if the
reefs have been bleached.
</P>
<P>
But the new research, led by Baker, suggests that heat-tolerant algae
may move in to replace strains lost in bleaching events. If so, he
said, "some of the doom and gloom might not be as bad as had been
suggested."
</P>
<P>
The findings are "definitely good news," said Nancy Knowlton, an
expert on corals who directs the Center for Marine Biodiversity and
Conservation of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the
University of California, San Diego.
</P>
<P>
Baker and his colleagues studied corals affected by El Nino-Southern
Oscillation events, natural disruptions of ocean currents that occur
periodically and that can cause ocean temperatures to rise in one
area or another. In particular, they studied what happened to corals
in relatively shallow waters off the Pacific coast of Panama, and in
the Indian Ocean off Kenya and Mauritius. All the corals they studied
were colonized by Symbiodinium algae, a diverse genus whose various
species look alike but react differently to heat.
</P>
<P>
Using DNA analysis, they compared the algae populations at those
three sites with algae strains in coral reefs in the Persian Gulf,
which are relatively tolerant of heat, and with other corals in the
Red Sea, where temperatures do not normally rise as high and where
algae strains are less heat-tolerant.
</P>
<P>
The scientists found that reefs in Panama and Kenya, which had
experienced unusually high water temperatures, had high proportions
of a heat-tolerant strain called symbiont D. By contrast, reefs off
Mauritius, where waters remained cooler, had fewer symbiont D algae.
They resembled the reefs of the Red Sea, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
Baker said these findings, reported in the journal Nature in August,
suggested that when corals lost algae in a bleaching event,
heat-tolerant algae could move in to replace them. Symbiont D "is
becoming more common on reefs that are experiencing bleaching
events," Baker said. He said the findings were the first "real-world
evidence" that corals might adapt to warming.
</P>
<P>
But this kind of adaptation may not be enough "to let corals off the
hook," as Knowlton of the Scripps Institution put it in an interview.
</P>
<P>
For example, according to a report issued this month by the Global
Coral Reef Monitoring Network, scientists do not know exactly what
conditions must exist for corals to acquire new strains of algae.
They do not even know if changes occur when corals recruit different
algae from the water around them, or if something somehow changes the
ratio of algae strains growing within them.
</P>
<P>
Also, Knowlton said, it is not yet known whether corals colonized
with new varieties of algae will grow as well as they once did with
other strains. For example, she said, it could be that heat-tolerant
algae strains devote more of their energy to reproducing and less to
providing sustenance to their coral hosts. And though symbiont D is
widespread among the world's corals, Knowlton said, scientists do not
know whether all of them can support the strain.
</P>
<P>
Answers to those questions await more research, and she said the
study of corals was still developing. "If it were birds it would be
18th- or 19th-century science -- who's living with whom, where," she
said.
</P>
<P>
History suggests that the coral bleaching and mortality associated
with the severe El Nino phenomenon of 1997-98 was a thousand-year
event, according to the monitoring network's coral report. That
means, in theory, that there is only a 1-in-1,000 chance that similar
effects would be seen in a given year. But, the report says, evidence
strongly suggests that global warming will turn severe bleaching into
"a regular event" by the middle of the century. So evidence of coral
recovery since 1998 is encouraging, the report says.
</P>
<P>
"Some people would argue that global climate change is their biggest
long-term threat," Knowlton said, "and it's the one we have the least
ability to do anything about. So good news on the global warming
front is very welcome."
</P>
<P>
About half the reefs that were left badly damaged after the 1997-98
El Nino event have bounced back, Baker said. "So even from a major
event there can be recovery," he said, if overfishing, habitat
destruction and other threats are mitigated. "But there can't be
recovery if we triple- and quadruple-whammy these reefs."
