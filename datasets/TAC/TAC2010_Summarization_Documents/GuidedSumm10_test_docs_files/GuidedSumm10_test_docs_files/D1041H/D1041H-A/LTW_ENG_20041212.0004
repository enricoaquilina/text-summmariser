Twenty percent of the world's coral reefs ``have been effectively
destroyed and show no immediate prospect of recovery.'' An additional
24 percent ``are under imminent risk of collapse through human
pressures,'' and an additional 26 percent ``are under a longer term
threat of collapse.'' These are only some of the conclusions of an
exhaustive new report by 240 scientists in 98 countries, working under
the auspices of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network. Coral reefs,
in addition to being breathtakingly beautiful, are among the cradles
of life on Earth -- hotbeds of biodiversity critical to sustaining
oceanic health. But a combination of global warming, pollution,
overfishing, diseases and other factors is ravaging reefs worldwide.
While Australian and Pacific reefs remain relatively healthy, the
report documents devastating declines elsewhere, including the
Caribbean region, where coral cover on many reefs has declined by up
to 80 percent. If something isn't done soon, it will be too late for
many reefs to recover.

The dire threat to the world's -- and America's -- oceans is hardly a
surprise, and it isn't limited to coral reefs either. Two major task
forces have recently documented the grave ecological conditions of
America's coastal waters. The studies basically show the same thing:
People are using the oceans in a fashion that can't be sustained, and,
absent serious change across a range of human behaviors, the oceans
will die off. Yet despite the widespread agreement on the nature and
severity of the problem, action has been slow.

Along with the related issue of climate change, this is the
preeminent environmental issue of our time. President Bush should make
it a priority of his second term. An opportunity to begin doing so is
coming; the administration by law has to respond by Dec. 20 to the
recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, which Congress
created in 2000 to examine America's policy toward its coastal waters.
So far, there is no indication the administration is contemplating the
needed dramatic shifts in policy. But the oceans -- and their precious
corals -- cannot afford delay.
