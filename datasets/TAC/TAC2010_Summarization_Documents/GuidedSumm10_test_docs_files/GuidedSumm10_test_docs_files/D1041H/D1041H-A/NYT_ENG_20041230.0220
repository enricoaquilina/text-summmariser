UN TO ASSESS DAMAGE TO CORAL REEFS, FORESTS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The United Nations Thursday set aside $1 million to assess
environmental damage caused by this week's devastating tsunami, as
reports of destroyed coral reefs and uprooted mangrove forests began
trickling in.
</P>
<P>
While attention is clearly focused on the rising human toll of the
tragedy, some dive operators and marine biologists are reporting that
from Sri Lanka to Thailand corals are suffocating under layers of
mud, heaps of rotten fish, are clogging beachfronts, and rare turtle
nesting sites have been washed out to sea.
</P>
<P>
"There is a huge natural cost, but what it is is still to be
determined," said Lynne Hale, director of the global marine
initiative for the Nature Conservancy, who worked in Thailand's
Phuket Island and Sri Lanka for many years. Both areas were hard hit
by the tsunami.
</P>
<P>
Now based in Rhode Island, Hale said the tsunami may have caused
lasting environmental damage that may take decades or longer to
recover from. "This is a massive, massive erosion event," she said.
</P>
<P>
A UN task force based in Geneva will assess two things: environmental
damage that threatens human health, and the toll on the ecological
resources -- many of which support tourism and the fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Ocean region, with its aqua, shallow seas, hosts some of
the most beloved and famous coral reefs in the world that support
scores of fish species found nowhere else. Mangroves are critical
nurseries for many of these fish. And the beaches of Sri Lanka, the
Andaman and Nicobar islands, and other countries hit by the tsunami
host prime nesting spots for some of the world's rarest sea turtles,
such as leatherbacks that return to the same spot year after year to
lay eggs.
</P>
<P>
Scientists Thursday said they expect marine life from shore to about
a mile out to have suffered the worst damage. However, some
biologists speculated that marine mammals such as whales and dolphins
swimming near shore when the tsunami struck may have sensed the
strange seas and headed for deeper waters, where the giant waves were
barely noticeable. Land animals may have had the same "sixth sense"
to move to safety: Wildlife officials in Sri Lanka's Yala National
Park said they have not seen evidence that many animals died, despite
the preserve's closeness to the ocean.
</P>
<P>
Scientists don't have comprehensive historical data about marine
damage that tsunamis can cause, especially one of this magnitude.
They do know that in 1883, when the Krakatoa volcano exploded and
sent a giant tsunami washing over Indonesia, coral heads that weighed
hundreds of tons were tossed hundreds of feet inland.
</P>
<P>
And in 1964, when a tsunami hit Alaska, news reports noted that baby
salmon were killed, although it's unclear how many.
</P>
<P>
This week, dive operators and researchers began sending e-mails to
the WorldFish Center in Malaysia, an international fisheries research
center, painting an early bleak picture of the region's treasured
coastal waters. On Phuket Island, one popular beach was piled with
dead staghorn coral, starfish, gulper eels, sea cucumbers, and sea
grasses.
</P>
<P>
In the Maldives, dive operator Norbert Schmidt said the eastern part
of the island was hit the worst, with dead coral and sand covering
the runway at Hulule International Airport. In Sri Lanka and
Thailand, coral damage is reported to be severe, and trees have
crashed down onto reefs, ripping many of the corals, some hundreds of
years old, apart.
</P>
<P>
"Many fish washed ashore, trees that were knocked down (smashed) into
the reefs," Michiru Main, a researcher who was conducting a reef
survey at Mu Ko Surin, a popular dive spot in Thailand, when the
tsunami struck, said in an e-mail. "I can definitely say there is
damage in the area."
</P>
<P>
Already stressed from fishing and tourism, many of the reefs may be
covered in mud, which can block sunlight that fish and other
organisms below them need. Meanwhile, corals, which only grow a
fraction of an inch each year, may be excreting mucus as a defensive
mechanism against the mud -- "expensive in terms of energy (that)
weakens the coral," e-mailed Marco Noordeloos of the WorldFish
Center. Noordeloos said fish populations have probably been damaged,
too, although it's far too early to get a complete picture.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists this week said human activity in the coastal zone
contributed to the immense damage on shore -- such as building
tourist hotels too close to the water and tearing out mangrove
forests to put in shrimp aquaculture farms throughout Asia. But
others say that while the lack of mangrove forests probably
exacerbated the destruction, it's unlikely that they would have
slowed the tsunami's enormous volume of water.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe in East Africa where the waves weren't as high, but I'm not
sure when you get a 40-foot wave a mangrove would have made a huge
difference," said Susi Moser, research scientist for the National
Center for Atmospheric Research.
