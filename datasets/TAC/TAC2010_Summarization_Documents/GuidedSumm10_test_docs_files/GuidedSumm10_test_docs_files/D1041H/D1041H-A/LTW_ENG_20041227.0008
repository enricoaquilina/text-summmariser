Storms Scoured Algae Off Reefs

Researchers at Florida's Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution
have discovered that this year's rash of hurricanes scoured damaging
seaweed, known scientifically as macroalgae, from coral reefs off the
Florida coast, though they warned it is likely to come back.

<P>
Farther south, scientists found that serious concentrations of a
blue-green algae known as cyanobacterium are killing corals and other
reef organisms.

``This is uncharted territory,'' said Harbor Branch marine
ecologist Brian Lapointe. ``No one has ever had the chance to study
the impacts of natural phenomena like hurricanes on reefs under siege
from these harmful algae blooms that we believe are triggered by
humans.''
</P>
<P>
Before the hurricanes struck, the scientists, funded by the
Environmental Protection Agency and the state of Florida, began
examining reefs stretching about 130 miles from Fort Pierce to north
of Miami. The scientists were looking for evidence that the algae
blooms are caused by human-generated runoff in the waterways,
including sewage and agricultural waste.

<P>
The group suspended its activity for two months while hurricanes
Frances and Jeanne pounded the region; when they returned, they found
that reefs in northern Palm Beach County had been scoured clean of
macroalgae such as seaweed.
</P>
<P>
But the hurricanes did not end the problem. ``This is a break, not
a solution for the reefs,'' Lapointe said. ``Unless we can get a clear
understanding of what drives these blooms and control the culprits,
it's going to be more of the same, and we'll risk losing this
incredible ecological and economic resource.''
