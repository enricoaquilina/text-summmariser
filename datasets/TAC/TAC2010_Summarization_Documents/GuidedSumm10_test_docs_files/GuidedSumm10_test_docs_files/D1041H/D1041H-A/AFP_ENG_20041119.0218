More than 58 percent of the world's coral reefs are endangered
because of pollution, the over-harvesting of reef fish and other
human factors, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Once again, human impacts are to blame for the depletion of reefs,"
the union said in a statement, adding that climate change and the
encroachment of introduced species such as starfish were also major
factors.
</P>
<P>
The conservation union -- which produces a "red list" of the world's
most endangered species -- also warned the destruction of reefs would
have a major impact on the lives of more than one billion people.

"Reefs provide seafood for one billiocautioned.

<P>
"As long as poverty, population growth and lack of alternative
livelihoods keep people dependent on already depleted reef resources,
the coral reefs of South Asia will continue to degrade," the union's
South Asia marine coordinator, Jerker Tamelander, said.
</P>
<P>
The union made the warning during its congress in Bangkok, which
brings together scientists and experts from 181 countries to debate
the escalating extinction crisis and form a conservation blueprint
for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
The IUCN plans to release a detailed report on the state of the
world's coral reefs next month.
