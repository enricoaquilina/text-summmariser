Coral reef damage rising worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only about 30 percent of the world's coral reefs are healthy, down
from 41 percent two years ago, according to a study released Monday
that lists global warming as the top threat.
</P>
<P>
The study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have
been destroyed. Another half are damaged but could be saved, it said.
</P>
<P>
Coral reefs are among the oldest and most diverse forms of life. They
provide food and shelter to fish and protect shores from erosion.
</P>
<P>
While covering less than 1 percent of the earth's surface, they help
drive the food chains and economies of many on the planet, with $375
billion (euro279 billion) in economic benefits globally, according to
the study by 240 scientists in 96 countries.
</P>
<P>
After global warming _ blamed for higher water temperatures and
carbon dioxide concentrations _ threats to the reefs include coral
disease, overfishing, coastal development and pollution runoff from
land-based sources.
</P>

"Reefs need our help, but they're not going to go extinct," said
Clive Wilkinson, the study's lead author and coordinator of the
Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network. Still, he said, it's crucial to
"raise the level of political will" to help reefs around the world.
</P>
<P>
"We know they're degrading fast, we know what the problems are, we
know how to fix them," Wilkinson said at news conference by the
Swiss-based World Worldlife Fund. "We've just got to do it."
</P>
<P>
Destruction or threats to 70 percent of the coral reefs represent a
sharp rise from 59 percent in the last study in 2002.
</P>
<P>
About 65 percent of the Persian Gulf's reefs have been destroyed, the
report said. Next in terms of damage are reefs off South and
Southeast Asia, where 45 percent and 38 percent, respectively, have
been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Retired Navy Vice Admiral Conrad Lautenbacher, a Commerce Department
undersecretary who heads the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, called reefs a global issue.
</P>
<P>
"It is not just a nice thing from an environmental perspective,"
Lautenbacher said. "It is essential to life on earth."
</P>
<P>
John Turner, assistant secretary of state for oceans and
international environmental and scientific affairs, called the report
"a wake-up call" and said it would be circulated to U.S. diplomats
overseas.
</P>
<P>
A more positive development is the recovery of about two-fifths of
the reefs seriously damaged by an unprecedented coral "bleaching"
from unusually warm waters in 1998. About 16 percent of global reefs
had been damaged by the bleaching.
</P>
<P>
Most of the reefs that have recovered are in the Indian Ocean, are
part of the Great Barrier Reef off Australia's coast or are in the
western Pacific, particularly around Palau. Australia this year put
as much as a third of both its Great Barrier Reef and Ningaloo Reef
marine park off limits to fishing.
</P>
<P>
The Caribbean has lost 80 to 98 percent of its elkhorn and staghorn
coral, two of the region's most common species, the scientists said,
suggesting the United States should look at listing them as
endangered species. A petition from an environmental group, the
Center for Biological Diversity, to do that is being considered by
the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
The administration's efforts so far to protect coral reefs include
improving monitoring and satellite surveillance, agreeing to
Geneva-based treaty restrictions on international trade in coral
reefs and passing out $10 million (euro7.4 million) in grants,
Lautenbacher said.
</P>
<P>
The administration is also considering creating a national marine
sanctuary and banning commercial fishing in the Northwestern Hawaiian
Islands to protect the chain's delicate reefs. A decision is expected
by the end of 2005, Lautenbacher said.
