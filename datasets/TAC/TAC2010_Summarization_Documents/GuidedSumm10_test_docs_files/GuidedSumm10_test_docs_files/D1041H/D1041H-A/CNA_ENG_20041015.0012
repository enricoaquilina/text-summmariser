Discarded utility poles were
submerged in waters off Nanliao Port in the northern Taiwan county of
Hsinchu Friday to create artificial reefs as part of the government's
fishery resources conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
The reefs were constructed under a long-term cooperative program
between the Council of Agriculture's (COA's) Fishery Administration
and state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower).
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades, Taiwan has created a large number of
artificial reefs made from discarded utility poles, decommissioned
naval vessels and discarded tires at 100-plus designated areas along
the coastline to enhance fishery resources.
</P>
<P>
COA officials said the artificial reefs not only function to
prevent the deterioration of fishing grounds but also help increase
fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
"The structures provide a foundation that is colonized by coral
polyps and in time becomes thickly encrusted with living coral,
providing an ecosystem in which marine life can thrive, " a COA
official said.
</P>
<P>
With underground electrical wiring becoming a general trend in
recent years, Taipower has donated many waste cement utility poles
for the creation of more than 10,000 artificial reefs in 79 coastal
regions, including Taoyuan County's Yungan, Hsinchun County's
Nanliao, Taichung County's Wuchi, Changhua County's Wangkung and
Hualien County's Yenliao, for conservation of fishery resources and
other marine life.
</P>
<P>
In addition to enhancing fishery resources, the artificial reef
areas have also become points of interest and create new businesses
in such areas as deep-sea diving, leisure fishing and recreational
scuba diving.
