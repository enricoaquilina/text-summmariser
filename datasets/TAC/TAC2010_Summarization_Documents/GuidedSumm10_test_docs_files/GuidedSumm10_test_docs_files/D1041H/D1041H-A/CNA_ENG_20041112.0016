Members of the Taiwanese Coral Reef Society
environmental group appealed yet again Friday to government agencies
not to let the "Amorgos" pollution case go any further and see to it
that the undersea wreckage is removed at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
Wreckage of the Amorgos, a Greek freighter that ran aground and
sank off the coast of Kenting at the southernmost tip of Taiwan Jan.
14, 2001, is now "a slaughter hell" for coral in an area of Lungkeng
off Kenting, said Cheng Ming-hsiu, Society chairman and a researcher
with Academia Sinica's Institute of Zoology.
</P>
<P>
Since the freighter's sinking, its wreckage has continued to
impair the growth of coral because of the sharp metal edges of the
wreck, turning the area into a coral graveyard, Cheng claimed.
</P>
<P>
He added that after a series of observations, it has been found
that in a 2 km by 500 meter coral reef area near Lungkeng, Kenting,
coral coverage rate has continued to drop.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to previous speculation that the freighter's wreckage
could become an undersea artificial fishery reef, he said, the ship
has disintegrated in the strong currents and its debris has continued
to spread, posing increasing threats to the coral.
</P>
<P>
The harmful debris will not disappear by itself and it cannot be
"digested" by the sea, Cheng argued, adding that the only option is
to have it removed before more coral, the ecological system and
Taiwan's tourism resources are further compromised.
</P>
<P>
A similar situation has been found in an undersea area to the
east of Green Island, where the freighter Picasso sank 12 years ago,
Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, he said, coral reefs near Penghu Island are found
to be the most healthy, with coral coverage rate totaling nearly 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Amorgos, carrying 60,000 tons of iron ore, was heading for
Nantong in mainland China from Singapore when it developed mechanical
problems and began to drift. It ran aground 1.6 km off the coast of
Oluanpi, Taiwan's southernmost tip, before sinking.
</P>
<P>
All 25 crew members were rescued, but the ship later broke in two
and an estimated 1,150 tons of fuel oil gushed out of the vessel and
blanketed coral reefs in the Oluanpi area.
</P>
<P>
The oil spill has blanketed coral reefs in the Oluanpi area,
causing an ecological disaster that will take the sensitive ecosystem
years from which to recover.
</P>
<P>
At least three officials were disciplined due to aftermath of
that incident.
