Experts fear coral reefs may have been severely damaged by tsunami

The tsunami that took a heavy toll in human life also battered Indian Ocean
coral reefs that already were in distress from pollution and global warming,
possibly causing damage that will require decades to recover, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have yet to conduct a complete survey of damage to the coral reefs
from the tsunami, but experts fear that some of the Earth's most spectacular
coral formations may carry scars from the killer wave for many
years.
</P>
<P>
Tom Hourigan, a coral reef expert for the National Marine Fisheries Service,
said that coral formations throughout the Indian Ocean were severely damaged by
El Nino warming in 1997 and 1998 and were just beginning to recover when they
were slammed by the tsunami last month.
</P>
<P>
"It is very likely that the tsunami would damage the coral and some of the worst
damage would come from debris thrown up against the reefs," said
Hourigan.
</P>
<P>
He said the shallow reefs along hundreds of miles of beach in Indian Ocean would
be victimized by a "one-two tsunami punch."
</P>
<P>
First, the tsunami wave would rise as it entered shallow water and smash into
the coral reef, said Hourigan. The force of the wave itself could damage the
reef. But then would come the second punch. As the wave swept back into the
ocean, it would carry tons of debris __ including cars, trees, refrigerators and
furniture __ along with sludge and silt.
</P>
<P>
The heavy debris would hit the reefs like battering rams, bulldozing the fragile
coral formations. The sludge can bury the coral, suffocating
it.
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest impacts will be from the debris pulled off the land onto the
reefs," said Hourigan. "We've been doing quite a bit of work in the western
Hawaiian islands in removing debris. It is likely that a lot of debris coming
off the land will be damaging to the reefs."
</P>
<P>
He said in studies following typhoons in Guam showed that tin roofs blown onto
coral caused significant damage when ordinary wave action used the tin to grind
away at the reef.
</P>
<P>
Some minor damage is repaired by the coral fairly quickly, but major reef
destruction can take decades to heal, he said.
</P>
<P>
Coral reefs also may suffer more diseases and even death from the silt and sand
that chokes the tiny organisms that builds the reefs.
</P>
<P>
"Some entire reef ... ecosystems could have been buried by sediments flushed
into shallow environments," said Russel E. Brainard, chief of the coral reef
division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Pacific Islands
Fisheries Science Center in Honolulu. For reefs normally washed by high tidal
action, this sediment could be swept clean within weeks or months. But in reef
areas protected from tidal waves or currents, the cleansing could take years or
decades, Brainard said in an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
As tsunami waves retreat to the ocean, they also flushed off the land oils,
paints and other hazardous chemicals, said Brainard.
</P>
<P>
"All of these chemicals are now in the near shore ecosystems interacting with
all types of marine life," he said. "These stressors could result in diseases to
corals, algae, fish and other (organisms). The impacts could be long
lived.
</P>
<P>
Brainard said that plastics, including such things as fishing nets, fish line
and traps, are also washed into coral reefs and the near shore environment. Such
plastics will last in the marine environment for years, even decades, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The loss of coral reefs could severely reduce the amount of fish available to
some small, oceanside rural communities in Asia and Africa that depend on the
sea for food.
</P>
<P>
"The three-dimension structure of a coral reef is the most important factor in
the richnesses you see on a reef," said Hourigan. "Fish depend on it for hiding
places, for the prey they feed on.
</P>
<P>
"A large amount of the protein that human communities need come from fishing on
the coral reefs," he said. If the reefs are severely damaged, then this could
affect the fish population "and have an impact on those communities for a long
period of time."
