Mangroves could have significantly reduced tsunami damage, conservation groups say

Damage from the Indian Ocean tsunami could have been significantly reduced if
more coastal areas had maintained their protective shields of mangrove swamps
and coral reefs, conservation groups said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"These act as shock absorbers for the types of flooding and the tsunami that we
saw," said Simon Cripps, head of the Worldwide Fund for Nature's marine program
based in Gland, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't have been able to stop it completely, of course, but we've seen
areas already ... where there were mangroves, there was substantially less
damage."
</P>
<P>
Mangroves grow in thickets along tropical coastlines and their complicated root
systems help to bind the shore together, effectively providing a shield against
destructive waves. They are vital for coastal protection from the sea, the U.N.
Environment Program says.
</P>
<P>
Many lives could have been saved if mangroves and reefs had been conserved in a
healthy state, said the Mangrove Action Program, an environmental organization
based in Port Angeles, Washington.
</P>
<P>
"Instead these vital protective buffers that nature provides against wind and
wave had been foolishly degraded or removed for unsustainable developments," the
organization said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
An official of the 144-nation Ramsar treaty protecting the world's wetlands said
initial assessments indicated mangroves had lessened some of the impact of the
tsunami, but that further study was needed to determine how effective they
were.
</P>
<P>
"Mangroves are recognized as being one of the coastal systems that provides
buffering against storms and storm effects from the sea," said Nick Davidson,
deputy chief of the secretariat for the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, which
also is based in Gland, near Geneva.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, it remains unclear whether mangroves and coral reefs had a
significant protective effect against a "tsunami on the scale that we've just
witnessed."
</P>
<P>
Up to half of the world's mangrove swamps have disappeared in the last 20-30
years because of the development of tourist resorts, transport infrastructure
and commercial prawn fishing, Cripps said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The Mangrove Action Program estimates that there are 16,000 hectares (40,000
acres) of mangroves left in the world.
</P>
<P>
This makes coastal areas more susceptible to flooding, as has previously been
seen in Bangladesh, which no longer has a protective shield of
mangroves.
</P>
<P>
"The advantage of mangroves is severalfold," Cripps said. "They hold the
structure of the land together, the coastline together."
</P>
<P>
Coral reefs have been similarly hit by waste water from new developments,
dynamite fishing and warmer water because of climate change.
</P>
<P>
Cripps cited the example of the Marriott hotel in Phuket, Thailand, which was
built next to a turtle nesting beach and so was developed with strict
environmental guidelines. The hotel was built back from the beach and
development of the waterfront was severely restricted, so mangrove swamps were
preserved along the coast.
</P>
<P>
"Apparently the damage, the actual physical damage, and the human loss of life
was very much less than in other areas and other hotels in the region," he
said.
</P>
<P>
An offshore coral reef also seems to have prevented much more widespread
destruction on the low-lying Maldives islands, Cripps noted.
</P>
<P>
"There is good evidence from previous events such as hurricanes and typhoons
that the presence of mangroves certainly assists in reducing the impact on
land," Davidson said. "The presence of coral reefs, I think, slows down the
movement of water and the more shallow zone areas you have far away from the
coast, the more effective at reducing energy of incoming water
systems."
