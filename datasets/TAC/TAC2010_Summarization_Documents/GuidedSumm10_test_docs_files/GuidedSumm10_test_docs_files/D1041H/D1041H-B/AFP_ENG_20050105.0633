Long-term environmental lessons must be 
drawn from Asia's tsunami disaster, especially the consequences of 
ripping out mangroves and destroying coral reefs that help protect 
coasts from sea and storms, experts say.

"Places that had healthy coral reefs and intact mangroves were 
far less badly hit than places where the reefs had been damaged and 
the mangroves ripped out and replaced by beachfront hotels and prawn 
farms," said Simon Cripps, director of the Global Marine Programme 
at the environment group WWF Internationational.

"Coral reefs act as a natural breakwater and mangroves are a 
natural shock absorber, and this applies to floods and cyclones as 
well as tgroves suffered fewer human casualties 
and less damage to property compared to areas without mangroves," 
the British-based science website SciDev.Net says.

Doug Masson, a senior researcher at Southampton University's 
Oceanography Centre in southern England, said that even the 
best-managed coastal buffer offers no guarantee of a shield against 
a major tsunami, but it certainly helps to save lives.

"There is a big dampening effect if you have a coral reef. My 
feeling is that coral is what probably saved the majority of people 
in the Maldives. The reef broke up the tsunami and it travelled 
forward as a broken wave and so was far less deadly," he said.

<P>
"As for mangroves, the effect would be different. It would act 
as a dampener but the wave would not be broken up before it hits."

Mangroves are a complex ecosystem of tangled trees, growing in 
muddy, brackish coastal creeks.

<P>
In many parts of South and Southeast Asia, the mangroves have 
been chopped down to make way fore mangroves should 
have been saved."
