   BOULDER, Colo. _ With the threat looming of a grand jury inquest
into the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, the parents of the murdered
beauty princess Thursday completed three days of questioning by
prosecutors here, breaking their 16 months of official silence.
</P>
<P>
   John and Patsy Ramsey, who last talked to Boulder investigators
on April 30, 1997, were questioned separately, and in videotaped
interviews by prosecutors, according to Alex Hunter, Boulder's
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey have been cooperative,'' Hunter said after
questioning ended Thursday afternoon. ``Questioning was not
restricted in content or length. The Ramseys have agreed to
continue to cooperate and to provide certain documents.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investigators from Hunter's office traveled two
weeks ago to the Ramsey's new home in Atlanta and conducted three
interviews with Burke Ramsey, the little girl's 11-year-old
brother. The Ramseys and their two children were the only people
known to be living at the Ramsey house on the night of the murder,
18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Ramsey's have long declined to be interviewed by
police, whom they characterized as biased in the case, their
attorney said recently the couple would cooperate with the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   A new grand jury was impaneled here two months ago. Early this
month, Boulder police spent two days detailing the case to Hunter.
At the end of the closed-door sessions, Hunter indicated that he
would decide whether or not to call a grand jury by early July. On
Thursday, he said: ``I do not know when I will make this
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Boulder's new police chief, Mark Beckner, urged the
prosecutor to convene a grand jury for the case. Earlier this
month, Beckner, who has directed the murder investigation since
October, said that there were ``30 reasons'' why a grand jury
investigation was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an idea who did it,'' he continued, conceding: ``It's
certainly a circumstantial case.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Beckner said he was ``excited'' about new
evidence. According to news reports, this new evidence came from
laboratory tests on clothes the parents wore the night of the
murder. In addition, tests recently confirmed that a felt pen found
in the Ramsey house was used to write the ransom note. Boulder
police already had said that the ransom note was written on a pad
found in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Although the police chief and district attorney both have said
that the Ramseys fall under ``the umbrella of suspicion,'' they
have not formally named any suspects.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the investigation has cost this small city $1 million in
additional police and prosecution expenses. In an accounting,
Boulder police said that, as of early June, they had interviewed
590 people, investigated 122 suspects and taken 1,058 pieces of
evidence. The public had come forward with 700 telephone tips and
3,400 letters.
</P>
<P>
   By talking to prosecutors now, the Ramseys may be trying to head
off grand jury appearances later this summer. When talking with
prosecutors, the Ramseys are not under oath, can refuse to answer
questions, can benefit from considerable advice from their defense
attorneys, and can avoid running a media gauntlet to enter a
courthouse. These conditions do not generally apply in a grand jury
setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only use a grand jury to compel evidence: testimony or
documents,'' said Craig Silverman, a former Denver prosecutor who
is now a defense attorney. ``They may prefer to testify in a
relaxed setting, not under oath. They knew of Hunter's deadline to
decide on a grand jury. This is a game of chicken.''

<P>
   While JonBenet is now a household name from here to Finland, not
everyone in this quiet college town is enamored of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, two men rented the Ramsey family's Tudor-style
mansion, which had remained empty since the murder. To discourage
gawkers, the men promptly planted three large spruce trees to block
the street view.
</P>
<P>
   Also last month, John Eller, the first police commander of the
JonBenet investigation, was in Key West, Fla., trying
unsuccessfully be hired as police chief of that town, 2,000 miles
from here.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Bellipanni, the Boulder District Court chief judge who
was expected to preside over a JonBenet grand jury, resigned last
month, after 15 years on the job. He is moving to Cairo to take a
U.S.-government-funded job as an adviser to reform Egypt's court
system. His move to the far side of the globe prompted The Denver
Post to headline: ``Trading Ramseys for Ramses.''
