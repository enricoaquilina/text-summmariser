JonBenet's parents vow to find her killer

	   LONDON (AP) _ The parents of JonBenet Ramsey, the six-year-old
murdered American beauty queen, break a 14-month silence in a
British television interview Thursday night proclaiming they are
innocent and vowing to find her killer.
	   ``I don't know what happened,'' her mother Patsy Ramsey said in
a Channel 4 documentary, according to highlights published in The
Times of London on Thursday. ``God knows, and He's not telling.''
	   JonBenet was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996 in her
home in Boulder, Colorado. There have been no arrests, and
authorities have said only that Patsy and John Ramsey are under
suspicion. The Ramseys have denied any involvement.
	   Newsweek reporters Sherry Keene-Osborn and Daniel Glick, who are
associate producers of the documentary ``Who Killed JonBenet?'',
previewed the show in The Times, saying the Ramseys accused the
media of convicting them of JonBenet's murder.
	   The reporters noted that the child, dressed in a pink cowgirl
outfit singing ``I Wanna Be A Cowboy's Sweatheart,'' or posing in
elaborate clothes, wearing make-up and high heels, has become known
throughout the United States through coverage of her unsolved
murder.
	   ``The American public has been led to believe that, after a
wonderful Christmas, we brutally beat JonBenet, sexually molested
her, strangled her, went to sleep, got up the next morning, wrote a
ransom note, called the police, sat around the house for four
hours, then I went downstairs and discovered her body and was able
to act distraught,'' Ramsey said.
	   ``Patsy was able to throw up that morning because of
gut-wrenching anxiety. Help me to understand that. Where is our
commonsense as a society, as a race of people?,'' he asked.
	   ``The single most important thing to us, from that day until
even now, is to find the killer of our daughter,'' Ramsey said.
``This ... creature.''
	   The Newsweek reporters wrote that the Ramseys displayed a range
of emotions in the interview in the two-story home in suburban
Atlanta where they moved after JonBenet's death.
	   ``Everything in our lives has been scoured,'' Patsy said. ``They
talked with my fourth-grade teacher, my friends from elementary
school. There's nothing. I'm not saying I've been perfect my whole
life, but there is no history of any activity like this. It's
ridiculous.''
	   Ramsey said that when he was told that police had tried to
withhold his daughter's body for burial in order to force an
interrogation, he lost all confidence in them, the reporters wrote.
	   ``They were not there to help us, they were there to hang us,''
he said.
	   The Ramseys denied allegations that John was an avid consumer of
pornography and that he had abused his other children, a view
supported by the children of his first marriage and his first wife,
the reporters wrote. JonBenet's pediatrician also said he never
suspected she was being abused.
