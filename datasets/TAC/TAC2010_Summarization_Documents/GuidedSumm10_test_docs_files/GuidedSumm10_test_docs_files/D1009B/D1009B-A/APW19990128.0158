	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Prosecutors posted a photograph of a  
white, furry bear dressed as Santa Claus on an Internet site 
Thursday in a plea for public help with the JonBenet Ramsey slaying 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Alex Hunter said investigators are hoping  
someone can identify the stuffed animal's manufacturer and 
retailers where it was carried in 1996 or before. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzanne Laurion, Hunter's spokeswoman, said investigators had  
been unable to find that information despite trying retailers, 
Internet sites and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	She refused to say anything more about the toy, including what  
role it may play in the investigation, how the bear came to the 
attention of police and whether police had it in their possession. 
</P>
<P>
	The indistinct photograph, which may have been cropped from a  
larger image, shows the bear on crinkled paper or material, but not 
posed in a manner to enhance identification. 
</P>
<P>
	The toy is about a foot long, with a red hat, bolero jacket and  
pants all trimmed in a curled white wool material. 
</P>
<P>
	``I make this public request for assistance, knowing that it  
will give rise to considerable speculation about the status of the 
Ramsey case,'' Hunter said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to let this speculation take whatever course it will  
since to confirm or deny theories about what this all means would 
most certainly damage the ongoing investigation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The toy was reportedly among stuffed animals found in JonBenet's  
room, but family members said it did not belong to the little girl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't hers,'' the child's aunt, Pam Paugh, told the Denver  
Rocky Mountain News. ``I believe it was on the other (twin) bed in 
JonBenet's room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her  
family's home Dec. 26, 1996, about eight hours after her mother 
discovered a ransom note demanding $118,000 for her safe return. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no arrests, although police have said JonBenet's  
parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, are under suspicion. They have 
denied involvement. 
</P>
