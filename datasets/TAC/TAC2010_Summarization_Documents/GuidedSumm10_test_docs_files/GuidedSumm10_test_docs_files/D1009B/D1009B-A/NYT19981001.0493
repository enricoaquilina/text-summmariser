LEAKS CLOUD DEATH INQUIRY ON JONBENET 
</HEADLINE>

   BOULDER, Colo. _ Sheets of white paper covered windows in the
courtroom where a grand jury met Thursday to pursue its
two-week-old investigation into the murder of JonBenet Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   But the white sheets were only symbolic screens in a week when
major characters in the almost two-year-old murder mystery waged a
war of leaks and letters, battling for the hearts and minds of the
12 jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ramseys did not do it,'' Lou Smit, a homicide detective,
said in a resignation letter dated Sept. 20 but released on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Smit reviewed police reports on the case for 18 months for the
Boulder County prosecutor's office. ``The `case' tells me that John
and Patsy Ramsey did not kill their daughter, that a very dangerous
killer is still out there and no one is actively looking for him,''
Smit said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the Boulder Police Department of ``going in the wrong
direction,'' Smit, a detective for 32 years, added, ``There is
substantial, credible evidence of an intruder and lack of evidence
that the parents are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The detective's resignation letter prompted Ramsey to make a
rare public statement in the 21-month-old case on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Smit as ``the only experienced homicide detective who
has ever been assigned long term to find the killer of JonBenet,''
Ramsey, in a written statement, lambasted the Boulder Police
Department as ``little more than a lynch mob.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The killer could never have guessed that he or she would be so
lucky as to have the resulting investigation conducted by such
closed-minded police,'' continued Ramsey, the father of the
6-year-old beauty pageant contestant whose body was found on Dec.
26, 1996. ``You have wasted almost two years trying to prove your
original theory. Meanwhile, my family knows a vicious killer still
walks the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet others critical of how the investigation has been handled do
not support Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Before the grand jury started work on Sept. 15, Steve Thomas,
the lead police detective in the case, wrote a resignation letter
denouncing the office of Alex Hunter, the Boulder County district
attorney, as ``thoroughly compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   Under grand jury rules in Colorado, jurors may not discuss
testimony outside the courtroom but are permitted to read news
reports about a case they are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the recent leaks and letters from acquaintances of
the Ramseys, Craig Silverman, a former Denver prosecutor, said,
``They are playing to the grand jury.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent days, as a succession of Boulder police detectives
have appeared before the grand jury, court observers say the
Ramseys and their defenders are trying to score a counterpunch with
the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people are looking and saying, `Hey, there is a forum
here, let's use it,'' said Bob Grant, the Adams County district
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Ramsey's criticism that Boulder police had not
investigated alternative theories, Mark Beckner, the Boulder police
chief, noted that his detectives had interviewed about 600 people
and investigated 122 suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey, in his statement, addressed ``the killer,'' saying, ``We
have been told that the authorities have your DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is true, it was presumably leaked to the Ramseys or
their lawyers. The release of Smit's confidential resignation
letter also constitutes a leak.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Hal Haddon, Ramsey's lead lawyer, has demanded
police investigations of leaks that seemed to implicate the
Ramseys. This round of leaks, favoring the Ramseys, has been met by
silence from Haddon.
</P>
<P>
   The leaks seemed to be timed to counteract a report Sunday on
the ABC news magazine ``20/20'' that cast an unfavorable light on
the Ramseys.
</P>
<P>
   But, on Sunday, only hours before ``20/20,'' The Associated
Press ran Smit's week-old resignation letter. Taking the bloom off
the ABC report, Smit was quoted in Boulder newspapers on Monday,
saying, ``I believe that justice is not being served, that innocent
people are being targeted and could be charged with a murder they
did not commit.''
