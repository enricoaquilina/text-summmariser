FORMER RAMSEY FRIENDS SEEK SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IN JONBENET CASE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Three former friends of the parents of JonBenet Ramsey have
asked for a special prosecutor to take over the stalled
20-month-old investigation into the slaying of JonBenet, the
6-year-old Colorado beauty princess.
</P>
<P>
   The three former friends, all residents of Boulder, have broken
off their friendships with John and Patsy Ramsey, parents of the
slain child. In two separate letters, they accuse Boulder District
Attorney Alex Hunter of unwarranted delays in prosecuting the case
and of being overly accommodating to the Ramseys.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter ``has provided evidence to Ramsey defense attorneys at
their request'' but denied requests by other witnesses for
transcripts of their own statements to the police, wrote Fleet and
Priscilla White, a couple who had the Ramsey family to their home
for dinner on Dec. 25, 1996, a few hours before JonBenet was found
dead. ``He has thoroughly alienated police detectives and key
witnesses whose cooperation is vital to the investigation and
prosecution,'' the Whites wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the dinner, White and Ramsey were searching
the basement of the Ramsey house when Ramsey emerged from a room
with his daughter's battered body. In a brief interview on
Thursday, White, an oil and gas entrepreneur, described himself as
``a frustrated witness in a horrible murder case.''
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by the Boulder police as suspects and eventually
cleared, the Whites became estranged from the Ramseys, who moved to
Atlanta a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In their 15-page letter, released on Wednesday ``to the people
of Colorado,'' the Whites alleged that ``Alex Hunter and those
advising him have no intention of seeking indictment from a grand
jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple faulted prosecutors for allowing a ``chummy''
atmosphere to build with Ramsey lawyers and charged that
prosecutors and police leaders deliberately delayed the case by
``killing time'' with well-publicized busy work and ``task lists.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to their former friends, the Whites concluded, ``We must
be mindful, however, of the first cause of the investigation's
failure _ the refusal of John and Patsy Ramsey to cooperate fully
and genuinely with those officials charged with the responsibility
of investigating the death of their daughter, JonBenet.''
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by this letter, Judith Phillips, a photographer who
had taken pictures of the Ramsey family, wrote an open letter on
Thursday calling for a special prosecutor and charging that Hunter
was ``willing to obstruct the justice he swore to uphold.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither letter gave an opinion about the possibility of the
Ramseys' involvement in the death.
</P>
<P>
   These calls for a special prosecutor come two weeks after
similar calls from a former police detective in the case and from
Denver's two daily newspapers, The Rocky Mountain News and The
Denver Post. In response to these calls, Hunter cut short a
vacation in Alaska, returned to Colorado, met with Gov. Roy Romer
and announced that he would take the case to a grand jury soon,
probably next month.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has declined to respond to the charges against him,
saying a response could prejudice the case. Romer has stood fast in
face of the new calls that he take the case away from Hunter and
appoint a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case is going to the grand jury,'' Jim Carpenter, the
governor's spokesman, said on Thursday. Referring to the Whites'
letter, he added, ``There was nothing in the letter that has
changed that view.''
</P>
<P>
   One legal analyst found it interesting that both the Whites and
Steve Thomas, the former police detective, had warned publicly that
a grand jury would not indict. ``This is the second time that
people have said this grand jury is going to be a fix,'' said the
analyst, Craig Silverman, a former Denver prosecutor who is now a
defense lawyer. ``It's unusual to hear stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, both Denver newspapers published articles that
appeared to open a window on the Ramsey household in the early
morning of Dec. 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to these reports, Mrs. Ramsey failed to hang up the
telephone for a few moments after calling 911 to say that she had
discovered a ransom note on her back stairs. A California
laboratory reportedly digitally enhanced snippets of conversation
picked up at 5:52 a.m. from the Ramsey kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   According to these newspaper accounts, Mrs. Ramsey can be heard
screaming, and JonBenet's brother, Burke, then 10, can be heard
asking what she had found. Ramsey can be heard telling his son to
go back to bed. The Ramseys have said their son was asleep in bed
when Mrs. Ramsey found the note and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Haddon, the Ramseys' lead lawyer, broke his general silence
about the case to issue a statement denouncing the news articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vicious leak is one more example of the pattern of
official misconduct which has characterized this investigation,''
Haddon said. ``Police sources leak what they claim is critical
evidence and spin it against the Ramseys. The Ramseys are helpless
to reply because they do not have access to the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys have denied any involvement in their daughter's
death. Boulder Police Chief Mark Beckner has said they are under an
``umbrella of suspicion.'' &QL;
