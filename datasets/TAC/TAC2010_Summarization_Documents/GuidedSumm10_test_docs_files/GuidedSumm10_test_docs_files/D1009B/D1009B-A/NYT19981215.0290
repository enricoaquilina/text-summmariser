JONBENET RAMSEY CASE MOVES AT `INCREDIBLY SLOW' PACE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ Nearly two years after JonBenet Ramsey was
murdered in her home here on Christmas night, a grand jury
investigation moves at a pace that many outsiders call leisurely.
</P>
<P>
   The second anniversary of the strangulation death of the beauty
princess will find the 12 grand jurors on a five-week Christmas
break. This comes after the jurors took one week off for
Thanksgiving. During a 10-week stretch this fall, the panel met
only 18 times to investigate the case, a murder mystery that has
fascinated the nation and much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty amazing that they are taking a full month off, it
seems more like a vacation than an investigation,'' said Craig
Silverman, a Denver trial lawyer who is not involved in the case.
``They are still moving at this incredibly slow, Boulder pace. It
is amazing the lack of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 15, six months after the grand jury was impaneled for a
one-year term, District Attorney Alexander Hunter of Boulder County
took the case before the grand jury. If the grand jurors
investigate the case into the spring, as expected, their term will
be extended for an additional six months.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the jurors heard testimony from a series of
law-enforcement witnesses _ Boulder police detectives and officers
and a state handwriting analyst. They also toured the Tudor-style
house here where the Ramseys lived until JonBenet's death.
</P>
<P>
   After the jurors reconvene in January, they are expected to hear
from neighbors and employees of the Ramseys in Boulder, as well as
many members of the Ramsey family, including the 6-year-old girl's
parents, John and Patsy Ramsey. In the summer of 1997, they sold
their house here and moved to an Atlanta suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter took the JonBenet case to the grand jury shortly after a
former Boulder police detective on the case and three former
friends of the Ramseys publicly demanded that Colorado's governor,
Roy Romer, replace Hunter on the case with a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bill Owens, Colorado's governor-elect, said he would
resist calls for a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a special prosecutor would have been necessary, had
the grand jury not been called,'' Owens, a Republican, said. ``At
this point, I am willing to await the results of the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of prosecutors here said that they had little experience
investigating and trying homicides in Boulder, a college city that
has about one murder a year. Indeed, in an unrelated case, Hunter's
office on Friday won its first murder conviction here since 1992.
To push the Ramsey case along, prosecutors from neighboring
counties have lent to Hunter's office prosecutors with experience
in homicides and grand juries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex has gotten what many people feel he didn't have _
extremely competent grand jury prosecutors, prosecutors with a
great depth of homicide experience,'' Bob Grant, district attorney
for Adams County, said Tuesday. Noting that he had lent his chief
trial deputy, Bruce Levin, to the case, Grant added, ``There really
isn't any way to predict how long an investigative grand jury will
go on.''
</P>
<P>
   As the grand jury has proved leak proof and as the murder case
has grown cold, interest among news organizations has tapered off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting in January 1997, at least one of the tabloids had
JonBenet on their cover for 55 straight weeks,'' said Stan Oliner,
manuscripts curator for the Colorado Historical Society. Noting a
dwindling flow for the society's JonBenet Ramsey Manuscript
Collection, he added: ``It has become an occasional story. The
Lewinsky story has replaced the pounding, week after week, coverage
of JonBenet.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, last week's headlines seemed to speak of a case frozen
in time.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday evening, Ramsey attacked a free-lance photographer
who tried to take his picture on a Boulder sidewalk, the
photographer, Frank Coffman, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He charged right at me and grabbed hold of me with both hands
and tried to throw me around a bit,'' Coffman said in an interview.
Coffman said he did not intend to file charges.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bynum, a lawyer and business partner of Ramsey who
witnessed the encounter, did not return telephone calls Tuesday.
Another business partner of Ramsey, Jay Elowsky, pleaded guilty
earlier this year to misdemeanor assault charge after he brandished
a baseball bat at two men he thought were newspaper reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A Denver newspaper also headlined last week: ``Ramsey Family DNA
Sought.'' Five members of the Ramseys' extended family agreed to
give Boulder police palm prints and DNA samples last week.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the ongoing investigation, detectives reportedly are
trying to identify a mystery palm print found in the Ramsey
basement and stray bits of DNA found under the little girl's
fingernails. Knowing that unidentified DNA could bolster the theory
that his daughter was murdered by a mysterious intruder, Ramsey
wrote in a public letter Sept. 28: ``We have been told that the
authorities have your DNA. They will know it is you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the DNA is not identified, it does weaken the prosecution's
case,'' said Scott Robinson, a Denver defense lawyer who follows
the case for several Denver news outlets. JonBenet's parents have
already provided police with DNA samples, largely snippets of hair.
The five family members who were scheduled to provide samples last
week all have alibis placing them far from Boulder on the night of
the murder.
