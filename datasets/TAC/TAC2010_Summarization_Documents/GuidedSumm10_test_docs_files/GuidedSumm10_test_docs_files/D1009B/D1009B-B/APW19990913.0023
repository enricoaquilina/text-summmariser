<HEADLINE> Ex-Detective Recalls JonBenet Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The police detective who was present when the body  
of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey was found by her father says she 
feared for her life. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Arndt, who was alone in the room with John Ramsey, told  
ABC's ``Good Morning America'' in an interview broadcast this 
morning that she remembers ``tucking my gun right next to me ... 
and consciously counting out the 18 bullets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged, but authorities say the child's parents  
remain under suspicion. They have denied any involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt was the first detective to arrive at the Ramsey home on  
Dec. 26, 1996, after Patsy Ramsey called 911 to report that her 
daughter was missing and she had found a 2 1/2-page ransom note. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records said that hours later, after no call came from any  
kidnappers, Arndt asked John Ramsey, the child's millionaire 
businessman father, and a friend to search the house for anything 
unusual. He went downstairs and emerged minutes later with the 
girl's body. She had been beaten and strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mind exploded. ... I saw black with thousands of lights,''  
Arndt said. ``Everything that I noted that morning that stuck out 
instantly made sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she knelt down next to the dead child, face to face  
with Ramsey. He asked if JonBenet was dead and Arndt said yes, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a nonverbal exchange that I will never forget. ... And  
as we looked at each other, I remember, and I wore a shoulder 
holster, tucking my gun right next to me and consciously counting 
out the 18 bullets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was asked why, and replied:  
</P>
<P>
	``'Cause I didn't know if we'd all be alive when people showed  
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt's interview is the first time she has spoken publicly  
about the case, and it will be aired over five days, beginning 
today. The first segment of the interview did not indicate who 
Arndt believes killed JonBenet, but ABC executive producer Shelley 
Ross said that information would be in a later segment. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder police have been harshly criticized for their handling  
of the case, including Arndt's allowing Ramsey to recover the body. 
She said in the interview that she had told him that when he 
searched the house, if he found anything unusual he should not 
touch it. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt resigned in March and is suing the Boulder police chief  
and the city, claiming her free-speech rights were violated when 
police were ordered not to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt told ABC she feels she has been ``scapegoated.'' She said  
when she called for backup, she was told everybody was in a 
meeting.
