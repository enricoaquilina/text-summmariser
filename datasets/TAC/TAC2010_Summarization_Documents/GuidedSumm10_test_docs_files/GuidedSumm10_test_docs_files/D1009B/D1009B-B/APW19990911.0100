<HEADLINE> Ramsey Grand Jury Nears 1 Year Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Nearly a year after a grand jury began  
looking into the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, there's no indication 
it's any closer to resolution of the case, frustrating both 
residents and city leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're at the point where they either have to say they have  
something or they don't,'' said Brian Greenman, a shopkeeper who 
lives near the Boulder County Justice Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-member jury, which began its work on Sept. 15, 1998, has  
heard testimony from police officers, friends and relatives of the 
Ramsey family, and technicians who examined thousands of pieces of 
forensic evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel, whose term expires next month, has not met since  
May 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver attorney Scott Robinson, who has followed the case, said  
jurors may be awaiting forensic test results, still following leads 
or waiting for attorneys to work out a deal for JonBenet's parents 
to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for District Attorney Alex Hunter declined  
comment, citing a state law that requires grand juries to operate 
in secret. 
</P>
<P>
	In finishing its term, the grand jury may issue indictments,  
draft a report or simply adjourn without so much as a 
recommendation. It will then be up to Hunter to decide whether to 
pursue any jury recommendation or empanel another group to start 
anew. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled in the basement of  
the family's home on Dec. 26, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	John Ramsey found his daughter's body about eight hours after  
his wife, Patsy Ramsey, told police she had discovered a ransom 
note seeking money in exchange for JonBenet's safe return. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said the Ramseys are under suspicion, but the couple  
has repeatedly proclaimed innocence. The family left Boulder two 
years ago and moved to the Atlanta area with their 12-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, almost three years after the slaying, the only arrests have  
resulted from evidence leaks to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	City spokeswoman Jennifer Bray said the end of the grand jury's  
work won't come quickly enough for city officials, who believe the 
case has given Boulder a black eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Boulder residents also want some closure, Ms. Bray said.  
</P>
<P>
	``In October, the grand jury has got to end. They expect some  
resolution at that point, whether that's the ending point or not,'' 
she said.
