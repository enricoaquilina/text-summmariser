<HEADLINE> Tabloid Denies Ramsey Case Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- A former free-lance writer for the Globe  
says his editors at the supermarket tabloid talked about trying to 
blackmail a Boulder detective into granting an interview about the 
JonBenet Ramsey case. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Shapiro, who researched the Ramsey case for the Globe, said  
his editors considered using as leverage a rumor that Detective 
Steve Thomas' mother committed suicide when Thomas was a boy. The 
rumor later proved false. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Lewis, a Globe editor, acknowledged sending Thomas  
photographs of his long-dead mother days after the detective 
resigned from the Ramsey case in frustration. But Lewis denied it 
was an effort to pressure the detective. 
</P>
<P>
	``No employee of the Globe ever said anything like that,'' he  
said. ``The only person who ever said anything to Thomas about his 
mother was Jeff Shapiro.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Globe Editor Tony Frost said: ``There was no threat to blackmail  
anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who is writing a book about the case, declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro made the allegations in author Lawrence Schiller's book  
about the Ramsey case, ``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,'' as well in 
other media reports. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996, in  
her family's home. The child beauty queen's parents, John and Patsy 
Ramsey, have come under suspicion. They have denied any 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, a grand jury investigating the slaying was granted  
a six-month extension to complete its work. The panel has been 
meeting since mid-September and its term was supposed to be up on 
April 21. The extension runs until Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro was one of the first tabloid reporters who arrived in  
Boulder to cover the Ramsey case. Shapiro said in Thursday's 
Washington Post that he taped some conversations with his editors 
because he feared some of their strategies would jeopardize his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro took the recordings to the FBI, but the detective didn't  
press charges and the agency declined to investigate. Shapiro then 
took them to CBS's ``48 Hours,'' which planned to air the tapes 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing was kind of shocking to me,'' Shapiro told the  
Post. ``I was making tapes to protect myself in case there was a 
criminal investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One tape included an exchange between Shapiro and a Globe editor  
who said, ``I'm not sure that this is even a story for us,'' 
referring to Thomas' family history. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it was something that I thought I might use to get an  
interview with him, you know?'' the editor asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro asked: ``How so?''  
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I'm sure he wouldn't want it published, would he?'' the  
editor replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis told The Associated Press on Thursday that a distant  
relative of Thomas' sent the tabloid the photographs and told of 
the rumors about his mother's death. Lewis said he sent the photos 
to Thomas along with a request for an interview because he thought 
Thomas would find them interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said the taped conversations were internal discussions  
about a story on Thomas' life in the wake of his resignation. He 
said Shapiro went to Thomas on his own to tell him about the 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that he did it shows extremely poor judgment on his  
part,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas resigned Aug. 6, accusing District Attorney Alex Hunter  
of bungling the case and trying to protect JonBenet's parents.
