<HEADLINE> DA Gets $62,001 for Ramsey Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The grand jury investigating the JonBenet  
Ramsey slaying received an additional $62,001 Tuesday to keep 
working for up to three more months. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the action is not a signal of when the panel,  
which convened in September, will wrap up. The grand jury's term 
expires April 22, but District Attorney Alex Hunter can extend it 
for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996, in  
the basement of her home. No arrests have been made, and police and 
prosecutors have been accused of bungling the investigation at the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	The child beauty queen's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, remain  
under suspicion. The Ramseys maintain their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplemental allocation, approved by the Boulder County  
commissioners with little fanfare, means state, county and city 
agencies have spent about $1.7 million on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Grand jury proceedings are secret. But Bob Grant, the district  
attorney in nearby Adams County who has consulted with Hunter on 
the case, has speculated the grand jury could finish its work by 
mid-April.
