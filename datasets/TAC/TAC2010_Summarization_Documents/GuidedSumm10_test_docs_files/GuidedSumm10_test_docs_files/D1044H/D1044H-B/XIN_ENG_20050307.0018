Heinz, a goliath international 
food manufacturer, has issued a national recall of chilli sauces 
and chilli oils that may contain the red industrial dye, Sudan I, 
Monday's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The recall follows news of fast food giant McDonald's 
withdrawing some products in Britain after the dye, believed to 
cause cancer, was found in some food products.
</P>
<P>
"Heinz has told its distributors and sales agencies across the 
country to recall the suspected products," said Charles Chyi, 
regional president of Heinz (China) Investment Co Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"And we know where our products are now being sold in the 
mainland," Chyi told a press conference Sunday afternoon in 
Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Heinz provided a list of products that must be recalled on the 
Chinese mainland and has given it to its distributors and 
wholesalers, but Chyi refused to reveal just how many products 
will be recalled because of the carcinogen nationwide.
</P>
<P>
According to a local quality supervision department, six 
products produced by Heinz companies are suspected of containing 
Sudan I.
</P>
<P>
The products include: chilli sauces, oils and extracts.
</P>
<P>
So far, Heinz is the first and only company that has been 
inspected to have produced the products containing the dye in 
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of nationwide inspections for the dye, law 
enforcement personnel from the Guangdong Provincial Administration
of Quality Supervision have sealed up many sauces and oils that 
contain Sudan I over the past couple of days.
</P>
<P>
The products that have been sealed up have included 60,624 
bottles of pepper oil, 119.4 kilograms of pepper extract, 66,636 
bottles of pepper sauce, 713.9 kilograms of pepper powder, 1,800 
bottles of red vinegar, and 34,155 bottles of seafood sauce.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some other dyes, additives and related materials 
and products that were produced by a subsidiary of Heinz, were 
sealed.
</P>
<P>
China banned imports of any food containing the carcinogenic 
substance on February 23.

<P>
On Friday, the State Administration for Quality Supervision, 
Inspection and Quarantine required the Heinz Meiweiyuan (Guangzhou)
Food Co Ltd to recall its affected products.
