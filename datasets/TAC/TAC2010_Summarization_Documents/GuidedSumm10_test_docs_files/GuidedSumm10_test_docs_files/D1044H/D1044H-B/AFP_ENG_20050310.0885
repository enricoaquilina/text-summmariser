A cancer-causing agent at the center 
of a European health scare has been found in 12 provinces and 
municipalities across China, sparking recalls of suspect products, 
state media said Friday.

The red dye, Sudan-I, was first discovered last week in a pepper 
sauce made by a Heinz subsidiary, the Heinz Meiweiyuan Food Co. 
based in Guangzhou, capital of southern Guangdong province.

The US food giant issued a recall of chilli sauces, chilli oils 
and other products in China suspected of containing the agent.

Xinhua news agency cited China's General Administration for 
Industry and Commerce (GAIC) as saying the dye had now been found in 
12 provinces and municipalities, including Beijing and Shanghai.

The suspect products all came from a raw materials provider, the 
Guangzhou-based Tianyang Food Co. Ltd., the administration said.

In Guilin, in southern Guangxi autonomous region, 58 kilograms 
of raw materials containing the colorant have been seized, but two 
kilograms remain unaccounted for, Xinhua said.
