<P>
China will strengthen the 
screening process for food containing cancer-causing Sudan I in 
the production and circulation areas, said the State 
Administration for Quality Supervision and Inspection and 
Quarantine (AQSIQ) here Friday.
</P>
<P>
China uncovered cancer-causing colorant, Sudan I, in a pepper 
sauce brand, Meiweiyuan, produced by the Guangzhou-based Heinz 
Meiweiyuan Food Co. Ltd., in an inspection recently, said the 
state
quality watchdog.
</P>
<P>
All the Meiweiyuan pepper sauce products in China must be 
removed from the shelves, said AQSIQ in a circular, Friday. AQSIQ 
required the company to stop producing the pepper sauce products 
immediately and recall its products.
</P>
<P>
The agency also asked local inspectors to check domestic 
restaurants and cafeterias to ensure their seasonings don't 
include the Meiweiyuan pepper sauce products.
</P>
<P>
AQSIQ has instructed boarder inspectors to strengthen the food 
supervision and continue screening foods from the European Union.

<P>
Sudan-I is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oils, waxes, 
petrol and shoe and floor polishes. It cannot safely be used in 
food, as it can contribute to an increased risk of cancer.
</P>
<P>
The dye was found by the Food Standards Agency of Britain on Feb.
18 in a batch of chili powder made by Premier Foods, one of the 
largest food and beverage companies in the UK. The agency also 
found some products of other companies, including Schweppes, Coca 
Cola, Unilever and Heinz, to contain Sudan-I.
</P>
<P>
China banned imports of any foods containing the carcinogenic 
substance on February 23.
