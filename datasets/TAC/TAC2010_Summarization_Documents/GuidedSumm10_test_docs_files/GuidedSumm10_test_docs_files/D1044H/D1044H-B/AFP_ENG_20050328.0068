China has detained a manager of a 
supplier found to be the source of the cancer-causing food coloring 
Sudan I found in Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Heinz products, a 
report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The manager of the Guangzhou-based Tianyang Food Co. recently 
taken into custody faces criminal investigations, the Beijing 
Morning Post quoted Guangzhou's Vice Mayor Wang Xiaoling as saying.

<P>
State media reports had earlier quoted government officials as 
saying the company was the source of the country's Sudan I scare and 
had used the dye in raw materials.
</P>
<P>
China launched a food safety inspection when Sudan I was 
detected in food and ingredients sold or used by fast food chain KFC 
and a subsidiary of American company Heinz. The firms suspended 
sales of the suspect products in China.

<P>
So far the dye has been found in 12 of China's provinces and 
municipalities, sparking recalls, state media said.
</P>
<P>
Food inspectors in various parts of China last week continued to 
comb supermarkets and restaurants for food containing the industrial 
product traditionally used for coloring solvents, oils, waxes, 
petrol and shoe and floor polishes.
</P>
<P>
In the northern city of Yanan, Sudan I was still beiing found in 
food on store shelves, including pepper sauces, barbeque sauces and 
sauces for "hotpot" soups. The products include those made by a 
company in the southwest city of Chengdu.

<P>
The dye, which was at the center of a European health scare, was 
found by the Food Standards Agency of Britain in February in a batch 
of chilli powder made by Premier Foods, one of the country's largest 
food and beverage companies.
</P>
<P>
The agency also found the dye in products made by Schweppes, 
Coca Cola and Unilever.
