Britain's food watchdog said 
Thursday it has launched an unprecedented investigation into how 
an allegedly cancer-causing agent Sudan 1 find its way into the 
string of British food industry.
</P>
<P>
The director of Food Standard Agency (FSA) David Statham said 
in a statement that "local authorities across the country have 
visited a number of premises to look at records and take samples,"
adding that "this is a major investigation".
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, the FSA has ordered the withdrawal of 419 
products, ranging from ready-made meals to popular sauces, because
they are tainted by a potentially cancer-causing dye.
</P>
<P>
The red-colored dye, which is used for coloring industrial 
products such as gasoline and shoe polish, was found in a batch of
chilli powder used by the British company Premier Foods to make 
Worcester sauce, which was then added as an ingredient in a wide 
range of products.
</P>
<P>
Determined to find out how traces of the illegal dye Sudan 1 
found its way into Britain's food chain, the FSA said it was 
conducting its largest ever investigation with the help of five 
local authorities.
</P>
<P>
It is illegal to put Sudan 1 into food in Britain or elsewhere 
in the European Union, and all chilli powder imported since July 
2003 has to be certified free of the agent.
</P>
<P>
The offending sample is thought to have entered Britain before 
that time.
