<P>
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) Monday 
extended the list of foods contaminated by carcinogenic colouring 
that it wants to recall from shop shelves and homes.
</P>
<P>
The 38 new items include certain sausages, seasonings and 
pizzas.
</P>
<P>
The watchdog agency Friday recalled 359 products, ranging from 
ready-made-meals to a popular brand of instant noodles, after 
finding traces of the illegal dye Sudan I.
</P>
<P>
"Sudan I can contribute to an increased risk of cancer but at 
the levels present the risk is likely to be very small," the agency 
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"There is no risk of immediate ill health but it is sensible to 
avoid eating any more," it said.
</P>
<P>
The FSA said it was working with supermarkets and other stores 
to remove the products from sale and reiterated its advice to the 
public to return products on the recall list to the places were they 
were bought.
</P>
<P>
The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible 
items such as petrol and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli 
powder used by the British company Premium Foods to make Worcester 
sauce, which was then added as an ingredient in a wide range of 
products.
