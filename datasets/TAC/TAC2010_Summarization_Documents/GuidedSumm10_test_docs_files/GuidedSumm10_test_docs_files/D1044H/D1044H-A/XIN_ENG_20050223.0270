Sudan I, a potentially cancer-
causing colorant, is the latest target for China's product quality
watchdogs after the disclosure that the red dye has tainted 
hundreds of food items in Britain, Thursday's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration for Quality Supervision and Inspection
and Quarantine Wednesday slapped a ban on imports of any foods 
containing the carcinogenic substance, and began screening foods 
from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday, the watchdog had released an updated list of 428 
affected food products, ranging from BBQ sauce to pies, including 
those made by Heinz and Unilever.
</P>
<P>
China's quality supervision agency put a Chinese version of the
known affected list, plus an urgent notice, in the public domain (
www.aqsiq.gov.cn) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency also asked local inspectors to check domestic food 
makers to ensure their products or raw materials are free of the 
dye.
</P>
<P>
Food that contains the substance is not allowed to be sold or 
exported, a statement from the Chinese agency said. China has 
already forbidden the use of Sudan I in foods, according to agency
sources.
