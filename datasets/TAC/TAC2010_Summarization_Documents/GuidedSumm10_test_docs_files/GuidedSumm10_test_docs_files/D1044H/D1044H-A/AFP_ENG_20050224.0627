<P>
Britain's food watchdog said Thursday 
three companies were under investigation for their alleged role in a 
cancer scare that has triggered the country's largest food recall.
</P>
<P>
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has launched an unprecedented 
probe into how a potentially cancer-causing dye contaminated at 
least 474 products, ranging from ready-made meals to popular sauces, 
that have been withdrawn from sale.
</P>
<P>
It has ordered supermarkets over the past week to discard a 
growing list of food tainted by the illegal Sudan I dye and 
instructed food manufacturers to reveal any other affected 
products.
</P>
<P>
"This has been an enormous undertaking. Hundreds of products 
have been affected in thousands of shops," said David Statham, the 
FSA's director of enforcement, as the agency added another 146 items 
to its black list.
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of contaminated foods has now been removed 
and that provides some reassurance to consumers," he said in a 
statement.
</P>
<P>
"However, there may be some products remaining both in shops and 
in the catering sector and we will continue to work with local 
authorities to remove them as far is practical and achievable."
</P>
<P>
Determined to find out how traces of the dye found their way 
into Britain's food chain, the FSA said it was conducting its 
largest ever investigation with the help of five local authorities.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major investigation," said Statham.
</P>
<P>
"Local authorities across the country have visited a number of 
premises to look at records and take samples," he said.
</P>
<P>
An FSA spokesman told AFP that the authorities had inspected 
three firms allegedly involved in the supply of tainted foods -- 
Premier Foods, East Anglian Food Ingredients and Unbar Rothon.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether any action had been taken with the companies, the 
spokesman said: "The investigation is ongoing."
</P>
<P>
The agency said in the statement it has advised the local 
authorities to consider whether to take "enforcement action" based 
on the evidence gathered.
</P>
<P>
Under British law, companies and their executives could face 
prosecution, unlimited fines and two years in prison, for failure to 
ensure that food placed on the market is safe and fit for human 
consumption.
</P>
<P>
The five local authorities involved in the investigation are in 
Essex and Lincolnshire counties and in the towns of South Holland, 
Rochdale and Basildon.
</P>
<P>
The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible 
items such as gasoline and shoe polish, was found in a batch of 
chilli powder used by the British company Premier Foods to make 
Worcester sauce, which was then added as an ingredient in a wide 
range of products.
</P>
<P>
Despite prompting an increased risk of cancer, the FSA has 
emphasised that the actual danger is very small given the levels 
present.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, however, the European Commission expressed concern 
over the discovery of tainted food and said that other EU states had 
been alerted.
</P>
<P>
Europe-wide rules introduced in June 2003 controlling products 
like the Sudan 1 dye were not being enforced, the EU executive 
said.
</P>
<P>
"I regret that more than 18 months after the (EU decision) 
establishing the control regime, certain industrial operators have 
not faced up to their responsibilities and cleaned up their stocks 
of raw material," said EU health and consumer protection 
commissioner Markos Kyprianou.
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned that old stocks of chilli from before June 2003 
appear still to be used by food processors," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is illegal to put Sudan 1 into food in Britain or elsewhere 
in the European Union, and all chilli powder imported since July 
2003 has to be certified free of the agent.
</P>
<P>
The offending sample is thought to have entered Britain 
beforehand.
