Britain's Food Standards Agency on 
Friday issued an urgent  warning advising people not to eat more 
than 350 food products inadvertently contaminated with an illegal 
dye.
</P>
<P>
The dye, known as Sudan I, is linked to an increased risk of 
cancer, but is not thought to be a risk to health at the 
concentrations used in these products, said a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
The dye got into a batch of chilli powder which was used in a 
large consignment of Crosse and Blackwell Worcester Sauce made by 
Premier Foods.
</P>
<P>
The sauce was then added as an ingredient to at least 359 
products made by supermarkets and leading food companies such as 
Unilever.
</P>
<P>
Sudan 1 is a red dye used for coloring solvents, oils waxes, 
petrol and shoe polish and it is illegal to add it to food in 
Britain and the whole EU region.
</P>
<P>
However, FSA chief executive Jon Bell told Sky News: "There is 
no risk of immediate illness and the general risk is very small.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly if anyone has any products throw them away or return 
them," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the widespread use of this Worcester sauce to 
flavor other foods, we may find further affected products. We will
continue to take action to remove these and minimize the risk to 
consumers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bell said the problem was uncovered when supplies reached an 
Italian company which tested for Sudan 1.
