<P>
Britain's Food Standards Agency on Thursday extended a list of foods that could
be contaminated with a dye linked to cancer.
</P>
<P>
A total of 474 food products are now being recalled, amid fears they could
contain traces of Sudan I _ a red dye used for coloring oils, waxes, petrol and
shoe polish.
</P>
<P>
The Food Standards Agency sparked an international food safety alert on Feb. 18
when it announced that a sauce contaminated with the dye had been used in
hundreds of British foods and exported to several European and Caribbean
countries and to North America.
</P>
<P>
The list of recalled foods includes dressings used by McDonald's fast food
chain, packets of potato chips and pre-prepared meals.
</P>
<P>
Sudan I is banned from food in Britain and across the European Union, and since
2003 all chili powder imported to Britain must be certified to be free of Sudan
I.
</P>
<P>
The batch thought to be responsible for the food scare predates the sampling
program. It was uncovered when Italian authorities carried out tests on a batch
of Worcestershire sauce shipped to Italy from England.
</P>
<P>
The Food Standards Agency said Sudan I could contribute to an increased risk of
cancer, but it was not possible to identify a safe level or to quantify the
risk.
