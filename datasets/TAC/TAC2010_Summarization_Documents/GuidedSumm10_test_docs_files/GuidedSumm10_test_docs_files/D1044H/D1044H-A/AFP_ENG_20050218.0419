<P>
Britain's food safety watchdog ordered 
the recall of more than 350 food products Friday after it said that 
a potentially cancer-causing dye had been discovered.
</P>
<P>
The Food Standards Agency said it was working with the food 
industry and local authorities to make sure that all the affected 
products are removed from the shelves and urged members of the 
public who have them in their cupboards to contact the store where 
they were bought for a refund.
</P>
<P>
"Sudan I could contribute to an increased risk of cancer," said 
FSA chief executive Jon Bell, while downplaying the gravity of the 
health risk.
</P>
<P>
"However, at the levels present the risk is likely to be very 
small but it is sensible to avoid eating any more," he said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no risk of immediate ill health," Bell said.
</P>
<P>
The red-coloured dye, which is used for colouring non-edible 
items such as petrol and shoe polish, was found in a batch of chilli 
powder used by the British company Premium Foods to make Worcester 
Sauce, which was then used as an ingredient in a wide range of 
products, the FSA said.
</P>
<P>
The agency has published a full list of the affected items, 
which are stocked by Britain's main supermarket chains and include 
ready-made meals such as shepherd's pie, pasta bake, cottage pie, 
chicken wings, sausage casserole, pizza, steak and kidney pie and 
chilli con carne.
</P>
<P>
There are also a number of products made by well-known British 
food companies, including three flavours of Unilever's top-selling 
Pot Noodle brand affected: Beef and Tomato, 'The Sizzler' Bacon 
Flavour and Hot Dog and Ketchup Flavour. All have a best before date 
of November 2005.
</P>
<P>
It is illegal to put Sudan 1 into food in Britain and the rest 
of the European Union and all chilli powder imported since July 2003 
has to be certified free of the agent.
</P>
<P>
The offending sample is thought to have entered Britain 
beforehand.
