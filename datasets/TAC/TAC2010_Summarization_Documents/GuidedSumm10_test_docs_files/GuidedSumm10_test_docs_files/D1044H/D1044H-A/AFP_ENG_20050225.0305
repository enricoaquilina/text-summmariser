are investigating whether a problem dye may also have tainted 
foodstuffs, officials said Friday.

Meanwhile the European Commission, reporting the results of a 
two-day meeting on the British scare, revealed that the batch of

came from India.

The EU commission said that 12 other EU states have been alerted 
after the British scare erupted: Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Spain, 
Greece, France, Ireland, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal and
