`Starved' Isn't Just in Bad Taste, It's Dangerous
</HEADLINE>

When I watched the premiere this month of ``Starved,'' the new FX
sitcom that claims to explore the comedic side of eating disorders, I
wasn't sure if I thought it was all that funny. After seeing the
second episode, I am sure -- it's not funny at all.
</P>
<P>
There are actually some very humorous moments in the show, but
that's exactly why I find it so troublesome. Eating disorders are
serious business. Millions of women and men fight a daily
life-and-death battle with anorexia, bulimia or binge-eating disorder.
By turning these illnesses into comedy, their gravity is trivialized.
</P>
<P>
``Starved'' chronicles the everyday lives and friendship of four
adults, each suffering from a different variety of eating disorder.
They binge, vomit, starve themselves and abuse laxatives, as well as
obsessively weigh and measure their bodies.
</P>
<P>
The group consists of three men and one woman -- an interesting
choice, because real-life statistics consistently demonstrate that the
number of women with eating disorders far exceeds that of men. Only
about 10 percent of sufferers who reach out to mental-health
clinicians are male. This kind of misrepresentation is just a further
illustration of how the show, by departing so drastically from
reality, trivializes a group of illnesses that, at their worst, can
result in death.
</P>
<P>
The National Eating Disorders Association is particularly alarmed
about this trivialization, but my greatest concern is slightly
different. As someone who works with adolescent girls who struggle
with body image and weight-loss issues, I worry that portraying eating
disorders as comedy will serve to normalize them in the eyes of
vulnerable teens.
</P>
<P>
Developmentally, teens have a trend-following mentality. They tend
to jump on many bandwagons as they travel through the angst of
extricating themselves from childhood. It doesn't take much for
someone with a poor body image or with an intense desire to be thin to
find a reason to actually try starving, bingeing or purging to obtain
or maintain a low weight. A peer or family member engaging in such
behavior could serve as a motivator. So could a TV show, which can
provide ideas for how to engage in disordered eating while
illustrating that everyone -- even the most mainstream adult guy --
can and is easily doing it.
</P>
<P>
It is a slippery slope, but we can't shield kids and teens from
every peril they may encounter -- especially those on TV.
</P>
<P>
Instead of focusing on the potentially detrimental effects of
``Starved,'' we should use it as a tool for communication -- a way to
reach out and discover what teens are thinking and how they are
feeling.
</P>
<P>
I asked a number of girls what they thought of the show. Most
thought it was ``funny but dumb'' or ``not realistic.'' When we spoke
further, they seemed to get it -- eating disorders are scary, and it
seems a bit strange and misguided to be contorting them into fodder
for a sitcom. It made for good conversation and led to discussions
about their own body images and stories about friends with eating
disorders.
</P>
<P>
Parents can and should have these discussions with their teens.
Younger children should also be part of these conversations, even if
they haven't seen ``Starved.'' According to the National Eating
Disorders Association, more than 80 percent of 10-year-olds are afraid
of being fat, and more than 50 percent of 9- to 11-year-olds feel
better when they are on a diet. Parents need to keep their eyes wide
open for children and teens -- especially girls -- who may be
exhibiting signs of body-image concerns and eating-disordered
behavior.
</P>
<P>
Inasmuch as a TV show can send a decidedly flawed message, parents
must recognize that they have the ability and, indeed, the
responsibility to counteract this message by using the opportunity to
discuss, debate and argue the point -- it doesn't really matter, as
long as they push open the more-often-than-not securely locked door of
communication between themselves and their children.
</P>
<P>
Parents have to stay connected with their children and teens,
talking to them, understanding them and fostering empathy for the
stresses, pressures and emotional challenges faced by youth --
pressures that can lead to eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
Parents also need to teach their kids that they have choices.
Believing everything you see on TV is only one of them. Another is to
be an educated television consumer who can separate fiction from
reality and then weigh in intelligently on the issues at hand, and who
sometimes even chooses to turn off the TV.
