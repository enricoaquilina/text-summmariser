WEB SITES CELEBRATE A DEADLY THINNESS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the Web site's pages begin to load, a box pops
up the screen.
</P>
<P>
"Caution," it reads. "This site contains pro-eating disorder images and information.
If you do not have an eating disorder or are
in recovery, do not enter this site."
</P>
<P>
Click OK, and a new box appears.
</P>
<P>
"Seriously. You enter this site of your own volition, and I
am not responsible for the decisions you make based on
the information you see here."
</P>
<P>
Click. A third box.
</P>
<P>
"So don't send me hate mail. It's your fault if you
don't like what you see."
</P>
<P>
However sincerely intended, the warnings, posted on one of a growing
number of Web sites that promote eating disorders like anorexia
and bulimia, may serve more as a lure, especially for
curious teenagers. And a recent study by researchers from the
Stanford School of Medicine has found that the Web sites
are commonly visited by adolescents who have eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
Such sites are the public face of a movement that goes
beyond the denial that often accompanies addictive behaviors like alcoholism
and gambling, into something more like defiance.
</P>
<P>
Many of the sites dispute that anorexia and bulimia are diseases,
portraying them instead as philosophies of life. They offer tips
on how to lose weight -- by purging, among other
methods -- and how to hide eating disorders from family
members or friends.
</P>
<P>
In the new study, presented at a meeting of the Pediatric
Academic Societies, the researchers said it was unclear whether the
Web sites played a role in drawing people into eating
disorders or in making recovery more difficult, in part because
the study sample was fairly small. A larger study is
planned.
</P>
<P>
But the researchers found that adolescents who reported visiting so-called pro-ana,
for anorexia nervosa, or pro-mia, for bulimia nervosa, Web sites
spent more time in hospitals and less time on school
work than those who said they did not visit the
sites. For reasons that are unclear, the study also found
that even when adolescents visited pro-eating-disorder and pro-recovery sites, they
still fared worse than those who visited neither kind of
site.
</P>
<P>
Pro-eating-disorder Web sites can be very attractive, experts say. Many are
well designed and well written, and they appeal to an
adolescent sense of rebellion.
</P>
<P>
"The belief that centers the pro-ana movement is the belief that
eating disorders are a lifestyle choice and not a disease,"
said one of the study's authors, Dr. Rebecka Peebles, a
specialist in adolescent medicine at Stanford's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Consider the page that greets visitors when they finally get past
the warning boxes. "Quod me nutrit, me destruit," it declares.
What nourishes me destroys me.
</P>
<P>
The site goes on to give tips on how to conceal
an eating disorder, including wearing baggy clothes, pretending to eat
and hiding the health problems the disorders can bring on.
</P>
<P>
The author of the site, in a "disclaimer," says she is
not promoting eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
"These sites," she writes "do not exist to say: 'I'm anorexic!
Aren't I cool? Don't you want to be like me?"'
The goal, she says, is to offer support: "This is
a place where people can come to say, 'This is
part of who I am. These are people who understand."'
</P>
<P>
Jenny Wilson, a Stanford medical student and the author of the
study, is skeptical of efforts to attach a philosophy to
eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
Instead, she sees the Web sites as efforts by people with
eating disorders to convince themselves that they have control over
their lives. "I think it's an expression of the disease
more than anything," Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the Web sites show a kind of ambivalence, the
researchers said. They defend people's right to be anorexic or
bulimic, but they spend a lot of time talking about
the difficulties of having eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
Peebles of Stanford said that for some people, the sites might
serve as no more than a support community, and not
as a source of encouragement to continue destructive behavior. "They
can express their innermost eating-disordered thoughts in a sortof anonymous
way where they won't be judged," she said.
</P>
<P>
Still, when the researchers spoke to adolescents who had visited the
sites, more than 60 percent reported trying weight-loss techniques they
had learned there. (About a quarter of the adolescents who
visited Web sites intended to help people with eating disorders
recover also said they had found tips on ways to
keep their weight down.)
</P>
<P>
For the study, the researchers sent surveys to the parents of
678 people, ages 10 to 22, who had been treated
for eating disorders at Stanford. They also asked the parents
to give separate surveys to their children.
</P>
<P>
In all, 64 patients and 92 parents responded.
</P>
<P>
And while the forms were anonymous, the researchers were able to
link the responses of the patients with those of their
families, to compare answers.
</P>
<P>
The study found that 39 percent of the patients had visited
pro-eating-disorder Web sites, 38 percent pro-recovery sites and 27 percent
both types of sites.
</P>
<P>
Despite the differences in reported hospital stays, the researchers found that
those who spent time on the pro-eating-disorder sites provided basically
the same information when asked about health changes as those
who did not. Their weight was not much different from
their ideal body weight, the researchers said, and they were
no more likely to have changes in their menstrual cycles
or to have symptoms of osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
When the researchers tried to see how familiar parents were with
the Web sites, they found that the parents whose children
visited the sites were more likely to know about them
and to be concerned about what their children were learning
on the Web.
</P>
<P>
But 39 percent of those parents said they did not know
whether their children visited pro-eating-disorder sites. And 15 percent wrongly
reported that their children did not use them.
</P>
<P>
Some large Web servers like Yahoo, responding to complaints, have removed
sites that promote eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
But the sites remain easy to find. And some experts wonder
whether they are doing a better job of getting their
message out than do the sites intended to promote recovery
from eating problems.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Kreipe, chief of adolescent medicine at the University of
Rochester Medical Center in New York state, said he was
struck by how attractive the pro-eating-disorder sites tended to be.
Still, he said, it is hard to prove whether the
sites actually make the problem worse.
</P>
<P>
The issue, Kreipe said, is probably not whether the sites can
draw the average teenager into an eating disorder but whether
they may influence someone with an inherited predisposition to develop
the disease -- especially an adolescent who is feeling isolated.
</P>
<P>
"The kid who's probably most vulnerable to this is the kid
who's least connected to other people," he said.
