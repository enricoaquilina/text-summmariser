DRUG MAY HELP EASE GRIP OF SOME PHOBIAS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many psychiatric disorders, drug therapy has become the norm. But
phobias -- irrational fears that can paralyze and disrupt people's
lives -- have been largely resistant to chemical intervention, and
behavioral therapies have remained the treatment of choice.
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, a tuberculosis drug with surprising effects on the brain
has given psychiatrists hope that a new approach to phobias
and other severe anxiety disorders may be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
The drug, D-cycloserine, an antibiotic, does nothing to soothe panic or
calm nerves. Instead, it increases learning and memory, and may
help people overcome their fears faster in psychotherapy, which can
be costly and take years.
</P>
<P>
In November, researchers at Emory found that people who combined the
drug with behavioral treatment to conquer their fear of heights
improved drastically after only two sessions, instead of the usual
eight. Elsewhere, researchers are studying its effects on social phobia,
panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. And a group at Columbia
University is exploring whether the drug may help people grappling
with anorexia nervosa.

"Treating anxiety with Valium or anti-depressants works on the symptoms, but
doesn't really get rid of the fear except to cover
it up in the moment," said Dr. Michael Davis, a
psychiatrist at Emory who was involved in the study on
heights, published in The Archives of General Psychiatry. "Psychotherapy is
really the best way to treat these disorders, and this
makes it better and faster."
</P>
<P>
For panic disorder, phobias and other severe anxiety disorders, psychiatrists often
rely on a specific type of treatment called exposure therapy,
in which patients gradually learn to feel comfortable in situations
they dread.
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that a glutamate receptor in the amygdala, a
part of the brain that governs emotion, plays a role
in learning to adjust to threatening stimuli. Since D-cycloserine is
known to act on these receptors, Davis, who has applied
for a patent on the concept of using the drug
to enhance learning during psychotherapy, decided to test whether it
might accelerate the breaking of people's fearful associations, a process
called extinction.
</P>
<P>
For the study, his team assembled a group of 28 people
so terrified of heights that they refused to park in
multilevel garages or would go out of their way to
book rooms on the lower floors of hotels.
</P>
<P>
They all took part in sessions involving a virtual reality program
that simulates rides in a glass elevator. Some received a
dose of D-cycloserine beforehand, and others were given a placebo.
</P>
<P>
After two sessions, people who were given the medication had almost
fully recovered and showed fewer symptoms of anxiety than those
in the placebo group.
</P>
<P>
"The people who had the drug were also more likely to
report crossing bridges and going to the tops of buildings
in their daily lives," said Dr. Kerry Ressler, an assistant
professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory and an
author of the study.
</P>
<P>
Early results were released in 2003. Since then, 10 other teams
around the world have been testing the drug on a
vast lineup of disorders treated with psychotherapy.
</P>
<P>
Anorexia nervosa, a disorder with high relapse rates and few medications,
is one of them. Because D-cycloserine specifically affects learning, not
anxiety per se, psychiatrists suspect it may help anorexic patients
unlearn their negative perceptions of food.
</P>
<P>
"We're approaching some of the disturbed eating behavior as though it
were phobic," said Dr. Timothy Walsh, a professor of psychiatry
at Columbia and the director of eating disorders research at
the New York State Psychiatric Institute.
</P>
<P>
Walsh is leading a study in which anorexic patients, aided by
a therapist, are given D-cycloserine and trained to overcome their
anxiety about food. He said the first results would be
known in the summer.
