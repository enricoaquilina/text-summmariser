Nutritional imbalance is a common problem
among school children in Taiwan, with vitamin E deficiency being the
most serious, according to the results of a survey released Thursday
by the Ministry of Education (MOE).
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 56 percent of boys and 69 percent of girls
between 10 and 12 have not taken in enough vitamin E.
</P>
<P>
Iron is the second nutrient after vitamin E that was found to be
deficient among school children, with 36 percent of boys and 53
percent of girls from the same age group consuming insufficient iron.
</P>
<P>
Among school children between six and 12, 11.4 percent of boys
and 13.2 percent of girls have displayed symptom of anemia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, vitamin B2 intake by 8 percent of low graders and 25
percent of high graders is lower than the recommended allowance, and
32.5 percent of girls and 18 percent of boys in the higher grades
have had insufficient vitamin A intake.
</P>
<P>
It was found that approximately 70 percent of school children
have insufficient nutrition.
</P>
<P>
While 37 percent of the children lack one nutrient, 22 percent
lack two nutrients, and 10.8 percent lack more than three nutrients.
</P>

Meanwhile, a separate survey on the health conditions of school
children shows that the percentage of school children who are
overweight has dropped from 27.18 percent to 24.2 percent, but the
percentage of those who are underweight has increased from 12.89
percent to 18.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to MOE officials, a lot of teenagers in Taiwan have
tried to lose weight by going on a diet, fasting or taking dietary
substitutes, which causes dietary disorders and nutrient deficiency.
</P>
<P>
The officials warned that nutrient deficiency could lead to
health problems such as delayed puberty, stagnant growth, lowering of
metabolism and blood pressure, low body temperature, electrolyte
imbalance, osteoporosis, anorexia and bulimia, with irregular menses
and even no menses possible among girls.
