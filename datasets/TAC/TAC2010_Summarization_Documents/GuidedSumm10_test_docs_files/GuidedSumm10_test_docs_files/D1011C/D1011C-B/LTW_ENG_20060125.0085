`Thin' Explores Secret Life of Women Who Purge
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
PARK CITY, Utah
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Polly Williams was 29 years old when she slashed
her wrists and downed sleeping pills. What drove her to the edge? Two
pieces of pizza. She hadn't been able to get home to throw them up.
</P>
<P>
Williams, one of four women with life-threatening eating disorders
whose stories are told in the documentary film ``Thin,'' came to the
Sundance Film Festival with first-time filmmaker Lauren Greenfield, a
Los Angeles photographer who has explored in shocking images the
relationship of girls to their bodies.
</P>
<P>
``I remember being so devastated that my body was digesting the
pizza, and I couldn't handle it anymore,'' said Williams during an
interview here with Greenfield.
</P>
<P>
The documentary, filmed at the Renfew Center, a South Florida
clinic for women with eating disorders, grew out of Greenfield's 2002
photo book ``Girl Culture.'' The film will air on HBO in the spring.
</P>
<P>
``Thin'' is an unflinching portrait of a deadly mental illness that
is little understood and poorly treated. Each morning's weigh-in
session is an exercise in horror and hope -- it's not uncommon for
women in treatment to weigh less than 85 pounds. A 2-pound weight
gain, while medically laudable, is met with disgust by one of the
patients.
</P>
<P>
``This is such a horrible disease,'' Williams said. ``It's not
something you can beat on your own.''
</P>
<P>
Among the three other women in the movie is Alisa Williams, who
joined the U.S. Air Force because she thought a military regimen would
help her lose weight. Before entering treatment, she kept her calorie
count to 200 a day (U.S. dietary guidelines recommend at least 1,600
calories daily for women) and compulsively changed clothes for
something that made her look thin. Asked to draw an outline of her
body, she produced an image that looks more like a National Football
League linebacker than the petite creature that she is.
</P>
<P>
``This is the one thing I want -- to be thin,'' says Williams, the
single mother of two children, ``so if it takes dying to get there, so
be it.''
</P>
<P>
Shelly Guillory, a psychiatric nurse, purges through the gastric
tube that was inserted to save her life. Competitive with her
identical twin, Kelly, she tells her therapist that ``if I get bigger
than her, that's the end of me.''
</P>
<P>
And Brittany Robinson, a depressed teenager who went from 185
pounds to 97 pounds in a year, talks about the candy she and her
mother would buy for ``chew and spit'' parties. ``We just had fun. We
didn't think it was a problem, which, obviously, it was.'' When
Robinson arrived at the clinic, she had liver damage and her hair was
falling out.
</P>
<P>
Although eating disorders are treated lightly in the popular
culture -- ``a glamorous illness that movie stars get,'' as Greenfield
said, -- her aim is to show that ``it's not coming out of vanity or to
look good in jeans, but a very serious mental illness that's
incredibly hard to treat.''
</P>
<P>
Greenfield received extraordinary access to the patients at the
Renfrew Center, as well as access to staff meetings, therapy sessions
and ``community meetings'' where angry or tearful confrontations would
sometimes occur. At mealtimes, the nausea and despair were palpable.
These women do not want to eat.
</P>
<P>
Greenfield was nervous about working in the collaborative world of
film, but was encouraged to pursue the project with producer R.J.
Cutler by Sheila Nevins, president of HBO's documentary division, on
the basis of some taped footage.
</P>
<P>
``In photography, I am my own boss and do my own thing,''
Greenfield said, ``but I think I had a dream situation for my first
film.'' The only advice Nevins gave, she added, was a suggestion to
stay within the center and not follow the subjects home after
treatment was completed.
</P>
<P>
``I told her to stay in one place, to bore a hole,'' Nevins said
before the film's premiere Saturday. ``I was interested in the whole
rehab situation -- the expense of it, the survival rate, the
professionalism of it.''
</P>
<P>
It is that question -- the professionalism of the staff -- that
provides unexpectedly troubling moments on film. There are many
compassionate professionals (some are obese) but there are moments
that are cringe-worthy -- when, for example, a mental health
professional calls Polly Williams a ``bad seed'' because she is the
dominant member of a high-spirited threesome of patients at the
clinic. (They smoke in their rooms against the rules or get a tattoo
during a furlough. )
</P>
<P>
Room searches for contraband items, such as cutting tools or
cigarettes, and Draconian rules contribute to a sense that the
patients, who already seem like little girls (their chests are flat
and many have stopped menstruating), are infantilized further by
protocols.
</P>
<P>
``We have a long way to go in the professional treatment of
psychiatric disorders,'' said Nevins. ``I grew up thinking that
anorexia was a Vogue magazine disease -- you flipped the page and you
wanted to look like that. I didn't know it was a neurological
dysfunction, a mental disease. These children, young women, need
psychiatric help and pharmaceutical help, not just rigorous bootstrap
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
The movie raises, but does not explore, the limits of insurance
coverage that exacerbate some patients' problems. Three of the four
have insurance issues. Two leave Renfrew before they are ready. ``More
concretely, the film is about anorexia and bulimia,'' Nevins said,
``but symbolically it stands for parity for mental illness to other
diseases. To put time limits on the treatment is ridiculous. You don't
put a time limit on cancer or diabetes.''
</P>
<P>
According to doctors with whom Greenfield consulted for the film,
it takes an average of seven years to recover from an eating disorder.
``And most insurance,'' she said, ``covers three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
Nor does the movie plumb the causes of anorexia and bulimia, which
are complex and not understood.
</P>
<P>
Polly Williams, now 31 and the manager of a portrait studio in
Chattanooga, Tenn., said that when she was 11 years old, her mother
and aunt paid her $200 to lose 10 pounds. Her mother was her coach,
imparting techniques that became second nature: ``Mom was like, `A
plate of spaghetti that's covered in sauce, think of it as live worms
sitting there on your plate and somebody wants you to eat it.''
</P>
<P>
Williams has been in two outpatient programs since leaving Renfrew
two years ago. She is in the care of a therapist and a nutritionist
and has forced herself not to pay attention to the numbers on her
scale.
</P>
<P>
In the movie's epilogue it becomes clear that all four women are
facing a lifelong struggle.
</P>
<P>
One tried to commit suicide after treatment, one lost 17 pounds,
and one left the clinic saying she didn't want to be helped. Even
Williams, who seemed to have the happiest ending, has setbacks.
</P>
<P>
``I may go three months and never purge,'' she said, ``and then
something may happen and you have a lot of stress and you have three
days where you just purge, purge, purge. And then you pull yourself
out of it.''
