Experts urge caution in talking to anorexics
</HEADLINE>

They became fast friends in college, sharing rides home and going to
parties. Then, month by month, year by year, Lisa Roy noticed her
friend getting thinner, alarmingly so.
</P>
<P>
"Like skin and bones," Roy recalled. The image haunted her so much
that she mustered the courage during a semester abroad to write to
her friend. "I apologize if I'm wrong," she wrote, but she hoped her
friend would seek help for her problem.
</P>
<P>
"That letter just woke me up," said the friend, an anorexic who wants
to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
The young woman did seek professional help. Six years later, she
still keeps the letter.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Americans notice friends or daughters going beyond
skinny to skeletal, and the urge to confront loved ones showing signs
of anorexia _ "Will you please just eat?!" _ can be powerful.
</P>
<P>
But mental health professionals counsel gentle persuasion over hard
lobbying. Friends and family need to realize that an anorexic looking
in the mirror does not see the same emaciated figure they do.
</P>
<P>
"You want to avoid getting into a full frontal assault because that
almost always ends badly," said Dr. Doug Bunnell, a clinical
psychologist and board president of the National Eating Disorders
Association.
</P>
<P>
Anorexia nervosa is a psychological disorder in which the sufferer
becomes exceedingly thin and still believes he or she is overweight.
Some exercise obsessively; others use laxatives or force themselves
to vomit.
</P>
<P>
Mental health officials have estimated that 0.5 percent to 3.7
percent of females will suffer from the potentially life-threatening
disorder in their lifetime. Males are also diagnosed with anorexia,
but at a much lower rate.
</P>
<P>
An excruciating feature of the disorder is that it can seem to unfold
in slow motion in front of friends and family as the sufferer gets
progressively thinner. Loved ones are typically tormented by the same
questions: Should I say anything? What do I say? When?
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gina Scarano-Osika, a psychologist, said anorexics need to be
made aware there is a problem before it becomes severe. But she
offers a crucial warning to friends: Do not try to "save" someone on
your own.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids think they can save the person themselves; if they
just meet and have sleep-overs and talk about this and teach them how
to eat, it will be OK," Scarano-Osika said. "It's not true."
</P>
<P>
Instead, she suggests talking to friends and family to organize an
intervention in a comfortable place. Friends should involve adults
such as parents, counselors, teachers _ someone the person trusts,
Scarano-Osika said. Bunnell advises having a folder at the ready with
names of medical professionals and helpful Web addresses.
</P>
<P>
Small groups are better, Scarano-Osika said, because the person may
be sheepish, embarrassed or defensive.
</P>
<P>
The eating disorders association cautions not to worsen the situation
with admonitions like "You just need to eat!" or "You are acting
irresponsibly." Try a softer tack, with phrases like "I'm concerned
about you." Be supportive.
</P>
<P>
"One of the hallmarks of the illness is denial of the illness,"
Bunnell said. "So if you go at someone really harshly or in a
confrontational way, you're just going to evoke a real defensive
reaction."
</P>
<P>
Lisa Roy tried to stay non-confrontational in her letter to her old
college friend. Other friends helped her find professional help.
</P>
<P>
An intervention does not always work the first time. Hard as it may
be to do so, Bunnell said, friends and family have to accept that
they are powerless. All they can do, he said, is keep speaking
honestly about their concerns.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot personally put yourself on the hook for it," he said.
