ANOREXIA NOT JUST MALADY OF YOUNG WOMEN

<P>
Mention anorexia and images of young women immediately come to mind:
Mary Kate Olsen, Tracy Gold, Jamie Lynn Discalia.
</P>
<P>
Not Bradlea Hecht.
</P>
<P>
She's 57, married, a mother of two. She's certainly not on a quest to
look like an A-list actress or pop star.
</P>
<P>
But she is anorexic and has suffered from the disease, and bulimia,
on and off since she was 14.
</P>
<P>
Years of claiming she wasn't hungry, eating small meals such as an
apple and a salad, running errands or taking a walk while her
co-workers went to lunch or purging when she ate more than made her
comfortable were all part of Hecht's routine.
</P>
<P>
"It's no longer about control or the desire to be skinny," says
Hecht. "Now it is a matter of shedding an ingrained habit."
</P>
<P>
Medical professionals say they see more and more adult women like
Hecht -- that is, those older than college age -- suffering from
eating disorders. Men, too, are being diagnosed as bulimic or
anorexic at an increasing rate, says Dr. Sharon Alger-Mayer, who
works in the division of clinical nutrition at Albany Medical Center
Hospital. As recently as 10 years ago it was a 1-to-10 male-to-female
ratio. Today it is 1-to-6.
</P>
<P>
According to research done by The Renfrew Center in Philadelphia, the
country's first free-standing and largest treatment facility for
eating disorders, the age distribution has changed: 23.5 percent of
the women treated at Renfrew are now over 35.
</P>
<P>
And the toll of the disease, which is defined as a mental illness,
goes beyond the emotional and physical effects felt by one person.
</P>
<P>
"When a person has an eating disorder, it becomes a family problem,"
Hecht says. "Because it affects you and all your loved ones."
</P>
<P>
Hecht says she doesn't talk about her eating disorder with her
children, but she knows they love her and want her to stop. Her
husband was her caretaker when her health got so bad she couldn't
walk herself to the bathroom. Eventually she was admitted to an
inpatient treatment facility.
</P>
<P>
While media images continue to create cultural definitions of beauty
associated with thinness, middle-aged women often experience other
stress-inducing problems, such as separation or divorce, empty-nest
syndrome and physical changes associated with their age, says
Alger-Mayer.
</P>
<P>
"These are triggers for some women to get reacquainted with an eating
pattern or coping style that worked for them while in college," says
Alger-Mayer.
</P>
<P>
Television shows such as "The Swan" or "Extreme Makeover" equate
thinness and beauty with happiness. Plus people can't go through a
typical day without hearing about the Atkins or South Beach diets.
These factors can act as reminders and cause the eating disorder to
resurface.
</P>
<P>
For Hecht, the eating disorders were part of her life for many years,
but she didn't admit it to herself, and others, until the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
"I was very secretive and ashamed. I would say 'I just don't like to
eat,"' she says. "Lying goes with the illness, until you are ready to
stop denying that you are ill."
</P>
<P>
And the shame can by magnified for older people, says Tully.
</P>
<P>
"Women can feel shameful because many of the behaviors -- like the
binging and purging chewing and spitting out and over-exercising --
are not understood," says Tully, who sees several adults with eating
disorders each week. "People fear they will be judged or that what
they are doing could possibly be a childish thing."
</P>
<P>
While the reasons for adult eating disorders vary widely, a majority
of sufferers, if not previously anorexic or bulimic, have dealt with
weight issues at some point in their lives, says Alger-Mayer.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, it's about continuing control, as is the case with
</P>
<P>
Albany's Rebecca Walker. The 29-year-old started restricting her food
consumption and exercising excessively while a freshman in college.
</P>
<P>
"I was somebody who did everything," says Walker, who was
valedictorian, prom queen and a three-sport athlete in high school.
"Then I went to college to play basketball and that, along with
(academics), became overwhelming."
</P>
<P>
It became clear, she says, that she wasn't going to be able to
achieve the way she had in high school.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I learned what I really enjoyed, I just performed. I
didn't see choices, I saw expectations."
</P>
<P>
The stress led her to control the one thing she could -- her body.
She could choose, or limit, what she ate and exercise often. Today,
anorexia is a part of her life, almost a routine.
</P>
<P>
"Especially as an adult, you know you are a smart person, and
intellectually it is the dumbest thing," says Walker. "Maybe I have
been successful in other ways, but I always feel I am not measuring
up."
</P>
<P>
Both Hecht and Walker are medically underweight but, as part of
ongoing therapy, prefer not to discuss numbers. Each has already
suffered some of the permanent effects associated with the disease --
which can include weakened hearts, severe osteoporosis, teeth that
break easily, brittle bones, loss of stamina and, most likely, a
shortened life span, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
"I am 57, but I have a body that is 75 or 80," Hecht says. Most
significantly, she says, the disease rules her social life. She does
not eat in restaurants or at other people's homes, unless it can't be
avoided.
</P>
<P>
She'd rather be home with her "safe foods," including grilled
chicken, hard-boiled eggs or tuna in water.
</P>
<P>
As each day goes by, full recovery becomes less and less likely for
these women, and others like them, experts say.
</P>
<P>
"Older sufferers build a strong identity around this," Tully says.
</P>
<P>
"To ask them to seek recovery, or make changes, is like whipping away
a security blanket."
