YOUR EATING DISORDER DOESN'T MEET OUR CRITERIA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine a 20-year-old woman who refuses to eat anything except
carrots and toast because she is afraid of gaining weight, even
though she is 5-foot-8 and weighs only 99 pounds. She exercises to
the point of exhaustion five mornings a week because, though she is
bone-thin, she thinks her thighs are too flabby. Her periods are
irregular, but she has never gone more than three months without
menstruating.
</P>
<P>
Another woman, who is also 20 and also 5-foot-8, has an opposite
eating pattern. She goes without eating all day, and starting at 6
p.m. she eats nonstop, whatever she can get her hands on. Her
favorite pastime is to sit in front of the television with a gallon
of mocha-chip ice cream. She maintains a normal weight of 130 by
occasionally forcing herself to vomit. But purging is not always easy
in her college dormitory, with four young women sharing a single
bathroom, so she ends up vomiting, on average, about once a week.
</P>
<P>
Everyone can agree that these women have some sort of disordered
eating.
</P>
<P>
But psychiatrists would say that neither one falls into the strict
definition of anorexia nervosa, the most severe eating disorder, or
its relative, bulimia nervosa. According to the bible of psychiatric
diagnosis, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual,anorexia must be accompanied by cessation of
menstrual periods for at least three months in a row, and bulimia
must involve vomiting or other forms of purging at least twice a
week, on average.
</P>
<P>
Instead these women, and thousands like them, would fall into a
category that doctors have been relying on for years, a vague
nondiagnosis known by the acronym EDNOS: eating disorder not
otherwise specified.
</P>
<P>
Diagnosing psychiatric conditions is more of an art than a science,
and the Not Otherwise Specified label reflects the imprecision of
that art. The American Psychiatric Association's manual has a Not
Otherwise Specified category for many disorders, whenever symptoms
are so vague, so mild or so untreatable that it doesn't seem to
warrant the full-fledged diagnosis. With the manual continually under
revision, the Not Otherwise Specified grab bag is the place where new
diagnoses emerge.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome, a variant of
autism, was pulled from a collection of disorders previously labeled
Pervasive Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified.
</P>
<P>
Much is at stake in whether a condition is elevated to the status of
a full-fledged diagnosis. Because no laboratory tests or other
objective criteria exist for making psychiatric diagnoses, the
American Psychiatric Association's manual is the definitive arbiter
of the line between normal and abnormal. Its definitions help
determine such practical matters as insurance reimbursement,
competence and eligibility for disability. But they also help
determine something more elusive, and probably more important:
whether someone's behavior should be considered a personality quirk
or a symptom of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
Now, in the diagnostic category of eating disorders, the search for
greater specificity in the Not Otherwise Specified grab bag is
generating much attention.
</P>
<P>
"The Future of EDNOS" was a topic at an international meeting on
eating disorders in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, last month, and it is
the title of a book expected to be released in Europe next year.
</P>
<P>
To some observers, this new attention comes not a moment too soon.
</P>
<P>
"EDNOS right now is a real hodgepodge," said Dr. B. Timothy Walsh,
professor of pediatric psychopharmacology at Columbia. "We have
people in that category with anorexia nervosa," but they still
menstruate so they don't meet all the criteria for a formal
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Walsh said, "we have people who are obese and binge but
don't vomit," so they don't fit into the strict definition of bulimia
nervosa, which requires both binging and purging. Or they might binge
and vomit once a week, but to qualify as bulimic they would have to
vomit at least twice a week.
</P>
<P>
"What we really need to do is collect data," Walsh said. "All the
knowledge base we currently have relates to people who vomit twice a
week. But if it turns out that the characteristics of those who binge
and vomit once a week are similar to those who do so twice a week,
then we can loosen the criteria for bulimia nervosa."
</P>
<P>
The history of eating disorders has been a gradual one as the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual has been revised through the years.
Anorexia nervosa first appeared in the version of the manual
published in 1980, and bulimia appeared for the first time in the
same edition. Bulimia was renamed bulimia nervosa in the next
edition, which came out in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Anorexia nervosa affects 0.5 to 3.7 percent -- or about 1.5 million
to 11 million American women -- at some point in life, according to
the National Institute of Mental Health. Rates are lower among men
and teenage boys.
</P>
<P>
The lifetime prevalence of bulimia is higher -- from 1.1 to 4.2
percent of women -- with a similar age and sex distribution.
</P>
<P>
In the current version of the diagnostic manual, published in 1994,
one condition -- binge eating disorder -- was pulled out of EDNOS and
listed as a "provisional diagnostic category," the first step in the
process of achieving its own diagnosis. The disorder is much like
bulimia nervosa, but without the purging.
</P>
<P>
The "provisional" designation highlights the need for more research
into a condition's prevalence and treatment, and highlighting binge
eating disorder in this way was a prelude to its being named as a
separate diagnosis in the manual that is to appear in 2012.
</P>
<P>
"That's one of most compelling reasons to get something out of the
Not Otherwise Specified category," said Dr. Michael First, associate
professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia. First is a member of
the planning group that is directing the enormous undertaking of
revising the manual for its fifth edition.
</P>
<P>
"If you feel that there's a homogeneous group of patients in there
for which there's a treatment, the fact that it's called Not
Otherwise Specified really obscures it, hindering treatment,
hindering research," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another candidate for a new eating disorder in the fifth edition of
the manual can be thought of as the flip side of binge eating, a
condition that has been labeled "purging disorder" by Dr. Pamela
Keel, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Iowa.
Just as binge eating disorder has many of the characteristics of
bulimia, so does purging disorder. But neither meets the strict
criteria for bulimia nervosa.
</P>
<P>
People with purging disorder, Keel said, are of normal weight, and
they purge after eating normal or even small amounts of food.
</P>
<P>
Right now, purging disorder is relatively hidden, buried in the EDNOS
category. And until the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual panelists
ask for more data, as they have for binge eating disorder, not much
more will be known, Keel said.
</P>
<P>
"Within widely used diagnostic interviews, if a person has never had
a low weight and denies a history of binge eating, the interviewer
skips all questions regarding the use of vomiting, laxatives or
diuretics to control weight," Keel wrote in an e-mail message. "It's
very difficult to learn more about a problem if you never ask any
questions about it."
</P>
<P>
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
As First sees it, several criteria must be met before a diagnosis is
pulled out of the Not Otherwise Specified category and into a
stand-alone diagnosis. These criteria have to be met before binge
eating disorder, purging disorder or any other condition emerges out
of the EDNOS grab bag.
</P>
<P>
The first requirement is that a significant number of patients must
be affected, he said. Second, there has to be evidence of an existing
and effective treatment.
</P>
<P>
The criterion of an effective treatment has prevented many conditions
from being entered in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. In the
1980s, there was an effort to include "sadistic personality
disorder." But it failed, said First, because no treatment existed.
"We could have decided to call something sadistic personality
disorder," he said, "but if there's no treatment, what would be the
point?"
</P>
<P>
The third criterion for removing a condition from the Not Otherwise
Specified category is the trickiest to meet. It relates to a kind of
diagnosis-creep. Experts working on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
panels must ask how close the condition is to behavior that could be
considered normal. For binge eating disorder, for instance, they must
ask: When is such behavior a true psychiatric condition, and when is
it the kind of thing that almost everyone engages in every
Thanksgiving?
</P>
<P>
"This is the matter of what we call false positives," First said.
"It's the danger of defining as a psychiatric syndrome a set of
symptoms that normal people have."
</P>
<P>
When a new category is created in the manual, he said, "you're trying
to identify a category that will help patients get treatment."
</P>
<P>
"But," he continued, "you're worried that this category is going to
be applied to normal people as well."
</P>
<P>
Some psychiatrists want to create a different label for EDNOS,
calling it instead "mixed eating disorder" or "atypical eating
disorder." But Walsh of Columbia said that would be merely a cosmetic
change.
</P>
<P>
"If I'm a clinician and I get a call from a school saying, 'Hey, I've
got a person with mixed eating disorder coming over,' I don't know if
I'm going to be seeing someone who weighs 80 pounds or 280 pounds,"
he said. "The whole belief that diagnoses are useful things rests on
their ability to put together under one umbrella a relatively
homogeneous set of syndromes, which gives the clinician the ability
to shortcut a full assessment."
</P>
<P>
Diagnostic labels, said Walsh, "allow big shortcuts."
</P>
<P>
Keel, on the other hand, prefers the term "mixed eating disorder"
over EDNOS. She said the mixed eating disorder label "may have the
benefit of eliminating the false impression that EDNOS is somehow
less severe or less clinically significant than so-called
full-threshold eating disorders." But she expressed concern that the
term would limit the enthusiasm for teasing out what other
identifiable conditions lie within the EDNOS category.
</P>
<P>
As experts debate what to do about EDNOS -- pull out distinct
disorders from the grab bag category, change the diagnostic criteria
for the existing disorder, give the grab bag a more
scientific-sounding name -- people with disordered eating are left in
a kind of therapeutic limbo.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the hope is, the uncertainties will be resolved, and the
woman with anorexia who still menstruates and the woman with bulimia
who only purges once a week, will be able to get the diagnosis and
treatment that they need.
