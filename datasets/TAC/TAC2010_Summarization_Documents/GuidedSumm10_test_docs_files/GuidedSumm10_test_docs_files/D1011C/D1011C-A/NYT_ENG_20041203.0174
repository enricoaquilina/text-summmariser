EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, DEC. 5 WASTING AWAY ON THE WEB

<P>
This is how Emma, 15, and a fan of Web sites promoting anorexia,
nearly starved herself to death:
</P>
<P>
She began by "eating healthy," she says, choosing salads and giving
up fast food. But when that wasn't enough, she went online to learn
how to lose more weight "safely." Or so she thought.
</P>
<P>
Emma, who once carried 150 pounds on her 5-foot-5 athletic frame and
was teased about being chunky, succeeded over a year's time in
dropping pounds, winning the praise of boys who thought she looked
hot and girls who envied her body. Yet the excessive dieting,
accompanied by breakneck exercising, nearly killed her.
</P>
<P>
From her bed in the intensive care unit at Children's Hospital of
Austin in August, Emma talked about her journey to be "perfect,"
which to her meant being rail thin. She was down to 96 pounds. Sunken
cheek bones. Deep-set eyes. Ribs protruding a bit. Her spine clearly
showing. Her menstrual cycle had stopped seven months earlier.
</P>
<P>
She had passed out at band practice. She couldn't keep warm. She wore
jackets in 90-degree heat. "My brain wasn't working. I couldn't think
straight," she recalls. Her vital organs, her heart in particular,
began shutting down.
</P>
<P>
At school, some classmates called Emma (not her real name)
"Skeletor." A lot was wrong. Her parents suspected anorexia for
months. They pushed her to eat. They monitored her weight. She
tricked them by strapping ankle weights under her pant legs, using
the advice of Web sites known collectively as "pro-Ana" (Ana is short
for anorexia).
</P>
<P>
The sites have been around for more than two years and are the
targets of groups such as the National Association of Anorexia
Nervosa and Associated Disorders. The association has had limited
success in persuading Internet providers to shut down the sites
because they can be harmful to minors, but the sites reappear through
other providers.
</P>
<P>
"Food is the drug we all must quit," wrote someone going by the name
of Thai in a pro-Ana journal. Next to the entry is a photo of a woman
in a crop top with every rib bone showing. That type of encouragement
alarms the anorexia association and other groups that are asking:
What can be more harmful than encouraging people to stop eating?
</P>
<P>
Type in the right search words on Google and nearly 5,000 results are
displayed. Many of the sites no longer exist, but many still offer
this type of advice: "Curl up in a ball if you have hunger pains."
"Clean something gross. You'll lose your appetite." When eating out,
"order something you know you hate." The encouragement is often
accompanied by photos of stick-like models. The images offer what the
sites claim is "thinspiration" in times of weakness.
</P>
<P>
Though Emma started dieting on her own, the sites pushed her over the
edge. "Ana's got me," she said in the hospital. "I know I need help.
I want help."
</P>
<P>
The strong-willed girl was confident this summer, cocky even, that
she was going to walk out of the hospital and get better through an
outpatient program. As motivated as she was in her quest to look
perfect, she was just as determined to beat the eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
"She looks like a Nazi war victim," her mother said at her bedside. A
former anorexic and bulimic who did not receive professional
treatment as a young woman, she had seen the signs for months. So had
her partner of 20 years, whom Emma calls "honey."
</P>
<P>
Emma talked openly and initially agreed her real name could be used
in the newspaper. She decided later to withhold her name to avoid
more stress on her family. She has a younger sister at home.
</P>
<P>
Describing how she survived on a dangerously low 300 calories a day,
the girl with an IQ of 143 says she became an expert on vitamin
supplements that helped keep her alive. She says she made "my
lifestyle choice" and was a "proud anorexic" -- the moniker for
pro-Ana followers.
</P>
<P>
Emma, who was in a foggy state when she was brought to the hospital,
somehow remembered to bring her "comfort foods" with her. Low
calorie, sugar-free maple syrup, low-calorie salad dressing and a
Diet Coke were displayed on top of a cabinet in her hospital room.
</P>
<P>
"As long as she wasn't eating them, I didn't see any harm," her
mother says. Emma left the hospital after eight days and began
counseling and participation in a peer treatment group.
</P>
<P>
Trapped in a world of food haters obsessed with body image, Emma had
explored the supportive Web sites and their chat rooms on her home
computer. "You start believing that starvation is good. Hunger pangs
made me happy," she says.
</P>
<P>
"People who go to these sites are motivated by the images. 'That's
what I want to look like,"' says Tracie Strucker, director of La Que
Sabe, a Central Texas eating disorders outpatient program. "They find
a community with a lot in common. Not only do they offer support and
encouragement to continue, but the sites offer competition for how
low they can weigh and how little they can eat. They are dangerous."
</P>
<P>
The hosts of such Web sites, experts think are female anorexics who
find support for their own conditions through the forums they lead.
"The payoff for someone who hosts a site is that it encourages them
to stay with their program," says Vivian Meehan, founder of the
National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders. In
October alone, the group persuaded Internet providers to remove 58
pro-Ana and pro-Mia (short for bulimia) sites.
</P>
<P>
Sites with names such as "House of Sins," "Starving for Perfection"
and "Bare to the Bones" convinced Emma that starvation was
fulfilling. They helped her find an identity, albeit one that led her
to the emergency room in Austin.
</P>
<P>
This week, Emma is finishing a 30-day program at an out-of-state
hospital that specializes in eating disorders. She struggled at first
and wanted to come back to Austin. In a letter home just before
Thanksgiving, she called the treatment center a "winter camp."
</P>
<P>
"It's exhausting, not physically, not emotionally. My mind has been
on a rollercoaster. I've been up, down, back, sideways, upside down.
I guess my biggest work has been in trying to create a secure
sanctuary at home so I can live a life without my eating disorder."
</P>
<P>
Her mother says, "I feel positive. She's gaining some weight and is
now talking more rationally. I'm encouraged."
</P>
<P>
Before she left home for treatment, Emma was feeling guilty that her
illness was stressing out her family. "I've cried a lot because I
look at what I'm doing to people who have tried to help me. That's
why I need to go. I can't do this to them anymore," she said.
</P>
<P>
She was convinced that her journey into self-imposed starvation would
somehow improve her life. "If anything, and after all this is over, I
will have learned to become a healthy eater," she said.
</P>
<P>
Despite her brush with death, she believed she was in control of one
thing: losing weight.
</P>
<P>
The beginnings of Emma's anorexia is a sensitive topic for her. She
won't divulge what spurred the dieting because she says she doesn't
want to hurt anyone's feelings. It started right after Sept. 11,
2001, by eating healthier food, and the pounds came off. She worked
out at a gym. Boys noticed her more, and the leaner body paid off on
the soccer field. "I was flying out there," she says.
</P>
<P>
The attention drove her to lose more weight. The striving for
perfection set in. "I told myself that being 5-5 and 118 pounds was
my ideal weight. That was going to make me perfect," she says.
</P>
<P>
When she reached 118, she was in the grasp of the disease. By early
last summer, she discovered the pro-Ana sites after watching a
documentary on television. She got on the Internet and scored
multiple hits when she typed in the appropriate search words. She was
fascinated by the discussion groups and the links to get more
information.
</P>
<P>
Emma saw the material as a real education in eating healthier.
Slowly, however, she heeded the advice that other site visitors
offered: Food is the enemy. She took dinner to her room and flushed
it down the toilet. She carried baggies with her to restaurants
during family meals to sneak the food off her plate.
</P>
<P>
"Looking back on it now, I learned to lie, and that was something I
didn't do before," she says. "That's what this disease does to you.
It's hell being deceitful."
</P>
<P>
The guilt of possibly failing in her mission to lose weight drove her
to stay focused. She couldn't stop. Her parents saw their daughter
wasting away and felt helpless.
</P>
<P>
"I can see now how bad they are," Emma says of the sites she once
frequented.
</P>
<P>
An array of doctors -- a family physician, a psychologist, an eating
disorders therapist and a nutrition counselor -- helped her begin her
battle against anorexia.
</P>
<P>
But Anne Ducharme-Jones, an Austin psychotherapist who specializes in
eating disorders and treated Emma, was not confident about the girl's
chances for successful recovery as an outpatient. She thought Emma
needed to go to an inpatient facility.
</P>
<P>
The turning point came in late October. Emma had been in treatment
for several weeks and had not gained a pound. In group therapy with
other teen girls, she admitted she had been hiding food. "One of her
peers turned to her and told her she needed to go to treatment,"
Jones says.
</P>
<P>
Emma says she realized how sick she was when she began stuffing food
down the sofa. "I know I was motivated to gain weight when I got out
of the hospital, but it wore off," she says. "I was back to being
deathly afraid of gaining weight. I looked in the mirror and I looked
OK, but when I saw still pictures of me I looked sick. Emaciated.
Gross."
</P>
<P>
The prognosis for Emma's recovery is guarded. "No one comes out of
such a treatment fixed," Jones says. "She's got a long way to go. It
may take 5 to 10 years. The family needs to know she's just getting
started."
</P>
<P>
To have a better chance at recovery, Emma and her family must deal
with complicated issues plaguing the family for years. Emma's mother
had a bout with alcoholism and sought treatment. The family has moved
around to several schools, including one in Florida, to get away from
harassment and physical threats made against Emma because she has two
gay moms.
</P>
<P>
The Tulane University-affiliated River Oaks Hospital Eating Disorders
Treatment Center in New Orleans uses several approaches
simultaneously in treating anorexics.
</P>
<P>
"We confront their body image distortion while teaching them to eat
normally so they can get to a normal body weight. Nutritional
counseling is a valuable part of the program," clinical director
Susan Willard says.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to stress, however, that eating disorders are not
about food and weight. Eating disorders are about problems and
conflicts that are unresolved in a person's life. The obsession with
one's body provides an escape from dealing with the real underlying
issues," Willard says.
</P>
<P>
Emma knows she must confront her past difficulties and family issues.
"I've learned that anorexia was a way for me to deal with my
problems. Anorexia was never about being skinny. I'm starting to feel
things again, like us moving around so much when I was younger. I
lost friends. My mom's alcoholism. Problems between my parents," she
says.
</P>
<P>
Her mother knows the challenges ahead involve not only Emma but also
her own relationship with her domestic partner. The couple is in
counseling. She is also facing her own past as an anorexic and
bulimic. "I never got the help that my daughter is getting now," she
says.
</P>
<P>
Meehan, of the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and
Associated Disorders, says the campaign to pull down sites promoting
anorexia will continue. She is appalled they get on the Internet in
the first place. "Providers have mission statements that they will
not support sites that can injure children. It is not the intention
of people who host these sites, but they are helping people commit
suicide," she says.
</P>
<P>
Search engine Yahoo declined to address pro-Ana sites specifically
but noted that a service agreement with members prohibits them from
posting any content that is unlawful or harmful.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Ana and pro-Mia sites also spurred an online movement to warn
people of the sites. Online search results for "pro-Ana" include
sites warning of the dangers of anorexia.
</P>
<P>
While several factors contributed to Emma's anorexia, she knows that
for the three months prior to her hospitalization, the pro-Ana sites
were instrumental in worsening her condition. "They're sick," she
says.
