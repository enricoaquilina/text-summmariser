Many baby boomers are in for a big
surprise.
</P>
<P>
"I think baby boomers were taught that if you ate right
and took those vitamins and exercised, you were never going
to grow old," says Ann Kearney-Cooke. "Now, all of a
sudden, they're getting older and struggling with natural changes."
</P>
<P>
A baby boomer herself at 49, Kearney-Cooke is a psychologist who
has written a book she hopes will help: "Change Your
Mind, Change Your Body: Feeling Good About Yourself After Age
40." (Atria Books, $14.)
</P>
<P>
The director of the Cincinnati Psychotherapy Institute, the author is a
frequent guest on TV and radio shows, including "CBS This
Morning," "Today," "Oprah" and "48 Hours."
</P>
<P>
About five or six years ago, Kearney-Cooke began noticing something disturbing
in her therapy sessions.
</P>
<P>
"I started to have more and more mid-life women who had
eating disorders,' she explains. "We traditionally think of anorexia and
bulimia affecting those of college or high school age, but
I found that they were also affecting two groups of
middle-aged women as well."
</P>
<P>
The first group included those who'd had an eating problem in
their youth but had resolved it. When they hit 50
and couldn't lose weight, it resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
The other group had no prior history of eating disorders, but
a life event -- a divorce, loss of parent or
job -- triggered an eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
For women who grew up with Twiggy and air-brushed photos, says
Kearny-Cooke, reality hasn't been easy. Many are dealing with depression
and loss of self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
But Kearney-Cooke says that needn't be the case.
</P>
<P>
"The main idea of my book is that you can't change
your relationship with food or your body until you change
the way you relate to people in general.
</P>
<P>
"The question is how, at mid-life, can you develop a stronger
and healthier body and self, not just be busy trying
to sculpt your body into impossible weights and shapes."
</P>
<P>
Begin, she advises, by establishing a realistic weight and shape for
yourself, based on genetics and how much time you're willing
to exercise.
</P>
<P>
"You can be sexy and attractive in mid-life, but that doesn't
mean you'll have to be the same size you were
when you got married," she says.
</P>
<P>
Kearney-Cooke says our culture has taught us that the more we
do, the more we'll get out of life.
</P>
<P>
But that's not the case.
</P>
<P>
"We have people doing more than ever," she says, "but they're
still feeling that life is passing them by."
</P>
<P>
The answer, she believes, is to become mindful of every moment.
</P>
<P>
"Put a spotlight on whatever you're doing," she says. "When you're
sitting with your son, if you are (really experiencing the
moment), that will lead to a feeling of fullness. The
same when you're listening to music -- close your eyes
and really take it in.
</P>
<P>
"The more you can slow down and pay attention, the fuller
you will feel, and you won't have to be turning
to food or alcohol."
