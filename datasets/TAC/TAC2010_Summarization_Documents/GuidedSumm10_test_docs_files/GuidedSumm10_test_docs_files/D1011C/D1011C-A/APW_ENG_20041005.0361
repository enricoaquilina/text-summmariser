'New era' for appetite-suppressing hormone, leptin; now eyed as
possible treatment for infertility
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An appetite-curbing hormone that failed to live up to its early buzz
as a possible key to slowing obesity is now being probed as a
potential aid for women who suffer from infertility and eating
disorders.
</P>
<P>
"This represents essentially a new era for leptin," said Dr. Jean
Chan, one of the researchers exploring new uses for the hormone. "Now
that we understand so much more about what this hormone does, we can
target it appropriately for the right condition."
</P>
<P>
A very small study, led by researchers at the Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center and at Massachusetts General Hospital and published
recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that leptin
restored menstrual periods in a few female athletes who hadn't had
periods for an average of 5 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
Authors of the study also said there were some preliminary signs that
the hormone improved bone density, which begins to decline when women
stop menstruating.
</P>
<P>
Women with low body fat, including athletes and those with eating
disorders, often stop menstruating, developing a condition called
hypothalamic amenorrhea.
</P>
<P>
The condition, caused by the way the brain regulates the reproductive
system, can also affect some women who are overly thin. Doctors
believe some of those cases are caused by stress. But in others, they
believe it may be caused by subtler changes in body composition
caused by diet and exercise.
</P>
<P>
The new work on leptin may offer clues to the condition's cause.
</P>
<P>
One function of leptin, which was discovered in 1994, is to regulate
appetite. It was originally thought that increasing leptin might
suppress the appetites of obese people. But studies found heavy
people tended to have plenty of leptin and adding more didn't help.
</P>
<P>
Researchers in the new study, which was funded by institutional
grants and Amgen, the developer of a drug based on the hormone, began
looking at people who may not have enough leptin because of low body
fat.
</P>
<P>
The researchers gave injections of Amgen's synthetic leptin to eight
competitive women athletes, all with hypothalamic amenorrhea. The
injections raised the women's leptin levels to those of normal women
or higher. Treatment was given until they responded or up to three
months, whichever came first. (One woman dropped out of the study.)
</P>
<P>
Five of the remaining seven showed promising results, according to
the study. Three of the women, one of whom had not had a period in 14
years, ovulated and had menstrual bleeding. Two others were "for all
intents and purposes about to ovulate," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said they envisioned possible fertility treatments, help
for thin athletes at risk of bone fractures, and restoration of
menstruation to patients recovering from anorexia.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Barbara Corkey, president of the North American Association for
the Study of Obesity and a professor of medicine and biochemistry at
Boston University, said the study had found a "creative use of
leptin," but she wasn't surprised.
</P>
<P>
"Leptin doesn't have only one function," she said. "It serves another
function and this highlights that."
</P>
<P>
Dr. William Schlaff, president of the Society for Reproductive
Endocrinology and Infertility and a professor at the University of
Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver, said the study was "very
nicely designed" and had made an "important first observation" that
needed further study. Ultimately, he speculated, it could lead to
advances that would help infertile women.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rexford Ahima, at the University of Pennsylvania School of
Medicine's Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, said
the study suggested that leptin is the signal that links fat tissue
to the brain and instructs it to control menstruation.
</P>
<P>
Ahima agreed that leptin might have potential as a fertility
treatment. But he had questions about its use as a treatment for
eating disorders, noting that anorexia is primarily a psychiatric
disorder whose root cause should be addressed before leptin is
considered.
</P>
<P>
Chan, at the Beth Israel medical center, said researchers are already
planning a longer study of a larger group of women.
