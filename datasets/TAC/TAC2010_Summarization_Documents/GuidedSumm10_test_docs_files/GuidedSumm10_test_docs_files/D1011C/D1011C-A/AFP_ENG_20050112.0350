BERLIN, Jan 12
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With her white chef's hat, Claudia looks 
at home in the kitchen of this Berlin restaurant, but her culinary 
talents are being used to feed people who, like her, suffer from 
eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
The owner of "Sehnsucht", or Nostalgia, in the German capital's 
Tiergarten quarter is Katja Eichbaum, and she too has come a long 
way back from the brink.
</P>
<P>
Her appetite began to disappear when her parents split up while 
she was a teenager. She lost 10 kilogrammes (22 pounds), then put 
the weight all back on again in no time and was admitted to hospital 
for three months in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Since then, a long period of therapy has begun bearing fruit, 
she explained recently, sitting on one of two huge lounge chairs 
placed in the restaurant's entrance to make the clients "feel at 
home".
</P>
<P>
Katja and Claudia consider that they have recovered and began 
helping others like them last month by opening the first restaurant 
in Germany, and perhaps in all of Europe, where anorexics and 
bulimics can eat without feeling ashamed.
</P>
<P>
Anorexia nervosa, from the Greek word meaning "loss of 
appetite", is an affliction stemming from a fear of gaining weight 
and leads sufferers to deny their hunger and essentially starve 
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Bulimia, which like anorexia is predominantly contracted by 
women, is a virtual food obsession that leads to eating binges 
followed by acts to make up for it like self-induced vomiting or 
excessive exercise.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that the girls take the first step, that 
they at least have a taste. They can also ask for small portions," 
said Eichbaum.
</P>
<P>
So that they don't feel stigmatised, nothing out front or in the 
entryway suggests that people are entering a restaurant that caters 
for those with special needs.
</P>
<P>
Indeed Sehnsucht is open to everyone, which helps the owners 
make money, at least enough to be encouraged by in the 
establishment's early stages.
</P>
<P>
The cooking? "Absolutely normal. Neither too little nor too 
much," said Eichbaum, who is keen, above all, to reassure her 
clientele.
</P>
<P>
Katja drew up the menu herself without any medical advice or 
help from a nutritionist. "I learnt how to eat again through my 
therapy," she said.
</P>
<P>
She has held down a number of different jobs and is convinced 
she can best help her clients, who often come in groups, like the 
members of the "Dick und duenn", or the Fat and Thin, association.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 or so people with eating disorders have hesitantly 
pushed their way through the doors at Sehnsucht in the month since 
it opened.
</P>
<P>
According to Thomas Falbesaner, a medical expert on anorexia and 
bulimia, the establishment could be helpful as "a reserved space for 
people who are returning to a normal life, but who are still 
sensitive about food."
</P>
<P>
The names of the dishes are often poetic. "Wolf's Hunger" 
describes a lamb dish, "d to make up five to 10 percent of anorexics but their 
numbers are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Some 600,000 people suffer from bulimia.
