ROME, Feb 1
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Italy's TV channels broadcast twice as many 
commercials featuring food as their US counterparts, threatening 
children who watch them with serious eating disorders such as 
bulimia and anorexia, according to a study published here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Children star in one out of every three commercials on Italian 
television, and 40 percent of all ads sell food products, according 
to the study by Rome's Sapienza university.
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Maria D'Alessio said her study "shows the threat 
caused by commercials aimed at children and featuring foodstuffs, 
because it distorts one's natural relationship with food".
</P>
<P>
"In the coming years, we will certainly have to face the problem 
of anorexia and bulimia," in Italian children.
</P>
<P>
D'Alessio said 40 commercials in every hour of programming were 
dedicated to food. "In the long term, this is very damaging for 
children."
</P>
<P>
The study -- based on two weeks of programming in March 2004 on 
Italy's six main private and state-owned chanels -- also confirmed 
that ads aimed at children encourge stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
"Boys starring with their mothers are shown eating, while girls 
watch their mothers do the housework."
