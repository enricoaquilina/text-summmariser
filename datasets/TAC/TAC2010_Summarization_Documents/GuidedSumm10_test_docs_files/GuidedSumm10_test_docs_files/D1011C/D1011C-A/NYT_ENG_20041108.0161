DAUGHTER'S STRUGGLE WITH BULIMIA SPURS WOMAN TO ACTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WACO, Texas
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Her gnarled knuckles, marred with cracked skin, made Amanda Meador's
hands look more like those of a seasoned car mechanic than of a
17-year-old.
</P>
<P>
But the damage didn't come from turning wrenches in tight quarters
under the hood of a car. It came from shoving her fingers down her
throat six to 10 times a day. The gag reflex caused her teeth to
clamp down as she yanked her hand out, biting into her fingers as she
vomited.
</P>
<P>
Purging that many times a day caused Amanda to lose 60 pounds in
about a year's time. It almost caused her death. Following Christmas
break during her senior year in high school, she was hospitalized for
dehydration, low blood pressure and low blood sugar.
</P>
<P>
That's what bulimia does.
</P>
<P>
"That is such a gross disease," said Amanda's mother, Dawn Montaner.
"You can't imagine anybody wanting to throw up."
</P>
<P>
According to the National Eating Disorder Association, about 7
million U.S. females and 1 million males suffer from an eating
disorder. Anorexia and bulimia typically begin in early to
mid-adolescence. About one out of every five people with an eating
disorder will die from the disease.
</P>
<P>
While bulimics purge what they eat, anorexics essentially starve
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Montaner had been warned months before by one of her daughter's
teachers that Amanda might have an eating disorder. Montaner, who
thought the weight loss was from rigorous exercise and reduced food
portions, was just glad her daughter was looking better.
</P>
<P>
The teen kept purging until she was caught by her brother, who told
their mother. Montaner said she still couldn't believe it, but this
time she confronted her daughter.
</P>
<P>
"I will never forget the look in her face," Montaner said. "It was
just empty. There was no fear of being caught; it was just empty.
Then she admitted that she threw up several times a day at school."
</P>
<P>
Montaner said she sat in horror as her daughter detailed how easy it
was to eat between classes at school, then go to the bathroom after
class started and force herself to vomit. Soon after, Montaner
learned that Amanda had also begun self-mutilation by cutting
herself, a behavioral step not uncommon in people with eating
disorders, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
That was more than six years go. Amanda Meador, now Amanda Harsh, is
married, has two children, and lives in Savannah, Ga. She's eating
right and healthy, Montaner said, but the recovery process has been
fraught with frustration, expensive therapy and a relapse after the
children were born.
</P>
<P>
When Montaner looked for help, she found that at the time, Waco did
not have a specialist in eating disorder therapy. When a hospital
psychiatrist recommended that her daughter go to an acute-care center
for treatment, Montaner discovered that Texas had no such facility
dedicated to eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
She found one in Arizona, but it cost thousands of dollars per week
for a mandatory 60-day stay and would not accept her daughter without
$25,000 up front. Montaner, her husband and her ex-husband, Amanda's
father, all had health insurance, but the three plans together didn't
come close to covering the cost of treatment.
</P>
<P>
She settled for a facility in Florida that the family could afford.
During her daughter's 45-day stay, Montaner's anger turned to action.
</P>
<P>
"You didn't hear anything about it in schools. You heard about safe
sex, drugs, AIDS ... but you never heard anything about eating
disorders. That's when I decided to start Lifelines."
</P>
<P>
Montaner established the nonprofit Lifelines Foundation for Eating
Disorders with the goal of establishing the first acute-care facility
in Texas dedicated solely to treating eating disorders. She plans on
calling it "The Haven." She has written hundreds of letters,
including one to first lady Laura Bush that led to Montaner's being
appointed to the adolescent health committee for the Texas Department
of Health.
</P>
<P>
When word about Amanda's ordeal got around her school, five of her
classmates who also had eating disorders came forward, Montaner said.
Using grant money to help with expenses, Montaner began traveling the
state, speaking at other schools about eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
"I have heard one resounding theme," she said. "School nurses and
counselors don't have the information needed when a student, teacher,
coach or family member comes to them for help."
</P>
<P>
Montaner decided to do something about it. With an anonymous $64,000
donation, she had enough educational materials published to send to
all 20 Education Service Centers in Texas. But for now, the materials
are sitting on the same 11 pallets they were shipped to her on.
Montaner is trying to raise the estimated $40,000 needed to get the
items distributed.
</P>
<P>
Heidi Strickler, an eating disorder specialist at Providence
Healthcare Network's DePaul Center who arrived after Montaner started
Lifelines, helped write the materials.
</P>
<P>
"I'm the only specialist in the area," Strickler said. "Not many
therapists want to deal with it because eating disorders have the
highest mortality rate of any mental illness, and the patients are
extremely difficult to work with."
</P>
<P>
The materials include handouts, posters and booklets with information
on the disease, how to get help and, most importantly, Montaner said,
contact information on each piece.
</P>
<P>
"The materials are designed to be available to the kids so that they
can pick one up and they don't have to talk to anybody," she said.
"They don't have to ask anybody for anything. They can pick one up
and take it home."
</P>
<P>
According to the NEDA, 80 percent of adolescent girls feel bad about
their bodies, and 28 percent of boys are dissatisfied with their
weight. Poor body image dating back to a swim meet Amanda won when
she was 7 led to her battle with eating disorders, Montaner said.
</P>
<P>
"She climbed out of the pool, and some kid standing nearby said,
'Gee, I didn't know Shamu was swimming today,' " Montaner said.
"There was also an incident not long after that when she was in choir
and someone told her she should be wearing a tent rather than a robe.
All those kinds of memories came out in therapy years later."
</P>
<P>
Other battles Montaner has waged include seeking a change in state
legislation that would force insurance companies to pay for treatment
of eating disorders. So far the insurance lobby has blocked attempts
to have anorexia and bulimia added to the list of serious mental
illnesses that insurance companies are mandated to cover, which
includes schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, people like Amanda will continue the daily struggle
to keep their disorder in check. For now, she's winning, and the only
thing adorning her fingers these days is a wedding ring with the
words "I Love You," from husband Ronnie Harsh.
