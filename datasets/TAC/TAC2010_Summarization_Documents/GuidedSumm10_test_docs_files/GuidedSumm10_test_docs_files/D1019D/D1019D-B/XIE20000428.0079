Manila, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
exhaust all peaceful means to resolve the Sulu hostage crisis
since the 20 hostages were abducted from a diving resort in Sabah,
Malaysia, the military said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Acting Armed Forces chief of staff Jose Calimlim told reporters
that he received a lot of inquiries from foreign ambassadors based
in Manila asking about the condition of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Calimim said he assured them that the government will exert all
efforts for the safe release of the hostages as soon as possible,
but he refused to give a timetable.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to set a time frame when the hostages would be
freed," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Calimlim, the hostages are being guarded by about
40 to 50 gunmen in Talipao in the southern Philippine island
province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
However, this does not include the relatives of the kidnappers
residing in the area who are expected to help secure the hostages,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim note that government soldiers have sealed off the area
to prevent the kidnappers from escaping.
</P>
<P>
Gov. Nur Misuari of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (
ARMM),who was appointed as chief negotiator, is negotiating with
the kidnap group for the safe release of the hostages, including
18 foreigners and two Filipinos, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the fourth day of the Sulu hostage-crisis, he added, Misuari
and his emissaries are trying to establish contact with the
kidnappers.
