<HEADLINE> Ailing Hostages Plead for Water  </HEADLINE>

   TALIPAO, Philippines (AP) -- The 21 hostages suffered from hunger
and diarrhea, and some pleaded for water. One said she could not
walk and wept in a bamboo hut where she and the others are being
held by Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages, including 10 foreign tourists, beamed Monday when
a doctor and several journalists arrived at the hut, 45 minutes
from the nearest road in the hills of a southern Philippine island.
</P>
<P>
   About 50-70 heavily armed Abu Sayyaf rebels, their faces covered
with hoods, guarded the area on Jolo island in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please give us water,'' several hostages beseeched the
visitors. Many complained of diarrhea from the unclean water and
meager food provided by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a doctor has seen the hostages since they
were abducted by boat from a Malaysian resort eight days ago -- one
of two kidnapping standoffs now ongoing in the Philippines'
southern islands.
</P>
<P>
   On the nearby island of Basilan, another group of Abu Sayyaf
rebels were able to escape with their 27 hostages when government
troops overran their mountain base this weekend, the military
admitted Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The army had been besieging the rebel base for days, trying to
rescue the hostages, mostly women and children who have been held
for more than a month. The abductions are not thought to be
directly coordinated.
</P>
<P>
   On Jolo, the hostages ate rice and cassava root as they lay on
the floor of the hut. The rebels allowed a provincial health
officer, Dr. Nelsa Amin, to bring them medicine, accompanied by
several reporters.
</P>
<P>
   One hostage, Renate Juta from Germany, twisted a towel with her
hands as she cried. She said she was unable to walk because of a
knee injury and had diarrhea and infections.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages include tourists from Germany, France, South
Africa, Finland and Lebanon, and resort workers from the
Philippines and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   The hut appeared to be different from a hut in which videotapes
of the hostages were taken Saturday, suggesting the captives had
been moved. The rebels, however, refused to allow such questions.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages asked the Philippine military to halt operations
near the hut, saying they had been awoken several nights earlier
and forced to walk barefoot to another location because of nearby
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Jolo is about an hour by boat from the Malaysian island of
Sipadan, the diving resort where the tourists were kidnapped Easter
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Consuls from the French, German and Finnish embassies delivered
11 boxes of medicine, clothes and food Monday to a Muslim official
who is serving as a go-between with the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   The consuls met for more than an hour with Nur Misuari, the
government negotiator, and rejected a rebel demand for direct
negotiations with ambassadors from the captives' countries.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two groups fighting for an
independent Islamic nation in the impoverished southern
Philippines, the homeland of the country's Muslim minority.
</P>
<P>
   On Basilan, about 50 miles northeast of Jolo, military officers
said a search of the captured Abu Sayyaf base had not found the
hostages or their captors. ''It appears that the rebels managed to
escape,'' Col. Ernest de Guzman said.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the base Sunday, soldiers searched a tunnel complex
in the mountain base. They found children's sandals, generators,
weapons and 100 sacks of rice in the 650-foot tunnel, Col. Hilario
Atendido said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that we did not see the hostages was both good and
bad,'' Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said. ''Bad because we
were hoping they would be there. But the fact they are not there
indicates they are alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The hostages were among about 50 seized by the rebels from two
schools on March 20 for use as human shields after an attack on a
military outpost. The rebels later released some hostages, and
claimed two weeks ago to have beheaded two captives after the
government rejected some of their demands.
