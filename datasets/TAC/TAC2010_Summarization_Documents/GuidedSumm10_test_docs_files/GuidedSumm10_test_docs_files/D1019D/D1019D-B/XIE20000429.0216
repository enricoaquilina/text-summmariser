MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Muslim extremist
group Abu Sayyaf has threatened to behead some of the 21 hostages
they abducted last Sunday in Malaysia because they do not want to
talk with a government negotiator.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Zamboanga City, the southern
Philippines,an Abu Sayyaf spokesman told Radio Mindanao Network
Friday night that Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region
of Muslim Mindanao, is unacceptable as negotiator.
</P>
<P>
He said his group wants to talk with the ambassadors of the
countries to which their captives belong.
</P>
<P>
The hostages are 10 Malaysians, three Germans, two French, two
South Africans, two Finns, one Lebanese and one Filipino. The
hostages,who were abducted by Abu Sayyaf in a resort in Sipadan,
Malaysia,Sunday night, are now in the Philippines' Sulu Province.

<P>
"Misuari is trying to divide and rule us. Because of this we
decided tonight (Friday) to rejected Misuari as the government
negotiator," the spokesman said. "Instead we demand the
ambassadors of the respective countries of these captives to
negotiate with us,and if they do not want, we will behead some of
the foreigners to teach them a lesson."
</P>
<P>
"We will execute the foreign captives and we will embarrass the
Philippine government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Philippine government said it will exhaust all
peaceful means to resolve the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Acting Armed Forces Chief of Staff Jose Calimlim told reporters
that he received a lot of inquiries from foreign ambassadors based
in Manila about the condition of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim said he assured them that the government will exert
all efforts for the safe release of the hostages as soon as
possible, but he refused to give a timetable.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to set a time frame when the hostages would be
freed," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Calimlim, the hostages are being guarded by about
40 to 50 gunmen in Talipao in the southern Philippine island
province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim noted that government soldiers have sealed off the
area to prevent the kidnappers from escaping.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf group, reckoned to number no more than 500, is
reportedly the most violent rebel group in the Philippines.
