<HEADLINE> Manila Not to Replace Negotiator for Hostage Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that it will not replace Nur Misuari as its chief
negotiator for the release of 21 hostages held by the Muslim
extremist group Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
Unless directed by President Joseph Estrada, the government
will not replace Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region of
Muslim Mindanao, as the chief negotiator, National Security
Adviser Alexander Aguirre told reporters here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as "mere propaganda" the threats made by the Abu
Sayyaf group Friday to behead foreign hostages if Misuari, former
leader of Moro National Liberation Front rebels, will not be
replaced as the negotiator.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado also said that no rebel group
could dictate the government who it wants to send as the
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf threatened Friday to behead some of the 21
hostages they abducted last Sunday in Malaysia, because they do
not want to talk with Misuari.
</P>
<P>
An Abu Sayyaf spokesman said that Nur Misuari is unacceptable
as the negotiator and his group wants to talk with the ambassadors
of the countries to which their captives belong.
</P>
<P>
The hostages are 10 Malaysians, three Germans, two French, two
South Africans, two Finns, one Lebanese and a Filipino. The
hostages, who were abducted by the Abu Sayyaf in a resort in
Sipadan, Malaysia, Sunday night, are now in the Philippines' Sulu
Province.
</P>
<P>
"Misuari is trying to divide and rule us. Because if this we
decided tonight (Friday) to reject Misuari as the government
negotiator," the spokesman said. "Instead we demand the
ambassadors of the respective countries of these captives to
negotiate with us, and if they do not want, we will behead some of
the foreigners to teach them a lesson."
</P>
<P>
"We will execute the foreign captives and we will embarrass the
Philippine government," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the government said that it will exhaust all peaceful
means to resolve the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Acting Armed Forces Chief of Staff Jose Calimlim told reporters
that he received a lot of inquiries from foreign ambassadors based
in Manila asking about the condition of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim said he assured them that the government will exert
all efforts for the safe release of the hostages as soon as
possible, but he refused to give a timetable.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to set a time frame when the hostages would be
freed," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Calimlim, the hostages are being guarded by about
40 to 50 gunmen in Talipao in the southern Philippine island
province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim noted that government soldiers have sealed off the
area to prevent the kidnappers from escaping.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf group, reckoned to number no more than 500, is
the most violent rebel group in the Philippines.
