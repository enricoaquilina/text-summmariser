<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Philippines search for hostages kidnapped from divingresort  </HEADLINE>

   SEMPORNA, Malaysia (AP) -- Authorities hunted the seas between
Malaysia and the Philippines today for two fishing boats controlled
by heavily armed men holding 21 hostages they abducted from a
Malaysian diving resort two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapping might be tied to Muslim rebels in the Philippines
who are seeking the release of militants jailed in the United
States, although some authorities said the Abu Sayyaf rebels were
just trying to attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our group is behind the abduction of the foreigners (in
Malaysia) and there are still a lot of surprises for the government
if they won't listen to us,'' Abu Sayyaf spokesman Abu Ahmad told
Philippine radio station DXRZ.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, however, Ahmad said he would neither
confirm nor deny his group was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were searching today for the hostages -- half of whom
are foreign tourists. They were taken Sunday night from lush
Sipadan Island off the northern Borneo state of Sabah.
</P>
<P>
   A police intelligence report said the hostages were taken to the
province of Sulu at the southern tip of the Philippines, no more
than an hour's boat ride from Sipadan. But Lt. Edgar Joseph Andres,
a navy pilot, said he found nothing in a three-hour search of the
sparsely inhabited area today.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysian officials said today that the kidnappers were believed
to be outside Malaysian waters.
</P>
<P>
   A waitress from the Philippines who escaped the abduction added
weight to the Muslim rebels' claim that they were involved. Jeneth
Cagaanan said when one of the men grabbed her, she replied to him
in Suluk -- the language prevalent in the southern Philippines -- and
that he understood her.
</P>
<P>
   Cagaanan also said one of the assailants wore a vest emblazoned
with the initials of the Moro National Liberation Front, the
Philippines' largest Muslim rebel group before it signed a peace
accord in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Five people were being questioned in connection with the
abduction, Sabah chief of police Mamat Talib said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said some of those arrested were former employees of the
Sipadan resort and were tied to the Filipino fishing community
along Sabah's eastern coastline.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Sipadan began Sunday when six masked gunmen,
carrying AK-47s and a rocket launcher, grabbed tourists and workers
and confiscated their cash and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen then forced their hostages to swim to two fishing
boats, which sped away and appeared to be heading toward Philippine
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitnesses said two of the captives -- James and Mary Murphy,
both 51, of Rochester, N.Y. -- escaped after James Murphy told the
assailants his wife didn't know how to swim. When the kidnappers
turned around, the American couple ran into the bushes and hid
until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   In the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, James Murphy declined
today to talk extensively about his ordeal. ''We don't want our
comments to overshadow anything that's going on with the
situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages forced onto the fishing boats included tourists --
two French, three Germans, two South Africans, two Finns and one
Lebanese -- and nine Malaysians who either worked at the resort or
for the wildlife service. One was a Filipino resort employee and
the nationality of the 21st hostage wasn't immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   Another hostage situation was escalating in a remote area of the
southern Philippines, about 275 miles north of Semporna, the port
from which tourists take boats for Sipadan. On the island province
of Basilan, troops shelled Abu Sayyaf camps again today as soldiers
battled their way up a mountain where the rebels were holding 27
Filipinos captive.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Calimlim, chief of intelligence for the Philippine
military, said an air force plane and navy boats were searching
Philippine waters near Malaysia for the hostages captured Sunday.
He doubted the Abu Sayyaf claim of credit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a part of their propaganda because they are really
trying to attract attention, especially international attention,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have demanded the freedom of Arab terrorist suspects
in U.S. jails, including Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993
bombing of the World Trade Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad insisted Malaysia was still a
safe tourist destination. The Sabah economy relies heavily on the
400,000 people who visit its beach resorts and rain forests every
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't get this kind of thing happening in Malaysia very
often,'' Mahathir said. ''It will affect tourism in Sabah, but the
rest of the country is not affected by this. Malaysia is very safe
for tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be of little comfort to Yee Mui Phia, a guide at
Sipadan Dive Center who sat today in his empty office in Semporna.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are scared,'' he said. ''And what's more important, it will
affect our business.''
