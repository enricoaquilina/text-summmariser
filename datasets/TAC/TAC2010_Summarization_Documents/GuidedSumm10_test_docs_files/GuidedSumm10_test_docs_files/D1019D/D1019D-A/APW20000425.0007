<HEADLINE> Rebels Take Blame For Kidnappings  </HEADLINE>

   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels who have been
holding 27 Filipinos hostage at a remote mountain stronghold in the
Philippines claimed responsibility Tuesday for also abducting about
20 people from a nearby Malaysian tourist island.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine officials, however, expressed skepticism over the
claim by the extr%miqt Abu Sayyaf rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The claim came as troops battled their way up the densely
forested mountain in the Philippines where the Muslim extremists
were holding their captives.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopter gunships pounded three outlying Abu Sayyaf camps with
rockets again Tuesday, said Lt. Gen. Diomedio Vildanueva, chief of
the military's Sguthern Command. He said the ground troops were
pursuing fleeing rebels, and the troops next plan to advance to the
main stronghold further up the mountain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The assault, which began Saturday, has been slowed by heavy
vegetation and by land mines, which have forced the troops to
employ metal detectors, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As that assault progressed, about 20 people, including foreign
tourists, were abducted Sunday night by heavily armed attackers on
a nearby Malaysian island and taken by boat toward the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine officials initially said they were investigating
possible links to the Abu Sayyaf. Police there said the kidnappers
in Malaysia spoke Tausug, a language spoken in parts of the
southern Philippines, but not in Basilan, where the Abu Sayyaf
rebels operate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our group is behind the abduction of the foreigners (in
Malaysia) and there are still a lot of surprises for the government
if they won't listen to us,'' Abu Sayyaf spokesman Abu Ahmad said
in an interview over local radio station DXRZ.
</P>
<P>
   The government has refused several rebel demands, including the
release of three Arab terrorists held in jails in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said the military
is still determining whether the Abu Sayyaf is actually responsible
for the Malaysian abductions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't just jump and believe the Abu Sayyaf immediately. We
will verify and confirm this,'' he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 hostages, including foreign tourists and local resort
workers, were abducted late Sunday from Malaysia's Sipadan Island
by six heavily armed men and taken on two fishing boats toward the
Philippines, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The 27 Filipino hostages -- who include many schoolchildren -- are
believed to be held at the main rebel stronghold further up the
mountain, which Villanueva said his forces were avoiding shelling
to prevent injuries to the captives.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a hostage situation and we're considering the safety
of the hostages to give them the best chance to survive,''
Villanueva said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 Abu Sayyaf rebels and four soldiers have died in the
fighting in the hinterlands of the southern island province of
Basilan. The rebels have warned they will behead their five
remaining adult male hostages -- including a priest -- if the
military does not halt its assault.
</P>
<P>
   The group also announced last week that it had beheaded two male
teachers. The rebels, who are fighting for an independent Islamic
state in the predominantly Catholic Philippines, are demanding the
release of Muslim militants jailed in the United States, including
the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller but more radical of two Muslim
groups fighting for an independent state in the Philippines. It has
been blamed for numerous attacks on Christians.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel spokesman said two hostages, including a child, were
injured in the shelling of the rebel camp, but the claim could not
be independently verified.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages have been forced to stay in unprotected shacks
while the rebels have taken refuge in bunkers, a hostage told
ABS-CBN television in an interview by cellular telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Suspected Abu Sayyaf rebels attacked an army outpost in Jolo in
nearby Sulu province late Sunday, injuring seven soldiers and five
civilians, Sulu police chief Candido Casimiro said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels originally seized more than 50 hostages, including
many children, from two schools in Basilan on March 20 for use as
human shields after attacking another army outpost. About half of
the hostages have since been freed.
</P>
<P>
   The group has demanded freedom for World Trade Center bomber
Ramzi Yousef, and Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, accused of conspiring to
blow up New York City landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   The demands were rejected by the Philippine government and by
the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation for the abduction, a group of vigilantes seized
11 relatives of Abu Sayyaf leader Khadaffy Janjalani. They still
held nine relatives after freeing Janjalani's pregnant wife and a
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department has included the Abu Sayyaf in a list
of 28 foreign groups that threaten Americans at home or abroad.
