<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 20 people were
taken hostage by six heavily armed men Sunday night from Sipadan
island off Sabah, East Malaysia, but their motives behind the
abduction are yet to be confirmed, Malaysian Police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
While police could not yet confirm the captors' motives,
politics, ransom and feelings of dissatisfaction were among the
possible reasons, Malaysian Police Inspector-General Norian Mai
told a news conference here at the federal police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"We seriously feel that politics may be a reason," he said.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility that the kidnapping was
connected to the Abu Sayyaf rebel group which was holding several
hostages in southern Philippines. "There is a possibility."
</P>
<P>
He said police had not made any contact with the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
It was however confirmed that among the hostages, there are 11
foreigners -- three Germans, two South Africans, two French
nationals, two Finns, one Lebanese and one Filipino while the rest
nine are Malaysians comprising four workers of the Wildlife
Department, three workers of the Sipadan resort center, a
policeman and a staff of Syarikat Borneo Divers.
</P>
<P>
According to Norian, an American couple, both aged 51, who were
captured together with the 20 people, managed to escape before
they were forced into a boat.
</P>
<P>
They fled into the jungles and emerged Monday morning, and
their condition was good and they were not injured, he said.
</P>
<P>
Norian said the armed men raided the police base on the island
before capturing the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"They came in two 'jongkong' boats, and when fleeing with the
hostages they used only one jongkong boat and seized a boat
belonging to the resort center. Their other boat was left behind,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A special team has been set up by the Malaysian police to
rescue the hostages and the Malaysian police are in contact with
their counterparts in Southern Philippines in efforts to track
down the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
said earlier Monday Malaysian security forces are in hot pursuit
of the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
He said the authorities are determined to secure the release of
the foreign tourists and local residents held hostage. "Freeing
them is uppermost," he added.
</P>
<P>
Describing the incident as unexpected, Abdullah said it should
prompt the police to review the security of territorial waters off
Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar also
held a news conference earlier Monday on the incident, saying that
all the 20 people taken hostage by armed pirates were safe.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said the names of the hostages would be released by
the Malaysian police.
</P>
<P>
He said the incident was an "isolated" case and it was safe for
people to visit Sipadan island, a resort popular with scuba-divers.
