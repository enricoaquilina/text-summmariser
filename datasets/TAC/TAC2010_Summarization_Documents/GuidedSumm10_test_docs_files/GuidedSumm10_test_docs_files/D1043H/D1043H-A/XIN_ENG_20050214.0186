<P>
Former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in central Beirut on 
Monday, Lebanese officials and medical sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hariri died at American University Hospital, while former 
Minister of Justice Samir al-Jisr and former Minister of Economy 
and Trade Basil Fuleihan, who were traveling in Hariri's convoy, 
survived the blast.
</P>
<P>
At least eight others were also killed, including some of 
Hariri's bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, apparently caused by a car bomb, occurred around 
1:00 p.m. (1100 GMT), when Hariri's motorcade of four black 
limousines escorted by jeeps was passing by in the seafront area of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
Security forces sealed off the scene, where a big crater was 
gouged by the explosion.
</P>
<P>
It appeared to be the biggest bomb in the city since Lebanon's 
civil war ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, 60, a Sunni Muslim, resigned last October. He came to 
office first in 1992 and headed five governments over 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Hariri had joined a chorus of objection to interference in 
Lebanon's internal affairs.
