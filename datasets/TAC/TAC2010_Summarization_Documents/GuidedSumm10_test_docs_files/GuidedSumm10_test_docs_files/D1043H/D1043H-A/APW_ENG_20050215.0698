<P>
Saudi Arabia on Tuesday rejected a French demand for an international
investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri, saying Lebanon is an independent country.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, speaking at a joint press
conference with French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier, said: "Lebanon is an
independent country and its judiciary is independent."
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese people will be the protectors of the fairness of the
investigation, especially if this case is dealt with the required transparency,"
Saud said.
</P>
<P>
Hariri had many business interests in Saudi Arabia, where he made his fortune in
construction, and was a close friend of the Saudi royal family.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has also rejected calls for an international investigation.
</P>
<P>
Barnier said France would continue to work toward achieving its demand for an
international investigation.
</P>
<P>
Hariri was assassinated in a huge bomb blast Monday, which also killed 16 other
people and injured about 120.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, French President Jacques Chirac, a friend of Hariri, demanded
an international investigation, saying the slain man represented "the
indefatigable will of independence, freedom and democracy" for
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Herve Ladsous said the U.N. Security
Council was working on a demand that the Lebanese government bring to justice
those responsible for the assassination of Hariri.
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes well, this declaration should be finalized in the day and
adopted" Tuesday, Ladsous said.
</P>
<P>
In the press conference, Saud dismissed a responsibility claim by a previously
unknown group for Hariri's assassination as "ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
The group, Support and Jihad in Syria and Lebanon, claimed in a video broadcast
on Al-Jazeera television that it had carried out the bombing, saying it was a
suicide operation to avenge the death of "its brothers" in Saudi Arabia. It said
Hariri was targeted because "he was an agent" for Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"This is ridiculous talk and shouldn't be answered. This is a crime against the
Lebanese people and a crime against Lebanon and cannot be justified under any
pretext," Saud said.
