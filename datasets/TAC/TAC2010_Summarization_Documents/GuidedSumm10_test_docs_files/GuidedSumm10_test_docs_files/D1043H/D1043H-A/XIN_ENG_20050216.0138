Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese 
mourners gathered at the Mohamed Al Amin Mosque in the capital 
Beirut on Wednesday to pay last tribute to former Prime Minister 
Rafik al-Hariri killed in a suicide car bombing on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hariri was buried in the unfinished mosque which he had financed
after the mass funeral procession escorting an ambulance carrying 
Hariri's coffin covered with national flag marched through the main
streets to the mosque in central Beirut.

<P>
French President Jacques Chirac was due to arrive in Beirut on 
Wednesday to present his condolences to the family of Hariri but 
appeared unlikely to attend the funeral in time.
</P>
<P>
Among foreign dignitaries at the funeral were EU foreign policy 
chief Javier Solana, US Assistant Secretary of State William Burns 
and Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa as well as other Arab 
and European ministers.

<P>
Hariri, 60, died on Monday when his motorcade was blown up by a 
suicide car bomber in western Beirut seafront. At least 14 others 
were killed.
</P>
<P>
It was too early to say who killed Hariri who resigned as prime 
minister last October though oppositions held Syria and its allied 
Lebanese government responsible for Hariri's murder.
</P>
<P>
The bombing has also led to renewed international pressure led 
by the US and France for Syria to withdraw its 14,000 troops from 
neighboring Lebanon.
