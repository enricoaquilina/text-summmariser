The crowd began massing quietly in front of
Rafik Hariri's mansion in the early dawn hours Wednesday as
Lebanon prepared to bury him and the six bodyguards who
were killed with him in a bomb blast on Monday.
</P>
<P>
They came from throughout the country in an emotional and politically
charged tribute to Hariri, the former prime minister, billionaire developer
and architect of Lebanon's revival from a devastating 15-year civil
war. Some climbed lampposts while others hung from balconies, trying
to catch a glimpse of the ambulance carrying his coffin,
often breaking into wails as they chanted "There is no
God but God" and "Hariri is loved by God."
</P>
<P>
Eventually, well over 100,000 marched down streets festooned with Lebanese flags,
shouting "Syria Out" in protest of the dominant role Syria's
forces have played in the country since the 1970s. Opposition
politicians and the United States have strongly suggested Syria had
a hand in the bombing of Hariri's motorcade.
</P>
<P>
At the Hariri family's urging, Lebanon's pro-Syrian president, Emile Lahoud, stayed
away from the funeral, but hundreds of women, breaking with
Islamic tradition, joined in the march.
</P>
<P>
The rites were organized by the Hariri family, which refused a
state funeral to underscore its anger at the government. The
meandering two-hour march through the streets became as much a
show of Lebanon's struggle for unity as an occasion for
mourning. Many Christians, Muslims and Druse, once bitter enemies, walked
side by side.
</P>
<P>
The red flags of the Druse leader Walid Jumblatt's Socialist Party
and the green cedar flags of the Phalangist Party, also
enemies in the war, fluttered together in the sea of
people that descended into the funeral grounds in front of
the unfinished Amin Mosque. "Brothers, we must all grieve together,"
one imam told the mourners.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that the most far-reaching effect of the assassination would
be a fundamental change in the relationship between Lebanon and
Syria, with a newly emboldened opposition movement renewing calls for
Syria's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Syria has denied any involvement in the bombing. But Hariri's supporters
have accused Syria and the Lebanese government of orchestrating the
assassination.
