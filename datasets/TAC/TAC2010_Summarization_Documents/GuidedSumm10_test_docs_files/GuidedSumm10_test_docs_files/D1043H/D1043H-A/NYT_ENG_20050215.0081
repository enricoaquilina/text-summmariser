LEBANON HAS LOST IMPORTANT SYMBOL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A friend of mine was killed in Beirut Monday in a
massive car bomb attack. He was Rafik Hariri, a former
and a future prime minister of Lebanon. He was a
billionaire, and more important, a philanthropist. Through his foundation and
with his money, more than 30,000 young Lebanese men and
women received university educations in the United States, Europe and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Why does his death matter? Hariri was important to Lebanon as
a politician and a symbol. When I first met Rafik
nearly 20 years ago, he had been spending the war
years outside his native Lebanon, making friends and a fortune
in Saudi Arabia. His friends included the Saudi royal family.
His foundation was already helping young people head off to
college. When I first met him, I thought that Rafik
was a talented man and a raw politician. He always
had vision. Our first conversations were about how to bring
peace between Israel and the Arabs. As the years passed
he became more experienced, polished and proficient.
</P>
<P>
Hariri was prime minister for 10 of the 14 years since
Lebanon's 15-year war ended in 1990. More than anyone else,
he was responsible for the rebuilding of Beirut and the
country's infrastructure. He was sometimes called a "bulldozer" for his
power to push through problems, but a ruined country needed
a bulldozer to clear away the debris.
</P>
<P>
He learned to campaign well in remarkably lively parliamentary elections. His
opponents accused him of saddling the country with debt in
financing the reconstruction. He asked whether it would have been
better to live in ruins.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Hariri became more and more concerned with Syrian
influence in Lebanon, a product of Syria's military and intelligence
presence left over from the war. Last September, the United
States and France joined together in the United Nations Security
Council to pass Resolution 1559, calling for free elections and
the withdrawal of all foreign forces (read Syria) from Lebanon.
Hariri was known to be a friend of French President
Jacques Chirac and had been to Washington to meet with
President Bush on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
In September, Hariri was known to have opposed the Syrian-imposed three-year
extension in the length of the term for Lebanon's president.
He resigned the prime ministry shortly thereafter. In recent weeks
he was working on a comeback in the parliamentary elections
scheduled for May. Part of his maneuvers included potentially making
common cause with the Lebanese politicians who are openly demanding
that the Syrian forces get out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hariri was important as a symbol of Lebanon to the outside
world. A successful businessman, a kind benefactor, Hariri was a
practicing and observant Sunni Muslim who was at home in
Beirut, Saudi Arabia, New York and Paris. Hariri had an
Atlanta connection, quietly coming each year to Emory Medical Center
for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
Rafik Hariri was the antithesis of Osama bin Laden. Hariri's sister,
Bahia, chairs the Education Committee in the Lebanese Parliament. Last
week she hosted a conference in Beirut for women in
politics from all over the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
I saw Hariri each time I visited Beirut, whether he was
in office or out. He was always optimistic. During one
such visit we discussed the concern of many over Syria.
He never uttered an uncomplimentary word about the Syrian leadership.
I told him that many of my Lebanese friends were
worried that Lebanon would become more like Syria, with free
speech stifled. I said that I thought that over time,
it will be the reverse: Syria will become more like
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Every Syrian who comes to Beirut feels as if he has
come from a smoke-filled room to a place with fresh
air. The more the Syrians experience the fresh air of
Lebanon, the more they will want it in Syria. It
is the Syrian system that will change. Hariri smiled.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has lost a leader, a larger-than-life figure who did much
good. Hariri wan not perfect -- no human is. His
death matters. Out of his death comes a stronger need
to defend the fresh air of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
There are fresh winds blowing through all of the Arab world,
of elections and education and a new role for women.
The success of those winds will not come from the
outside but from Arabs of vision and optimism, men and
women like Rafik Hariri.

East and South Asia from 1989 to 1991.
