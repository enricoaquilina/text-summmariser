Wailing and shouting, hundreds of thousands of mourners
made their way in a somber but angry procession Wednesday
from the home of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri to
his burial place in the grounds of an unfinished mosque
that was one of his favorite reconstruction projects.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, a popular figure to many in Lebanon and a central
figure in reconstructing the country after a devastating 15-year civil
war, was assassinated on Monday in an explosion that many
here believe was the work of Syria, whose forces have
played a dominant role in Lebanon since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese from all walks of life and religious groups, many waving
Lebanese flags and posters saying "Syria Out!" and "We Don't
Want You!" walked for more than two hours in an
emotional but orderly manner from Hariri's home to Martyr's Square.
</P>
<P>
The procession of mourners, which was larger than expected, included Hariri's
three sons, Bahaa, Saadeldine and Ayman, and, in a break
with Islamic tradition, hundreds of weeping women. Although the crowd's
sorrow was mixed with anger, there was no tension in
the air, and the procession was conducted in an orderly
way.
</P>
<P>
The family believes that Hariri's death was caused in part by
the government's failure to provide security, and at their request
no government officials attended the funeral. The family also said
it did not want a state funeral but one that
the people of Lebanon could attend. And although police officials
provided security, there were no Lebanese soldiers to be seen.
</P>
<P>
Crowds had begun jamming the streets in Martyr's Square in downtown
Beirut since 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
As a result the procession found it difficult to enter and
did not arrive in time for the regular noonday prayers
at the massive Mohammed Amine mosque, an impressive building with
four minarets that is to replace a mosque destroyed in
the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Ambulances carrying the coffin of Hariri and six of his bodyguards
and a paramedic who were also killed in the blast,
were brought to a halt at the edge of the
square.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the coffins were first placed on the ground, and
that of Hariri, draped in a red, white and green
Lebanese flag, was passed overhead by the mourners.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's eldest son, Bahaa, asked for calm from the wailing crowd
so that prayers for the dead could be read, but
many of the mourners were too emotional and did not
join in the prayers.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic call to prayer was mixed with sounds of church
bells and mourners chanting slogans of reverence for the former
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Hariri and the other victims were then laid to rest in
the grounds of the new mosque.
</P>
<P>
Watching the ceremony from the steps of the mosque, outside the
prayer area, were Hariri's two daughters and his sister, who
is also a member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Later, at her home, Hariri's wife, Nazik, met President Jacques Chirac
of France, a close friend of the ex-prime minister, who
had come to pay his condolences.
