<P>
Opposition leaders on Monday held Lebanese and Syrian governments responsible
for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, demanded Syrian
troops withdraw from Lebanon within the next three months and called on the
international community to intervene to help "this captive nation."
</P>
<P>
"We hold the Lebanese authority and the Syrian authority, being the authority of
tutelage in Lebanon, responsible for this crime and other similar crimes," said
a statement after an opposition meeting held Monday night at the late leader's
house in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, at least five bodyguards and four other people were killed in a massive
bombing that blasted his motorcade on a Beirut seafront street earlier Monday.
Another 100 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
The opposition statement called for the resignation of Prime Minister Omar
Karami's Cabinet, "which has lost its popular local and international
credibility."
</P>
<P>
The statement demanded the "full withdrawal" of Syrian troops before the
elections, which by law should take place in April and May although no date has
been set.
</P>
<P>
It also called for a three-day strike and demanded an international commission
to investigate the assassination "in light of the lack of confidence of the
Lebanese in this government."
</P>
<P>
"We call upon the international community to shoulder its responsibility toward
Lebanon, the captive nation," said the statement, read by legislator Bassem
Sabei, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc.
</P>
<P>
Other opponents of Syrian involvement in Lebanese affairs also cast blame on
Damascus and its allies within the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
"Responsibility for this ugly crime is known. It begins in Damascus and passes
through the Lebanese presidential palace in Baabda, the Lebanese government and
the Lebanese intelligence apparatus," former Economy Minister Marwan Hamadeh,
who was seriously hurt in an October car bombing that killed his driver, was
quoted on LBC television as saying.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Bashar Assad condemned the assassination as "a horrible
criminal action" and offered his country's condolences and support to Hariri's
family and Lebanon at large.
</P>
<P>
Walid Eido, a member of Hariri's parliamentary bloc, also blamed Lebanese
authorities, saying: "This government is responsible for the killing of Rafik
Hariri."
</P>
<P>
Eido said his bloc would not participate in any meetings that include government
opponents of Hariri and urged the government to keep away from Hariri's
funeral.
