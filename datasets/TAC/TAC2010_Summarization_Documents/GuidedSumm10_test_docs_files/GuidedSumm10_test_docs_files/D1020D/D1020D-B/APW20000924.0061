<HEADLINE> Concern Surfaces Over Taco Recall  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID SCOTT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Just down the block from biotech ground zero --
the headquarters of Monsanto Co., which helps produce biotech foods
-- the Beddos shopped for groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Beddo had heard about Kraft recalling taco shells because
of a particular type of bioengineered corn, but didn't think much
about it. His wife, Krista, on the other hand, was well aware of
the issue as she held their one-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they ought to leave nature alone,'' she said. ''There
is a reason food grows like it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft Foods recalled Taco Bell-brand shells after tests showed
they were made with a variety of genetically engineered corn that
isn't approved for human consumption because of questions about
whether it could cause allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Friday's recall, people shopping for dinner in St.
Louis expressed support for biotechnology -- but growing
apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably (used) a lot more than we know, particularly in
the produce,'' said Diane Joiner, 41, a second-grade teacher from
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   She was shopping with her two children at a Schnuck's
Supermarket in Richmond Heights, Mo., where the recalled shells
were still on the shelf Friday night. Joiner said the recall scared
her, not so much because of the genetically modified corn but
because it reminded her how little she knows about the food she
buys.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's never advertised blatantly,'' Joiner said. ''You might
hear a blurb on the news one day, and never hear anything else
another day. I would like to know. ... But I don't think they tell
you everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans aren't even aware of biotech foods in the
supermarket, according to a study commissioned by the International
Food Information Council, which is funded in part by biotechnology
companies. Of those surveyed in May, only 43 percent said biotech
products are in stores.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, about 50 percent of the nation's corn acreage was
planted with genetically modified seed this year, said Scarlett
Foster, a spokeswoman for St. Louis-based Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-nine percent of soybeans and 61 percent of cotton were
grown from genetically modified seed. The vast majority of those
biotech crops are grown from Monsanto seed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The International Food Information Council found that over the
last three years support in for biotech products in the United
States has dropped. In 1997, 79 percent of those surveyed felt
biotechnology would benefit themselves or their families. That
slipped to 75 percent in February 1999, to 63 percent in October
1999, and was down to 59 percent this May.
</P>
<P>
   The corn involved in the taco shell recall is produced by
Aventis Corp. It contains a bacterium gene that makes the corn
toxic to an insect pest, and is one of the least-used varieties of
biotech corn. It's also the only genetically engineered crop of any
kind not approved for food use.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said Monsanto has a long-standing policy against
producing any biotech products that are not designed for human
consumption, as well as a policy forbidding the insertion of a
human or animal gene into a plant.
</P>
<P>
   That's not enough for Ed Fink, 35, an information services
manager at a telecommunications company who did his shopping Friday
in Ladue, Mo., at Wild Oats Market, an organic food store that
doesn't knowingly sell any genetically modified product.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping at the same store, Washington University student Nicole
Lovenduski said biotech food ''doesn't really bother me.'' She is
returning to school in St. Louis after spending a semester in
London, where public opinion is decidedly anti-biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was on the news, it was like the main event, when someone
found some crops that had been genetically engineered,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Justine McBride, also a student at Washington, believes
biotechnology can be dangerous -- but at the same time she can see
its advantages. For example, European researchers have developed
rice with extra beta carotene that's advertised as a way to save
millions of children in developing nations from blindness or
diseases like diarrhea and childhood measles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confused about that,'' McBride said. ''It's hard to argue
with, but in principle I'm against the bioengineering of
anything.''
