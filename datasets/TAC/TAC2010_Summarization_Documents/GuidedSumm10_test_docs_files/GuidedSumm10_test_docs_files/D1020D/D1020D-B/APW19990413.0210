	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal food inspectors declared unfit for  
human consumption 21 million pounds of meat and poultry produced by 
the same Arkansas plant from which 30 million pounds of meat 
products were recalled three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The meat, products of the Thorn Apple Valley's Forrest City,  
Ark., plant, was being housed in warehouses and waiting to be 
shipped to distributors, officials with the Agriculture 
Department's food safety and inspection service said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Thorn Apple Valley recalled 30 million pounds of hot  
dogs and luncheon meats produced at the same Arkansas plant. That 
recall was because of possible contamination with the listeria 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA officials said an investigation begun after the recall led  
them to halt the use of all of the remaining product. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorn Apple Valley, based in Southfield, Mich., has  
approximately 9 million pounds of meat and poultry products on hold 
in warehouses across the United States. More than 12 million pounds 
of products subject to recall were exported to Russia and South 
Korea, and Agriculture Department officials said appropriate 
international officials have been notified of the latest action. 
</P>
<P>
	``These products may contain physical, chemical and-or  
microbiological contaminants that render the product adulterated 
and not fit for human consumption,'' an agency release said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant has not produced hot dogs or luncheon meats since Dec.  
31, when USDA suspended inspection because the plant had not 
complied with sanitation requirements, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department said people should check their  
refrigerators for products bearing the codes ``EST 13529'' or ``EST 
P-13529.'' Any such products should be returned to the wherever it 
was bought. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall covered products produced between July and December  
1998.
