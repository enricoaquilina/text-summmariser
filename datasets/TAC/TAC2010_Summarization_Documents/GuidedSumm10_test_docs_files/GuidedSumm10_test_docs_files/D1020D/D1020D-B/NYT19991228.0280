   A New Jersey company known for its high quality foods is
voluntarily recalling 26 of it prepared products, including foie
gras pates, mousses and terrines, and has forced the closing of the
Huntington, N.Y., plant that produced them because of possible
contamination with the sometimes deady bacterium, listeria
monocytogenes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's recall is the third issued by the company, D'Artagnan,
since Dec. 17 when it learned that its truffled foie gras mousse,
which is sold in stores across the United States and Canada,
through catalogs and over the Internet, had made two people in
Maryland ill with listeriosis. There has been another confirmed
case in Maryland since then and two other cases in two other
states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria does not pose much danger to most people but it is a
serious threat to the elderly, to pregnant women, to fetuses and
newborns and to those whose immune systems are compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The first recall, which took place Dec. 17, was for 17,600
pounds of the truffled mousse and peppercorn mousse. It was
expanded Dec. 23. The recall on Tuesday was for all of the 26
products that the plant has made since Nov. 1, about another 60,000
pounds of expensive items that range from smoked duck breast to
venison terrine. In addition, up to 10,000 pounds of food that had
never left the warehouse has been destroyed. The privately owned
company with $22 million in sales this year is still counting its
losses.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 22, D'Artagnan had told its contractor, Hannelore
Gourmet Foods Ltd., of Huntington, to stop production. ``I did not
feel confident,'' said Ariane Daguin, who owns the 15-year-old
company in Newark, N.J., with George Faison.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Hannelore, which does 90 percent of its business
with D'Artagnan, could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daguin said she received a report this morning from the
laboratory she hired to investigate the problem that said the
source of the listeria was probably in the packaging process.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. I. Kay Wachsmuth, deputy administrator for the office of
public health and science in the Department of Agriculture's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said that listeria was widespread in
the natural world and ``once it is inside a plant it's a bear to
get rid of,'' adding that recalling all the products from that
plant was ``very prudent.''
</P>
<P>
   This case illustrates the difficulties the Department of
Agriculture has with listeria, said Dr. Wachsmuth.
</P>
<P>
   She said that even with the Agriculture Department's new
science-based program to assure the safety of meat and poultry in
processing plants, ``we've had people who have had to take up
floors and replace them or completely take down machinery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not sterile products,'' said Dr. Wachsmuth. She said
that irradiation, a process that sterilizes food but is not used
much in the United States, ``is going to have to play a role
here.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to notifying retailers and distributors about the
recall, the company also had to call people who had bought the
products from catalogs or on the Internet, either directly through
D'Artagnan or other sources.
</P>
<P>
   The recall comes at the busiest season of the year for producers
of these luxury products. A pound of mousse of foie gras with
truffles sells for about $60. Ms. Daguin said that the products
that had either been destroyed or recalled represented 30 percent
of the prepared food the company sold.
</P>
<P>
   None of D'Artagnan's fresh product line, which includes
everything from pheasant and wild boar to rabbits and uncooked foie
gras, is affected by this recall, nor are the company's sausages,
prosciutto and Bayonne ham, which are produced elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Other suppliers have already taken up the slack. ``They stuck us
with no pate on the biggest pate week of the year,'' said Andy
Arons, a partner in the four Gourmet Garages in New York. ``They
also do our private label pate. So we went to another vendor and
are paying a lot more because we have no relationship with this
one. There were maybe 1,000 units involved and it hurts. We are
discussing how to communicate to our customers why our pate is now
$2 more.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Arons said he had ``nothing negative to say
about D'Artagnan because they are a superb company with a high
degree of integrity, and if they want to be careful and recall
everything it's the smartest way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been few reports of contamination with listeria over
the last six years. In 1998, the Department of Agriculture
announced three recalls and in 1997, two. This year there have been
26, but officials are not certain whether there are actually more
contaminated products or better reporting. The incidence of
listeriosis has remained relatively stable _ about five per million
_ according to Dr. Paul Mead, a medical epidemiologist at the
Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   It is now possible to fingerprint the DNA of bacteria and link
isolated cases in different parts of the country. Dr. Mead said
that less than 5 percent of listeria isolated from patients came
from the particular strain found in this case. ``Finding this
particular strain is an unusual event,'' said Dr. Mead, ``and
finding several people in several states that have had that pate
and finding it in a closed package of that pate makes a very strong
argument that it was the source of the infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the potential for serious illness, the Agriculture
Department urges consumers who have bought the product not to eat
it and return it to the store. The listeriosis mortality rate is
about 30 percent.
