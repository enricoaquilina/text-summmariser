	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lisa Lee, pregnant with twins, had less than  
five months left before the due date when she came down with what 
seemed to be the flu. She was rushed to the hospital last month and 
was cured but lost both babies in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors now say the prospective mother was struck by  
listeriosis, a disease caused by the bacteria Listeria 
monocytogenes, a food-borne pathogen often found in hot dogs, 
luncheon meats, soft cheese, even milk. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee's once-rare disease has received tremendous attention in  
recent months, especially since a massive recall in December of 
possibly tainted food from a Michigan plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Bil Mar Foods Co., a meat processor owned by Sara Lee in  
Zeeland, Mich., recalled 15 million pounds of hot dogs and cold 
cuts after a rare strain of the listeria bacteria was found in both 
opened and unopened packages. 
</P>
<P>
	The same strain, pattern E, has been linked to 12 adult deaths  
and five miscarriages among 82 illnesses in 19 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from causing stillbirths and miscarriages, listeriosis  
also can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in people 
with weakened immune systems: infants, the elderly or patients with 
chronic diseases, HIV infection or undergoing cancer chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Bil Mar is the only plant to have an outbreak with  
illnesses traced to its products, several others across the country 
have had to recall products after tests detected listeria. 
</P>
<P>
	Since September, there have been nine known recalls due to  
listeria, mostly from deli meats and hot dogs. One recall was for 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
	It's an increase from the corresponding period a year earlier  
when the Agriculture Department recorded just one listeria-related 
recall. And that recall was at the end of 1997, the only recall of 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly seems like it's on the rise,'' said Dr. Robert B.  
Gravani, professor of food science at Cornell University. He said 
experts are trying to determine whether the incidents are due to 
better reporting or whether the listeria really is appearing more 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	Better testing and reporting is the more likely reason, said  
Margaret Glavin, associate administrator for USDA's food safety and 
inspection service. ``We don't see an uptrend in the number of 
positives we're finding,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria was a real problem for the United States in the  
mid-1980s, said Dr. Lester Crawford, director of Georgetown 
University's Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, but the 
government declared zero tolerance for the pathogen. Listeria 
levels dropped sharply, Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
	``By 1994, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) was proclaiming  
that this was one of the most successful regulatory actions in U.S. 
history,'' Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the sudden rise in recalls has experts baffled.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have explored whether or not there might be a new strain or  
new characteristics in listeria that's causing it to be more 
difficult to control,'' Crawford said. So far, no evidence has been 
found to support that theory. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts also found no evidence that a new scientific-based food  
inspection program, USDA's Hazard Analysis and Critical Control 
Point, has failed. If anything, they argue, HACCP's inspections, 
which monitor things like temperature in the processing system, 
have helped. 
</P>
<P>
	So, why is listeria suddenly popping up?  
</P>
<P>
	``We're sort of left with no real answer,'' Crawford said.  
</P>
<P>
	For now, he and other experts, remind people to cook hot dogs  
and eat deli meats before the sell-by date. They also say consumers 
should be careful not to reheat leftovers more than once. 
</P>
<P>
	Pregnant women, about 20 times more likely than other healthy  
adults to get listeriosis, should be particularly careful to never 
eat raw meat or undercooked eggs or food, the USDA recommends. They 
also should avoid soft cheeses, such as feta or Brie, and avoid 
food from deli counters. Any lunch meat or hot dogs should be 
thoroughly heated. 
</P>
<P>
	For Lisa Lee, it was a risk she says she never knew existed.  
Luncheon meat in her has been turned over to the local health 
department for testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Her advice for other pregnant women is ``ask more questions, be  
more informed.''
