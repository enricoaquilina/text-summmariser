WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 250,000 kilograms
of ground beef in 33 U.S. states have been recalled because the
meat might contain a deadly strain of E. coli.
</P>
<P>
The meat-packing giant IBP Inc. disclosed that a sample of beef
taken on October 22 from its Dakota City plant could be tainted
with E. coli O157:H7, an Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
Complications associated with the O157:H7 strain can lead to
kidney failure, severe anemia, clotting problems and, in some
cases, coma and death.
</P>
<P>
IBP spokesman Gary Mickelson said 71 retail, food service and
distribution customers bought the ground beef, sold in
vacuum-packaged tubes. The recall does not include any prepackaged
fresh or frozen beef patties.
</P>
<P>
The meat was under test by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
But the company decided Wednesday to recall it.
