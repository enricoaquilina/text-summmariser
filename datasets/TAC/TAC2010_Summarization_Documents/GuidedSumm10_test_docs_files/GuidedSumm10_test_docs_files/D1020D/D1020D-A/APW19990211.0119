<HEADLINE> Gov't Tries To Contain Listeriosis </HEADLINE>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recent outbreaks of listeriosis are causing an  
immediate public health problem, federal agriculture officials said 
in launching a review of whether to require more testing for the 
deadly bacterium. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Agriculture Department officials said they would like more  
legal authority to focus on the danger to public health when they 
recommend recalls, so they can warn the public faster. 
</P>
<P>
	At a daylong public meeting on Wednesday, officials said they  
had more questions than answers about a spike in outbreaks of 
listeriosis like the one traced to hot dogs and cold cuts at 
Michigan's Bil Mar Foods plant in December that has killed 16 
people and sickened more than 70 in 14 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria monocytogenes is a bacteria that healthy people usually  
fight off but sometimes can kill. Pregnant women, the newborn, 
older adults and people with weakened immune systems are especially 
at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we have an immediate public health problem, our first  
goal is to establish an immediate action plan to address 
improvements in the control of listeria,'' said Thomas Billy, 
administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Farther ahead, the agency is considering whether industry should  
be required to do its own testing. It is also revisiting the shelf 
life of foods to see if the bacterium grows quickly at particular 
times or in particular foods after they are processed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new information based on this outbreak brings into  
question the adequacy of control procedures we've been relying 
on,'' Billy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus is on ready-to-eat foods such as luncheon meats  
because the bacterium can be killed if it is cooked until steaming 
hot, or past about 170 degrees. Fewer than 2,000 people in the 
United States report serious illness from listeriosis each year, 
but about one in four of them die from it. 
</P>
<P>
	Plant officials at Bil Mar voluntarily recalled about 35 million  
pounds of hot dogs and lunch meat on Dec. 22. That recall, and one 
in January of about 30 million pounds of hot dogs and luncheon meat 
from the Thorn Apple Valley plant in Arkansas, represent most of 
the increase in the pounds pulled from shelves for listeria 
contamination in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1989, when the government implemented stricter policies  
for the bacterium, illnesses from listeria monocytogenes have 
dropped 44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	At the meeting, some federal officials also questioned whether  
they acted quickly enough in the Bil Mar recall. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Centers for Disease Control had managed to  
trace 20 cases of food sickness to the Bil Mar plant by Dec. 18, 
and USDA officials said they met Bil Mar executives to urge them to 
consider a recall then. However, USDA officials said they did not 
feel comfortable recommending a recall until they found a package 
of unopened meat with the bacterium at the plant. That happened 
Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	After several days of debate among medical experts, CDC  
officials clearly determined there was a public health threat on 
Dec. 22, the day of the recall, said Dr. Paul Mead of the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Derfler, a USDA deputy director, suggested there should be  
legislation allowing the agency to require a recall ``based on the 
threat to public health rather than what it can show about the 
content of the food.''
