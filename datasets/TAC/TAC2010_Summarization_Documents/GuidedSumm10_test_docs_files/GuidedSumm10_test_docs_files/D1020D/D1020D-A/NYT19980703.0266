CLINTON PRESSURES CONGRESS FOR MONEY TO ENSURE SAFETY OF FOOD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to press Congress on
Saturday to provide all $101 million he has sought to ensure the
safety of the nation's food supply. But Congress seems unlikely to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also plans to announce two steps the administration can
take without congressional authority to protect food safety,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   According to an advance text of his Saturday radio address, the
president will also ask Congress to give the Food and Drug
Administration ``greater authority to halt imports of fruits,
vegetables and other food products that are produced under safety
conditions that do not match our own strict standards,'' and to
give the Department of Agriculture ``new authority to impose tough
fines on businesses who violate those standards and to issue
mandatory recall of unsafe meat and poultry.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has no reliable tracking system, but health
officials say food-borne diseases account for up to 30 million
cases of illness and 9,000 deaths a year. There have been many
large outbreaks of food-borne illness in the last year, including
one just last week that made a New York woman ill and resulted in
the recall of 172,000 pounds of ground-beef patties contaminated
with the deadly bacteria E. coli O157:H7.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress has failed to address legislation proposed by the
administration to give the food agencies greater authority, and it
appears unlikely that Congress will provide the full amount of
money the administration has requested to expand inspections,
increase research and surveillance of food-borne illness and
educate consumers. Before the July 4 recess, the House voted to
provide only $16.8 million of the requested money, and the Senate
bill, which has not been voted on, provides just $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the day the agencies can quantitatively answer how much
it would cost to reduce food-borne illness,'' said John Ziolkowski,
a staff member of the House Appropriations Committee, ``they won't
get any more money. If they can say we will cut food-borne illness
by so much, I'm sure the members would say that is a serious
proposal. Did we provide enough money? No. I'm sure we didn't for a
lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
agriculture, Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said that even though some new
programs proposed by the administration had merit, the committee
did not have the money for them. So it provided nothing. Instead,
Cochran suggested that some of the Food and Drug Administration's
duties be delegated to states and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials say more action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food-borne diseases are a continuing problem that have not yet
been resolved,'' said Dr. Robert Tauxe, chief of the food-borne and
diarrheal diseases branch of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. This fact has been underscored in the last few months
by two unexpected outbreaks of food-borne illnesses: travelers'
diarrhea, or enterotoxigenic E. coli, from potato salad, which
sickened 4,000 people in Illinois, and salmonella in breakfast
cereal, which made 200 people ill in 11 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salmonella in breakfast cereal is basically a first for us in
this country,'' Tauxe said. ``We cannot have a breakfast-cereal
plant having failures like that, and that's an inspection
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The potato salad outbreak is equally worrisome, he said. ``We
used to believe you had to travel overseas to get travelers'
diarrhea. It's a classic example of emerging infections common in
Latin America becoming a problem here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what Tauxe described as ``extraordinary efforts'' to
prevent E. coli O157:H7 from contaminating meat, it continues to be
a problem. ``I don't feel that recalls are the answer,'' he said,
``because we don't want E. coli in the meat to begin with. That's a
sign that additional efforts are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, the number of products recalled for life-threatening
microbial contamination has increased almost fivefold, according to
the FDA. In 1993, the agency asked the administration for the power
to bar fruits, vegetables, grains, fish and other food from
countries with food-safety systems inferior to that of the United
States. But advocates of free trade oppose ceding that power,
called equivalency, and no action, executive or legislative, has
been taken.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture has the power to bar imported meat
and poultry, but in a report issued in May, the General Accounting
Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said ``Federal agencies
cannot ensure that the growing volume of imported food is safe for
consumers,'' and recommended that the power of equivalency be
extended to cover all foods eligible for import.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The FDA now deals with imported food only after it arrives. It
inspects slightly more than 1.5 percent of all foreign shipments,
and among imported produce items, a source for some extremely
serious outbreaks of food-borne illness, only 0.2 percent were
sampled last year. The number of shipments of food for which the
FDA is responsible has increased to 2.2 million from 1.5 million
five years ago. The number of people who inspect the food has
remained the same. And domestically, the agency inspects food
plants only every 10 years, on average.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress returns from its recess, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,
will offer an amendment to restore all of the original $101 million
for the president's food safety initiative.
</P>
<P>
   And in his radio address, the president will announce what the
administration can do without congressional approval. One measure
is an FDA rule requiring warning labels on all packaged juice that
has not been pasteurized or processed to kill harmful bacteria. A
second measure is the creation of a national institute for food
safety research to coordinate public and private research.
</P>
<P>
   Unpasteurized apple juice, contaminated with E. coli O157:H7,
caused the death of a 16-month-old child last year and led to the
hospitalization of a dozen other children. The new labeling rule
will take effect in time for the apple cider season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is sitting on its hands while we watch all these
outbreaks occur around this country,'' said Caroline Smith deWaal,
director of food safety for the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, an advocacy group based in Washington, ``and things are
not going to get better without resources and authority to regulate
food.''
