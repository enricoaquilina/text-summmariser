OUTBREAK OF FOOD POISONING LEADS TO WARNING ON HOT DOGS AND COLD
CUTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Investigators from the Federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention who are looking into an outbreak of food poisoning that
has sickened 40 people and killed four in 10 states since August
have warned consumers on the storing and cooking of hot dogs and
cold cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak led to the recall on Tuesday of certain lots of hot
dogs and packaged meat produced at the Bil Mar Foods plant in
Zeeland, Mich., and sold throughout the United States. Bil Mar is a
division of Sara Lee Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit, investigators say, is a strain of air and
soil-borne bacteria known as Listeria monocytogenes, which is
carried in the intestines of animals and can easily come into
contact with raw vegetables, dairy products or uncooked meat. It
thrives in refrigerators, but can be destroyed by boiling or
reheating food to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   When ingested, Listeria bacteria can cause illness and death
among the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and those with weakened
immune systems. In a normal year, an estimated 1,850 people become
seriously ill. Of these, 425 die.
</P>
<P>
   Three who have died in this outbreak have been elderly. They are
a man, 79, from the Rochester, N.Y., area, and two others from
Ohio, one from Toledo and one from Cincinnati. The fourth victim,
from the Toledo area, was a fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio has had the largest number of cases, 13. New York has had
12. Tennessee, Massachusetts and West Virginia have each had 3.
Michigan has had two cases. Connecticut, Oregon, Vermont and
Georgia have had one each. The outbreak began on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elizabeth Koch, acting state epidemiologist in Ohio, said
the DNA of the bacteria involved in the outbreak showed ``a very
rare pattern,'' called Pattern E.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking the source, health officials from New York, Connecticut,
Ohio and Tennessee worked with the agency to examine the diets of
affected patients. Most had eaten cooked hot dogs the month before
they became ill.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the disease agency, said that on
Dec. 19, three days before the Bil Mar recall, investigators
isolated this strain of Listeria on an open package of hot dogs
that a month earlier had been eaten by one of those who became ill.
It is not known how or where this package was contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is studying whether some of the Bil Mar products
might contain the Listeria bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The products recalled were only those labeled with Establishment
Numbers EST P261 or EST 6911 for Ball Park, Bil Mar, Bryan Bunsize,
and Bryan 3-lb. Club Pack hot dogs, and Grillmaster, Hygrade,
Turkey, Sara Lee Deli Meat and Sara Lee Home Roast brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stopped operations for those product lines at the
plant,'' Theresa Herlevsen, a spokeswoman for Sara Lee, said in a
telephone interview, emphasizing that there had been no conclusive
information about contamination of these products.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herlevesen said Sara Lee estimated the cost of the recall at
$50 million to $70 million. Consumers may return the recalled
products to the place of purchase for a full refund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to commend the company for taking this step,'' said
Skinner of the disease control agency, noting that the company was
cooperating with federal investigators. ``What's important is that
people at risk, such as the elderly and pregnant women, need to
reduce their risk by avoiding these products or thoroughly cooking
them before eating them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thoroughly cook your hot dogs,'' Skinner said, ``you
kill the Listeria. We don't want people to stop eating hot dogs and
cold cut meats.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the source and cause of the outbreak was
continuing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The disease control agency said healthy adults and children were
occasionally infected with Listeria, but rarely became seriously
ill. People with weakened immune systems, including those with
cancer, diabetes and kidney disease, are much more vulnerable.
People with AIDS are almost 300 times more likely to get
listeriosis than people with normal immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms are those of a flu-like illness, and may include a
fever, muscle aches, nausea, diarrhea or a stiff neck. A blood test
is the most reliable way to diagnose the disease.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risks, the disease centers, recommends thoroughly
cooking raw food from animal sources, washing raw vegetables, and
keeping uncooked meats separate from vegetables. Hands, knives and
cutting boards should be washed after coming into contact with
uncooked foods.
</P>
<P>
   Although the risk of listeriosis associated with foods from deli
counters is relatively low, the disease agency says pregnant women
and immunosuppressed people may choose to avoid these foods or
thoroughly reheat cold cuts before eating. They should also avoid
soft cheeses like feta, Brie, Camembert, blue-veined and
Mexican-style cheese.
