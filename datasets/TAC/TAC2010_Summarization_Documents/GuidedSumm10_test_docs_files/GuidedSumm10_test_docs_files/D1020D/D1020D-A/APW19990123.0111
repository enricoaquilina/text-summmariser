<HEADLINE> Thorn Apple Valley Recalls Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers who have purchased meat products  
manufactured at Thorn Apple Valley's Forrest City, Ark., plant in 
the last six months are being urged to return them because of 
concerns of possible contamination with the Listeria monocytogenes 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department announced the recall Friday night. It  
includes all meat and poultry products bearing the codes ``EST 
13529'' or ``EST P13529'' anywhere on the package. The recall 
includes dozens of brand names, based on information collected by 
the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service and provided by 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The department suspended operations at the Arkansas plant on  
Dec. 31 because of its noncompliance with sanitation requirements. 
Operations there remain suspended. That plant has a production 
capacity of 400,000 pounds of hot dogs per day, according to the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	No consumer illnesses have yet been linked to the products,  
which were distributed nationwide and shipped to foreign countries, 
including South Korea and Russia, and manufactured after July 6, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the potential of foodborne illness, we urge  
consumers who have purchased the suspect product not to eat it and 
return it to the point of purchase,'' said Margaret Glavin, 
associate administrator of the FSIS. 
</P>
<P>
	Between July and December 1998, government inspectors collected  
20 ready-to-eat samples from the plant. Five tested positive for 
Listeria monocytogenes bacteria, which can cause high fever, severe 
headache, neck stiffness and nausea. Based on the findings and 
conditions at the plant, the agency concluded there may be a public 
health risk associated with the product. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department said it has no evidence, however,  
linking the product to a nationwide listeriosis outbreak that is 
under investigation. About 1,800 cases of food poisoning caused by 
listeria are reported in the United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy people usually can fight off the bacterium with no more  
than flu-like symptoms. But listeria can kill, by causing 
meningitis or blood infection. Most at risk are pregnant women, the 
elderly and people with weak immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Those concerned about illnesses they suspect are related to  
these products should contact their physicians immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third major recall in a month of meat products.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Oscar Mayer Foods Corp. recalled more than 28,000  
pounds of deli meat because of concerns of possible contamination 
with the Listeria bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee Corp. announced in late December a recall of hot dogs  
and other packaged meats as a precaution after an outbreak of food 
poisoning sickened more than 35 people in nine states, killing 
four. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers seeking information about the Thorn Apple Valley  
recall may contact the company at 1-800-316-2855. Consumers with 
food safety questions may phone the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 
at 1-800-535-4555. The hotline is staffed from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
EST Monday through Friday. Recorded information is available 24 
hours a day.
