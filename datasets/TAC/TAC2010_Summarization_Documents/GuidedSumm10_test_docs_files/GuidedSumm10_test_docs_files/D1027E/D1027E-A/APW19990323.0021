<HEADLINE> Trial in Wyo. Gay Slaying To Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- In the weeks after the beating death of gay  
student Matthew Shepard, this college town found itself portrayed 
as backwards, homophobic, an outpost of Wild West-style violence 
and small-mindedness. 
</P>
<P>
	With the first of Shepard's alleged attackers set to go on trial  
for his life Wednesday, those images of Laramie could work to 
prosecutors' advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Hoover, a jury consultant based in Raleigh, N.C., said the  
jurors may be eager to show that the people of Laramie, population 
26,000, are progressive, law-abiding folks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you've got a small town where nothing like this has ever  
happened, then they are definitely going to do their best to 
portray that they care,'' she said. ``They don't want the world to 
think that's the type of thing that happens in their town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and  
aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October. 
The crime shocked the nation and drew condemnation from President 
Clinton and Congress and calls for stronger bias crime laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The other man charged in the slaying, Aaron McKinney, 21, is set  
to go on trial in August. Both could get the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Henderson and McKinney posed as homosexuals and  
lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar, kidnapped him, 
pistol-whipped him and stole $20. He was left for dead, tied to a 
fence in the 28-degree chill of Wyoming's high plains. The 
political science major at the University of Wyoming died five days 
later at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Jon Forwood, a prosecutor in nearby Cheyenne, said the  
university setting will probably help the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The academic community is generally perceived as one that is  
less in favor of the death penalty and more inclined to seek out 
the emotionalism as to what has happened and why,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Rice, a clinical psychologist and jury consultant in San  
Francisco, cited what he said is a key difference between this case 
and the Jasper, Texas, dragging-death trial, in which a white man 
was swifly convicted and sentenced to die for dragging a black man 
to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	America, he said, has ``moved further along on the issue of race  
and people tend to know what the `right' answer is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The homosexual issue is less cut-and-dried, a little more  
difficult to measure,'' Rice said. ``It's a question less people 
have considered in their own minds.''
