	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- One of two men arrested in the beating  
death of gay college student Matthew Shepard merely watched while 
the other man pistol-whipped Shepard and left him to die, a defense 
attorney said Wednesday as jury selection began. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defense will contend that Russell did not participate in  
the beating and did not share in the proceeds of the robbery,'' 
said Wyatt Skaggs, the lawyer for 21-year-old Russell Henderson. 
Skaggs also said the slaying wasn't premeditated. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked potential jurors not to punish his client to redeem  
this small town's image in the eyes of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing ``has literally injected into our community a  
feeling of guilt. The press wants us to think that we are somehow 
responsible for what went on Oct. 6,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are any of you here going to judge this case because you feel  
guilty and want to make a statement to the nation?'' he asked the 
prospective jurors. They replied, ``No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha told the prospective jurors that Shepard  
was ``not the same as you and I'' but that every individual should 
be treated equally under the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as  
homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar 
Oct. 6, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to a 
fence in the cold. The University of Wyoming student died five days 
later at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The crime led to demands for stronger hate-crime laws around the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney will be tried later. Both men could get the death  
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Skaggs also told the jury candidates that the case ``is not  
about lifestyles.'' ``This case is not about hate. All crimes ... 
aren't about hate. They all come down to some real simple 
motives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One prospective juror, a man in his 40s, objected quickly: ``No,  
I disagree. ... I think Matthew Shepard's lifestyle was part of 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the day, 15 of the 71 prospective jurors in the  
first pool had been dismissed, many for financial, medical or 
child-care related decisions. Jury questioning for the rest of the 
week will be closed to the public. Opening statements are set for 
April 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The prospective jurors will be questioned individually in the  
judge's chambers.
