<HEADLINE> Shepard Suspect Blames Co-Defendant </HEADLINE>

	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- The strategy for the first defendant on  
trial in the beating death of gay college student Matthew Shepard 
is clear: blame the co-defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russell Henderson was a witness to the beating of Matthew  
Shepard,'' attorney Wyatt Skaggs told prospective jurors as 
Henderson's trial opened Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson stood by and watched while his friend Aaron McKinney  
brutally pistol-whipped Shepard, 21, and left him to die, Skaggs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defense will contend that Russell did not participate in  
the beating and did not share in the proceeds of the robbery,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Individual questioning of potential jurors continued today  
behind closed doors. Officials said about 30 people would be 
questioned. Outside the courthouse, clearly marked protest areas 
were empty. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Henderson and McKinney are accused of first-degree murder,  
kidnapping and aggravated robbery in an attack that led to demands 
for stronger hate-crime laws around the country. McKinney's trial 
is scheduled for August. 
</P>
<P>
	Skaggs asked prospective jurors not to punish his client for the  
sake of redeeming this small town's image in the eyes of the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are any of you here going to judge this case because you feel  
guilty and want to make a statement to the nation?'' he said. ``The 
press wants us to think that we are somehow responsible for what 
went on October 6.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha told the potential jurors that Shepard  
was ``not the same as you and I'' but that every individual should 
be treated equally under the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson and McKinney, both 21, face the death penalty if  
convicted. Authorities said the pair pretended to be homosexual and 
lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a downtown bar before 
they beat him and then left him lashed to a fence in a remote area 
east of town. The University of Wyoming student died five days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard's mother, Judy, remained mostly impassive during the  
first day of jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the day, 15 of 71 prospective jurors in the first  
pool had been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	During the session, Skaggs put his arm around Henderson and told  
the jurors: ``This is not a defendant, not a person, but a real 
live living human being. Can all of you give him a fair shot?''
