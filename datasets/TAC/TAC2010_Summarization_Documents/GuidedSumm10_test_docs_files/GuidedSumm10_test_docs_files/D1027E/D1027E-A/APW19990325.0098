	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Fourteen people were dismissed Thursday as  
jury selection continued in the trial of a man accused of beating 
gay college student Matthew Shepard to death. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection process, which began Wednesday, is going on behind  
closed doors. Twenty-nine of 71 potential jurors have been 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Henderson, 21, is accused of posing as a homosexual to  
lure the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar Oct. 6. 
Henderson, along with Aaron McKinney, allegedly kidnapped and 
pistol-whipped Shepard and left him tied to a fence in the cold. 
The University of Wyoming student died five days later at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's attorney said his client was only a witness and did  
not participate in Shepard's beating. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney will be tried later. Both men could get the death  
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Holt, a 52-year-old Greek literature professor at the  
University of Wyoming, said he was relieved after being excused 
from jury selection Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Laramie's small enough that if you don't know the victim, you  
at least know people who do,'' he said. ``I know some people who 
knew Shepard. I know some people close to Henderson's family. It 
sent shock waves through the town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opening statements are scheduled for April 6.
