	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Like the gay college student he is accused  
of killing, Russell Henderson is a slightly built young man who was 
raised on the dusty high plains of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 10 months apart in age, Henderson and Matthew Shepard wound  
up in the same city, where they frequented some of the same 
nightspots and even had mutual acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
	But when their paths crossed back in October, they were heading  
in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard was educated in Europe and  
had big plans for the future, Henderson, at 5-feet-7, 138 pounds, 
was a high school dropout who held unskilled jobs. He had had minor 
scuffles with the law, but no history of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, his buddy Aaron McKinney and Shepard met in a college  
bar last fall. Eighteen hours later, Shepard was found near death, 
tied to a fence, bloodied by a pistol-whipping. Henderson was 
jailed after trying to outrun a police officer and was soon named a 
suspect in Shepard's death. McKinney was arrested soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection continued Friday in Henderson's trial on charges  
of murdering Shepard. McKinney is scheduled to stand trial on 
identical charges in August. Both men could get the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Police allege Henderson and McKinney, both 21, pretended to be  
homosexuals, lured Shepard out of the Fireside Lounge and took him 
to a remote area east of Laramie and attacked him. They believe 
Henderson and McKinney intended to rob Shepard, but also targeted 
him in part because he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's girlfriend is awaiting sentencing after pleading  
guilty Dec. 23 to accessory after the fact to murder. McKinney's 
girlfriend goes on trial in May on an accessory charge. 
</P>
<P>
	In a preview of his defense strategy, attorney Wyatt Skaggs told  
prospective jurors this week that Henderson witnessed the beating 
but did not participate in it. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Sept. 24, 1977, Henderson was raised by his mother, Cindy  
Dixon, who often left him in the care of his grandparents and 
aunts. 
</P>
<P>
	Little is known about Henderson's father, and his mother died of  
exposure in January on a two-lane road north of Laramie, several 
hours after she left a bar. Police said it may have been an 
accidental death. 
</P>
<P>
	At school, Henderson blended in with the crowd, just another  
dark-haired, polite young man. One of his childhood loves was 
scouting. He earned 21 merit badges to become an Eagle Scout. 
</P>
<P>
	But Henderson dropped out of high school and moved out of his  
grandmother's home. He piled up a series of petty offenses, mostly 
traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
	At 15, Henderson took a night job at Taco Bell, said Tammy  
Shields, his manager at the time. ``He was always on time and, if 
he wasn't he would always call and let us know,'' she said. ``He 
just didn't say much. He went and did everything you told him to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Henderson and McKinney were hired by a roofing  
company, working long hours, said Doc O'Connor, who also owns Doc's 
Western Village apartments and gave McKinney a place to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russ was a very mellow, mild man,'' O'Connor said. ``He didn't  
talk that much but was very polite and well-mannered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson's life took a bad turn shortly after midnight on Oct.  
7 when police responding to a vandalism call spotted Henderson and 
McKinney as they got out of a black pickup and crouched down. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Flint Waters turned on the patrol car's lights and the  
two men bolted in different directions. Waters tackled Henderson a 
half-block away when the young man was by slowed by hedges in a 
back yard. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Waters found a bloody .357 Magnum in the back of the  
pickup and asked Henderson if it had been fired. According to 
police, Henderson laughed and said, ``I guarantee you won't find 
anyone with a bullet in them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the police eventually found was a badly beaten Shepard, who  
died five days later.
