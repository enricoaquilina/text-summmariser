<HEADLINE> Clinton To Endorse Hate Crime Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to endorse a bill  
Tuesday that would expand federal hate crime laws to include 
offenses based on sexual orientation, White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress failed to act on similar legislation last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also will direct that colleges be required to report  
hate crimes annually and announce a public-private partnership 
designed to educate middle school students against intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership will involve AT&AMP;T, Court TV, Cable in the  
Classroom and the National Middle Schools Association working with 
the Justice and Education departments to develop curricula to 
combat intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is signing this directive to increase public  
awareness and information about hate crimes among young people and 
doing whatever he can in his power to advance this cause while we 
wait for Congress to act,'' said Bruce Reed, the White House 
director of public policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was announcing the initiatives with religious, education  
and law enforcement leaders at a Roosevelt Room ceremony Tuesday, 
White House officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for the middle schools program grew out of a White  
House conference on hate crimes that generated a lot of anecdotal 
information about ethnic and racial insensitivities among school 
children, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim, said a White House official who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, is to ``nip intolerance in the bud'' by educating 
children about its consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton will direct the Justice and Education  
departments to require that college campuses provide specific 
information about hate crimes in the campus crime statistics they 
provide to law enforcement each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The information will be used to generate hard data on how crimes  
of violence relate to intolerance on college campuses, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's hate crimes legislation died in committee in the House  
and Senate last year. The initiative was reintroduced last month by 
a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, 
D-Mass., and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Reps. John Conyers, D-Mich., 
and Connie Morella, R-Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, current law would be expanded so the Justice  
Department could prosecute crimes based on a person's sex, sexual 
orientation or disability. Now, the statute only covers crimes 
based on race, color, religion or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the bill would make federal prosecution of hate crimes  
easier. Current law limits prosecution to situations where the 
victim is targeted for engaging in certain federally protected 
activities, such as serving on a jury, voting or attending public 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40 states have hate crimes laws but only 21 cover  
sexual orientation, 22 cover gender and 21 cover disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors are hoping that outrage over recent highly publicized  
killings will fuel support for the measure this year. 
</P>
<P>
	One of two young men charged in the slaying of gay college  
student Matthew Shepard in Wyoming pleaded guilty Monday and was 
sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men have been charged with beating to death a gay textile  
worker, Billy Jack Gaither, in Alabama earlier this year and 
burning his body on a pile of tires. 
</P>
<P>
	John William King, a white supremacist, was sentenced to death  
in Texas for chaining a black man, James Byrd Jr., behind a pickup 
truck and dragging him to his death. Two other men wait trial in 
the case.
