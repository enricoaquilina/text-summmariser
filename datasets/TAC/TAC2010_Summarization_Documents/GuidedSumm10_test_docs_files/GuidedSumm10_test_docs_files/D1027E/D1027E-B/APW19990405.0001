	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- One of two men charged in the killing of  
gay college student Matthew Shepard pleaded guilty Monday to 
murder, admitting he tied the bleeding young man to a wooden fence 
and left him for dead on the prairie. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Henderson, a 21-year-old high school dropout and roofer,  
avoided a trial and a possible death sentence with his plea. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms and will not be  
eligible for parole. His only hope for release is a pardon. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Shepard cried at the courtroom podium while talking about  
her son, then turned to Henderson: ``I hope you never experience 
another day or night without experiencing the terror, humiliation, 
the hopelessness and helplessness that my son felt that night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Henderson and Aaron McKinney, 21, posed as  
homosexuals and lured the 5-foot-2, 105-pound Shepard out of a bar 
last October, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him and left him tied to 
a fence in the cold. The 21-year-old University of Wyoming student 
died five days later at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The crime led to demands for stronger hate-crime laws around the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he pleaded guilty to felony murder and kidnapping,  
Henderson said his friend and co-defendant delivered the fatal 
blows. 
</P>
<P>
	He matter-of-factly recounted the grisly beating and his  
attempts to cover up his role, then asked forgiveness from his and 
Shepard's families. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not a moment that goes by that I don't see what  
happened that night,'' he said. ``I hope one day you will be able 
to find it in your heart to forgive me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson said he tried to stop the beating, but McKinney struck  
him with a gun when he spoke up. ``Matthew looked really bad, so I 
told (McKinney) to stop, he's had enough,'' Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Jeffrey Donnell told Henderson he did not believe he was  
remorseful. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pain you have caused here, Mr. Henderson, will never go  
away. Never,'' Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney will be tried in August on first-degree murder,  
kidnapping and aggravated robbery charges. He could be sentenced to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been speculation that if Henderson pleaded guilty, he  
would end up testifying against his friend and co-defendant, but 
officials would not confirm that will happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha said he believed it was appropriate to  
offer a plea agreement to Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my hope that Mr. Henderson will die in the Wyoming state  
penitentiary and the only time he leaves the Wyoming state 
pententiary is when they bury him,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Wyatt Skaggs denied that Shepard was targeted  
because he was gay. ``This crime has never been a hate crime,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chasity Pasley, Henderson's girlfriend, pleaded guilty in  
December to accessory after the fact, admitting she helped hide 
Henderson's clothing, which was covered with Shepard's blood. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's girlfriend, Kristen Price, is scheduled to stand  
trial in May on an accessory charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courthouse Monday, a dozen young people dressed as  
angels, with white sheets for wings, tried to block from view an 
anti-gay group that was demonstrating. 
</P>
<P>
	The angels stood silently, but inside their human wall about a  
dozen anti-gay demonstrators from Kansas shouted slogans and waved 
signs, including one that said ``God Hates Fags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These ... creatures are sending this nation to hell in a  
handbasket,'' said the Rev. Fred Phelps of Westboro Baptist Church. 
Phelps and members of his church picketed Shepard's funeral in 
Casper with anti-gay signs.
