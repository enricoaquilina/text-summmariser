	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Courtroom veterans Wyatt Skaggs and Cal  
Rerucha have faced each other many times, but never before with the 
national media looking on and a man's life at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Skaggs is the defense attorney and Rerucha the prosecutor in the  
trial of Russell Henderson, who is charged with first-degree 
murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in the fatal beating Oct. 
6 of gay university student Matthew Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence of the crime -- Shepard died from massive skull  
fractures after he was tied to a fence and pistol-whipped -- and 
suspicion Shepard may have been targeted because he was gay have 
put the town and the lawyers in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both are good trial attorneys,'' said prosecutor Jon Forwood.  
``There's no mismatch there. Each can handle himself quite well in 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fiercely competitive, the two can also bring out the worst in  
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of an accused rapist, Rerucha became incensed after  
Skaggs told the jury his client was good-looking and ``could have 
many, many women if he wanted to. ... Is this a type of guy who 
would commit a rape?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rerucha responded that serial killer Ted Bundy was also  
good-looking, a remark noted by the Wyoming Supreme Court on appeal 
but not deemed egregious enough to overturn the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was almost as though Wyatt had invited it,'' said Ted  
Lauer, professor of law at the University of Wyoming. ``The level 
of aggression and debate between the two was so intense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Wyatt can be one of the meanest people in the whole world in  
court. Out of court he can be brusque, sharp and short,'' said 
Lauer. ``He doesn't mince words with anybody. If he doesn't like 
you, he'll tell you so to your face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both men are extremely private, refusing to hold news  
conferences and seldom offering interviews. Neither would comment 
to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare public statement in December, Skaggs railed at  
Rerucha's decision to seek the death penalty against Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been other cases in this county that have been just  
as heinous or more heinous in which he has not requested the death 
penalty,'' he said. ``I think it's heavy-handed to say the least 
and somewhat politically motivated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lauer disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Cal is an extremely conscientious person,'' he said. ``He  
doesn't do anything without agonizing over it. I'm sure he agonized 
over the decision to seek the death penalty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sign outside Skaggs' office refers to him as ``country  
lawyer,'' but prosecutors know better. He has become the top 
criminal defense attorney in the state public defender's office and 
often is assigned the toughest cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Skaggs grew up the son of a flying instructor in Cody, a town on  
the outskirts of Yellowstone National Park. He told The Cody 
Enterprise last October that he was ``a bit of a rebel'' while 
growing up. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that's one reason he so strongly defends each of his  
clients, no matter the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every person, no matter how poor or reprehensible, deserves  
the best representation possible,'' he said. ``That's something 
that was drilled into me by my parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rerucha, former paperboy and son of a Laramie railroad worker,  
enjoyed early political success. He was elected student body 
president at the University of Wyoming and after law school, 
alternated between private practice and work as deputy county 
attorney. In 1986, he ran for prosecutor and won. Albany County 
voters have re-elected him three times. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shepard case is not the first time he has drawn national  
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, he charged a pregnant woman with child abuse because  
she allegedly consumed high quantities of alcohol. A judge 
dismissed the case because Rerucha could not show any damage had 
occurred to the unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, both lawyers will take part in a hearing called by 2nd  
District Judge Jeffrey A. Donnell. The meeting has pushed back jury 
selection to Tuesday and opening statements from Tuesday to 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Security remained tight at the courthouse, where visitors had to  
weave around police tape to the only open entrance and pass through 
a metal detector. Police have been planning for demonstrations for 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to anticipate as best we can both for what we  
know is going to occur and for what we can anticipate is going to 
occur,'' said Laramie Police Cmdr. Dale Stalder.
