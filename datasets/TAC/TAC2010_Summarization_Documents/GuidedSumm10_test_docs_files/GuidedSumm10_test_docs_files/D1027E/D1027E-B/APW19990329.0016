<HEADLINE> Potential Jury Warned in Gay Attack </HEADLINE>

	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Potential jurors in the trial of a man  
charged with the beating death of Matthew Shepard were warned 
Monday to expect intense media scrutiny, the possibility of three 
weeks away from their families and graphic evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Murder is not a pretty subject,'' prosecutor Cal Rerucha said.  
``These pictures are very graphic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with first-degree murder,  
kidnapping and aggravated robbery in last October's death of 
Shepard, a gay college student. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Wyatt Skaggs also warned jurors to expect  
disturbing testimony, but he told them they should not be swayed by 
national opinion in the case. In the aftermath of the killing, some 
dismissed Laramie as a small-minded backwater. 
</P>
<P>
	The second panel was called in after attorneys went through the  
first pool of 71, dismissing two-thirds of them in the first three 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Albany County District Court officials plan to select 12 jurors  
and three alternates and begin opening statements early next week. 
Officials ended last week with 26 potential jurors, yet they wanted 
a larger pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Police allege Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, pretended  
to be homosexuals, took Shepard to a remote area east of Laramie 
and attacked him Oct. 6, leaving him bloodied and tied to a fence. 
Shepard died five days later.
