@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the posterior segment eye disease affecting elderly people and may lead to loss of vision. AMD is diagnosed using clinical features like drusen, Geographic Atrophy (GA) and Choroidal NeoVascularization (CNV) present in the fundus image. It is mainly classified into dry and wet type. Dry AMD is most common among elderly people. At present there is no treatment available for dry AMD. Early diagnosis and treatment to the affected eye may reduce the progression of disease. Manual screening of fundus images is time consuming and subjective. Hence in this study we are proposing an Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)-based nonlinear feature extraction to characterize and classify normal and AMD fundus images. EMD is performed on 1D Radon Transform (RT) projections to generate different Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF). Various nonlinear features are extracted from the IMFs. The dimensionality of the extracted features are reduced using Locality Sensitive Discriminant Analysis (LSDA). Then the reduced LSDA features are ranked using minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), Kullback–Leibler Divergence (KLD) and Chernoff Bound and Bhattacharyya Distance (CBBD) techniques. Ranked LSDA components are sequentially fed to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to discriminate normal and AMD classes. The performance of the current study is experimented using private and two public datasets namely Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) and STructured Analysis of the Retina (STARE). The 10-fold cross validation approach is used to evaluate the performance of the classifiers and obtained highest average classification accuracy of 100%, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100% for STARE dataset using only two ranked LSDA components. Our results reveal that the proposed system can be used as a decision support tool for clinicians for mass AMD screening.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a irreversible, chronic and multi-factorial ocular condition, identified by the presence of clinical features namely drusen, Retinal Pigment Epithelial Defect (RPED), Choroidal NeoVascularization (CNV) and Geographic Atrophy (GA) [1]. AMD is caused by ageing of cells in the macula region. It affects the people above the age of 50years and may lead to blindness [1]. United Nations (UN) and World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 20–25 million people are affected worldwide and 8 million people have severe visual loss [2]. According to the presence of above mentioned clinical features AMD is mainly categorized into early, intermediate and advanced stages [3]. Further, advanced AMD is classified into dry and wet type. The clinical features, symptoms, detection methods and treatment options are described in Table 1.Early stage of AMD shows no symptoms, however it can be detectable by the presence of drusen [4]. According to Wisconsin AMD grading [6] drusen is classified as per the size and boundary visibility. This work utilized Wisconsin AMD grading [6] to examine the fundus images of private dataset which is used in this study and the images are labelled as early, intermediate and late AMD by the clinical experts. Several works reported in the literatures proposed various AMD detection methods using drusen segmentation which are briefly explained in Table 2.Most of the reported works in Table 2 concentrates on drusen segmentation except few studies [9,14,16,19]. The works in [9,14,16,19] uses drusen segmentation for automated detection of AMD. However, segmentation of drusen is a challenging task due to poor boundary visibility and other abnormal lesions [21]. Hence, few works [5,7,21–27] proposed image analysis and pattern classification techniques for automated screening of AMD. Hijazi et al. [21] proposed hierarchical decomposition and spatial histogram techniques for automated AMD screening and reported an accuracy of 74% and 100% respectively. Inverse segmentation method using statistical texture features is proposed in [22,23] to identify healthy and unhealthy region in AMD images. Their method obtained an inverse segmentation accuracy of 90% for unhealthy region [22]. The statistical segmentation in [23] obtained segmentation accuracy of 89.59%, 92.69% and 93.03% for small, medium and large degeneration [23] respectively. Instantaneous Amplitude (IA) and Instantaneous Frequency (IF) are used in [24] for the detection of drusen, pigmentation, GA and extended to AMD screening. These IA and IF are extracted using Amplitude Modulation (AM)–Frequency Modulation (FM) method. Their method is evaluated using two private datasets namely Retina Institute of South Texas (RIST) and University of Texas Health Science Centre in San Antonio (UTHSCSA) and reported an Area Under receiver operator characteristics Curve (AUC) of 0.84 and 0.77 respectively. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and wavelet energy and entropy feature are used in [5] for automated screening of AMD. Their method analysed various feature ranking methods to select optimum features for AMD detection and reported an accuracy of 93.70%. Automated AMD screening using Case Based Reasoning (CBR) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is proposed in [25] and performance of their method is compared with the manual graders and reported a sensitivity of 86%. Hierarchical decomposition using trees and Weighted Frequent Sub-Graph Mining (WFSM) methods are proposed in [26] to identify normal and AMD classes using fundus images. Various texture features and ranking methods are experimented in [7] to discriminate normal and AMD classes with an accuracy of 95.07%. Hijazi et al. [27] proposed automated screening of AMD using data mining approaches. Their method extracted wavelet, texture features namely Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), colour histogram features and colour features from normal and AMD fundus images and reported a classification accuracy of 99.6%.Aforementioned works utilized data mining and pattern recognition techniques for automated screening of AMD. However, these works has following limitations: (i) lesion segmentation (drusen) [22–24], Optic Disc (OD) and blood vessel removal are mandatory [25–27]; (ii) many features are used to design a classification model [5,7,21,26,27]; (iii) existing works [22–27] uses either private or public domain datasets to evaluate their techniques. The reported works [5,7,21,26–28] for AMD detection used 1262, 1000, 50–400, 121, 54 and 22 features respectively to obtain highest classification performance. The execution time may extend with more features. Our proposed work uses less number of features for classification, it does not require any segmentation (as will be shown later in this paper), and performance is evaluated using both private and public domain datasets.In the present work various nonlinear features are extracted from Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) [29]. The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is widely used to analyse biomedical signals such as Electrocardiogram (ECG) [30], near-infrared spectroscopy muscular signals [31] and Electroencephalogram (EEG) [32,33] to detect diabetes [30,31], QRS complex [34], epilepsy [32,33] and texture analysis [35]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work applying EMD for the AMD detection. EMD breaks the signal without loosing the time domain information [29]. It can capture the subtle changes present in the biomedical signals [31]. In the past, this method yielded good classification performance by capturing the signatures present in the phonological signals. The pixel variation in AMD images is not uniform due to the presence of drusens [5,7,28]. These nonlinear changes can be captured only by nonlinear feature extraction methods [29,31,33]. Hence, in this work, we have used EMD and nonlinear features to discriminate normal and AMD classes.The block diagram of the proposed AMD detection system is shown in Fig. 2. In the first step green channel is separated from normal and AMD colour fundus images and contrast enhancement is performed using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalisation (CLAHE) [36] to improve the image contrast. Further, Radon Transform (RT) is performed on preprocessed 2D green channel fundus images at each 5°. Now the images are converted into 1D signals. These signals are subjected to EMD to generate IMFs and various non-linear features are extracted from these IMFs. The dimension of the extracted features are reduced using Locality Sensitive Discriminant Analysis (LSDA) [37] and subsequently ranked using various feature ranking techniques namely minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) [38], Kullback–Lieber Divergence (KLD) [39] and Chernoff Bound and Bhattacharyya Distance (CBBD) [40]. Further, ranked features are sequentially fed to different Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier kernels [41] namely linear, quadratic, polynomial and Radial Basis Function (RBF). The average classification performances are calculated using 10-fold cross validation.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Fundus image dataset description, preprocessing, empirical mode decomposition, feature extraction, reduction and ranking are explained in Section 2. SVM classification method is briefly described in Section 3. The results of the proposed system is presented in Section 4 and discussed in Section 5. Finally, the paper concluded in Section 6.In this section we explained private and public dataset description, preprocessing, RT, EMD, feature extraction, feature ranking and classification.Proposed method is evaluated using both private and two public datasets namely Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) and STructured Analysis of the Retina (STARE). A brief description of the database is given below.i.Private dataset:images were collected from Department of Ophthalmology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, India. The normal (n=270) and AMD (n=270) images were captured using Zeiss FF450 plus mydriatic fundus camera using 50° Field of View (FOV). Patient’s consent was taken to use the images for research purpose. Clinical experts reviewed the acquired images and graded as early AMD, intermediate AMD and late AMD (see Fig. 3) using Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) classification. These images were stored in 24bit rate format and480×364pixel resolution.ARIA dataset:images were collected from St. Pauls Eye Unit and University of Liverpool, UK. Fundus images of normal (n=101) and AMD (n=60) were captured using Zeiss FF450+ fundus camera using 50° FOV. The acquired images were stored using 24bit rate format with768×576pixel resolution. ARIA dataset images are available in the following link: http://www.eyecharity.com/aria_online.STARE dataset:images were collected from the Shiley Eye Centre, University of California and Veterans Administration Medical Centre, USA. These images (normal=36 and AMD=47) were captured using TOPCON fundus camera using 35° FOV and stored with 24bit rate format. STARE dataset has700×605pixel resolution and it is available in the following link: http://www.ces.clemson.edu/∼ahoover/stare.Fundus images of all three datasets (private, ARIA and STARE) are processed to enhance the contrast using CLAHE [36]. Generally, histogram equalization is used to enhance the contrast by stretching the most occurring intensities to produce the better contrast distribution in the image. However, histogram equalization enhances bright region into more bright and hence edges are not clearly visible [36]. CLAHE is used to overcome this problem. CLAHE separates the images into different regions and do the Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE) on each region. Hence, each region pixel intensities maps into new pixel intensity values which is proportional to the rank of the each region intensity histograms [36]. This method enhances the normal structures of the retinal images namely OD, macula, blood vessels and abnormal lesions (drusen, GA and CNV).RT is a mathematical approach developed by Johann Karl August Radon [42]. The basic principle of RT is line parametrization and it is widely used in various applications like computer vision, seismic data processing, radar imaging, geophysics, non-destructive testing and medical image processing [43]. In this work, the contrast enhanced green channel fundus image intensity is projected along a radial line at a specific angle [44] using RT. It captures the directional features of an image using series of line integrals at different angles from the centre of an image [44]. In this work, RT is performed to generate 1D projections of 2D image intensity for every step size (theta) of 5° [7]. RT of a 2D imagef(x,y)in(r,θ)plane is computed using the following equation:(1)R(r,θ)=∬-∞∞f(x,y)δ(r-xcosθ-ysinθ)dxdywhere r is the perpendicular distance of a line integral from the centre,θis the angle formed by the distance vector,δ(r)is the Dirac function [44] andδ(xcosθ+ysinθ)denotes the line integration function off(x,y)[7,44] and defined using(2)r-xcosθ-ysinθ=0Fig. 4a shows the illustration of RT computation and Fig. 4b is the result of RT for an anglesθ={0∘,5∘,…,175∘}.The EMD [29] is a data driven method which performs multi-scale decomposition and time–frequency analysis of nonlinear and non-stationary signals [29]. Using this method original signal is modulated into amplitude and frequency components called IMFs [45]. The IMF of a given signal depends on the signal local characteristics like scale and time. The condition for the IMF is given below [29,30,34,46]:(a)Each IMF should have the same number of extrema (maxima and minima) and zero-crossings or differ at most by one.The mean value of the two envelops corresponding to local maxima and minima should be zero.For a given signal (1D Radon projection of either normal or AMD fundus image)x[t], the EMD generates a set of IMFs and a monotonic residue signal and is given below:(3)x[t]=∑i=1Nci(t)+r(t)where{ci[t]}i=1Nis a set of IMFs andr(t)is the residue signal. These IMFs can be extracted using sifting algorithm. The first IMF of a signalx̃(t)can be computed as follow [29].(i)Letx̃(t)≔x(t).Detect the all local maxima and minima of signalx̃(t).Lower signal envelopeemin(t)and upper signal envelopeemax(t)are obtained by interpolating minima and maxima using cubic spline interpolation.Calculate the local meanm(t)=[emin(t)+emax(t)]/2.Amplitude and frequency modulated oscillatory modes(t)=x̃(t)-m(t)is obtained by subtracting the mean from the original signal.Letx̃(t)≔s(t)and go to step (ii) and repeat the process untils(t)satisfies the conditions of an IMF.Once the first IMF is derived, to obtain the successive IMFs, the steps (ii)–(vi) is repeated recursively to the residue signalr(t)=x(t)-s(t)until the residue signalr(t)becomes a monotonic function where any more IMFs can be extracted.This amplitude and instantaneous frequency combination used for time–frequency analysis [46]. The first three IMFs of 1D Radon transformed normal (see Fig. 5a and b) and AMD (see Fig. 5c and d) fundus images are shown in Fig. 5e–h.The AMD lesions (GA, CNV and drusen) change the spatial orientation and colour intensity in digital fundus images. These nonlinear pixel changes quantified using EMD are reflected in IMFs (see Fig. 5g and h). Moreover, nonlinear changes can be appropriately captured using nonlinear feature extraction methods like Energy, Fractal Dimension (FD), Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE), Recurrence Rate (RR), Determinism (DET), Mean diagonal line length (〈L〉), Longest diagonal line (Lmax), Entropy, Laminarity (LAM), Trapping Time (TT), Longest vertical line (Vmax), Recurrence times of 1st pointcare recurrence points (T1), Recurrence times of 2nd pointcare recurrence points (T2), Recurrence (REC), Trend, Sample Entropy (SE) and Tsallis Entropy (TE). These features are used for various other applications namely epilepsy detection [47–49], power signal analysis [50], sleep stages [51] classification and nonlinear system dynamics [52] have yielded excellent results. Hence, in this work we have used various nonlinear feature extraction techniques on first three IMFs.Energy is used to compute the amount of information present in each IMFs. FD [51] is used to compute the self-similarity of IMFs at different scales which quantifies the roughness present in the IMFs. Lyapunov exponent is used to quantify sensitivity of the system to initial conditions, if LLE value is high which indicates more pixel variations in the fundus image due to AMD lesions [47]. Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) is used to identify the number of recurrence and duration of recurrences of a signal in state space trajectory [52]. Various non-linear RQA features namely RR, DET, 〈L〉,Lmax, Entropy, LAM, TT,Vmax, T1, T2, REC, Trend [48] all are extracted from first three IMFs. SE measures the regularity of the given data where high values of SE indicates that the data is irregular and vice versa [49]. TE is a generalized version of Shannon entropy and derived using Boltzmann–Gibbs statistics [50]. It has ability to explain complexity of non-additive systems [50]. These nonlinear features quantify the subtle pixel changes in the normal and AMD fundus images.Higher Order Spectra (HOS) is also known as polyspectra which are nothing but spectral representations of the higher order moments or cumulants of a given signal [53,54]. This work computes the 3rd order polyspectrum or bispectrum from the normal and AMD fundus images and subsequently bispectral entropies namely phase entropy (PE), normalized bispectral entropy (E1), normalized bispectral squared entropy (E2) and normalized bispectral cubed entropy (E3) are computed from the bispectrum. The bispectrum (3rd order correlation) of a given signal is computed using the following equation [53,54]:(4)B(f1,f2)=E[X(f1)X(f2)X∗(f1+f2)]whereX(f)is the Fourier transform of a given signalx(nT)and approximated using fast Fourier transform,f1andf2are frequency components of a signal and varies from 0 to 1 and normalized using Nyquist criteria,E[·]is expectation operation [54]. The bispectrum of a real signal can be represented using unique triangle0⩽f2⩽f1⩽f1+f2⩽1. The bispectrum features are extracted by integrating the bifrequency space and line of integration in the non-redundant region [54]. The first three IMFs are used to compute HOS bispectrum. Further, phase entropy (PE), normalized bispectral entropy (E1), normalized bispectral squared entropy (E2) and normalized bispectral cubed entropy (E3) are derived from the bispectrum [54]. The extracted entropies quantify the variations present in the pixels of normal and AMD fundus images.From each IMF 21 nonlinear features are extracted, there are three IMFs and 36 RT projection angles (0°,5°,10°,…,175°) resulting in 2268 features. Then the dimension of the extracted features are reduced using LSDA method.Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is one of the popular feature reduction technique and helps to analyse the relationship between data points and classes [37]. However, it fails to identify the local geometry of the data points when the number of training sample is small. LSDA significantly identifies the local geometry of the data even when the training samples are less [37]. Since, ARIA and STARE are small databases, LSDA can be useful to reduce the features dimension.Considering N training samplesx1,x2,…,xN∈Rqare sampled from the submanifold M[55]. In LSDA within-class variance is constructed using the vertex setX=x1,x2,…,xNand within-class weight matrixWmcan be defined asWij=1,ifxi∈N(xj)orxj∈N(xi)0,otherwisewhereN(xi)is the set of points which are k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) ofxiand has the same label ofxi[55].Within-class compactness (Gw) and between-class separability (Gb) of LSDA [55] can be computed using following equations(5)Gw=miny∑ij(yi-yj)2Ww,ij(6)Gb=maxy∑ij(yi-yj)2Wb,ijwhereyi=αTxiandyj=αTxjis 1D mapping ofxiandxj,αis the projection direction [55]. Applying such method 2268 features are reduced to 30 LSDA components. The dimension of the reduced LSDA components can be chosen manually. In this work, we have chosen 30 which provided maximum classification performance. Further, these LSDA components are ranked using various ranking techniques namely mRMR, KLD and CBBD which are briefly explained as on below.Feature selection process is used to identify the most significant subset of the original features to reduce the classification error [56]. In this work, we have used mRMR, KLD and CBBD techniques to rank the features.Maximum relevance in mRMR method searches the features where the mutual information between independent feature and target is maximum, similarly minimum redundancy is used to identify the features that are mutually maximally distinct [38]. These two criterion’s are combined in mRMR to avoid the correlated and redundant features [38]. Mutual information between the features is computed using fuzzy entropy [57]. KLD is a distance function which compares entropy of two density distributions without prior assumptions [39]. In this work, KLD compares two feature distributions by computing entropy between the features, if the relative entropy value of a feature is high then that particular feature is considered as most significant [39] in discriminating normal and AMD classes. CBBD selects the best possible features assuming that features are normally distributed [40]. Chernoff bound on tail distributions with independent random variables gives exponential decay [40]. Hence, Chernoff bound combined with Bhattacharyya distance is used to perform feature selection. Further, these three methods are used to rank the features according to their significance and ranked features are fed to SVM classifier.Automated classification of AMD is carried out using SVM classifier with various kernel functions namely linear, quadratic, polynomial and RBF. SVM is used to construct the decision planes (hyperplanes) to separate the two classes. It follows the concept of structural risk minimization [41]. SVM can be used for linearly and nonlinearly separable datasets [41]. Various kernel functions namely quadratic, polynomial and RBF are used to project the non-linearly separable data into an higher dimensional feature space where the features are linearly separable [40]. In this work sigma of the kernel function is varied in steps (σ=0.1,0.2,0.3,…,5) to obtain the highest classification performance using Bootstrap method [58].
