This paper develops a method based on genetic algorithm (GA) for reliability-based optimization (RBO) of structures through a software application. This method employs GA as an optimization technique in which reliability constraints of RBO problem are evaluated using finite element reliability analysis modules offered by OpenSees. Since Tcl is a programmable and interpreted language, the proposed method is implemented using Tcl scripting language together with OpenSees software framework. Developing the RBO method through this software application leads to the important advantage of utilizing new advanced structural reliability methods implemented in OpenSees without compiling the source code. In the RBO problem, the cost of design is defined as an objective function and a number of design requirements are defined as reliability constraints. This method is also able to deal with RBO problems with discrete and continuous design variables. Six numerical examples are provided to investigate the strengths of the method through the software application. Results illustrate the advantages of this application in RBO of structures. Since OpenSees is used for finite element reliability analysis, this application is readily extendable to nonlinear structures.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In structural engineering, it is necessary to design structures by satisfying pre-defined performance objectives most economically [1]. Optimization methods are usually utilized to perform this task by identifying a suitable balance between safety and economy. Deterministic optimization methods do not consider uncertainties within the optimization process. Therefore, these methods may lead to unreliable designs [2].Reliability-based optimization (RBO) is a well-suited framework to design optimal reliable structures due to considering reliability terms within the optimization procedure. In RBO, usually, a number of constraints and/or objective function involve probabilistic terms.To design structures by considering reliability concepts, it is necessary to develop effective automatic procedures to perform RBO. There is a great deal of research to develop appropriate methods for solving RBO problems [3–9]. Enevoldsen and Sorensen [3] formulated RBO problems in several forms. They solved the problems by reliability index approach. Grandhi and Wang [4] proposed an improved two-point adaptive nonlinear approximation method for RBO of structures. Royset et al. [5] solved RBO problem by a decoupling approach. They reformulated the problem and solved it by a semi-infinite optimization method. Dimou and Koumousis [10] proposed a particle swarm optimization method for RBO of trusses in which reliability assessment are performed by Ditlevsen bounds. Gu et al. [11] developed an SNOPT-based framework for reliability-based optimization of structural and Geotechnical systems in OpenSees software.Valdebenito and Schuëller [12] presented an approach for performing RBO of structures with discrete design variable by constructing an approximate meta-model for reliability. They discussed that in real-world problems, the design variables are usually selected from a discrete set of variables.Since RBO problems are usually complex and multi-modal, it is necessary to utilize robust and effective optimization methods. The traditional gradient-based optimization techniques solve the problem by seeking a solution in the neighborhood of starting point. Therefore, they are not effective for solving optimization problems with multi-modal and discontinuous domain. On the other hand, genetic algorithm (GA) searches the domain in a probabilistic manner and more global, leading to a higher chance of obtaining near-global optimal solution in problems with complex domain. The advancement of computational power of computers has opened the possibility to utilize evolutionary algorithms such as GA to solve time consuming problems of RBO. As a first attempt, Thampan and Krishnamoorthy [13] performed RBO of truss structures using GA. They utilized upper bounds for calculating the reliability of truss structures. Dimou and Koumousis [14] presented a competitive GA for RBO of truss structures in which the population size of GA is calibrated by altering the resources of the system. They also used Ditlevsen bounds to estimate the reliability of the truss. Tolson et al. [15] proposed a hybrid method by linking a GA and first-order reliability method (FORM) for performing RBO of a water distribution network. Mathakari et al. [16] developed a multi-objective GA hybridized with importance sampling (IS) for RBO of space trusses. Shayanfar et al. [17] recently implemented a GA combined with second-order reliability method (SORM) for solving RBO problems with explicit performance functions using MATLAB.Recent advances in structural reliability software make it possible to utilize different advanced reliability methods combined with optimization techniques to perform RBO of structures. As one of the first attempts, CalREL has been developed by Liu et al. [18] for research and engineering practice purposes. Another general-purpose reliability software is COSSAN that was developed for computational stochastic structural analysis [19]. A new computer program, Rt, is recently developed by Mahsuli and Haukaas [20] for multimodel probabilistic analysis. An overview of structural reliability software can be found in a special issue on reliability software in the journal of Structural Safety[21]. In this context, OpenSees software framework is an appropriate tool due to its versatile approach to analyzing structures. OpenSees is an open source, object-oriented finite element-based software framework that has been developed for earthquake and structural engineering applications [22]. OpenSees has been extended with modules to perform reliability and response sensitivity analysis by Haukaas and Der Kiureghian [23]. Recently, some improvements have been made in reliability module of OpenSees [24].In OpenSees, users build models and perform structural analyses using the scripting language Tcl [25]. Tcl is a programmable interpreted language having basic language features such as control structures, variables, and procedures [26] that make it attractive for solving RBO problems with repetitive nature. OpenSees interpreter is an extension of Tcl language for finite element and reliability analysis using the classes provided for in OpenSees framework. In this context, implementation of optimization algorithm within RBO in Tcl leads to a significant decrease in run time in comparison with the case of implementing optimization algorithm in other external programs. This is because RBO usually needs to perform several reliability analyses within optimization procedure. Consequently, calling OpenSees for reliability analyses by an external program considerably increases the run time. In addition, implementation of RBO in Tcl makes it possible to utilize different advanced reliability methods and structural elements offered by OpenSees in RBO procedure.The objective of this paper is to develop a hybrid method for performing RBO of structures with discrete and continuous design variables by utilizing well-established sensitivity and reliability modules of OpenSees to evaluate reliability constraints of optimization problem. In this method, a GA is combined with finite element reliability analysis for performing RBO. Finite element reliability analysis is performed using FORM. Another novelty is the implementation of the GA as an optimization technique in the Tcl in order to deal with time consuming RBO problems. The presentation begins with describing formulation of RBO problem. A brief description about reliability and finite element reliability method utilized is then presented. The subsequent sections describe details of a GA-based method used for RBO. Six numerical examples are then provided to illustrate the application of the proposed method. The last section discusses the advantages of the proposed method through the software application and the possible future extensions of this application.Several definitions for reliability-based optimization problem have been presented in the literature [3,27,28]. A typical RBO problem can be formulated as minimization of the cost of the design subject to reliability and deterministic constraints. In this research, RBO is considered as an optimization problem in which particular constraints of optimization problem are expressed in terms of the reliability of design. In this formulation, the cost of structural design is defined as the objective function. Therefore, reliability-based optimization problem is defined in mathematical terms as follows:(1)minC(d)subjecttop(gi(d,x)≤0)≤pf,it;wherepf,it=Φ(−βit)i=1,...,nrchj(d)≤0j=1,...,ndcwhereC(.)denotes the cost of structural design, d is vector of design variables, x is the vector of random variables,gi(d,x)is the ith limit state function,hj(.)is the jth deterministic constraint,pf,itrepresents the allowable probability of failure for the ith limit state function,βitis the minimum allowable reliability index for ith limit state function, and ndcand nrcare the number of deterministic and reliability constraints, respectively. It should be noted that the design variables of optimization problem can be either deterministic variables or statistic parameters of probability distribution such as mean value of random variables.Structural reliability analysis aims at calculating probabilities of failure corresponding to the pre-specified performances [29]. Structural reliability is usually formulated based on the definition of limit state function(s), i.e.g=g(d,x). The limit state function is defined in a way thatg(.)<0represents the failure domain. The component׳s probability of failure for the design d can be calculated using the following multiple integral:(2)pf(d)=∫...gi(d,x)≤0∫fx(x)dxwhere pfis the probability of failure, andfx(x)is the joint probability density function of vector x. Since the closed-form solution for the integral is not usually available, a number of approximate reliability methods such as FORM, SORM and IS are utilized to solve the problem approximately.Reducing the number of evaluations of performance function and its gradient is necessary in finite element reliability analysis. FORM usually needs 5–10 evaluations of performance function in order to get sufficiently accurate reliability approximation [30]. For this reason, FORM is widely utilized for reliability assessment within RBO problems [31]. Therefore, in this research, FORM is utilized for finite element reliability analysis in the RBO procedure.FORM begins with transforming the input random variables to standard normal random variables as follows:(3)y=T(x)T:Rm→Rmwhere T is the probabilistic transformation. In this study, Nataf transformation implemented in OpenSees is employed to transform the random variables.In FORM, the limit state surface is approximated by a first-order Taylor approximation in the space of standard normal random variables. This method employs the concept of the so-called design point to solve the reliability problem. The design point is the most probable point (MPP) in the failure domain in the space of standard normal random variables.Finding the design point converts the structural reliability problem to a constrained optimization problem as follows:(4)β=min‖y‖subjecttoG(y,d)=g(x(y))=0where β is known as reliability index which is equal to the Euclidean distance of design point from the origin in the standard normal space. Eq. (4) can be solved by standard nonlinear optimization techniques. There are several numerical algorithms such as iHLRF, the Polak-He algorithm, the gradient projection algorithm, and the sequential quadratic programming implemented in OpenSees to solve the constrained optimization problem of Eq. (4). In this research, iHLRF algorithm is utilized to compute the design point. This is an iterative algorithm and like other sensitivity-based algorithms utilizes the gradients of performance function in each iteration.The gradient vector required for finite element reliability analysis, can be calculated using chain rule of differentiation:(5)∂g∂y=∂g∂u∂u∂x∂x∂yIn this equation,∂g/∂uis easily computed and∂x/∂yis the Jacobian of probabilistic transformation. For computing the remaining gradient,∂u/∂x, two algorithms were implemented in OpenSees by Haukaas and Der Kiureghian [23]. These algorithms include the finite difference method (FDM) and the direct differentiation method (DDM). FDM needs to repeat structural analyses for calculating the gradient, leading to high computational cost. On the other hand, in the DDM, the analytical differentiation of the governing equilibrium equations are derived and then implemented along the side of finite element response equations. Therefore, DDM leads to response sensitivities without repeated structural analyses for perturbed value of each random parameter. For this reason, in this research, for structures which include finite element modeling such as truss and frame, DDM is utilized to compute the response sensitivity. Further details about DDM and its implementation in OpenSees can be found in [23,32].GA is a heuristic optimization method that considers a group of individual solutions, called population. Inspired by the theory of evolution, GA employs survival of the fittest rule from biological science to search the optimum solution. As a gradient-free algorithm, GA uses a stochastic adaptive search based on natural evolution instead of gradient search used by traditional optimization methods.To perform reliability-based optimization of structures, GA is combined with (finite element) reliability analysis. In the proposed method, GA is used to minimize the cost of the design and performs FORM analyses in order to evaluate the reliability constraints. The general structure of the proposed GA is briefly described below:Step 1 – Initialization: generate initial population randomly.Step 2 – Fitness evaluation: evaluate fitness value for each individual (design solution).Step 3 – Selection for crossover: select two individual from the population for mating.Step 4 – Crossover: employ crossover operator to reproduce two new offspring.Step 5 – Mutation: employ mutation operatorStep 6 – Survivor selection: select the next population from the current population together with newly generated offspring.In the proposed GA, design variables of optimization problem are encoded to binary strings and these strings are then combined to construct an individual (design solution). Since this method is designed to deal with both discrete and continuous RBO problems, two different representation methods are applied to discrete and continuous problems. In RBO problems with discrete variables, a binary string is assigned to each member section (design variable). An example of binary representation of design variables for one of the section sets used in example 4 is shown inFig. 1.In continuous problems, the following formula proposed by Adeli and Sarma [33] is utilized to encoding and decoding of each design variables:(6)C=Cmin+(B/2L)(Cmax−Cmin)where C is the value that the binary string represents, Cmax and Cmin are respectively the maximum and minimum allowable values for C, B is the decimal integer value of the binary string, and L is the length of the binary string specified by the required accuracy. In this research for continuous problems L is taken to be equal to 10.In this research, fitness function is formulated as a combined function of objective function and penalty constraints. For evaluation of fitness function, each individual is decoded to a set of design variables. Finite element reliability is then executed by the iHLRF method for each individual. For truss and frame structures, response sensitivity required for reliability assessment is performed using DDM.The proposed method employs the penalty function method to handle the constraints. The penalty function method assigns a penalty value to the infeasible individuals.In this paper, after performing reliability analysis, reliability index for each probabilistic constraint is calculated and compared with the allowable value to compute the penalty terms as follows:(7)ϕi={βi−βallowable,iβallowable,iifβi<βallowable,i0ifβi≥βallowable,iwhere βiis the reliability of ith limit state function,βallowable,iis the minimum allowable reliability corresponding to the ith limit state function.By using a quadratic penalty function, the constrained optimization problem of Eq. (1) is transformed into the following unconstrained problem:(8)min∏(D,μi,ϑi)=C(D)+∑1Nυi.ϕi2where D is an individual corresponding to the vector of design variables x, ∏ is the fitness of the individual D, C(D) is the cost of the design, N is the number of (reliability) constraints and υiis a penalty coefficient. The penalty coefficient should be selected large enough to decrease the chance of infeasible individuals to be selected for reproduction in the subsequent generations.In this step, individuals with higher fitness are selected for reproducing and subsequently constructing the next generation. This paper utilizes a fitness-proportionate selection in which an individual is selected with a probability proportional to its fitness value in the population.An elitist strategy is also adapted by selecting and carrying over the best individual from the current generation into the next generation.A multi-point crossover is applied to each pair of individuals in order to reproduce two new offspring. In this process, 3 crossover points are randomly selected along the binary string representing an individual and the sections between these points are swapped as shown inFig. 2. Then, individuals are mutated with the probability of mutation. The mutation inverts randomly one binary bit in the string representing an individual. This process is schematically illustrated inFig. 3.The proposed method begins with randomly generating a population of N individuals by GA. The reliability and sensitivity modules of OpenSees are then utilized to evaluate the reliability constraints for each individual using the iHLRF method. The fitness of each individual is computed using Eq. (8). After that, crossover and mutation are applied to selected individuals to produce new offspring and construct new population. As illustrated inFig. 4, this process is repeatedly performed until the convergence of algorithm to a near-global optimal solution.In this section, six numerical examples involving a mathematical problem, a speed reducer design, a truss structure design with continuous design variables, a frame structure design with discrete design variables, and a 72-bar space truss design with discrete design variables, and a cantilever beam design are provided to investigate the strengths of the proposed method. The first two examples involve explicit nonlinear limit state functions. On the other hand, examples 3–6 involve implicit limit state functions.In the proposed method, the following parameter setting obtained by numerical experiments is used to solve the examples: the population size is 100, the rate of crossover and mutation are respectively 70% and 10%, and the penalty coefficients are set to 104. For each example, 50 different runs are performed.This example is a mathematical example with 10 random variables and eight reliability constraints [34,35]. All 10 random variables are statistically independent with normal distribution. The formulation of the problem is as follows:(9)findd=[d1d2d3d4d566d7d8d9d10]Tminf(d)=d12+d22+d1d2−14d1−16d2+(d3−10)2+4(d4−5)2+(d5−3)2+2(d6−1)2+5d72+7(d8−11)2+2(d9−10)2+(d10−7)2+45subjecttoprob(gj≤0)≤Φ(−β1t),j=1,2,3,...,8g1(x)=4X1+5X2−3X7+9X8105−1g2(x)=10X1−8X2−17X7+2X8g3(x)=−8X1+2X2+5X9−2X1012−1g4(x)=3(X1−2)2+4(X2−3)2+2X32−7X4120−1g5(x)=5X12+8X2+(X3−6)2−2X440−1g6(x)=0.5(X1−8)2+2(X2−4)2+3X52−X630−1g7(x)=X12+2(X2−2)2−2X1X2+14X5−6X6g8(x)=−3X1+6X2+12(X9−8)2−7X100≤di≤10.0,i=1,2Xi~N(di,0.022),i=1,2,3,...,10βjt=3.0i=1,2,3,...,8This example is solved using the proposed RBO method through the software application. The results (forβjt=3.0) are listed inTable 1 in which the results of other researchers are given for comparison. The reliability constraints at optimal solution are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) with 107 sample size and given inTable 2. In this table,βiMCSstands for the reliability index of ith limit state function calculated by MCS.The reliability indices listed in Table 2 illustrate that unlike the other methods all reliability constraints satisfy the target value. Another benefit of this method is that unlike the gradient-based methods the optimal solution is independent of initial point.In the case ofβjt=3.0, the convergence history for the best result and the average results for 50 runs is illustrated inFig. 5. This figure shows that the proposed method implemented in Tcl leads to the optimal solution in 120 generations. The initial population is randomly generated for all the optimization runs. For the best run, the best individual in the initial population is (1.627, 3.345, 8.189, 4.761, 1.434, 3.397, 1.137, 8.755, 7.120, 9.244) corresponding to the objective function value of 68.817. On the other hand, the worst value of the objective function in the initial population is 89758.926 corresponding to the design (5.429, 0.010, 4.995, 1.663, 0.995, 3.689, 1.261, 1.014, 4.134, 9.972). The standard deviation for the values of objective function in the initial population is 20,802.In order to show the impact of target reliability level on the optimization results, this example is also solved for three levels of reliability constraints by the proposed method. These three new reliability indices are 2, 2.5, and 3.5. The results for these levels of target reliability are listed inTable 3. This table indicates that the increase in the level of target reliability leads to an increase in the result of optimization problem. This point is illustrated inFig. 6.This example investigates reliability-based optimal design of a speed reducer structure [34–36] shown inFig. 7. The problem involves seven random design variables and 11 reliability constraints. The objective function is the weight of structure and reliability constraints are imposed on physical quantities such as geometry, bending stress, longitudinal displacement, and contact stress. The random variables are assumed to be normally distributed and statistically independent. The RBO problem is formulated as(10)findd=[d1d2d3d4d566d7]Tminf(d)=0.7854d1d22(3.3333d32+14.933d3−43.0934)−1.508d1(d62+d72)+7.477(d63+d73)+0.7854(d4d62+d5d72)subjecttoprob(gj≤0)≤Φ(−βjt),j=1,2,3,...,11g1(x)=27X1X22X3−1g2(x)=397.5X1X22X32g3(x)=1.93X43X2X3X64−1g4(x)=1.93X53X2X3X74−1g5(x)=(745X4/X2X3)2+16.9×1060.1X63−1100g6(x)=(745X5/X2X3)2+157.5×1060.1X73−850g7(x)=X2X3−40g8(x)=5−X1X2g9(x)=X1X2−12g10(x)=1.5X6+1.9X4−1g11(x)=1.1X6+1.9X5−12.6≤d1≤3.6,0.7≤d2≤0.8,17≤d3≤28,7.3≤d4≤8.37.3≤d5≤8.3,2.9≤d6≤3.9,5.0≤d7≤5.5Xi~N(di,0.0052),i=1,2,3,...,7βjt=3.0i=1,2,3,...,11Forβjt=3.0, the optimization results are given inTable 4 where other researchers׳ results are presented for comparison. This table indicates the results achieved by the proposed method are better in comparison with the results reported in the literature. Reliability indices for all limit state functions evaluated by MCS are listed inTable 5. It is seen that all reliability constraints satisfy the pre-defined target reliability.Fig. 8 illustrates the convergence history of the best result and the average of results for this example in the case ofβjt=3.0. This figure shows that the proposed method leads to the reliability-based optimal design in 160 generations. For the best run, the best individual in the initial population is (2.645, 0.775, 17.709, 8.155, 8.146, 3.744, 5.407), corresponding to the objective function value of 31036.10. On the other hand, the worst value for objective function in the initial population is 116681.621, corresponding to the solution (3.326, 0.743, 27.807, 8.236, 7.413, 2.907, 5.275). The standard deviation for the values of objective function in the initial population is 21,820.The effect of target reliability level on the optimal design is also investigated for this example. For this purpose, the RBO problem is solved for three additional values of reliability constraints. The three target reliability indices are taken 2, 2.5, and 3.5. The results of RBO problem for these reliability levels are given inTable 6 for comparison. The comparison shows that the increase on the level of reliability target increases the optimal solution (optimal design). This comparison is also illustrated inFig. 9.This example investigates reliability-based optimization of a 10-bar truss involving six nodes and 10 truss element shown inFig. 10. The truss is constructed form aluminum with Young׳s modulus of E, and is subjected to two concentrated loads of P at nodes 2 and 4. Similar versions of this example have been frequently used for evaluating optimization methods [37–39]. The RBO problem involves 12 random variables with the statistic parameters listed inTable 7. Design variables are the cross-sectional area of truss elements. The objective function is the weight of the truss and one reliability constraint is imposed on the transverse displacement of node 2. The formulation of RBO problem is as follows:(11)findd=[A1A2A3A4A5A6A7A8A9A10]TminW=ρ∑i=110AiLii=1,2,...,10subjecttoprob(g(X)≤0)≤Φ(−βt)0.10≤Ai(in2)≤35.0i=1,2,3,...,10whereg(X)=u2−2in.βt=3.0ρ=0.1lb/in3The truss element and Elastic material in OpenSees are used to construct the 10-bar truss model.The design variables of optimization problem are continuous design variables. The results of RBO problem are presented inTable 8 for four different levels of target reliability. As seen in the table, reliability index evaluated by MCS satisfies the target value.Table 8 also indicates that the increase in the target reliability level leads to an increase in the optimization results. This is also illustrated inFig. 11.In the case of β=3, the convergence history for this example is illustrated inFig. 12. This figure indicates that the convergence is achieved in near 280 generations. For the best run, the best individual in initial population is (28.422, 8.995, 25.695, 24.639, 0.986, 11.688, 24.844, 28.354, 18.538, 28.149), corresponding to the objective function value of 8700.69. On the other hand, the worst value for objective function in the initial population is 49799.23 corresponding to the solution (3.747, 1.770, 23.344, 28.899, 30.297, 34.932, 15.130, 32.512, 26.173, 31.694). The standard deviation for the values of objective function in the initial population is 12,466.This example considers a three-bay three story steel frame subjected to concentrated and uniform loads as shown inFig. 13. The frame has 17 random variables involving 6 cross-sectional member areas (Ai), 6 moments of inertia of members (Ii), Young׳s modulus of elasticity (E), dead loads of beams (WD), and 3 horizontal loads. The statistic parameters for random variables are listed inTable 9. It is assumed that the structure remains in the linear-static range. In order to get more practical design, 21 elements of structure are collected in 6 groups illustrated in Fig. 13. Therefore, RBO problem involves 6 random design variables.From optimization point of view, this example is a discrete RBO problem in which the design variables are the steel profiles of the columns and beams of the frame. The available member sections for each design variable are selected from AISC LRFD Manual [40] and are given inTable 10. This table shows that each design variable of the first four groups (columns) is chosen from a discrete set of 36 columns of W14 while each design variable of groups 5 and 6 (beams) is selected from a set of 16 profiles of W21. The objective function is the volume of structure and three reliability constraints are considered to control inter-story drifts of all three stories. The threshold value for interstory drifts is chosen equal to 0.01m. The RBO problem can be formulated as follows:(12)findd=[A1A2A3A4A5A6]TminV=∑i=16AiLisubjecttoprob(gi(X)≤0)≤Φ(−βit)whereg1(X)=0.01−u1th−stroryg2(X)=0.01−(u2th−strory−u1th−strory)g3(X)=0.01−(u3th−strory−u2th−strory)βit=3.0i=1,2,3whereuith−stroryis the displacement of ith story.The forceBeamColumn element with elastic section is used for building the finite element model. The integration type used to evaluate force-based element response is Lobatto with five integration points.In order to have more applicable design, the algorithm is adjusted in a way that the profiles selected for upper stories are smaller than or equal to the profiles chosen for lower stories. The optimal W-sections gained by the proposed method are given inTable 11. The reliability indices for all limit state functions evaluated by MCS are also listed in this table. It is seen that all reliability constraints satisfy the target value for reliability index.In order to show the effects of target reliability level on the optimal design of the frame, the RBO problem is also solved for three additional levels of reliability. The results of optimization problem are given in Table 11 for different values of reliability constraints.Fig. 14 indicates the impact of target reliability level on the optimal design of the frame. This figure reveals that the increase in the target reliability level results in an increase in the cost of the design.In the case ofβit=3.0, the convergence history for the best result and the average of results for 50 runs is illustrated inFig. 15. This figure illustrates that the convergence is achieved in 55 generations. For the best run, the best individual in initial population is (W14×283, W14×257, W14×550, W14×342, W21×166, W21×55) which corresponds to the objective function value of 4.54. On the other hand, the worst value for objective function in the initial population is 120002.3 which corresponds to the solution (W14×176, W14×82, W14×61, W14×30, W21×166, W21×166). The standard deviation for the values of objective function in the initial population is 40,828.In the proposed method, sensitivity analysis required for reliability assessment is performed using DDM rather than FDM which is commonly used. Using DDM leads to a significant reduction in the number function evaluations and structural analyses required for reliability assessment.Table 12 indicates the numbers of function evaluations performed by DDM and FDM.This table indicates the reduction in the number of functions for all three limit state functions. In the first limit state, the numbers of function evaluations for a single reliability analysis using DDM and FDM are 16 and 84, respectively. In the second and third limit states, the numbers of function evaluations for one single reliability analysis at the optimum design using DDM and FDM are 12 and 63, respectively. Comparison shows that the number of function evaluations for limit states 1, 2, and 3 is reduced by 68, 51, and 51, respectively. Therefore, using DDM (which is utilized in the proposed method) leads to an 80% reduction in the number of function evaluations for reliability analysis.This example considers reliability-based optimization of 72-bar truss shown inFig. 16. The dimensions are also shown in this figure. The truss structure is subjected to three concentrated loads at node 1 in the x, y, and z directions. The weight of the truss is the objective function and cross-sectional area for the truss members are defined as design variables. The density of material for truss elements is 0.1lb/in3. The design variables are collected in 16 groups as shown inTable 13. Therefore, the RBO problem involves 16 random design variables and two reliability constraints to control the lateral displacements of node 1 along the x and y directions. The threshold value for lateral displacements is equal to 0.3in and the target value for reliability index is assumed to be 3. The statistic parameters for random variables are listed inTable 14. Each design variable is selected from a 23-component set S={0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 1.9, 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 2.9, 3.1, 3.3, 3.5, 3.7, 3.9, 4.1, 4.3, 4.5}.The truss element with elastic section is used to construct the finite element model in OpenSees. The reliability-based optimal design is given inTable 15. The reliability index for each limit state evaluated by MCS is also presented in this table. In this table,β1MCSandβ2MCSare the reliability indices corresponding to the lateral displacement at node 1 along the x and y directions, respectively.Table 15 also presents the optimal design of the spatial truss structure for three additional different values of reliability constraint. This table shows that choosing the higher level of target reliability leads to the increase in the optimal solution.Fig. 17 illustrates the impact of target reliability level on the optimal design of the truss.The convergence history for the best result and the average of results is shown inFig. 18 for the case ofβit=3.0. This figure illustrates that the convergence is achieved in near 200 generations. For the best run, the best individual in initial population is (0.5, 2.3, 0.5, 0.5, 1.1, 1.9, 1.9, 3.9, 3.7, 0.3, 0.3, 1.3, 1.9, 0.9, 1.5, 1.1) which corresponds to the objective function value of 1184.76. On the other hand, the worst value for objective function in the initial population is 29603.54 which corresponds to the solution (2.30, 0.7, 3.1, 0.1, 3.3, 3.5, 2.1, 0.1, 2.5, 3.7, 3.7, 2.9, 0.1, 1.7, 3.9, 3.7). The standard deviation for the values of objective function in the initial population is 6220.92.This example considers RBO of the stepped cantilever beam shown inFig. 19. The beam is fabricated of isotropic material with uncertain elastic modulus E and Poisson׳s ratio υ=0.3. The beam has three random variables involving Young׳s modulus of elasticity (E), and two vertical loads P1 and P2. The statistic parameters for random variables are listed inTable 16. The objective function of RBO problem is the weight of the cantilever beam and one reliability constraint is used to control the vertical displacement of the cantilever beam tip. The threshold value for the vertical displacement of the cantilever beam tip is chosen equal to 0.35in. The height and width in both segments of the beam are design variables. Therefore, the RBO problem consists of four design variables, namely h1, b1, h2, b2. Each design variable is selected from a 41-component set as follows: h1, h2={50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 75, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100} (in), and b1, b2={5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.5, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 10.0} (in). The RBO problem is formulated as follows:(13)findd=[h1b1h2b2]TminV=ρ∑i=12bihilisubjecttoprob(g(X)≤0)≤Φ(−βt)whereg(X)=0.35−utipβt=3.0ρ=0.1lb/in3The cantilever beam is modeled with 4-node quadrilateral element as shown in Fig. 19.The results for RBO problem is given inTable 17. In this table,βMCSstands for reliability index corresponding to the vertical displacement of cantilever beam tip calculated by MCS.Table 17 also indicates the optimal design of the cantilever beam for four levels of target reliability. Comparison of the optimization results illustrates that the higher reliability levels increase the weight of the cantilever beam (i.e. the cost of the design). The sensitivity of optimal design in terms of target reliability level is also shown inFig. 20.In the case ofβit=3.0, the convergence history is shown inFig. 21 illustrating that the convergence is achieved in near 100 generations. For the best run, the best individual in initial population is (97, 80, 7.2, 5.7) which corresponds to the objective function value of 17,316. On the other hand, the worst value for objective function in the initial population is 56978.5 which corresponds to the solution (77, 77, 5.7, 9.0). The standard deviation for the values of objective function in the initial population is 13,850.It should be noted that in the examples, the standard deviation for the values of objective function and the difference between the values of objective function for the best and worst solutions in the initial population are relatively large. This is due to using the penalty function method that penalizes the infeasible (random) solutions by adding the penalty terms to their objective function.
