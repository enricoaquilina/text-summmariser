@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
An appropriate DEA LP problem can be solved to find the economic capacity output.The capacity output in U.S. manufacturing in 2007 is calculated for each state.This capacity output differs from both short run capacity output and Banker's MPSS.Out of 48 states, we find economies of scale in 16 and diseconomies for 31.A subsequent bootstrap analysis broadly supports the DEA findings.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
An economic measure of scale efficiency is the ratio of the minimum average cost to the average cost at the actual output level of a firm. It is easily measured by the ratio of the total cost of this output under the constant and variable returns to scale assumptions. This procedure does not identify the output level where the average cost reaches a minimum. This paper proposes a nonparametric method of measuring this output level using DEA. The relation between this efficient production scale, the short run physical capacity output, and the most productive scale size (MPSS) is also discussed. An empirical application using state level data from U.S. manufacturing is used to illustrate the procedure. The DEA findings are further analyzed using a smoothed bootstrap procedure.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In standard microeconomic theory, the capacity output of a firm has been defined in several different ways. The simplest of them is the maximum level of output that can be produced from a given level of quasi-fixed inputs (like plant and machinery) even when variable inputs (like labor or materials) are available without restriction. By definition, the actual output produced cannot exceed this maximum quantity. This is a physical measure of capacity that is technologically determined. First proposed by Johansen (1968) it has been subsequently popularized in empirical applications by Fӓre, Grosskopf, and Kokkelenberg (1989).11Klein and Long (1973) argue that critical bottlenecks in intermediate inputs (like fuel) can also limit the capacity output.An economic interpretation of capacity is the output level where the average cost curve of the firm reaches a minimum. Here again, one needs to distinguish between the short run, where some inputs are fixed and the long run, where all inputs are variable. The presence of fixed costs associated with the quasi-fixed inputs of the firm justifies the U-shaped average cost curve and the output level where the short run average (total) cost reaches the minimum is the capacity level for the given bundle point of the (quasi) fixed inputs.22In fact, Cassels (1937) argues “It is generally agreed that, since the absolute technical upper limit of output obtainable from the fixed factors is likely to lie far beyond the realm of practical economic operations, their capacity output should be taken as that at which the average full costs of production are at their minimum”.In the long run, there are no fixed inputs and all inputs are freely adjusted in order to minimize the cost of producing a given output level. The presumed U-shape of the long run average cost curve results not from the presence of any fixed inputs but from economies of scale at smaller levels of output followed by diseconomies of scale at higher output levels. In the standard textbook analysis of long run equilibrium in a constant cost perfectly competitive industry, free entry and exit drive the market price to the level of the minimum long run average cost and each firm that remains in the industry produces the corresponding level of output. The long run competitive output level is considered to be the capacity output. This is an economic interpretation of capacity, which is determined by the position and curvature of the average cost curve and, for nonhomothetic technologies, on input prices as well. Economies of scale exist at all output levels below this capacity output. Diseconomies of scale set in once this benchmark output level is exceeded.33The presumed U-shape of the long run average cost curve has been questioned by many writers (e.g. Kaldor, 1935; Klein, 1960). When neither economies nor diseconomies of scale prevail at different output levels, the long run average cost curve is horizontal and there is no unique minimum point. Presence of fixed costs would still ensure the U-shape of the short run average cost curve. The capacity output level in such cases is defined by the point of tangency between the short run and the long run average cost curves (Berndt & Morrison, 1981; Klein, 1960; Segerson & Squires, 1990). Even when scale economies and diseconomies are present at different output levels, it is possible that the average cost curve may have a ‘flat bottom’ in which case capacity output corresponds to an interval rather than a point on the average cost curve.Monopolistic competition is regarded as an inefficient market structure relative to perfect competition because although firms earn zero profit in the long run in both cases, only in the perfectly competitive market is the output produced at the level where the long run average cost is minimized.44Of course, the concept of average cost is meaningful only in the context of a single output technology. For multiple outputs one must consider the minimum ray average cost for a given output-mix. In this paper we consider the single output case only.It is considered to be socially wasteful because there remains excess capacity in the sense that further economies of scale remain unexploited.55Cassels (1937) and Paine (1936) considered implications of government intervention in imperfectly competitive markets with excess capacity.In parametric models, one can determine the efficient output level from the estimated cost function by solving for the condition that the output elasticity of total cost should be unity at the efficient output scale.66For multiple outputs, the partial elasticities of total cost with respect to the individual outputs must add up to unity.In nonparametric analysis, however, this is not a feasible approach because there is no explicit cost function that can be differentiated. However, at the efficient output level, average cost attains a minimum and, hence, average and marginal costs are equal at this point. This, in its turn, implies locally constant returns to scale (CRS). Hence, even when variable returns to scale (VRS) holds across different levels of output, the minimum cost of producing this output level would be the same whether or not one assumed constant returns to scale globally.Following Johansen (1968), Fӓre, Grosskopf, and Kokkelenberg (FGK) (1989) introduced a measure of short run capacity utilization for a firm as the ratio of its actual level of the output and the maximum that could be produced from a given level of its fixed inputs assuming that the variable inputs were available without limit. This physical upper bound and the corresponding measure of capacity utilization have been used in several empirical applications in the DEA literature. Fӓre, Grosskopf, and Kokkelenberg (1989) in their own paper analyzed capacity utilization in a sample of 19 coal-fired steam-electric generating plants from Illinois treating capital as the fixed input and labor and fuel as variable inputs. Dupont, Grafton, Kirkely, and Squires (2002) applied the FGK model to measure excess capacity in multi-product privatized fisheries in Nova Scotia. Vestergaard, Squires, and Kirkely (2003) obtained both ray measures and product specific measures of fishing capacity utilization for 69 Danish gill-net vessels. In an input-oriented variant of this approach, Kerstens, Vestergaaard, and Squires (2006) measured what can be more appropriately be called capital utilization at the industry level using data from Danish fisheries. In an application in a different area, Valdmanis, Bernet, and Moises (2010) use the FGK model to measure capacity utilization in 168 hospitals in Florida as a part of emergency preparedness assessment.77For a different approach to measuring capacity utilization in the intensive care unit of a hospital using queuing theory see Kim, Horowitz, Young, and Buckley (1999).Coelli, Grifell-Tatje, and Perelman (CGP) (2002) argue (quite logically) that the Johansen–FGK measure of short run capacity utilization is not of much practical use for a manager because the cost of variable inputs required to attain the capacity output may exceed the additional revenue from the extra output. Instead, they proposed a ‘ray’ measure of capacity utilization by finding the optimal scale of the output bundle (with the output mix unchanged) that would maximize short run profit given the actual levels of the fixed inputs. It may be noticed that in a single output case, their capacity output is simply the short run profit maximizing level of the output. CGP applied their model to data from a sample of international airlines. Pascoe and Tingley (2006) estimated this non-parametric ray measure of fishing capacity utilization of a Scottish fleet of vessels.Fӓre, Grosskopf, and Kirkely (2000) had proposed a different revenue based measure of capacity utilization derived from the dual of an output oriented Distance Function with no upper bound on the sub-vector of variable inputs. Lindebo, Hoff, and Vestergaard (2007) used this revenue based measure to evaluate capacity utilization of Danish North sea trawlers.Ray, Mukherjee, and Wu (2006) modified the FGK approach by treating the actual amount of variable cost as an additional fixed input (working capital) apart from the usual machinery and equipment regarded as fixed input in the short run. Their approach permits the firm to freely select its bundle of variable inputs within the allowable expenditure limit.Sahoo and Tone (2009) provide a non-radial (slack-based measure) of physical capacity utilization allowing free availability of the variable inputs.In the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) literature, one compares the optimal solutions of the cost minimization problems under alternative returns to scale assumptions to determine whether or not a particular output level represents the efficient output scale. Of course, the minimum cost under the CRS assumption is never higher than that under the VRS assumption. The ratio of the two measures the scale efficiency at the observed output level. The measured level of scale efficiency provides useful information in two ways. First, when it is different from unity, one concludes that the output level under consideration does not constitute the efficient production scale. Second, its numerical value shows how much the average cost of the firm would be lowered if it changed its output to the optimal scale. But it does not identify the output level88There may be a range of outputs where the average cost remains a minimum. In such cases, one would like to identify the smallest and the largest output levels where the minimum average cost is attained.where the average cost curve attains a minimum.This paper develops a simple procedure in DEA that lets one determine not only the minimum long run average cost but also the level of output where the average cost attains a minimum. When the actual output is smaller than this efficient output level, economic capacity utilization is less than 100 percent. The opposite is true, when actual output exceeds this benchmark. The paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 presents the methodological background for DEA and introduces the procedure that determines the efficient output level that can be used as benchmark for measuring capacity utilization. The section includes a simple numerical example of the proposed model. Section 3 provides an empirical application using state level data for total manufacturing production in the United States from the 2007 Census of Manufactures. The findings from the DEA model are also compared with the findings from a smoothed bootstrap analysis, Section 4 is the summary.Consider an industry where firms produce a scalar output y using input bundlesx∈R+n. An input–output bundle (x, y) is considered feasible when y can be produced from x. The set of all feasible input–output bundles constitutes the production possibility set(1)T={(x,y):ycanbeproducedfromx}.Suppose that (xj, yj) is the observed input–output bundle99In this paper vectors are identified by superscripts and scalars by subscripts.of firm j (j = 1, 2,…, N). Obviously, every observed input–output bundle is feasible. Under the fairly non-restrictive assumptions that the production possibility set is convex and that both inputs and outputs are freely disposable, one can approximate the set T by the free disposal convex hull of the observed bundles(2)S={(x,y):x≥∑1Nλjxj;y≤∑1Nλjyj;∑1Nλj=1;λj≥0(j=1,2,…,N)}.If, additionally, one assumes CRS, for any (x, y) ∈ T, for any k ≥ 0, (kx, ky) ∈ T. Correspondingly the empirical construct of the CRS production possibility set would be(3)SC={(x,y):x≥∑1Nλjxj;y≤∑1Nλjyj;λj≥0(j=1,2,…,N)}.An alternative characterization of the technology is possible in terms of the input requirement sets. For any specific output level (y0), the input requirement set consists of all input bundles that can produce y0. This set can be expressed as(4)V(y0)={x:(x,y0)∈T}.Empirically, the input requirement sets will be(5)V^(y0)={x:x≥∑1Nλjxj;y0≤∑1Nλjyj;∑1Nλj=1;λj≥0(j=1,2,…,N)}under the assumption of variable returns to scale (VRS) and(6)V^C(y0)={x:x≥∑1Nλjxj;y0≤∑1Nλjyj;λj≥0(j=1,2,…N)}if CRS is assumed.When VRS is assumed, the minimum cost of producing any output y at input price (vector) w0 is(7a)CVRS(w0,y)=minw0′x:x∈V(y).Similarly, under CRS, the minimum cost is(7b)CCRS(w0,y)=minw0′x:x∈VC(y).In empirical applications, the minimum cost of output y at input prices w0 under the VRS assumption is estimated as1010Under the VRS assumption the minimum cost can be estimated only if y does not exceed the largest observed output quantity.(8)CVRS(w0,y)=minw0′xs.t.∑jλjxj≤x;∑jλjyj≥y;∑jλj=1;x≥0;λj≥0;(j=1,2,…,N).The corresponding average cost is(9)ACVRS(w0,y)=CVRS(w0,y)y.In order to find the output level where the VRS average cost reaches a minimum one needs to solve the problem:(10)minw0′xys.t.∑jλjxj≤x;∑jλjyj≥y;∑jλj=1;x≥0;y≥0;λj≥0;(j=1,2,…,N).The optimal input–output bundle (x*,y*) from (10) yields the minimum average cost(11)ACVRS(w0,y*)=CVRS(w0,y*)y*=w0′x*y*along with the efficient output level (y*). Note that in (10) the output level y is also a choice variable.Unlike standard DEA problems, the minimization problem in (10) is a non-linear programming problem and can be computationally quite burdensome. However, one can utilize the following two lemmas from production economics to determine both the output level y* and the minimum average cost ACVRS(w0, y*) by solving a simple DEA LP problem.Lemma 1Locally Constant Returns to Scale holds at the input-output bundle (x*, y*) where the average cost reaches a minimum.Suppose this is not true. Then there exists a pair of non-negative scalars (α, β) such that (βx*, αy*) ≡ (x**, y**) ∈ T and α > β. Note that the average cost at (x**, y**) isACVRS(w0,y**)=w0′x**y**=βw0′x*αy*=βαACVRS(w0,y*).But, because α > β by assumption, this would imply that ACVRS(w0, y**) < ACVRS(w0, y*). This contradicts the assumption that average cost reaches a minimum at (x*, y*). Hence it is proven.Lemma 2If the technology exhibits Constant Returns to Scale globally, average cost is a constant at all output levels.Consider two different output levels, y0 and y1. Suppose that at some vector of input prices w the input bundlex*0minimizes the cost of producing y0. Hence,CCRS(w,y0)=w′x*0andACCRS(w,y0)=w′x*0y0.Similarly,x*1minimizes the cost of producing y1.CCRS(w,y1)=w′x*1andACCRS(w,y1)=w′x1*y1.Now suppose that ACCRS(w, y0) ≠ ACCRS(w, y1) and assume (arbitrarily) that ACCRS(w, y0) > ACCRS(w, y1). Defineρ=y0y1.We know that(x*1,y1)is a feasible input–output bundle. Now, because CRS holds,(ρx*1,ρy1)is also feasible. Denote the bundleρx*1as x2. Further, ρy1 equals y0. That is, (x2, y0) is feasible. Now, if ACCRS(w, y0) > ACCRS(w, y1),w′x*0y0>w′x*1y1=w′ρx*1ρy1=w′x2y0. That is, the input bundle x2can produce the same output level y0 at a lower cost than the bundlex*0. In that case,x*0could not have minimized the cost of producing the output y0. Hence it is proven.Suppose that firm k faces the input prices wkand produces the output quantity yk. Our objective is to find the output levelyk*=y(wk)that minimizes ACVRS(wk, y).For this we first consider the CRS cost minimization problem(12)minwk′xs.t.∑jλjxj≤x;∑jλjyj≥yk;λj≥0.Suppose that at the optimal solution∑jλj*=qand∑jλj*xj=x*.This implies that wk′x* = CCRS(wk, yk) is the minimum cost of producing ykat input prices wkunder the CRS assumption. Then, by Lemma 2,1qwk′x*=1qCCRS(wk,yk)=CCRS(w0,1qyk). Define the output levely¯=1qykand the weightsμj*=1qλj*. Clearly,∑jμj*=1and eachμj*≥0. Further, define the input vectorx˜=1qx*=∑jμj*xj.Now consider the VRS cost minimization problem(13)CVRS(wk,y¯)=minwk′xs.t.∑jλjxj≤x;∑jλjyj≥y¯;∑jλj=1;λj≥0.Suppose that the optimal solution of (13) yields a minimum costwk′x¯.It can be seen from above that theμj*s andx˜from (12) constitute a feasible solution for (13). Hence,(14)wk′x¯≤wk′x˜.At the same time,wk′x˜=1qwk′x*=CCRS(wk,y¯)is the optimal solution of the less restrictive CRS problem(15)minwk′xs.t.∑jλjxj≤x;∑jλjyj≥y¯;λj≥0.Hence,(16)wk′x˜≤wk′x¯.The inequalities together imply(17)wk′x˜=wk′x¯.Therefore, at the output levely¯the total and average costs are the same under both CRS and VRS assumptions. That is at the output levely¯the average cost ACVRS(wk, y) reaches a minimum. In other words,y¯is an efficient production scale.1111To obtain the efficient output levely¯one could simply solve the DEA LP problem (12) for the unit output level (y = 1) and the efficient output level isy¯=1∑jλj*.Recall, however, thaty¯=1qyk.Hence, an economic measure of capacity utilization is(18)CU=yky¯=q.In order to obtain the capacity output one only needs to solve the CRS cost minimization problem and from the optimal values of the λs compute(19)y¯=ykq=yk∑jλj*.The method proposed in (12) and (19) is very similar to Banker's (1984) primal approach to returns to scale determination. However, there is a subtle difference. In Banker's approach, for specific input–output combination (xk, yk), one solves the following input-oriented CCR problem(20)minθs.t.∑jλjxj≤θxk;∑jλjyj≥yk;λj≥0(j=1,2,…,N).From the optimal solution of (20), one computesq=∑jλj*,β=θ*q, andα=1q, then, as shown by Banker (1984), (βxk, αyk) is an MPSS. Note that this optimization problem is totally independent of input prices. Comparing (12) with (20) one can easily see that there is no reason why αykwould be the same as the output levely¯obtained from (19). The fundamental difference is that for Banker's MPSS, the input-mix in the observed bundle xkis held constant and only radial changes are considered.1212Minor adjustments for slacks at the optimal solution of the MPSS problem do not alter α.By contrast, in (12) the input-mix is not predetermined and is obtained from the optimal solution of the problem.It would be useful at this point to compare this economic measure of the capacity output with the physical capacity measure defined by Fӓre, Grosskopf, and Kokkelenberg (FGK) (1991). Following Johansen (1968), FGK define the capacity output as the maximum quantity of output that a firm can produce given its (vector of) quasi-fixed inputs1313Ray, Mukherjee, and Wu (2006) consider working capital (measured by a firm's total expenditure on variable inputs) as an additional quasi-fixed input.even if unlimited quantities of the variable inputs were available. Suppose that input vector is partitioned as x = (v, f), where v is the sub-vector of variable inputs and f is the sub-vector of fixed inputs. Then for any given bundle of fixed inputs f0, capacity out is defined by FGK as(21)y**(f0)=maxy:(v,f0,y)∈T.In empirical applications, the FGK capacity output is measured asy**=φ**y0where(22)φ**=maxφs.t.∑jλjyj≥φy0;∑jλjvj≤v;∑jλjfj≤f0;∑jλj=1;v≥0;λj≥0(j=1,2,…,N).Note that apart from non-negativity the variable inputs are unconstrained and, in consequence, play no role in the optimization problem in (21). Recall that the technically efficient output producible from the given levels of variable and fixed inputs (v0, f0) isy*=φ*y0where(23)φ*=maxφs.t.∑jλjyj≥φy0;∑jλjvj≤v0;∑jλjfj≤f0;∑jλj=1;v≥0;λj≥0(j=1,2,…,N).FGK defined capacity utilization asy*y**=φ*φ**.It is clear from above that φ** ≥ φ* and, therefore, their measure of capacity utilization can never exceed unity. By contrast, the capacity utilization rate defined in (18) can be greater than unity. This is because, while FGK's capacity output represents a physical upper bound that cannot be exceeded given a specific bundle of fixed inputs f0, the efficient output level where average cost reaches a minimum can easily be exceeded by a firm because there are no fixed inputs and all inputs are choice variables. As Cassels (1937) pointed out the economic capacity output refers to capacity of all inputs rather than any specific set of fixed inputs.The capacity output levely¯defined above will not be unique unless the DEA LP problem (12) has a unique optimal solution. When multiple optimal solutions exist, even though the objective function would have the same minimum value, the λs (and q, the sum of these λs) would differ from one solution to another. In that case, we would need to determine the smallest and the largest value of q across the alternative optimal solutions. Let qLbe the smallest and qHthe largest value of the sum of the λs across these alternative solutions. Then,y¯L=ykqHis the smallest efficient scale of output. On the other hand,y¯H=ykqLis the largest efficiency output scale beyond which diseconomies of scale will apply. Over the interval[y¯L,y¯H]the average cost curve would be flat.In order to determine the smallest efficient output scaley¯L=ykqHone needs to solve the following auxiliary LP problem:(24)qH=max∑jλjs.t.∑jλjxj=x;∑jλjyj≥yk;w0′x=w0′x*;λj≥0.In this problem the constraint w0kx = wk′x* ensures that only the λs from the optimal solution of (12) would be eligible. In an analogous manner the largest efficient production scaley¯L=ykqLcan be obtained from the solution of the following LP problem:(25)qL=min∑jλjs.t.∑jλjxj=x;∑jλjyj≥yk;w0′x=w0′x*;λj≥0;(j=1,2,…,N).Consider a 1-output 2-input example. Table 1shows the hypothetical quantities of output (y) and inputs (x1) and(x2) for 7 firms identified as unit 1–7. Assume further that each firm faces the same input prices (w1 = 10, w2 = 5).For each firm k, we solve the DEA cost minimization problem(26)minw1x1+w2x2s.t.∑j=17λjxij≤xi(i=1,2);∑j=17λjyj≥yk;∑j=17λj=1;λj,xi≥0;(j=1,2,…,7;i=1,2)to get the minimum cost under the VRS assumption. For the different output quantities the minimum cost and the corresponding levels if average cost are shown asCVRS*and ACVRS. The average cost initially declines with output, reaches a minimum of 10.45 at output level 11 and then continues to increase. Thus, the economic capacity output level is y* = 11. For each unit, the ratioyky*is the corresponding measure of capacity utilization.We then solved the problem(27)minw1x1+w2x2s.t.∑j=17λjxij≤xi(i=1,2);∑j=17λjyj≥1;λj,xi≥0;(j=1,2,…,7;i=1,2)to obtain the cost of producing 1 unit of the output1414See footnote 11 above.under the CRS assumption. The minimum cost in this case was 10.45 and at the optimal solution1∑j=17λj*=11, which is the capacity output.In this empirical application we use output quantity and input quantity and price data for each of the 48 continental states in the U.S. constructed from the Census of Manufactures for the year 2007. For this, we conceptualize a 1-output, 5-input production technology and assume that there is no difference in the technology across the states in any given year.One problem with the Census of Manufactures data is that the reported output and input quantities are aggregates over all establishments covered by the survey in that state. This total input–output bundle is not an observed data point. However, the unit-level input–output quantities (although not reported individually) are all feasible input–output bundles. The total input–output bundle is necessarily feasible only if the underlying production technology is assumed to be additive. This, in its turn, implies constant returns to scale. But, in that case, the question of the efficient production scale becomes irrelevant. However, the average (or per establishment) input–output quantities for that state is, in effect, an equally weighted convex combination of the actual (though unreported) input–output bundles of the individual units and is feasible even under the VRS assumption so long as the production possibility set is convex. In this empirical application per establishment data from each state is treated as the observation from that state. The production possibility set is constructed as the free disposal convex hull of these points.Given the fact that the market for manufactured goods is nationally integrated, we assume that the output price does not vary across states so that the value of output is a reasonable measure of the quantity produced.1515Conceptually, U.S. manufacturing is viewed as a multiple output industry. But when all firms face the same output prices and there is no allocative inefficiency, the value of output can serve as an appropriate aggregate measure of the output bundle. See, in this context, Banker, Chang, and Natarajan (2007).Input prices, however, do vary across states. The inputs included are (a) production labor (L1), (b) non-production labor (L2), (c) capital (K), (d) energy (E), and (e) materials (M). Output is measured by the gross value of production. Production labor is measured by the number of hours worked (in thousands). The corresponding input price is wage paid per hour to production workers (w1). The other labor input is the number of non-production employees. The corresponding wage rate (w2) is total annual emolument per employee. The capital input is the average of beginning-of-the year and end-of the year (nominal) values of gross fixed assets (millions of dollars). The capital input price (i.e. user cost), pK, is measured by the sum of depreciation, rent, and interest expenses per dollar of gross value of capital. The quantity of the energy input (E) is constructed by deflating the expenditure on purchased fuels and electricity by state specific energy price (pE). Total expenditure on materials, parts, and containers is used as a measure of the materials input quantity (M). By implication, materials price (pM) was set equal to unity (when measured in current dollars) for every state.Summary statistics about the input and output quantities along with the input prices are reported in Table 2. Gross value of output per establishment varies between a maximum of $47.466 million in Louisiana and a minimum of $ 5.224 million in Rhode Island. The average of gross output per establishment across the 48 continental sates was $13.280 million. The coefficient of variation was 0.544. Number of production workers per establishment was the highest in Mississippi (96.65) and the lowest in Montana (20.23). The U.S. average was 58.67. The highest number of non-production employees was highest in Kansas (15.69) and lowest in Montana (4.33). The U.S. average was 11.67. Consistent with the size of gross output per establishment, energy consumption was the highest in Louisiana and the lowest in Rhode Island. Hourly wage rate of production workers was a maximum of $22.39 in Michigan and a minimum of $15.62 in Arkansas with the U.S. average of $18.62. For non-production workers, the annual salary (including benefits) per employee was $76.27 thousand in New Jersey at the high end and $48.74 thousand in Montana at the low end. Price of energy per million Btu was the highest ($21.61) in Massachusetts and the lowest ($7.56) in North Dakota. User cost of capital (per dollar of gross value of fixed assets) had an average of 17 cents across the states with a maximum of 21 cents per dollar in Nevada and 13 cents per dollar in Wyoming.Table 3reports the actual output (yj), the scale efficient outputy¯(wj), capacity utilization rate (CU), scale efficiency (SE) and related information about each individual state (j). The efficient output level (y¯(wj)) was found to be $9.415 million for every state. Differences in the input prices did alter the long run average cost curves but did not change the output level where these different average cost curves reach their respective minima. For a parametric and differentiable cost function, this would suggest that the total cost function is multiplicatively separable in the input prices and the output quantity.1616Suppose that the total cost curve can be written asC(w;y)=a(w)·b(y),where w is the vector of input prices and y is the output quantity. In that case,AC(w,y)=C(w,y)y=a(w)·[b(y)y].It is clear that the first order condition for a minimum of the average cost isyb′(y)−b(y)y2=0.This, in turn, impliesb′(y)=b(y)y.This last equation is totally independent of w. Hence, changes in input prices would not change the output level that solves the equation in (28).Such multiplicative separabilty of the cost function implies that the underlying technology is homothetic. In the case of DEA, the empirically constructed isoquants are piece-wise linear and do not have the smooth convex shape found in textbook illustrations. As a result, the optimal point is not sensitive to (even moderate) changes in relative input price. Hence, any conclusion about homotheticity of the technology remains merely speculative.Comparison of the actual output per establishment with the benchmark output of $9.415 million yields the capacity utilization rate (CU) reported in Table 3. Connecticut is one state where output per establishment is at the efficient scale. Of the 16 states with capacity utilization rates below unity, 6 states (Rhode Island, Florida, Nevada, Montana, Colorado, and New York) show capacity utilization rates below 75 percent. At the other extreme, the output per establishment in Louisiana is over 5 times the efficient production scale and in Delaware it is over three times as large as the optimal scale.It is important to note that although the optimal production scale(y¯(wj)), where the average cost attains a minimum at the applicable input prices is the same for all of the states, there is considerable variation in the minimum average cost itself across states due to input price differences. At the lower end it is 57.3 cents per dollar of gross output in Mississippi and at the upper end it is slightly over 64.9 cents per dollar in Massachusetts. The actual output (yj) (in millions of dollars), the efficient total cost C(wj, yj) and average cost C(wj, yj) at the observed output level, and the minimum average cost C(wj, yj) are also reported in Table 2. Comparison of the average cost at the optimal and the actual output levels yields the measure of scale efficiency (SE). While the capacity utilization rate varies considerably across the states, far less variation can be found in levels of scale efficiency. An interesting point to note is that the same level of scale efficiency is observed for two states located at two completely different segments of their respective average cost curves. Take the example of Florida and Delaware. Both states have scale efficiency of 0.88. That is, the minimum average cost (at the optimal scale) would be about 88 percent of the average cost at their observed levels of output. But this does not reveal the fact that the actual output in Florida ($5.795 million) is only 61.5 percent of the optimal output ($9.415 million) whereas in Delaware the actual output ($29.842 million) is 317 percent of the optimal output. By the same token, the capacity utilization rate only identifies how far below or above the efficient production scale does a firm operate. It does not measure the extent of scale economy that can be exploited by altering the output level appropriately. In this sense, CU and SE provide complementary information about the operational efficiency of a firm. Together they also provide a (gross) measure of the elasticity of the average cost with respect to a change in output. Take the case of Florida. At the actual output of $5.795 million the average cost is 67.7 cents per dollar whereas at the optimal scale ($9.415 million) the average cost would fall to 59.7 cents per dollar.This is a $3.62 million (62.46 percent) increase in output and a 8 cent (11.8 percent) decline in average cost. Broadly, it implies an output elasticity of average cost equal to −0.189. For Delaware, the change in output would be a decline of $20.427 million (68.45 percent) and the decline average cost would be 8.6 cents (11.91 percent). The resulting elasticity of average cost would be 0.174. As a general rule, let y0 and y* be the actual and optimal levels of output and, correspondingly, AC0 and AC* be the actual and optimal levels of average cost. Then the proportionate changes in average cost and output areΔACAC0=AC*−AC0AC0=(SE−1)andΔyy0=y*−y0y0=(1CU−1)=1−CUCU.Thus the output elasticity of average cost is(28)ɛyAC=SE−11−CUCU.The numerator is less than or equal to 0 by definition. When CU is less than unity, the denominator is positive and elasticity is negative. This is consistent with positive scale economies at output levels below the capacity output. Similarly, the elasticity is positive for output above the capacity level signifying that output and average cost both change in the same direction (i.e., decline).Table 4reports two other measures of the capacity output along with the associated measures of capacity utilization. The first is the short run capacity output (y**) from (22) due to FGK. The ratio of this actual output (y0) and this capacity output is the gross capacity utilization measure (fgk_cu) shown in Table 3. It should be noted that it incorporates both technical inefficiency (wasted capacity) and under-utilization of capacity (unutilized capacity). For 7 out of the 48 states (Colorado, Florida, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, and Rhode Island) the short run (maximum) capacity output is smaller than the economic (efficient) capacity. It needs to be remembered, however, that the FGK capacity output for any state is the maximum output producible given the quantity of its quasi-fixed input whereas for the efficient output level all inputs are optimally chosen and the quantity of quasi-fixed input may exceed the observed level if that leads to a lower average cost. In 4 cases (Idaho, Maine, West Virginia, and Wyoming) the FGK capacity utilization rate was less than 50 percent and in 2 others (Rhode Island and Vermont) it was below 60 percent. At the other end, in 5 cases (Delaware, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, and New Mexico) short run capacity utilization was 100 percent. In 2 other cases (Nebraska and South Dakota) the rate of capacity utilization exceeded 90 percent.The other measure of capacity output reported in Table 3 is the output level at Banker's MPSS (obtained from (20)). The corresponding capacity utilization rate is reported for the individual states in the column identified as ‘Ratio’. For 4 states (Connecticut, Maine, Oregon, and Rhode Island), Banker's MPSS output level is smaller than the efficient output scale. However, in all of these cases, the difference between the two is really small. Especially for Connecticut, the two are almost identical. In 8 cases (Alabama, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia) the actual output exceeded the MPSS. For Alabama, however, the two were almost identical. In 8 other states (Connecticut, Delaware, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oregon, and Wyoming) the actual output was at the MPSS. On average, states were utilizing 75.2 percent of their short run capacity (the FGK measure) and were producing 83.5 percent of their respective MPSS output levels. However, they were producing 41 percent above the optimal output level and were experiencing diseconomies of scale. Correlation between the economic capacity utilization rate and the MPSS ratio was about 52 percent. Correlation between the economic and physical (short run) capacity utilization rates was even lower (32.7 percent). As already noted, the FGK measure of capacity utilization is lower than 1 by construction. The other two measures, by contrast, allow capacity utilization beyond 100 percent. A closer look at the results reported in Table 2 shows that 16 of the 48 states were operating in the downward sloping segment of their average cost curves and a single state (Connecticut) was at the efficient production scale. The remaining 31 states were experiencing diseconomies of scale. As can be found from Table 3, many of these states were found to be operating well below their MPSS output levels. For example, the rate of economic capacity utilization (CU in Table 2) in Texas was 2.38. Thus, it was way up in the region of diseconomies of scale along the average cost curve. However, as shown by the ‘Ratio’ in Table 3, it was found to be producing only 82 percent of the MPSS output level and was in the region f increasing returns to scale along the VRS frontier.Such conflicting evidence arises because of the fact that while the MPSS analysis keeps the observed input-mix unchanged, in determining the economic capacity level one changes the input-mix to attain full allocative efficiency. For practical policy, the economic capacity utilization measure is a better guide because when input prices are available, changing the production scale while keeping a sub-optimal input mix makes no sense. A state where the average firm is experiencing diseconomies of scale, the right policy would be to encourage a reorganization of the industry with an increased number of smaller firms. The opposite would be true where the average firm is found to be experiencing economies of scale. There the policy should be to provide incentives for consolidation of firms so that at a larger output scale, the average firm can exploit the economies of scale the fullest extent.It is widely recognized that DEA does not make any accommodation for random noise in the data and as result, all deviation from the frontier is regarded as inefficiency. Holland and Lee (2002) in their Monte Carlo simulation with data generate from a Cobb Douglas technology found that the DEA estimates of capacity utilization were quite sensitive to both random noise and model specification. To address this problem analysts researchers often resort to bootstrapping (along the lines developed by Simar and Wilson (1998)) in order to generate a non-parametric distribution of the DEA efficiency measure.1717While bootstrapping for output oriented efficiency is more common, there are applications in input oriented models as well in the literature.Unlike in the case of output or input oriented technical efficiency, there is no standard bootstrapping procedure for the problem at hand. That is because in this case we are not looking for a distribution of technical efficiency directly obtained from the optimal solution of a DEA LP problem. What we are trying to generate is a distribution of the output level where the long run average cost reaches a minimum.This was carried out in the following steps:(i)The actual input–output data were used in an output-oriented VRS model to obtain for each observed input–output bundle (xj, yj) the maximum feasible output expansion factor,φj*.From the DEA sample{φ1*,φ2*,…,φN*}1000 smoothed bootstrap samples{φ1b,φ2b,…,φNb}(b=1,2,…,1000)were drawn using a Gaussian kernel and the reflection method to handle cases where a bootstrap φ was less than 1.For each bootstrap replication (b) an artificial output levelyjb=φj*φjbyjis associated with the input bundle xjto create a bootstrap data setDb={(xj,yjb);j=1,2,…,N}.For each bootstrap sample data Dbthe DEA LP problem (17) is solved to obtain the capacity outputyb*(wj)for the input price vector wjfaced by unit j.The 1000 values ofyb*(wj)provide the empirical distribution of the capacity output of unit j.Table 5 reports the main findings from the bootstrap analysis. The columns y0 andy* show the actual output and the capacity output obtained from DEA with the observed data for each state. The next three columns – ymean, y5 percent, and y95 percent – show the mean, the 5-percentile, and the 95-percentile of the empirical distribution of the capacity output for each state. The last four columns – CUDEA, CUmean, CU5 percent, and CU95 percent – are the corresponding capacity utilization measures from the DEA estimate and the mean and the 95- and 5-percentiles of the capacity output distribution. Judging by the column CUmean 26 out of the 48 states in the data set had capacity utilization greater than unity and, by implication, were operating in the upward rising segment of their respective long run average cost curves. In fact, in 3 states – Delaware, Louisiana, and Texas – the actual output was more than twice as large as the corresponding capacity output. On the other hand, Wyoming appears to be the only state where the actual output ($11.887 million) is approximately equal to the (bootstrap mean) capacity output. The simple correlation between the bootstrap mean and the simple DEA measure of capacity utilization across the 48 states in the data set was 99.7 percent. This lends a great measure of credibility to the DEA results reported and discussed above.A closer look at Table 5 provides more information about the probability distribution of capacity utilization in the various states. The column labeled CU95 percent shows values less than for 12 states (Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Vermont). Thus, there is 95 percent (or higher) probability that each of these states is operating in the region of economies of scale. On the other side, judging by the column CU5 percent there is a 95 percent probability that 13 states (Alabama, Delaware, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas) are operating in the region of diseconomies of scale.One needs to end with a note of caution. The purpose of the empirical analysis is primarily to provide an application of the methodology proposed in the paper rather than to serve as an in-depth analysis of the U.S. manufacturing sector. For any serious policy prescription, the conclusions drawn from the empirical analysis should be validated by a more disaggregated analysis with establishment level data.
