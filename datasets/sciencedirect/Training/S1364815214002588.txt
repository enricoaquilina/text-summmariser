@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The Plant Modelling Framework (PMF) is a software framework for creating models that represent the plant components of farm system models in the agricultural production system simulator (APSIM). It is the next step in the evolution of generic crop templates for APSIM, building on software and science lessons from past versions and capitalising on new software approaches. The PMF contains a top-level Plant class that provides an interface with the APSIM model environment and controls the other classes in the plant model. Other classes include mid-level Organ, Phenology, Structure and Arbitrator classes that represent specific elements or processes of the crop and sub-classes that the mid-level classes use to represent repeated data structures. It also contains low-level Function classes which represent generic mathematical, logical, procedural or reference code and provide values to the processes carried out by mid-level classes. A plant configuration file specifies which mid-level and Function classes are to be included and how they are to be arranged and parameterised to represent a particular crop model. The PMF has an integrated design environment to allow plant models to be created visually. The aims of the PMF are to maximise code reuse and allow flexibility in the structure of models. Four examples are included to demonstrate the flexibility of application of the PMF; 1. Slurp, a simple model of the water use of a static crop, 2. Oat, an annual grain crop model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, 3. Lucerne, perennial forage model with detailed growth, development and resource use processes, 4. Wheat, another detailed annual crop model constructed using an alternative set of organ and process classes. These examples show the PMF can be used to develop models of different complexities and allows flexibility in the approach for implementing crop physiology concepts into model set up.The Plant Modelling Framework source code is freely available for non commercial use and can be viewed at http://apsrunet.apsim.info/websvn/listing.php?repname=apsim&path=/trunk/then clicking on the “Model” then “Plant2” folders. Note that the PMF (called Plant2 in internal documentation) does not stand alone and users will need to download the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (http://www.apsim.info/Products/Downloads.aspx) to build and use PMF models.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A key purpose of APSIM is to simulate realistic long-term dynamics in agricultural simulations (Holzworth et al., 2014; Keating et al., 2003). To do this, a range of arable, pasture, vegetable, tree, bush, vine and weed models are required to represent different kinds of plant communities and their contributions to the water and nutrient balance of agricultural land. However, the development and maintenance of many models requires considerable time and financial commitment. This problem is relevant to all agricultural systems modelling platforms that provide the capacity to simulate different crop types (Brisson et al., 2003; Jones et al., 2003; Stockle et al., 2003). Generic crop templates have been developed to address the problem (van Keulen et al., 1982; Penning de Vries et al., 1989). They are based on the hypothesis that crop models can be constructed from a generic set of software classes that are then assembled and parameterised differently to represent the physiology of different crops. From this, the idea of process oriented programming was developed where sub routines represent a process defined as “a series of events, which drive the dynamics of the system in response to system attributes and environmental conditions” (Wang et al., 2003; Wang and Engel, 2000). A crop was defined as a system with a set of components such as phenology, organ genesis and biomass production. Processes are closely related to a specific system component and result in the change of the components state variables. Efforts have been made by a number of groups to increase flexibility in the way that generic crop templates are set up to make models more adaptable to different requirements. The DSSAT group developed the CROPGRO template (Boote et al., 1998) in which crop coefficients are set in a ‘species file’ to configure the model as a particular crop type. CROPGRO has been applied to a large number of crops but has forced developers into a fixed structure and numerous changes have been required to the code base to adapt it to different crop types. The APES simulator (Donatelli et al., 2010) provides a range of pre-determined crop model component options and parameters that the user selects through a graphical user interface (GUI). Similarly CROSPAL (Adam et al., 2010) provides a framework which combines expert knowledge and libraries containing crop modelling with a GUI that allows crop models to be assembled using combinations of different modelling approaches, However, to date CROSPAL based plant models have not been incorporated into a full farm systems model.Specific to the APSIM model, Wang et al. (2003) developed the generic crop model template (GCROP). This consisted of a set of component and function classes in a crop process library (source code) and configuration files. The configuration file informed the APSIM model of what classes to assemble and what their parameter values were. This meant model developers could focus on determining crop parameter values and evaluating crop models without the need to write model code. Reusing the same code for each model also meant maintenance was simplified because the code base was smaller and changes did not have to be repeated in multiple code sets whenever a fix or enhancement was implemented. In 2003 a new template was developed for APSIM which was derived from the ideas and structure of GCROP and the generic legume model (Robertson et al., 2002) implemented in C++ and named PLANT in recognition of the application of the template to communities of plant species other that those defined as crops.From the 41 plant models currently in APSIM (Holzworth et al., 2014), 26 are implemented using the PLANT or GCROP templates including cereals (Keating et al., 2001; Manschadi et al., 2006; Peake et al., 2008), legumes (Robertson and Carberry, 1998; Robertson et al., 2002; Turpin et al., 2003), horticultural crops (Robertson et al., 2002), vines (Huth et al., 2009; Robertson et al., 2005), pastures (Dolling et al., 2005; Probert et al., 1998b; Verburg et al., 2007) and weeds (Thornby et al., 2006; Whish et al., 2002). However, over time a number of limitations have been exposed in the PLANT template approach. In particular, it has a limited set of functionality available to model developers and creating new functions is difficult due to the structure and implementation of the template. This has forced models into a fixed structure. However, different researchers have different, but equally acceptable, ideas about how reality should be abstracted. For instance, if data describing environmental responses are limited and the intended scope of model application is limited to specific situations (e.g. the study of yield under irrigated conditions at a single location), a simple model might be preferred. If the physiology of crop has been intensively studied and a model is to be used in a number of different situations (e.g studying yield, water and nitrogen balance in a range of locations and management systems), a more detailed crop model will be preferred. Both approaches are legitimate in certain circumstances. As a result of the prescribed form of the generic template, crop modellers who want to take different approaches have not used it. Instead they have integrated alternative models into APSIM, resulting in contrasting code bases for crop models and a maintenance burden for the software team.New developments in the software industry (David et al., 2013), as well as lessons learned over the last 10 years from building models in the GCROP and PLANT templates (Holzworth and Huth, 2009b; Holzworth et al., 2010), have made an update to the generic crop template possible. Newer computer programming languages (e.g. C#) have the ability to inspect source code at runtime, extracting metadata about the code. This ability, called reflection or introspection (Rahman et al., 2004), can be used by a model framework to locate required functionality (classes) and determine their data requirements (inputs). This means that classes can be developed independently and models can be constructed at run time from executable mark-up language (XML) files that specify how to assemble and parameterise classes. The updated template is called the Plant Modelling Framework (PMF). This has been in development over the past 3 years aiming to achieve a number of key design goals:•Enable models to be established at different levels of complexity.Enable code reuse and minimise the amount of code to maintain.Externalise the structure and parameterisation of a crop model.Provide a framework that enables the easy inclusion of new organ, process and function class alternatives.The aim of this paper is to describe the PMF both conceptually and technically as a modular framework for building crop models and provide a set of example models of contrasting complexity to demonstrate its application and flexibility. One of these models is fully validated and previously implemented in APSIM (Wheat), one is a simple model also previously implemented in APSIM (Slurp) and two are alternatives to current APSIM models and still under development (Oat and Lucerne). This paper is not intending to provide a full description of these example models but use them to demonstrate different ways that science is translated into software in the PMF.The PMF classes are abstracted at the plant or sub-plant level. However, an instance of PMF represents a community of identical plants so the basic units for class properties are expressed on an area basis (m−2). Italics are used when referring to the names of specific classes, properties, events and values within the PMF software and names that refer specifically to the examples shown in Fig. 1are given in single quotes. There are three main types of classes in the PMF (Fig. 2):•Top-level Plant class which provides an interface between instances of the crop model and the other models in the APSIM environment such as soil models and weather data. It also serves as an interface with the other PMF classes.Mid-level classes.○Organ classes which contain properties including; current status, supplies and demands of biomass (dry mass,DM, and nitrogen,N, mass); dimension (e.g. Height and LeafAreaIndex) and the number of constituents (e.g. GrainNumber) within that organ. These include Root, Leaf, Reproductive and Generic organ classes.Process classes that orchestrate activity at the plant level and provide cues or instructions to organ classes. These include the arbitration of resource allocation to organs (Arbitrator class) and the phasic (Phenology class) and morphological (Structure class) development of the crop.Sub-classes that organ and process classes delegate to for processes and/or data structures that repeat the same pattern. Multiple instances of a sub-class are used to represent each repetition (e.g. live and dead biomass, phases of development, cohorts of leaves).Low-level function classes contain generic mathematical, logical, reference or procedural code to return values to be used in mid-level class calculations.Processes are programmed in a general way within the source code of mid-level classes. An example is shown in Fig. 3for the Structure class. This class has a property of MainStemNodeNo who's value is calculated daily in the DoPotentialDM event method. The values for ThermalTime and MSNAppRate which are used in this calculation are links to Function classes rather than simple floating point declarations. The PMF infrastructure will look for a Function with the same name as the declaration e.g. ThermalTime and MainStemNodeAppearanceRate. This allows any type of function to be selected providing the names match. Therefore, the model developer can chose different functions to provide values to the source code depending on how they want to represent it in their model. There are a range of broadly generic function classes that are used to implement a specific algorithm that can be used by many higher level classes (Table 1). There are also a number of specialised function classes that perform a single function, such as calculating an organ's DMdemand, but are still generic as they can be re-used by any organ and any plant model. Function classes can also take the values they require from other function classes. Therefore, functions can be assembled in many different ways to derive values for the processes contained in mid-level classes.The type, arrangement and parameterisation of classes to be included in a model is specified by a plant configuration file (executable mark up language) and the PMF has an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to allow plant models to be constructed visually (Fig. 1). An example of how functions can be assembled to deliver values can be seen in Fig. 1 where the Oat ‘Stem’ Organ class calculates its ‘DMDemand’ using a Minimum function (‘DMDemand’). This gets its values from two Multiply functions (‘NodeNumberLimitedDemand’ and ‘HeightLimitedDemand’) which in turn get their values from LinearInterpolation (‘SpecificStemDensityMax’), Constant (‘SpecificStemLengthMax’) and VariableReference functions (‘DeltaNodes’, ‘DeltaHeight’ and ‘Stems’). While functions that deliver values to a mid-level class have to have a name that matches the source code (‘DMDemand’ in the example above), the names of subordinate functions are arbitrary so they can be given names appropriate for the concept they represent (eg, ‘DeltaNodes’, ‘DeltaHeight’ and ‘Stems’ in the example above).The Plant and lower level class structure and the use of a configuration file to select and parameterise classes was also used in the original APSIM PLANT template. The additional structuring of classes into mid and low level classes and the development of an IDE for visual configuration is new to PMF.Instances of crop models communicate with the APSIM model environment using .NET events which are raised to correspond with management or processing events such as Sow, Process, Harvest, EndCrop and Cut (Moore et al., 2007). The Sow event handler is invoked whenever a crop is to be sown. On this event the crop model constructs and configures its class hierarchy. The bulk of PMF computation is triggered by the Process event. In response to this event, the Plant class raises a number of its own events (Fig. 2) that propagate processes through the mid-level classes:1.DoPhenology is subscribed to by the Phenology class and triggers calculation of daily crop development.DoPotentialGrowth is subscribed to by the Structure class and each Organ classes and triggers the calculation of how much each organs number of constituents, dimensions and mass could change and how much DM and N they may contribute to plant growth.DoWater is subscribed to by Root and Leaf organ classes and triggers calculations of water supply and demand used to determine the extent of water stress.DoArbitrator is subscribed to by the Arbitrator class and triggers procedures to determine how much DM and N each Organ class will actually contribute and receive.DoActualGrowth is subscribed to by Organ classes, triggering updates of other state variables and moves senesced biomass from Live to Dead biomass pools.Propagating processes through the PMF in this way enables flexibility of model structure. If a particular functionality is required, the appropriate class is included and responds to the appropriate events. If that functionality is not required in the crop model the class can be excluded from the configuration and the events that it would have responded to go unheard.Phenology is the development of crop through a series of phases which exhibit differences in the genesis of organs, nature or environmental response or resource partitioning. Crops differ widely in both the number of phases they contain and the types of behaviour exhibited within these phases. Similarly, model developers differ in their opinion of the number and type of stages that characterise crop phenological development. Phenology may not be required for simple crop models (such as Slurp) that do not change their function over time. When phenology is required in a crop model, it is represented by including the Phenology class in the plant configuration file with the necessary Phase sub-classes (Fig. 1). The number and type of Phase sub-classes (Fig. 2) is unlimited by the source code and is at the complete discretion of the model developer. Phenology works on a daily time-step. Each day (when the DoPhenology event is invoked) the Phenology class interrogates the current Phase class to determine if it has reached its Target. When it has, it calculates the proportion of the day that was not used to complete that phase and passes it to the next Phase class instance. This is repeated each day until all phases have been completed. Rewind actions can also be included to return the crops development to an earlier phase to simulate the effects of defoliation on perennial crops. This structure enables phenology of varying degrees of complexity to be established (Fig. 1). There are a range of Phase sub-classes representing different types of phenology which are described in Table 2and examples of the parameterisation of phases are given in Section 3.The Structure class represents the crops morphology and is required for models where organ classes need this information. The main properties of the Structure class include PlantPopulation, MainStemNumberPerPlant, MainStemPrimordiaNumber, MainStemNodeNumber, MainStemBranchNumber and Height.All organ classes use the same Biomass sub-class to keep track of their live and dead biomass status (Fig. 2). The Biomass sub-class currently deals with DM and N content of organs. In the future it will also deal with P, K and other nutrients. Each of these components of biomass are separated into three types of pools represented by the properties:•StructuralDM and N are essential for the growth of the organ. They remain within the organ once it has been allocated and are passed from Live to Dead pools as the organ senesces.MetabolicDM and N are essential for growth and their concentration can influence the function of organs (e.g. photosynthetic efficiency of the leaf depends on MetabolicN content). MetabolicDM and MetabolicN may be reallocated (moved to another organ upon senescence of this organ) or retranslocated (moved to another organ at any time when supplies do not meet the structural and metabolic DM demands of growing organs).NonStructuralDM and N are non-essential to the function of an organ. They will be allocated to an organ only when all other organs have received their Structural and Metabolic allocations and may be reallocated or retranslocated.A range of organ classes have been developed for the PMF. The simplest is the GenericOrgan which contains properties of biomass status and daily biomass demand and supplies (Table 3). The reproductive organ is similar to the generic organ but determines its biomass demands in a different way and also has a GrainNumber property. SimpleLeaf and Root organs deal with biomass demands the same as GenericOrgan. However, SimpleLeaf includes properties for DMSupply (photosynthesis), LeafAreaIndex, GreenCover and WaterDemand (Table 3). It is called simple because it is much less dynamic that the regular Leaf organ. The Root organ has additional properties of Depth, RootLengthDensity, NSupply and WaterSupply. More detail of the different way these organs can be set up is given in Section 3.A phytomer type Leaf class has also been developed for the PMF. It has the same basic properties as SimpleLeaf but predicts the area and biomass as the tally of areas and biomass of separate cohorts of leaves. A cohort of leaves is represented by a main-stem node position and branch leaves are kept in the same cohort as the main-stem leaf appearing at the same time (Lawless et al., 2005). The Leaf class delegates the status and function of individual cohorts into LeafCohort sub-classes (Fig. 2). Further detail of the Leaf class is given in Oat model example below.Organ classes have been designed around an arbitrator interface that provides a core set of properties that Organ classes may need to provide to the Arbitrator class with their biomass supplies and demands and to receive biomass allocations from the Arbitrator (Fig. 4):•Biomass supply and demand properties, which are set by each organ class and interrogated by the Arbitrator class:○DMSupply contains supply types Photosynthesis, Retranslocation and ReallocationDMDemand contains types Structural, Metabolic and NonStructuralDMPotentialAllocation contains types Structural, Metabolic and NonStructural which are used to calculate NDemand typesNSupply contains supply types Reallocation, Uptake, Fixation and RetranslocationNDemand containing Structural, Metabolic and NonStructural types.Biomass allocation properties that are set by the Arbitrator class to deliver biomass allocations to each organ class:○DMAllocation contains Allocation, Reallocation and Retranslocation typesNAllocation contains Allocation, Reallocation, Uptake, Fixation and Retranslocation types.To minimise the amount of code needed, these arbitrator interface properties are all contained within a BaseOrgan class and all other organ classes inherit from this. Each property has zero values by default and code written into the appropriate properties of inheriting organ classes overwrites these defaults. Specific organ classes only contain procedures to assign values to those supplies and demands that are relevant. For instance the Leaf class is currently the only one that contains a PhotosynthesisDMSupply and the Root class is the only one containing an UptakeNSupply. However, if models require other organs to photosynthesise or take up N, these can be added into other Organ classes without needing to reengineer the arbitrator interface.The Arbitrator regulates the partitioning of biomass among Organs using resource supplies and demands from each Organ instance (Fig. 4). The growth of a plants DM is the minimum of DM supply from photosynthesis and DM demands from structural growth and the capacity to store non-structural DM (Gent and Seginer, 2012). The PMF arbitrator extends this idea to the organ scale where the DM supply becomes that of photosynthesis plus the reallocation and remobilisation of non-structural DM from other organs. In situations where DM demands exceed supplies the Arbitrator class can partition to organs based on their demand relative to other organs or on a user-specified priority ranking. The partitioning of N is inherently linked to DM partitioning in the PMF Arbitrator class based on the partitioning concepts of the SIRIUS modelling approach (Jamieson et al., 1998).The Plant class first invokes DoPotentialGrowth (Fig. 2) when each organ determines how much its biomass, dimensions and number properties could increase and sets the values of DMSupply and Demand properties (Fig. 4). Next it calls DoDMArbitration and DoNArbitration which trigger a sequence of functions in the Arbitrator class to determine how much DM and N will be allocated to each organ (Fig. 4). DoPotentialDMAllocation takes PhotosynthesisDMSupply and ReallocationDMSupply, partitions these to organs based on their Structural and MetabolicDMDemands and partitions any SurplusDMSupply to organs based on their NonStructuralDM demand. If some DMSupply is still unallocated this remains unallocated with the assumption that the plant would down regulate photosynthesis due to lack of sink capacity in such cases (Gent and Seginer, 2012). If the Structural and MetabolicDMDemand are not met RetranslocationDMSupply is used to meet these demands. Then DoNReallocation, DoNUptake, DoNRetranslocation, and DoNFixation determine organ NAllocation from each of these supplies. DoActualDMAllocation takes NAllocations for each organ, determines if this is enough to maintain MinNConc and if not the DMAllocation is constrained and SurplusDM discarded. This assumes that under severe N stress photosynthesis would be down regulated due to N inadequacy limiting sink strength (Gent and Seginer, 2012; Jamieson et al., 1998).Currently arbitration has only been implemented to deal with N supply. However, P, K and other nutrients can also be included in the same way with each organ registering supplies and demands, the arbitrator allocating these and constraining DM allocations to maintain minimum nutrient concentrations in organs.Water stress is represented in PMF using a WaterSupplyDemandRatio property calculated as supply/demand (Brown et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2004). The supply comes from the Root organ (Table 3) and demand from the MicroMet model in APSIM (Snow and Huth, 2004). Values ≥ 1 mean water supply is able to met demand and values <1 infer some degree of stress. Processes that are influenced by water stress have their rates multiplied by stress factors. The PMF allows water stress factors to be included to influence any process. Currently they are applied to photosynthesis, leaf area expansion, stem extension, leaf senescence, branch mortality and N fixation. These responses to water stress are configured in the crop.xml files (e.g. the ‘FW’ function under ‘Photosynthesis’ in the ‘Leaf’ organ of the lucerne model, Fig. 1).The simplest crop model implemented in PMF is Slurp (named after the action of slurping water from the soil) which consists of SimpleLeaf and Root organs. This model is for the purpose of doing water balance studies where detailed representation of plant processes are not required, e.g. Snow et al. (2007). The functionality given by Arbitrator, Phenology and Structure classes is not needed so these classes are omitted from the Slurp configuration. The values of LeafAreaIndex, Height and RootDepth are given to Leaf and Root organs by Constant functions.The oat model is an example of a complex crop model, currently under development, to demonstrate the functionality of the cohort leaf class.The structure of the phenology model is displayed in Fig. 1. The ‘Germinating’ phase is represented by a Germination phase class and the ‘Emerging’ phase by an Emerging phase class (Table 2). The emergence phase leads into a ‘Vegetative’ phase which is currently represented by a Generic phase class (Table 2) with a constant 70 °C ThermalTimeTarget. This can be expanded with more detailed functionality in the future to represent vernalization responses of sensitive cultivars. Next is the ‘EarlyReproductive’ phase, which is also a GenericPhase class with a ThermaltimeTarget that uses a LinearInterpolation function to decrease from 650 °Cd to 400 °Cd, as photoperiod increases from 10 to 16 h. This captures the photoperiod sensitivity that is displayed by oats (Martin et al., 1998a). FinalMainStemNodeNumber is set in the Structure class on the completion of the early reproductive phase (Section 2.3) and the following ‘PseudoStemExtension’ phase is a LeafAppearance phase class (Table 2) that finishes when flag leaf has appeared. Following this there are a series of Generic phase sub-classes with Constants for ThermaltimeTarget representing grain development and ripening phases (Fig. 1).In the oat model MainStemPrimordiaNumber is assumed to represent the number of primordia committed to becoming leaves. In cereals the commitment of primordia to becoming leaves increases as a linear function of leaf appearance until floral initiation, when the fate of all primordia is set (Brown et al., 2013; Jamieson et al., 2007). Sonego et al. (2000) showed that final main-stem node number in ‘Drummond’ oats is related to the modified Haun stage at which floral initiation occurs (FIHS) by:FinalMainStemNodeNumber=2.8+1.2×FIHSTo model this, MainStemPrimordiaNumber is set to 3 at the time of emergence and MainStemPrimordiaInitiationRate is calculated by dividing MainStemNodeAppearanceRate by 1.2 (‘PrimordiaPerMainstemNode’ function in Fig. 1). MainStemPrimordiaNumber is fixed at floral initiation (the end of the ‘EarlyReproductive’ phase) which determines the upper limit for MainStemNodeNumber (Fig. 5a). Thus, the photoperiod response that is programmed into the early reproductive phase directly affects FinalMainStemNodeNumber and the timing of flag leaf and subsequent anthesis (Section 3.2.1). The value of MainStemNodeAppearanceRate for predicting MainStemNodeNumber (Fig. 5a) is delivered by a Multiply function (‘MainStemNodeAppearanceRate’ in Fig. 1) that provides the product of ‘BasePhyllochron’ (Constant function) and ‘LeafStageFactor’ (LinearInterpolation function) that decreases as MainStemNodeNumber increases (Jamieson et al., 1995; Martin et al., 1998b).The ‘BranchingRate’ (number of new branches produced each day, Fig. 1) is given by a Multiply function that returns the product of a ‘PotentialBranchingRate’, a ‘ShadingFactor’ and a ‘WaterStressFactor’. In oats, the first tiller appears when the 4th main-stem node appears and in wide spaced plants a further tiller may appear with each main-stem node until floral initiation. To reproduce this process the PotentialBranchingRate is a PhaseBasedLookup function with a LinearInterpolation function returning a value (increasing from 0 for the first 3 main-stem nodes, to 1 for all subsequent nodes) from emergence until floral initiation and returning a Constant of zero for subsequent phases. As plant spacing decreases the extent of tillering on individual plants decreases also. To capture this, the ‘ShadingFactor’ is a LinearInterpolation function which has a value of 1.0 when GreenCover is between 0 and 0.5, decreasing to 0 at a GreenCover of 0.8. This means, at lower populations, plants will produce more tillers than at higher populations. ‘ShadeInducedBranchMortality’ and ‘DroughtInducedBranchMortality’ functions are also included (Fig. 1) with LinerInterpolation functions returning positive values at high GreenCover and low WaterSupplyDemandRatio respectively.The Oat model uses the Leaf organ class containing the phytomer leaf model. The duration of expansion of oat leaves is twice that of the phyllochron (Sonego et al., 2000) so the GrowthDuration value is delivered to each Cohort class by a Multiply function returning the product of ‘Phyllochron’ and a Constant of 2.0. This means the difference between number of tips and number of fully expanded leaves will also be 2 (Fig. 5a). The MaximumSize of each Cohort is currently set as a function of node position but will be changed to a function of developmental stage to capture the effect of changes in final leaf number on the position of the largest leaf. The LagDuration, when the cohort area remains at its maximum is a Constant 800 °Cd and the SenescenceDuration a Constant 600 °Cd. The ‘ShadeInducedSenescenceRate’ uses a LinerInterpolation function to return a value of 0 when OverlyingCover is < 0.8, increasing to a rate of 0.02 for covers from 0.8 to 0.97 and increasing to 0.1 when OverlyingCover exceeds 0.97. Thus, when a crop has a high stem population and many leaves, the lower leaves will senesce away keeping LeafAreaIndex at realistic values. A comparison of the size of each leaf position relative to that predicted for each cohort is shown in Fig. 5b and the net LeafAreaIndex predicted from this model for different drought treatments shown in Fig. 5d.The ‘Grain’ in the oat model (Fig. 1) is represented by a Reproductive organ class (Table 3). The GrainNumber given by a Multiply function which returns the product of Structure.TotalStemPopulation (using a VariableReference function), the number of ‘PaniclesPerStem’ (a Constant of 0.83), the number of ‘SpikeletsPerPanicle’ (a Constant of 25) and the number of ‘GrainsPerSpikelet’ (a LinearInterpolation returning a value which increases from 0 at flowering up to 1.95, 250 °Cd after flowering).The ‘Stem’ is represented by the GenericOrgan class (Table 3). Stem weight is correlated with node number (main-stem and branched nodes) over a range of water stress conditions giving differences in internode length (Martin, unpublished data). This shows there is plasticity in the specific length (mm g−1) of nodes so when stress reduces node expansion the nodes can become denser. However, under severe stress the correlation between node number and stem mass changes suggesting there is a limitation to how dense internodes can become. To capture this, the StructuralDMDemand is determined using a Minimum function which returns the lowest of ‘DeltaNodeNumber’ and ‘DeltaHeight’ limited demands (Fig. 1). The ‘Husk’, ‘Rachis’ and ‘Peduncle’ organs are also represented by the GenericOrgan class but with simple representations of StructuralDMDemand using a function class called PopulationBasedDemand. This function has parameters of MaximumOrganSize, StartStage and GrowthDuration. Linear growth is assumed so daily StructuralDMDemand of each organ is calculated as the product of PotentialDailyGrowth (MaximumOrganSize/GrowthDuration), ThermalTime, a WaterStressFactor and the TotalStemPopulation (assuming each stem has one of these organs). An example of the biomass accumulation patterns that result from these organ class parameterisations is shown in Fig. 5c.Lucerne is a perennial crop that is frequently cut and the extent of biomass partitioning to below ground organs varies among the consecutive regrowth periods throughout the year (Teixeira et al., 2007a). It is also a crop for which recent advances in physiology had been included into another model (Teixeira et al., 2009). The lucerne model is used to demonstrate how feasible it is to reproduce the functionality of an alternative model of intermediary complexity into PMF.The Germination, Emerging, and Generic Phase classes (Table 2) are used to construct the development of the lucerne crop from sowing – harvest ripe (Fig. 1) with phases parameterised as described by Teixeira et al. (2011). Lucerne differs from the other crop models described because it is perennial (as opposed to annual) and regrowth must be modelled. To achieve this there are a set of regrowth phases that the crop proceeds into once grain production is complete (Fig. 1). The crop will also reset phenology to the ‘RegrowthVegetative’ phase each time a defoliation event is specified by the APSIM Manager module. When regrowth reaches the end of the ‘RegrowthEarlyReproductive’ phase, phenology is then re-set to the ‘PodDevelopment’ phase (Fig. 1) so the same phases can be used to represent the seedling and regrowth crop.In the case of lucerne, the complexity of seasonal changes of leaf size and branching dynamics makes it challenging to parameterise the phytomer model in the Leaf class. Instead the SimpleLeaf class (Table 1) was used with functions included to provide changes in LeafAreaIndex, DMSupply and DMDemand (Fig. 1). Teixeira et al. (2007b) showed the daily increase in LeafAreaIndex of lucerne is closely related to thermal time in unstressed crops with MainStemPopulation greater than 800 stems/m2. To capture this LeafAreaIndex is modelled using an Accumulate function (’LAI’ in Fig. 1) which keeps a tally of daily increments (‘DeltaLAI’) in response to ThermalTime. ‘DeltaLAI’ uses a Multiply function to return the product of (i) potential leaf area expansion rate (‘LAER’, a Constant value of 0.016 m2 leaf per m2 of soil per °Cd), (ii) a ‘PhotoPeriodAdjFact’ (LinearInterpolation retuning a value of 1.0 for photoperiods > 12, reducing to 0 at a photoperiod of 10.0 h), (iii) a ‘LAIAdjFact’ (LinearInterpolation factor to reduce expansion rates at LAI < 1) and (iv) a ‘SeedlingAadjFact’ which was a PhaseLookup class returning a value of 0.6 for seedling phases and 1.0 for regrowth phases. The Accumulate class subtracts a specified proportion from value when a defoliation event is sent from the APSIM model so LAI is decreased in response to such events. The LAI model is relatively simple collection of functions but was able to reproduce the LAI dynamics of a lucerne crop for 2 years from sowing (Fig. 6a).The ‘Leaf’ was as SimpleLeaf organ given a DMSupply by including the RUEModel function (‘Photosynthesis’ in Fig. 1) parameterised using the RUE responses described by Brown et al. (2006). The ‘DMDemand’ for leaf was provided by including a PartitionFractionDemand function which returns a demand that is the product of DMSupply and a PartitioningCoefficient which was adapted from the one described by Teixeira et al. (2009).The ‘Stem’ organ used the GenericOrgan class (Table 3) with a PartitionFractionDemand function to set its ‘DMDemand’ as described by Teixeira et al. (2009). The tap and fine roots were represented with the Root organ class which provides mineral N and water supplies to the arbitrator and keeps track of below ground biomass. Lucerne shows a seasonal fluctuation in below ground DM with increases in the autumn and reductions in winter and spring (Fig. 6c). This was modelled by using two collections of functions to reproduce seasonal patterns of (i) biomass partitioning to roots and (ii) root senescence plus maintenance respiration adapted from Teixeira et al. (2009). This set up was able to reproduce the complex seasonal patterns of shoot and root DM observed in a lucerne crop (Fig. 6) without requiring any changes to the source code of Root organ class.This example shows that the PMF framework enabled flexibility to successfully implement a previously developed lucerne model (Teixeira et al., 2009) for crops growing under unconstrained water, nutrients and harvest management conditions. This basic set up enables flexible expansion of the model capability. Specifically, to account for sub-optimal growth conditions, lucerne reserve organs (e.g. crowns and taproots) have to be implemented to store nitrogen, a root nodule organ is required to fix atmospheric nitrogen and water stress responses have to be parameterised. This will enable the model to deal with the effects of severe grazing on root biomass and shoot regrowth. In addition, the uncoupling of root respiration and senescence, the effects of low population on canopy growth, and inclusion of varieties with contrasting dormancies, as described in the existing version of APSIM, can be easily transferred to this pilot lucerne model.Wheat was initially a series of translations of the CERES wheat model (Ritchie and Otter, 1985) into the Fortran77-based APSIM framework (Asseng et al., 1998; Keating et al., 2001; Meinke et al., 1997). Upon the development of the GCROP template (Wang et al., 2003), the science of these was translated into this generic crop template which also represented a move to Fortran90. This was then merged into a code base which also allowed for simulation of legumes and perennial plants (Robertson et al., 2002) to make an even more generic modelling framework and represented another language move into C and then C++. This model evolution has been driven by the advantages of moving to more generic designs, including object oriented and pattern-based development at each step. Science developments have been implemented into the model over this time also with most functionality being maintained from one version to the next. Ongoing testing (Holzworth et al., 2014, 2011) has ensured that model performance and integrity has been maintained during each evolutionary step. The documentation of APSIM wheat is available online (www.apsim.info).The decision was made to further evolve the wheat model into the PMF to make use of its better design. However, the wheat model was already extensively validated and has a large user base, and so it was important to ensure that model performance was maintained. Whilst it is desirable to implement the wheat model using the PMF classes described above, doing this and re-testing the model would require a considerable effort. Processes are being developed to help accelerate these processes. However, until these become available, it was decided to conduct a software port of the existing wheat model into PMF by using PMF components wherever possible and porting other required processes into C#. It was possible to use the PMF phenology classes to represent development and capture much of the remaining functionality in function classes. The result is a set of new mid-level classes (Fig. 2) that replicate the existing wheat model.The PMF Wheat model produces outputs that are identical to those of the existing wheat model in the standard APSIM wheat model validation set containing 164 simulations for a wide range of environments and treatments (Supplementary material). The predicted yields for above ground biomass (Fig. 7a), grain yield (Fig. 7b), and nitrogen content in above ground biomass (Fig. 7c) and grain (Fig. 7d) all showed good agreement with observed values. These results show that this intermediate step in the model's evolution can still be used with confidence by the APSIM user community whilst we continue to move toward using more of the standard PMF classes.
