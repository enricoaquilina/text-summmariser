@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A microgripper component which is made of piezo-cantilever is presented in this paper. The modified mixed variational principle including piezoelectric materials is established and then the state-vector equations of laminated piezoelectric beams are derived directly from the principle. Finally the exact expressions of mechanical and electrical variables along the thickness direction based on the state-vector equation are simply given. Based on the semi-analytical solution of the state-vector equation, a state space finite element model is established. The static analysis is carried out for a laminated beam fully covered with piezoelectric actuating layers on the top and bottom surfaces of the substrate. Both the substrate and piezoelectricity of the laminated beam are considered as one-dimensional line solids and the same linear element is used to discretize the whole beam. This semi-analytical technique can guarantee the continuity of generalized displacements and generalized stresses inter-layers and the transfer matrix method can be applied. Furthermore the exact solution in one direction ensures there is no restriction on the thickness for the smart structures. At the end of this paper the influence of secondary converse piezoelectric effect (SCPE) on the deflection of the laminated beam covered with piezoelectric driving layers for static precision displacement control is investigated. The above mentioned state space finite element method is used to predict the deflection of the beam with and without SCPE. If the influence of SCPE is eliminated, the deflections of the clamped beam will increase by ~2.7%. In addition, the driving characteristic with different PZT/steel thickness ratio considering SCPE are also studied. The maximum influence of SCPE on deflection can reach ~3% for the beam fully covered with piezoelectric active layers, which should not be neglected in practical microoperation applications.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Due to their successful and wide application in microoperation systems [1], dynamic and static control of structure shape [2], vibration noise [3] and health monitoring of structures [4], the laminated piezoelectric smart structures or the conventional structures with piezoelectric actuator and sensor patches have received a particular attention recently. Many studies on the electromechanical behaviors of piezoelectric structures have been carried out [5–8]. As a typical actuating element, the piezoelectric actuator is popularly used as one of the key components of the piezo-microgripper comprising of two parallel piezoelectric cantilevers [9] or the nano-positioning walking mechanism including piezoelectric beams with hinged ends [10]. When the electric voltage is applied on the piezoelectric layer, the resultant bending motion in the structure becomes the working principle in micro-mechanical applications.An important characteristic of bending laminated piezoelectric structures is that the deflection of the bender is dependent on the driving voltage. One of the widely used methods for the laminated piezoelectric structures is the analytical solution. The exact solutions can predict precisely the static and dynamical behavior of the laminates, which are of great value. For the exact method the quantities near or across the interfaces of different material layers can be achieved, which would be employed as benchmark to determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various numerical methods for other more complex structures [11–13]. Among the exact solution strategies, the method based on the Eshelby–Stroh formulation or stator-vector equation [14–18] is widely used to investigate the responses of the general laminate structures or smart structures with piezoelectric under the external static or dynamical mechanical or electrical loads. The Eshelby–Stroh formulation method, also called mixed state variable means, regards the general displacements and stresses as the variable vector components at the same time. The transfer matrix in the solution of the state vector equation makes the final algebra equations independent of the laminate thickness and the layer number. Then based on the independent spatial variable such as the thickness parameter of the beams, plates and so on, the mixed state variable technology can be used to investigate the behavior of the laminate structures comprising different materials and complicated geometries [19,20]. Furthermore this provides a continuous stresses field across the thickness for the multi-layer structures which is impossible for many other numerical methods [14,21].The complexity of the material, geometry and boundary conditions makes the governing equations in piezoelectric laminates too complicated to be solved analytically. Thus the numerical technologies, such as finite element method, boundary element method etc., are inevitably required to analyze the electromechanical coupling behaviors in piezoelectric structures. Most of the finite element methods for piezoelectric structures are developed from the traditional ones. It always makes the computational model artificially large and stiff when the piezoelectric smart devices and large structure regions are modeled using the three-dimensional brick elements. For the threadlike or thin piezoelectric structures, one- or two-dimensional elements [22] can be used with high efficiency and accuracy. Most of the elements analyzing the piezoelectric devices are free of electric degree of freedoms which are deduced based on the specific sensing/actuating equations [23]. So the operations for the inverse matrix are usually carried out and the numerical stability problems exist. In one word, many obstacles challenge the efficiency and accuracy in numerically exploring the responses of the piezoelectric structures to the environments.The semi-analytical method can touch the balance between the accuracy, efficiency and the computational scale. The state space finite element method [24,25] conflates the conventional finite element technology and the state-vector equation means. The Hamilton element [24] adapts the finite element approximation in one dimension direction and introduces the analytical expression in the other direction. The state space finite element [26] assumes previously the analytical expressions satisfying the boundary conditions and solves the field functions in the finite element space. Hence the semi-analytical method reserves most of the advantages inhered in the exact solution based on the state-vector equations. Using the Hamiltonian element, the number of variables of the final algebra equation system is much less than the traditional finite element method. At the same time, the number of variables is independent of the thickness. So theoretically the semi-analytical technology can analyze the laminated structures with any number of layers. Additionally, the semi-analytical solution can ensure the continuousness of the transverse stresses between all the laminated interfaces [12]. It is worthwhile to find a semi-analytical method combining the analytic and finite element ascendency for discerning the couple phenomena in complicated piezoelectric multilayer structures.Before the smart device fabrication, the piezoelectric actuator is always polarized in advance. And the SCPE [27] would exist in the actuator while applying mechanical or electrical loads, which could affect the actuator performance. Though the SCPE phenomena was researched theoretically and experimentally a long time ago [28], the influence of the SCPE is rarely considered in practical structures. Kapuria and Hagedorn [29] investigated the static and dynamic response of smart beams with segmented extension/shear mode bonded with piezoelectric actuators. And the induced voltage distribution along the beam thickness direction was calculated. The SCPE phenomenon produced by the induced voltages was neglected by the authors. In the study of piezoelectric sandwich beam, a quadratic variation of Ezacross the thickness have been reported, of which the researchers explained as the attribution of the induced potential due to the direct piezoelectric effect [30]. But they did not do any detailed investigation about this situation either. This study focuses on the influence of the SCPE on the beam deformation, based on which, the elimination can be applied to improve the deflection.This paper presents a state space finite element method that combines the advantages of the traditional finite element approximation techniques. The analytical solution means of the recursive formulation of state equation is applied to solve the mechanical problems of piezoelectric laminated beams. The method is based on a modified mixed variational principle that takes into account the variables of both general displacements and general stresses. To solve the variational equations, a laminated beam is discretized resembling the conventional finite elements method in the longitudinal direction of the beam, while the through-thickness distributions of generalized displacements and stresses are solved directly from the state equation analytically. Finally the semi-analytical method is used to predict the deflection of the beam with and without SCPE. The results show that the influence of the SCPE on the deflection of the beam is large and should not be neglected in practical applications.A microgripper constructed by two piezoelectric cantilevers for micromanipulation is illustrated inFig. 1(a). One piezoelectric cantilever is shown in Fig. 1(b). In this section, the formulation of the multilayer beam system containing piezoelectric is given. Fig. 1(b) shows the piezoelectric laminated beam referred to a system of Cartesian coordinates with the x-axis being along the beam axis. It is assumed that the piezoelectric layer and the substrate layer are perfectly glued and the thickness of the adhesive can be neglected thus pretermitting the shear-lag effect [31]. Assuming the materials of the piezoelectric and the matrix layer are orthotropic, the linear constitutive equations can be written as the following matrix form:(1){σxσzτxzDxDz}=[C11C1300e31C13C3300e3300C55e15000e15−є110e31e3300−є33]{εxεzεxz−Ex−Ez}whereσx,σz,τxzεx,εz,εxzare the components of the stress and strain respectively.

Dx, Dzare the electric displacements.є11,є33are the relative dielectric coefficients ande31,e33,e15are the piezoelectric stress constants.The relationships of the displacement and strain can be(2)εx=∂u∂x,εz=∂w∂z,εxz=∂w∂x+∂u∂zwhere u and w are the components of the displacements in the x and z directions respectively.The electric field components can be related to the electric potentialϕ(3)Ex=−∂ϕ∂x,Ez=−∂ϕ∂zThrough the matrix transformation, Eq. (1) can be stated as following:(4){PP1}=[Γ11Γ12Γ21Γ22]{Θ1Θ}whereP=[τxzσzDz]T,P1=[σxDx]T,Θ1=[εxzεz−Ez]T,Θ=[εx−Ex]T.Taking P1 andΘ1as unknown quantities in Eq. (4), one can get(5){Θ1P1}=[Φ11Φ12Φ21Φ22]{PΘ}The matricesΓijandΦij(i, j=1, 2) are given in Appendix A.Based on the modified mixed variational principle [32,33], the modified Hellinger–Reissner variational principle for piezoelectric laminated beam can be(6)δΠ=δ∬ΩLRdΩ−δ∫SuTT(Q−Q¯)dS−δ∫SσQTT¯dS=0whereΩis the area of the beam,Suis the generalized displacement boundary andSσis the generalized force boundary. The superscript “T” denotes transposition. The mechanical displacement and electric potential vector can beQ=[uwϕ]T,Q¯=[u¯w¯ϕ¯]Tthe stress and electric displacement vector areT=[TxTzTq]T,T¯=[T¯xT¯zT¯q]Tthe Reissner׳s energy density function LRcan be expressed as [26](7)LR=PTQ̇+PT(G1Q+Φ21TG2Q)+12(G2Q)TΦ22G2Q−12PTΦ11P−QTFwhereF=[fxfzfq]Tindicates the generalized external load vector:Q̇=dQ/dz.The operator matricesGi(i=1, 2) are given in Appendix A.Assuming the lateral general stress and displacement boundaries are satisfied, the following expressions can be obtained by the variational manipulationδΠ=0:(8a)dQdz=−(G1+Φ21TG2)Q+Φ11P(8b)dPdz=−(G1T+G2TΦ21)P−G2TΦ22G2Q−FThe top surface and bottom surface boundary conditions of the mechanical stresses and electric displacements can be(9)T¯=[nzτ¯xznzσ¯znzD¯z]TThe lateral side boundary condition of the mechanical stresses and electric displacements can be(10a)T¯x=nx(k8∂u∂x−k6σz−k7Dz)+nzτxz(10b)T¯z=nxτxz+nzσz(10c)T¯q=nx(k9∂ϕ∂x−k5τxz)+nzDzwhere ni(i=x, z) are the outward unit normal components of the beam boundary and ki(i=1, 2, …, 9) are given in Appendix A.To use the advantages of state-vector techniques in solving differential equations, one can rewrite Eq. (8a,b) as following:(11)ddz{PQ}=[−AT−BC−A]{PQ}−{F0}whereA=[0∂∂x−k5∂∂x−k6∂∂x00−k7∂∂x00]B=[k8∂2∂x20000000k9∂2∂x2]C=[k1000k2k30k3k4]Eq. (11) is the state-vector equation of the piezoelectric beam. The state equation can also be derived base on the field equations as Lee and Jiang [14] and Tang [34] did for the piezoelectricity and elasticity. But it would a burdensome task in some areas such as the piezoelectric shells, the multiple-field coupling situations. The Hellinger–Reissner mixed variational principle provides a relatively laconic way to obtain the state-space model for those complex cases [26].In this section, the Hamilton element method by Zou and Tang [24] is applied. Suppose there are n elements in the x direction, which has two nodes and six-degree of freedoms for each node, we can get n+1 nodes (Fig. 2). The node parameters areδ(i)=[u(i)w(i)ϕ(i)τxz(i)σz(i)Dz(i)]Twhereδ(i)is the node degree of freedom vector which is the function only about z. When the linear shape function is adopted, the field function of the element with element length lecan be (Fig. 2 shows the local coordinate system of the linear element)(12)ue=N1u(e1)+N2u(e2),we=N1w(e1)+N2w(e2),ϕe=N1ϕ(e1)+N2ϕ(e2)τxze=N1τxz(e1)+N2τxz(e2),σze=N1σz(e1)+N2σz(e2),Dze=N1Dz(e1)+N2Dz(e2)in which(13)N1=12(1−ξ),N2=12(1+ξ)(−1≤ξ≤1)Supposing the displacement boundary conditions are satisfied previously, substituting Eqs. (12) and (13) into Eq. (6) will yield the following elemental state-vector equations:(14)[R11R12R21R22]∂∂z[δ(1)δ(2)]=[Λ11Λ12Λ21Λ22][δ(1)δ(2)]+[F10]whereRij,Λij(i, j=1, 2) andF1are given in Appendix A.As the standard finite element assemblage process is used the global state-vector equation for the mth layer can be:(15)Rm∂δm(z)∂z=Kmδm(z)+fm(z)whereRm=∑e[R]me,Km=∑eΛme,fm(z)=∑efme(z).The analytical solution of Eq. (15) can be(16)δm(z)=Tm(z)δm(0)+Lm(z)whereTm(z)=exp{[Rm]−1Kmz}Lm(z)=∫0z(exp{[Rm]−1Km(z−ι)}[Rm]−1fm(ι))dιIt may be to note that many ways, such as approximation theory, differential equation, matrix eigenvalues, matrix characteristic polynomial etc., can be applied to compute the exponential matrixTm(z). Some methods are preferable to others considering the computational stability, efficiency and accuracy. In this paper the precise integration method presented by Zhong [35] and Zhong and Zhu [36] is employed to solve Eq. (15).Eq. (16) is available to any layer in the laminated beam. Particularly for z=hj, the following expression is accessible:(17)δm(hj)=Tm(hj)δm(0)+Lm(hj)At the interface of mth layer and (m+1)th layer, the compatibility condition should be satisfied(18)δm(hj)=δm+1(0)(m=1,2,3,…,m−1)Using the matrix transform method to Eqs. (17) and (18), the following recurrence formulations can be obtained:(19)δm(hm)=(∏i=1mTi)δ1(0)+(∏i=2mTi)L1(h1)+(∏i=3mTi)L2(h2)+⋯+Lm(hm)where∏i=1mTi=TmTm−1Tm−2⋯T1For Eq. (19), the matrix form expression can be written(20){Pm(hm)Qm(hm)}=[T11⁎T12⁎T21⁎T22⁎]{P1(0)Q1(0)}+{HpHq}whereP1(0),Q1(0),Pm(hm),Qm(hm)denote the generalized stress vector and generalized displacement vector at the top and bottom surfaces of the laminated beam respectively,HpandHqdenote the equivalent loads which is related to the external loads and boundary conditions.The general displacements and stresses on the interfaces between matrix beam and piezoelectric layer, whenever piezoelectricity fully or partially covered the matrix, must be continuous. After the similar processes, deducing Eqs. (17)–(19), were executed, the matrix expression of the laminated beam with piezoelectric layer can be(21){P(z)Q(z)}=[T11pieT12pieT21pieT22pie]{P1(0)Q1(0)}+{HpHq}where the superscript “pie” denotes the piezoelectric layers/patches.As the static problems are concerned, substituting the known boundary conditions at the top and bottom beam surfaces yields the following equation:(22)Q(z)=T21pieP1(0)+T22pieQ1(0)+HqFor the PZT actuator, the PZT layer is recommended to be polarized before device fabrication, which can reduce the polarization stress [8]. And the SCPE exists in the actuator, which would affect the actuator performance [27]. The SCPE can be described as follows: When the PZT actuators, of which the piezoelectricity portions are in mechanical free boundary condition, are driven by applied voltages/electric fields; the strains, ε, in the PZT induces an additional electric displacementD(2)due to the piezoelectric effect.(23)ε=dE(24)D(2)=eε=edεThe additional electric displacementD(2)generates an additional strainε(3)to the original deflection produced by the drive voltage.(25)ε(3)=−gD(2)=−gedEThe total process isε→D(2)→ε(3). Though the SCPE has been brought forward theoretically and experimentally for a long time, the influence of the SCPE phenomena are rarely considered in practical devices [6,37,38]. In Eqs. (23)–(25), d and g are piezoelectric strain constants and piezoelectric voltage constants respectively and can be calculated by the following equations [28]:(26a)d=eS(26b)g=єdwhere S is the piezoelectric flexibility matrix,єis the piezoelectric dielectric matrix.To demonstrate the benefit from the new technology in this paper, a cantilever piezoelectric bimorph beam, composed of PVDF, is considered. Both layers have the thickness h=0.5mm. The aspect ratio of l/h=100 is investigated. A constant potentialϕ=100Vwas applied on the top surface of the piezoelectric bimorph and the bottom surface was grounded. At the same time the top surface and bottom surface of the bimorph were traction free and electrical boundary condition Dz=0 (open-circuit case) was applied. The PVDF material properties are listed in the followingTable 1.Table 2 shows the maximum displacement in the bimorph when the total elements of both the line element and the plane stress element PLANE13 in ANSYS®, which has four-nodes with three-degree-of-freedoms per node, is equal. Although the degree-of-freedoms using present linear element are a little more than that using the plane stress 2-D element PLANE13, the solution of present method is of higher accuracy. When the total elements of present method and ANSYS® method are the same (8), the maximum displacement using present semi-analytical method is 3.2963e−5m and the absolute error is less than 0.2% compared with the analytical solution [39].Fig. 3 shows the convergence rate of the line element and the ANSYS plane stress 2-D element PLANE13. When the total elements of present method and ANSYS method are equal (8), the tip displacement computing using present technology iswmax=3.2963e−5m and the absolute error is 0.11%; but the solution of ANSYS iswmax=3.1256e−5m and the absolute error is 5.28%. When the total elements of ANSYS method is 40,wmax=3.2573e−5m, the absolute error is 1.29%. Therefore it is obvious that the convergence rate of present semi-analysis solution is much faster than that of ANSYS.The through-the-thickness distributions of axial normal stress at mid position in the length direction are shown inFig. 4 and compared with the 2D finite element solution ANSYS for the voltage load of 100V. Although the displacements distribution of the bimorph, applied with voltage load, is similar to the pure bending of the isotropic material beam, the normal stress distribution is of much discrepancy. There are two zero axial normal stress points which are located at some position in sublayer of the bimorph as shown by Kapuria and Hagedorn [29]. The results are in excellent agreement with the 2D finite element results.Fig. 5 shows the distributions of shear stress along the thickness direction at x=0.5l for the 1N point force load applied at the free tip of the beam. Similar to the transversal load bending of the isotropic material beam, the bimorph shear stress is of parabola distribution. The results calculated by the present method are much smoother than the results by the finite element method.The driving displacements of a steel clamped beam with piezoelectric active layers including SCPE, as shown in Fig. 2, are investigated. And the above mentioned method is used. The assumption that the actuating layers are perfectly bonded to the top and bottom surfaces of the matrix steel is implemented. The actuators are made of PZT-4. The physical properties of the two kinds of materials are list in Table 1. The three layers have the same thickness h=0.5mm. The aspect ratio of l/h=100 is studied. Suppose the top surface and bottom surface of the two piezoelectric actuating layers were traction free and Dz=0.Fig. 6 shows the lateral displacements of the above mentioned cantilever beam under 100V driving voltage with and without SCPE. Obviously, the deflections of the beam are different with and without SCPE consideration. Because of the linear piezoelectric effect taken into count, the displacements of the beam with and without SCPE are almost linear increasing along the axial length. With the amplifying effect of the beam, the tip displacement difference is about 1.19e−6m, or 2.77% relative to the displacement induced in the beam without SCPE. There will be more than 32nm drift in real driving if SCPE is not taken into account. In some new positioning drives with only 4nm in each step [40], the SCPE could not be negligible.The free end deflections of the piezoelectric laminated beam with and without SCPE are shown inFig. 7. Because only linear piezoelectric effect is taken into count, the tip displacements of the beam are increasing proportionally to the driving voltages whenever the SCPE is considered or not. The displacement difference with and without SCPE is also increasing proportionally as the driving voltage increasing. The ratio of the tip displacement with and without SCPE is about 97.2%. And it proves that the SCPE should not be neglected when using the piezoelectric element to control the structure displacements, shape, position etc. The same conclusion was point out by Ma et al. [27] who employed the disc and ring type PZT actuators to investigate the SCPE phenomena in the piezoelectricity which is partially covered with mental electrodes.Over the past two decades, several advances have been made in the field of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). A clear need for the integration of materials other than silicon and its compounds into micromachined structures has emerged. As the dimensions of the smart devices are becoming smaller, the stress level in these devices plays a key role for the reliability and servicing life.Fig. 8 shows the shear stress distribution of the laminated beam in the thickness direction under 100V voltage load. Compared with the displacements, the values of the stresses in the composite beam are much larger. And the effects of the SCPE on the stress of the laminated structure are of negligible compared to the strength of the materials.The PZT thickness in different applications usually varies with the limitation such as the volume, shape, weight and so on. So we investigate the effect of PZT/steel thickness ratio, hPZT/hsteel, from 0.12 to 1 on the influence of SCPE with the 100V driving voltage. The results using the present semi-analytical method are shown inFig. 9. The tip deflections of the beam are decreasing when the PZT/steel thickness ratio is increasing. The reason is that the stiffness constant of the piezoelectric PZT-4 is larger than the stiffness constant of the matrix steel. The whole structure stiffness is reduced when the piezoelectric layer is thinner. When the thickness ratio is small, for instance 0.12, the ratio of the deflection with and without SCPE is about 97%. And the deflection ratio is decreasing while increasing the thickness ratio until reaching to 0.48, about 97.16%. That is to say that the displacement drift is about 2.61μm with and without SCPE. Neglecting the drift displacement will lead to a wrong consequences in some real applications with the resolution of 4nm [41]. When the thickness ratio is above 0.48, the deflection ratio is increasing with the raise of the hPZT/hsteel. It may be that the extension in the laminated beam could not be neglected and lead the decrease of the SCPE when the PZT/steel thickness ratio is beyond 0.5.For piezoelectric actuators, the piezoelectric constant [42] plays an important role in the displacement control of the smart structures.Fig. 10 shows the influence of the SCPE on deflections as a function of the PZT piezoelectric constant with the 100V driving voltage. Obviously the tip deflection of the beam decreases linearly when the piezoelectric stress constant, whenever e31 or e33, diminishes. The constant e31 drives the longitudinal displacements with the action of transverse electric fields and has larger actuating effects to the laminated beam. Thus compared with the piezoelectric constant e31, the SCPE exhibits more tempestuously with the changing of e33. Even the ratio of the piezoelectric constant e31 is at 0.3, the drift of the tip displacements is larger than 0.42μm with and without SCPE at 100V driving voltage. In some application, the resolution of the micro-translation apparatus is only several nanometers [41] and the displacements duced by SCPE cannot be ignored.The same laminated piezoelectric beam, as described in section 4.2, under simply supported boundary conditions on both ends (S-S boundary condition) is investigated.Fig. 11 shows the lateral displacements of the beam with S-S boundary condition under 100V driving voltage with and without SCPE. Evidently, the SCPE has a slightly larger impact on the deflections of the beam. On the middle of the beam, which is the position of the max deflection, the displacement difference is about 2.78% relative to the displacement induced in the beam without SCPE.The max deflections of the piezoelectric laminated beam with and without SCPE are shown inFig. 12. The max deflections of the beam are also increasing proportionally to the driving voltages based on the linear piezoelectric effect. The max displacement difference considering SCPE or not is about 0.3μm which is much larger than the step size of the precise positioning apparatus [41].The effect of PZT/steel thickness ratio, hPZT/hsteel, on the max deflection of the S-S boundary condition beam is also investigated under the 100V driving voltage. The results are shown inFig. 13. The max deflections of the beam are decreasing when the PZT/steel thickness ratio is increasing. The reason is that the whole structure stiffness is reduced when the piezoelectric layer is thinner. When the thickness ratio is small, for instance 0.12, the ratio of the max deflection with and without SCPE is about 98%. And the deflection ratio is decreasing while increasing the thickness ratio until reaching to 0.48, about 97.21%. Thus the real tip displacement drift is about 2.6μm with and without SCPE. The piezoelectric driving components, patented by Burleigh Instruments as an inchworm-type linear piezomotor motor [40], provides nanometer level resolution. Thus the displacements induced by SCPE should be taken into account in precise positioning system.Fig. 14 shows the influence of SCPE on max deflections with different PZT piezoelectric constants when the driving voltage is also 100V. Obviously the max deflection of the beam decreases linearly when the piezoelectric stress constant, whenever e31 or e33, diminishes. The constant e31 drives the longitudinal displacements with the action of transverse electric fields and has larger actuating effects to the laminated beam. When the ratio of piezoelectric constant is small, about 0.3, the max deflection difference is about 0.47μm, for e31 and 0.64μm, for e33 under 100V voltage load. For the positioning system driven by piezoelectric actuator or piezomotor with nm-level precision in the nano-fabrication, manufacturing, measurement field, the resolution is about 4nm [40] and the SCPE phenomenon should not be canceled.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A semi-analytical Hamilton element method has been presented to solve the mechanical problems of laminated beams fully covered with piezoelectric actuating layers. The method was based on a mixed variational representation including the electro-mechanical coupling equations. The generalized displacements and stresses in one direction were discretized by finite element technique while their cross thickness distributions were obtained by solving the state equations. The compatibility of generalized displacements and stresses across material interfaces are maintained by uniting the algebraic equation including both of them.Numerical tests and comparisons have been carried out to validate the presented method. By comparing with existing piezoelectric bimorph analytical solutions, it was observed that the new method shown an excellent agreement. Since the transfer matrix technique was used to derive the state equations of laminated piezoelectric beam, the dimension of the final state equation had no restriction on the thickness or number of matrix layers or piezoelectric layer.The influence of SCPE on the deflection of the beam fully covered with piezoelectric materials was also investigated. The semi-analytical mathematical model was established to predict the deflections of the laminated beam with and without SCPE. The results show that the deflections of the beam increase by about 3% while the influence of the SCPE being eliminated. The influence of SCPE on deflection increases as the thickness ratio hpzt/hsteel(hpzt/hsteelis below 0.5) increases. In summary, the influence of the SCPE for intelligent structures fully covered with piezoelectric materials should not be neglected, and better to be eliminated to improve the actuator performance in practical actuating applications such as shape control, vibration suppression and so on.
