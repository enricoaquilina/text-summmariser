@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents a new bi-side gate driver integrated by indium-zinc-oxide thin film transistors (IZO TFTs). Our optimized operate method can achieve high speed performance by employing a lower duty ratio (25%) CK2 with its pulse located in the middle of the pulse of CK2L to fully use the bootstrapped high voltage of node Q. In addition, the size of devices is optimized by calculation and simulation, and the function of the proposed gate driver is predicted by the circuit simulation. Furthermore, the proposed gate driver with 20 stages is fabricated by the IZO TFTs process. It is shown that a 2.6μs width pulse with good noise-suppressed characteristic can be successfully output at the condition of Rload=6kΩ and Cload=150pF. The power consumption of the proposed gate driver with 20 stages is measured as 1mW. Hence, the proposed gate driver may be applied to the display of 4K resolution (4096×2160) at a frame rate of 120Hz. Moreover, there is a good stability for the proposed gate driver under 48h operation.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
There are several advantages for integrating gate driver by thin film transistors (TFTs) on the glass substrate in the flat panel displays (FPD), such as simpler process, lower cost, thinner thickness, and narrower bezel [1–4]. Generally, the types of thin-film transistors (TFTs) applied in FPD are hydrogenated amorphous silicon TFTs (a-Si:H TFTs) and low-temperature polycrystalline-silicon TFTs (LTPS TFTs). Although a-Si:H TFTs have advantages of simple process, low cost and good uniformity, it is extremely difficult to integrate a circuit operating at high speed due to low field effect mobility. On the other hand, LTPS TFTs may be not suitable for large glass since a crystallization step such as laser annealing is required to obtain high field effect mobility. Recently, metal oxide thin film transistors (MO TFTs) such as zinc-oxide (ZnO) TFTs [5,6], indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO) TFTs [7,8], and indium-zinc-oxide (IZO) TFTs [9,10] have gained much interest as a promising technology for the next generation of FPD due to the high mobility, low sub-threshold voltage swing, high current on/off ratio, and good process compatibility with a-Si TFTs. However, there are some difficulties for MO TFTs to integrate the gate driver because they operate in a depletion mode with threshold voltage around zero compared with a-Si:H TFTs or LTPS TFTs [5–10].Some circuit technologies are developed to solve the problems of gate driver induced by the depletion mode of MO TFTs, such as two negative power sources [11,12], series connected two-transistors (STT) structure with a feedback TFT [13–15], or floating gate method [16]. In addition, the high speed gate driver is urgently required for the display with high resolution such as 4096×2160 or high frame rate such as 240Hz. Normally, three important factors needs to be taken into account for achieving high speed performance, which are the schematic of gate driver, the optimized timing and the optimization for the sizes of devices. Whereas, few works specially focused on these factors for designing a high speed gate driver.In this paper, we propose a new bi-side gate driver integrated by IZO TFTs. By employing the optimized timing and the optimized sizes of devices, the proposed gate driver can operate at a quite high speed with good noise-suppressed characteristic.The fabrication of the IZO TFTs integrated for the proposed gate driver is described as follows [17]. A molybdenum (Mo) gate electrode was formed on a glass substrate with a thickness of 200nm. Then, a 200-nm-thick SiO2 film was deposited as gate insulator by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) at 310°C. A 30nm indium zinc oxide (IZO, In2O3:ZnO=1:2) active layer was deposited on the insulator SiO2 by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering with a power of 150W and Ar/O2 ratio of 50/4. The IZO film was pre-annealed in O2 atmosphere for 30min at 350°C. Then, an etch stop layer (ESL) used for protecting the active layer was fabricated and patterned by dry-etch. For the source/drain (S/D) electrodes, molybdenum/aluminum/molybdenum (Mo/Al/Mo) stacked layers were deposited by DC sputtering and patterned by wet-etch. Finally, the device was post-annealed in O2 atmosphere for 30min at 350°C. The post-annealing step is useful for repairing the ionic-bond damage and reducing the hydrogen content in the IZO film, which are induced during the ESL deposition [17–19].Fig. 1(a) shows the transfer characteristics of the IZO TFTs with different W/L (W/L=20μm/10μm, 160μm/10μm, and 800μm/10μm) at Vds=10V, which are measured by a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Agilent B1500A). The extracted values of (Vth, μ, S) for the TFTs with W/L=20μm/10μm, 160μm/10μm, and 800μm/10μm are (2.6V, 14.99cm2V−1S−1, 313mV/decade), (1.7V, 13.46cm2V−1S−1, 320mV/decade), and (0.8V, 13.86cm2V−1S−1, 320mV/decade), respectively. Hereinto, Vth, μ, and S are threshold voltage, filed-effect mobility, and sub-threshold swing, respectively. The on-off current ratio for the IZO TFTs with different W/L can all be up to 109. As seen from Fig. 1(a), it is seemed that the on-off current ratio increases with the increase of the width of TFTs. That is because the measured off current may be limited by the instrument test precision and the environmental noise. We think that the actual on–off current ratio should be independent of the width of TFTs. The SMART-SPICE software is used to perform the circuit simulation to verify the proposed gate driver, in which RPI TFT model (level=36) is used to fit the characteristic of IZO TFTs. As shown in Fig. 2, the characteristics of IZO TFTs are fitted well. Fig. 1(b) shows the transfer characteristics of the IZO TFTs (W/L=20μm/10μm) under negative bias temperature stress (NBTS) and positive bias temperature stress (PBTS) for 12h. The conditions of PBTS are Vg=15V, Vds=10V, and that of NBTS are Vg=−15V, Vds=10V. It is shown that there is a good stability for the IZO TFTs.Fig. 2(a) shows the schematic of the proposed gate driver which is composed of gate output module (module 1), carry output module (module 2), input module (module 3), and inverter module (module 4). The gate output module constituted by T10 and T11 is used to drive the scan line of pixel array, which can be equivalently described as an R–C load. T8 and T9 with a bootstrapped capacitor (C1) form the carry output module, which is used to transmit a pulse signal as the input signal of the next stage of the gate driver. The input module consisting of T3, T4, T5, T6, and T7 is applied to receive the carry output signal of the previous stage. T3 is series-connected to T4 to form a series-connected two-transistors (STT) structure, as well as T5 and T6. And T7 is a feedback TFT to suppress the inner leakage current [13]. T1 and T2 form a clock-controlled inverter module of which the output controls T9 and T11 [15].Fig. 2(b) shows the timing chart for each stage of the proposed gate driver. The high level of all signals is equal to VD. VL is set a little lower than VS for turning off T10 and T11 completely. The clock frequency of CK1L, CK2L and CK2 is same. Note that, there is a blank interval between CK1L and CK2L since the duty ratio of them is both 37.5%. And the pulse of CK2 with duty ratio as 25% is located in the middle of the pulse of CK2L. The operation of the proposed gate driver is divided into three periods as following.(1)Input period: CK1L goes to high so that node Q is charged to high voltage (VD) through T3 and T4 by the previous carry output. However, at this moment, QB is still hold at high voltage because of the high level of CK1L. Then CK1L goes to low to switch off T3 and T4 for maintaining the charge in C1 and the gates of T8 and T10. At the same time, QB is discharged to VL to turn off T9 and T11by the low level of CK1L.Drive period: CK2L goes to high level and the voltage of Q (VQ) is bootstrapped up a little by the parasitic capacitor (Cgd_T8) between the gate and drain of T8. Then COUT is charged to VD through T8 and VQ is further bootstrapped up by C1 and the parasitic capacitor (Cgs_T8) between the gate and the source of T8. Meanwhile, the high level of CK2L is fed back to the common nodes of the two STTs by T7 to prevent VQ from decreasing. After that, CK2 is turned high and VQ is bootstrapped once again by the parasitic capacitor (Cgd_T10) between the gate and the drain in T10. As a result, GOUT is charged to high level through T10. After the display data are input into the pixel circuits, CK2 goes to low and then GOUT is discharged to VS through T10 with node Q still in the bootstrapped condition. Finally, CK2L is turned low and COUT is discharged to VL through T8.Hold period: CK1L goes to high to turn on T3 and T4 so that Q is discharged to low voltage again. Meanwhile, QB is charged to high voltage since T1 is also turned on by CK1L. From this moment until the previous carry output is input again, the node Q is always connected to low voltage by the two STTs, while QB is kept at high voltage by T1 which is turned on periodically. Therefore, COUT and OUT can be stably maintained as VL and VS, respectively.In summary, the causes for the proposed gate driver to achieve high speed are explained as follows. Firstly, QB is discharged to low to turn off T9 and T11 before COUT and GOUT begin to be charged due to the non-overlapping clock signals CK1L and CK2L in the drive period. Hence, COUT and GOUT are charged rapidly without leakage through T9 and T11, respectively. Secondly, GOUT is charged or discharged fast by T10 due to the bootstrapped state of node Q since CK2 has a lower duty ratio (25%) than CK2L and its pulse located in the middle of the pulse of CK2L. Thirdly, the transition time from charging of GOUT to discharging of that is reduced since the same TFT (T10) is used during charging or discharging of GOUT. By the way, the area of the gate driver can be decreased by reducing the number of large size TFTs. Fourthly, for outputting the same width of GOUT signal, there is longer reaction time for the interior of the proposed gate driver since the pulse width of clocks (CK1L, CK2L) used to drive module 2–4 is wider than that in the other works [11–16].Fig. 3shows the block demonstration of the gate driver for bi-side driving and its timing diagram. The proposed gate driver may be integrated on two sides of the panel to fully utilize symmetry of the panel for the high resolution displays with demand of narrow bezels.In module 1, T10 should be designed large enough to drive the RC load. Note that, T10 always works in the linear region during the period in which GOUT outputs high level. So the equivalent output resistance of T10 can be expressed as(1)RT10=1[β(Vgs_T10-Vth_T10-12Vds_T10)]=1βVg_T10-12Vd_T10-12Vs_T10-Vth_T10withβ=μnCOXWT10/LT10where μn, Cox, WT10, LT10, Vg_T10, Vd_T10, Vs_T10, and Vth_T10 are the field-effect mobility, the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, the channel width, the channel length, the gate voltage of T10, the drain voltage of T10, the source voltage of T10 and the threshold voltage of T10, respectively. As seen from (1), RT10 increases along with the increase of Vs. The charge delay time of GOUT is approximately calculated as(2)t1=3(Rload+R‾T10)CloadwhereR‾T10, Rload, and Cload are the average value of RT10, the equivalent resistance of load, and the equivalent capacitance of load, respectively. Fig. 4shows the simulated results of needed ratio of W to L for T10 versus Rload×Cload with different Vgs for the same charge delay time of 2μs. It is shown that the larger RC load, the larger size of T10 is required for the timely charging. And the size of T10 can be considerably decreased by using a higher gate voltage of T10. In other words, the charge speed would be faster if the gate voltage of T10 is higher.In module 2, the status of T8 is controlled by the voltage at node Q which is charged or discharged by module 3. So, module 2 and module 3 should be taken into account together. The bootstrap capacitor C1 is designed to generate a higher gate voltage to drive T8 and T10. Besides, C1 can prevent VQ from rapidly decreasing due to the leakage current in the module 1. After CK2L becomes high, VQ is bootstrapped by the parasitic capacitor (Cgd_T8) between gate and drain of T8, the parasitic capacitor (Cgs_T8) between gate and source of T8, and C1. The needed time (t2) for this bootstrap process may be approximated ast2≈3R‾T8C1, whereR‾T8is the average equivalent resistance of T8. Similarly, VQ will be bootstrapped up due to the parasitic capacitor (Cgd_T10) between the gate and the drain of T10 when CK2 jumps to high level. And the whole variation of VQ due to the bootstrap effect can be expressed as(3)ΔV=(Cgd_T8+Cgs_T8+C1)(VD-VL)Cgd_T8+Cgs_T8+Cgd_T10+Cgs_T10+C1+Cgd_T10(VD-VS)Cgd_T8+Cgs_T8+Cgd_T10+Cgs_T10+C1=(VD-VL)1-Cgs_T10Cgd_T8+Cgs_T8+Cgd_T10+Cgs_T10+C1+(VL-VS)Cgd_T10Cgd_T8+Cgs_T8+Cgd_T10+Cgs_T10+C1≈(VD-VL)1-Cgs_T10Cgd_T8+Cgs_T8+Cgd_T10+Cgs_T10+C1whereCgs_T10is the parasitic capacitor between the gate and source of T10. It is shown that a large value of C1 is helpful to achieve a large increase of VQ due to the bootstrap effect. Note that, for our proposed operation timing as shown in Fig. 2(b), the gate voltage of T10 has been bootstrapped up to a higher voltage before CK2 starts to charge GOUT since the duty ratio of CK2L is set larger than that of CK2. Fig. 5shows the simulated results of VQ after bootstrapping by employing different values of C1 with the other parameters as constant. It is shown that VQ rapidly increases with the increase of C1 at the beginning stage, and afterwards VQ slowly increases. Note that, C1 is charged by module 3 in the period 1. As a result, the value of C1 should be optimized by taking into account both the bootstrap effect and the size of TFTs in the module 3.For module 4, we present a clock-controlled inverter to avoid the direct current path compared with the conventional diode-connected inverter. Fig. 6shows the simulated results of output voltage versus the ratio of W(T1) to W(T2) for the conventional diode-connected inverter and the clock-controlled inverter when the inverter is expected to output low level, as well as the direct current following through T1 and T2. It is shown that the channel width of T2 should be much larger than that of T1 to output a quite low voltage for the conventional diode-connected inverter. Whereas, the clock-controlled inverter can output a reasonable low voltage without large size T2 since T1 is working at “off” station with only the leakage current going through T1 and T2. Note that, in our proposed gate driver, the speed of charging QB would be faster as T1 can be designed larger than that in the diode-connected inverter.Table 1shows the optimized design parameter values of the proposed gate driver as demonstrated in Fig. 3 at the condition of Rload=6kΩ and Cload=150pF. Fig. 7shows the simulation results of the proposed gate driver by using SMART-SPICE software with the fitting characteristics of IZO TFTs as shown in Fig. 1. It is shown that the variation of the voltages at node Q and node QB is consistent with the operation analysis of the proposed gate driver in Section 3. And the proposed gate driver can reasonably output the COUT and GOUT pulse.One side of the proposed gate driver with 20 stages employing IZO TFTs has been fabricated on the glass substrate for verification. And Fig. 8shows its micrograph with parameters shown in Table 1. Note that, the area of output module can be reduced about 17% compared with that employing two same large size TFTs. Fig. 9shows the outputs of the 1st and 20th stages at a clock frequency of 12.5kHz with the load Rload=6kΩ and Cload=150pF, of which the pulse width is 20μs. It is observed that the 20th stage can generate the output signal with no distortion compared with the first stage. Therefore, the expected shift function can be well realized with a good noise-suppressed characteristic. Note that, the 20th output pulse is used to drive the 39th gate line of pixel array in the bi-side driving condition. Fig. 10(a) shows that the proposed gate driver can successfully output a pulse small to 2.4μs at a clock frequency of 100kHz without RC load. While Fig. 10(b) shows that it can successfully output a pulse of 2.6μs width revealing a good noise-suppressed ability at an clock frequency of 100kHz with Rload=6kΩ and Cload=150pF. And the measured power consumption of the proposed gate driver with 20 stages is 1mW. Therefore, the proposed gate driver can be suitable for the popular 4K resolution display (3840(RGB)∗2160) at a frame rate of 120Hz.The stability of the gate driver for long term operation should be taken into account for its application in flat panel display [F]. Fig. 11shows the characteristics of a 4μs output signal at the initial time (dotted line) and that after 48h operation (solid line). It can be found that the output waveform after 48h operation is almost same as that of the initial condition. As a result, a good stability for long term operation has been achieved for the proposed gate driver.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we have proposed a high speed bi-side gate driver integrated by IZO TFTs, which is composed of four modules. For the driving schedule, the bootstrapped high voltage at node Q can be fully used to output the high level of GOUT since CK2 has a lower duty ratio (25%) than that of CK2L (37.5%) and its pulse located in the middle of the pulse of CK2L. In addition, the function of every module is carefully analyzed and the size of devices is optimized by calculation and simulation. The experimental results show that the proposed gate driver can successfully output a 2.6μs width pulse with good noise-suppressed characteristic at the condition of Rload=6kΩ and Cload=150pF. The measured power consumption of the proposed gate driver with 20 stages is 1mW. Therefore, the proposed gate driver can be applied to the display of 4K resolution (4096×2160) at a frame rate of 120Hz. Moreover, a good stability for 48h operation has been achieved for the proposed gate driver.
