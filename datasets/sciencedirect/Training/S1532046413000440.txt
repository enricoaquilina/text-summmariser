@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Personalized medicine is to deliver the right drug to the right patient in the right dose. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is to identify genetic variants that may affect drug efficacy and toxicity. The availability of a comprehensive and accurate PGx-specific drug–gene relationship knowledge base is important for personalized medicine. However, building a large-scale PGx-specific drug–gene knowledge base is a difficult task. In this study, we developed a bootstrapping, semi-supervised learning approach to iteratively extract and rank drug–gene pairs according to their relevance to drug pharmacogenomics. Starting with a single PGx-specific seed pair and 20 million MEDLINE abstracts, the extraction algorithm achieved a precision of 0.219, recall of 0.368 and F1 of 0.274 after two iterations, a significant improvement over the results of using non-PGx-specific seeds (precision: 0.011, recall: 0.018, and F1: 0.014) or co-occurrence (precision: 0.015, recall: 1.000, and F1: 0.030). After the extraction step, the ranking algorithm further improved the precision from 0.219 to 0.561 for top ranked pairs. By comparing to a dictionary-based approach with PGx-specific gene lexicon as input, we showed that the bootstrapping approach has better performance in terms of both precision and F1 (precision: 0.251 vs. 0.152, recall: 0.396 vs. 0.856 and F1: 0.292 vs. 0.254). By integrative analysis using a large drug adverse event database, we have shown that the extracted drug–gene pairs strongly correlate with drug adverse events. In conclusion, we developed a novel semi-supervised bootstrapping approach for effective PGx-specific drug–gene pair extraction from large number of MEDLINE articles with minimal human input.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We developed a bootstrapping, semi-supervised learning approach to iteratively extract and rank drug–gene pairs according to their relevance to drug pharmacogenomics. Starting with 19,055 human protein-coding genes, 6707 drugs, 20 million MEDLINE abstracts, and a few PGx-specific drug–gene pairs as seeds, the extraction algorithm achieved a precision of 0.219, a recall of 0.368, and an F1 of 0.274 after two iterations, which is a significant improvement over the results of using any seeds (precision: 0.015, recall: 1.000, and F1: 0.030). The ranking algorithm effectively ranked PGx-specific pairs highly and further improved the precision from 0.219 to 0.561. By comparing to a dictionary-based approach with PGx-specific gene lexicon as input, we showed that the bootstrapping approach has better performance in terms of precision and F1 (precision: 0.251 vs. 0.152, recall: 0.396 vs. 0.856 and F1: 0.292 vs. 0.254). To demonstrate the connection between drug metabolism and drug adverse events, we show that drug–drug pairs sharing at least one PGx-specific gene also share significant more adverse events (28.2 for all pairs vs. 37.4 for pairs sharing at least one PGx-specific gene). In the future, we will develop automatic and semi-automatic methods to further improve both precision and recall of the extracted drug–gene pairs and use the extracted pairs in drug adverse event prediction.
