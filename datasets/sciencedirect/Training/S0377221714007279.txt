Today, an increasing number of companies have publicized policies to improve corporate social responsibility performance related to human resources in their supply chain management practices, such as safer and healthier working conditions, higher payment, better benefits, and fewer working hours. However, there are still concerns about the sincerity and effectiveness of such efforts. This could be attributed to the fact that the economic benefit of those improvements is not clearly structured as an integral part in the companies’ decision-making process. In this paper, we develop a stylized analytic framework that links a firm's supply chain social performance in people with its economic performance in profit. Specifically, we examine how consumers’ responses to the outbreak of social misconduct in supply chains affect competing firms’ market segmentation and profit and subsequently provide economic incentive for proactive social responsibility investment. Closed-form optimal solutions for proactive social responsibility strategy are found for our model setup. Numerical tests and sensitivity analyses have been conducted to study the effects of various factors on the firms’ supply chain social responsibility strategies. Factors such as consumers’ ethical disposition, the social environment, and consumers’ perception of a product's functional versus social value are a few among them. The results of our analysis demonstrate that proactive investment in supply chain social responsibility can enhance a firm's competitive advantage and economic performance, thereby suggesting a profit-driven approach to achieving supply chain social responsibility and sustainability.“You have to be able to do good to do well.”–Julius Rosenwald

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The globalized market and low labor costs of developing countries make global sourcing indispensable in today's business world (Krause, Pagell, &#38; Curkovic, 2001). However, sourcing from a global supply network also exposes purchasing firms to a notable set of risks (Reuter, Foerstl, Hartmann, &#38; Blome, 2010). One risk that recently captured enormous public attention is that associated with global suppliers’ irresponsible practices in human resources involving continuous violations of human rights, worker safety and health, and labor law (Spekman &#38; Davis, 2004). In recent years, many incidents related to social responsibility (SR) have been exposed in the global supply chains of multinational companies such as Nike, Adidas, Microsoft, Apple, and Wal-Mart (Hoang &#38; Jones, 2012). Such negative SR incidents in supply chains can cause severe impact on firms’ public image, reputation, and even bottom line. With rising media transparency and high public social expectation, proper strategy to manage SR practices in global supply chains becomes necessary for a firm's sustainable development.While an increasing number of companies pronounce their stand on supply chain SR via supplier codes of conduct or corporate social responsibility reports, concerns have been raised that for many firms, efforts in building a socially responsible supply chain are only for window dressing to improve their public reputation. A survey of more than 600 major US companies on corporate sustainability revealed that 43 percent of the companies surveyed adopted supplier codes of conduct, but only 25 percent of them performed minimal monitoring to determine suppliers’ compliance to codes (Lubber, 2012). Carter and Rogers (2008) emphasized that a firm's supply chain SR performance must be undertaken with a clear and explicit recognition of the company's economic objective, which has been overlooked in the extant research.In this study, we propose a stylized framework that links a firm's social performance in people with its economic performance in profit. Linking social performance with economic performance provides a strong business case for firms engaging in SR initiatives (Pomering &#38; Dolnicar, 2009; p. 285; Tang &#38; Zhou, 2012; Vanhamme, Adam, Reast, &#38; van Popering, 2012; Xia &#38; Tang, 2011). In particular, we consider two competing firms that apply different strategies, i.e., conventional versus proactive, in managing supply chain SR. We examine how consumers’ responses to the exposure of social misconduct in a supply chain affect the competing firms’ market segmentation and profit. We intend to explore whether and how consumers’ reactions can provide firms economic incentive for proactive investment in building a sustainable and socially responsible supply chain. We explore the interplay among consumers’ ethical disposition, their evaluation of a product's functional versus social value, corporate strategies, and market share and profit changes. The model proposed in this research simplifies the reality; nevertheless, it captures some specific characteristics of social performance and provides theoretical support for the profit-driven socially responsible supply chain.Most of the supply chain articles investigate issues of sustainability through case studies or empirical research. Among the limited articles that adopt a theoretical-modeling method, most focus on environment-related “green” operations (Brandenburg, Govindan, Sarkis, &#38; Seuring, 2014; Sarkis, Zhu, &#38; Lai, 2011). Compared with green operations, social responsibility on the “people” dimension is more difficult to quantify and evaluate. Environmental performance or improvement can be measured with indices such as gas mileage, carbon emission, waste reduction, etc. However, there is no well-accepted index for measuring social performance continuously. In addition, a market niche exists for products with outstanding environmental quality. Some consumers are willing to pay extra for environment-friendly products; e.g., electric automobiles are sold at a much higher price than gas-motored automobiles. Moreover, green operations may cost reduce cost for companies through energy-saving or recycling. On the contrary, consumer attitudes toward social-conscious products are complicated. Improvement of social performance always requires investment and effort; but the economic benefit of social performance improvement is neither obvious nor direct. Nevertheless, the people-related corporate social responsibility is essential and should not be ignored. An in-depth study on people-focused sustainability is needed.Although many companies have realized the importance of supply chain social performance, several essential issues have not been rigorously addressed in the literature to foster companies’ effort in improving their SR practices in supply chains. In this study, we develop a rigorous analytic model that connects supply chain social performance with its economic performance. With this model built up, we intend to understand how different factors, such as the exposure of negative SR events, the change of the customer ethical disposition, and the product preference collectively influence companies’ market performance. We can even obtain optimal decisions and provide quantitative suggestions as well as managerial insights on corporate social responsibility investment.In this research, we propose a stylized model to capture several key characteristics influencing firms’ supply chain social performance. We recognize that in some literature, corporate social responsibility includes both the “green” dimension and the “people” dimension. However, as we discussed above and will introduce soon, the two dimensions possess very different characteristics and thus cannot be described by the same analytical model. In this research, we focus on the specific “people” dimension of corporate social responsibility. In the rest of the paper, when we mention social performance, social value, or social responsibility (SR), we indicate the specific “people” dimension. The structure of our analytical model is supported by the literature.First, as the president and CEO of the Fair Labor Association, Auret van Heerden, stated, “Social responsibility has a cost. We are asking factories to make significant investments. We all have to be willing to share that cost (ABC Nightline, 2012).” In an intensive case study of a Reebok supplier located in South China, Yu (2008) found that despite Reebok's high-profile for human rights, the Chinese employees there work long hours with very low payment, and the employee union established as required by codes of conduct could not really represent workers’ interests. Yu argued that one important reason was that Reebok was not willing to share costs with suppliers or amend its purchasing policy to make it more financially manageable for suppliers to improve working conditions. Reebok took a punishment approach by using its buying power to force the supplier to comply with the labor codes, which led to limited improvement of labor conditions. Similar problems have been found in other studies that examined the labor conditions of international suppliers (Emmelhainz &#38; Adams, 1999; Jiang, 2009; Robert, 2003; Strand, 2009). Clearly, in order to improve their supply chain social performance, firms need to invest financially to share cost with their suppliers. According to McWilliams and Siegel (2001), an adequate level of investment in corporate social responsibility can be determined through cost–benefit analysis to realize the balance of maximizing profit and satisfying stakeholder demand for the social responsibility. Porter and Kramer (2011) also argue that a firm's social responsibility initiatives should be developed with a goal of achieving both economic profit and societal benefit in a cost effective manner. Therefore, in this research, we introduce a cost function to describe the relationship between firms’ financial investments on SR initiatives and its social performance.Second, a firm's supply chain social performance can influence its image among consumers and subsequently affect the sales of its product (Brunk, 2010; Mascarenhas, 1995; Park-Poaps &#38; Rees, 2010). It is suggested that negative information influences consumer attitudes much more than positive information. Consumers tend to punish firms for their unethical and irresponsible actions but not necessarily reward ethical and responsible actions (Carrigan &#38; Attalla, 2001; Deng, 2012). Note that this particular characteristic makes social performance distinctive from environmental performance as consumers may respond positively and directly to green products and green strategy in a supply chain (Folkes &#38; Kamins, 1999). Accordingly, it is particularly important that firms take steps to reduce the risk of suppliers’ social misbehaviors and minimize the potential damage of an ethical or social crisis on the firm's image and reputation to avoid the loss of market share and sales (Carter, 2000; Mohr &#38; Webb, 2005). Inspired by the above research findings, we propose that negative social events influence consumers’ evaluation of the utility of products and can cause them to switch between products.Third, prior research also suggests that while consumers typically express their intention to purchase from companies with a good reputation in social performance, social performance is not the ultimate criterion in their purchase decisions. Consumers’ attitudes toward a firm and its products are dual-dimensional, reflecting both the products’ social performance and functional attributes (Boulstridge &#38; Carrigan, 2000; Browne, Harris, Hofny-Collins, Pasiecznik, &#38; Wallace, 2000; Davies et al., 2012; Folkes &#38; Kamins, 1999). In this study we assume that when consumers make purchasing decisions, they assess a product's functional value as well as the social value associated with the making and delivery of the product.Finally, not all consumers react to supply chain social performance in the same manner (Carrigan &#38; Attalla, 2001). Fullerton, Kerch, and Dodge (1996) assessed consumers according to their acceptance of moral transgressions. They found that consumers can be generally classified as puritan consumers (around 5 percent) who strongly believe that firms in the marketplace should follow strict standards of conduct, permissive consumers (around 17 percent) who are indifferent to product social performance, and the remaining majority of consumers, called situationalists or conformists, whose acceptance of ethical breaches depends on the specific scenario. Situationalists are likely to conform to social norms and have strong but not unequivocal opinions on the responsible conduct of businesses. Bird and Hughes (1997) also identified similar classifications of consumers, such as “ethical,” “semi-ethical,” and “selfish” consumers based on the relative degree to which the consumer is motivated by ethical standards or product benefit in the purchase decision. Accordingly, in our model, we recognize the difference among consumers through proposing a distribution of consumers’ ethical dispositions.We consider a market with two competing firms, Firm 1 and Firm 2, which provide substitutable products to consumers. The firms can be manufacturers that outsource their production overseas. They can also be retailers who sell products made by overseas suppliers; however, the products carry brand names registered by the retailers. Each firm controls the design, development, and distribution of its products and is considered the focal firm in its supply chain. Consequently, consumers’ purchasing decisions are related to the firm's reputation and image in the market; social misconduct of the firm's global suppliers may damage the firm's corporate image and lower its products’ social value.We assume that both firms have established common practice with contractual provisions and policies to regulate their global supply chain social conduct. For their industry and in a certain time period, with the common practice established, the average number of breakouts related to suppliers’ social misdemeanors is expected to be λ0 > 0. Without loss of generality, we assume that Firm 1 relies only on the common practice in supply chain social responsibility management and thus its expected number of social misdemeanors is λ1 = λ0. However, Firm 2 may go beyond the conventional approach and invest in proactive social programs to pursue a higher level of social performance with its expected number of social misdemeanors λ2 < λ1 = λ0. We thus call Firm 1 a common-practice firm and Firm 2 a proactive firm. Note that λi(i = 1, 2) shows the social performance of the supply chains: the lower the λi, the higher the level of the supply chain's social performance.We assume that the occurrence of negative social events in a firm's supply chain follows a Poisson distribution. Poisson distribution is appropriate when the probability of an event is low. It is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time and/or space if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event. Negative social events happen in a certain time period with small chances. Social misconduct in supply chains is, or at least considered by the consumers to be, an uncommon event; that is also part of the reason why negative event could damage corporate imagine and draw public attention. On the other hand, social misdemeanors can involve a variety of irresponsible practices, such as long working-hour, low payment and restriction of union right, etc. (Jiang, 2009; Yu, 2008). In addition, a firm's supply chain network typically involves a number of suppliers at different tiers. Those suppliers, as individual businesses, operate independently; any of them could conduct any type of socially irresponsible practices that might impair the firm's reputation. Therefore, the negative social events in a firm's supply chain being exposed in a time period can be presumably independent of each other. Accordingly, it is reasonable to describe the occurrence of negative social events in a firm's supply chain based on Poisson distribution. We therefore can quantify the chance that one or more negative events might happen in the supply chain of Firm i by(1)ri=1−e−λi,i=1,2.Both firms invest in setting up contractual provisions and policies and monitoring the conduct of their global suppliers, such as visiting and inspecting suppliers’ facilities, hiring third-party organizations for assessment, corrective actions in response to problems, legal and consulting fees, etc. (Jiang, 2009); we denote the cost as SR cost Ci, i = 1, 2. We further propose an exponential cost function to reflect the relationship between the cost and the firm's desired level of social performance λi,(2)Ci=Kee−αλi,i=1,2.An exponential cost function is widely accepted in the supply chain literature (Carlsson &#38; Rydin, 1993; Grewal &#38; Slotegraaf, 2007) to reflect the fact that it gets more expensive as a firm seeks to improve its performance to a higher level. In the above cost function, Ke is the cost limit that firms spend on a supply chain SR program; α represents the external environment within which a business is operating regarding improvement of supply chain SR performance. A higher value of α indicates a social environment in which governments, businesses, and the public have a higher awareness of SR issues and businesses are more willing to abide by contracts and obey rules.On the demand side, consumers exhibit varying dispositions in two dimensions, product functionality preference and ethical disposition. In a competitive market, multiple factors, such as price, perceived quality, convenience to repair, energy efficiency, aesthetics taste, and even personal experience collectively influence a consumer's evaluation of the functionality value of a product. In this research, we assume that those factors collectively form a consumer's functionality preference. Consumers differ in their functionality preference of the products of Firms 1 and 2, denoted by y on a scale ranging from 0 to 1 with y = 0 indicating most preference for Firm 1’s product and y = 1 indicating most preference for Firm 2’s product. The consumers with 0 ≤ y < 0.5 prefer the product of Firm 1 (product 1) over the product of Firm 2 (product 2); the consumers with 0.5 < y ≤ 1 prefer the product of Firm 2 over the product of Firm 1; the consumers with y = 0.5 have no preference between the two firm's products. This functionality preference distribution setup follows the model used in Xia (2011).Consumers also exhibit different ethical dispositions in their purchase decisions; the ethical disposition, x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), is used to indicate a consumer's attitude and stance in ethical and social issues related to fair labor, with x = 0 referring to permissive consumers; x = 1 referring to extremely ethical, puritan consumers; and 0 < x < 1 referring to conformist consumers who are neither permissive nor extreme ethical. We assume that the percentage of permissive consumers in the market is Np, extremely ethical consumers Nc, and conformist consumers Ne. The total market size is D = Np + Nc + Ne = 100 percent.We further consider that the conformists’ ethical disposition value xc follows an approximate Triangular distribution with m as the mode. As suggested by previous studies (Bird &#38; Hughes, 1997; Fullerton et al., 1996), the conformists constitute the majority of consumers. Accordingly, the change of public attitudes toward social issues can be represented via the value of m, which indicates the primary stand of most conformists’ attitudes toward supply chain social responsibility. Triangular distribution is a practical approach to describe conformists’ ethical disposition in this study. First, this distribution is effective in covering skewed cases, which is appropriate to describe the wide range of ethical values among conformists. Second, the change of Triangular distribution is defined by its mode, which is less affected by any outliers and thus can be effectively estimated. Lastly, Triangular distribution allows closed-form solutions for our theoretical model, which help to provide more illustrative descriptions of the problem and useful managerial insights. Note that Triangular distribution has been commonly used in the literature for analytic tractability (Ayanso, Diaby, &#38; Nair, 2006; Schmitt, Snyder, &#38; Shen, 2010; Walker, 1993). The distribution of consumers’ ethical disposition is illustrated in Fig. 1.We further introduce the following notations to facilitate our model description:ωi: the profit margin per percent of market share for Firm i, i = 1, 2Mi: the expected market size for Firm i in a time period, i = 1, 2πi: the expected total profit for Firm i in a time period, i = 1, 2F(xc) and f(xc): the demand accumulative distribution function and distribution function for conformists with respect to their ethical dispositionF(xc)={xc2m0<xc≤m1−(1−xc)21−mm<xc<1f(xc)={2xcm0<xc≤m21−xc1−mm<xc<1G(y) and g(y): the demand accumulative distribution function with respect to the consumers’ functionality preference between the two productsVp: the factor representing consumers’ perception of the functional value of the productsVe: the factor representing consumers’ perception of the social value inherent in the productsWhen there is no exposure of negative social misconduct associated with either of the two firms, the consumers make purchasing decisions based on their functionality preference only. Consumers with 0 ≤ y < 0.5 choose product 1; consumer with 0.5 < y ≤ 1 choose product 2; consumers with y = 0.5 choose product 1 or 2 with equal chances.Upon the exposure of negative social events, consumers may choose to stay with their preferred product, to switch to another product, or to cease purchasing. The decision is based on how much they prefer one product over another (the position of y), how ethical they are (the position of x) and with whom the negative event has associated.To describe consumers’ decision making process, we introduce a new concept called switching cost. Switching may involve giving away a consumer's preference and convenience of purchasing one product and becoming familiar with the functionality and operations of the new product, etc. Therefore, a consumer doesnot switch just because the benefit of the product he/she has becomes lower than another product. A consumer switches only when the loss of value of his/her product is over a threshold, the switching cost. For a customer with preference location y, its switching cost is a given threshold value. The real switching force is the loss of the social value from negative social events. Note that even consumers who are indifferent to the products are still resistant to changing products due to the inconvenience. According to Wagner and Friedl (2007) and Xia (2011), switching cost Sican be defined as the threshold cost to switch a consumer from his/her current preference location to the location that is most preferable to product i and can be expressed as:(3)S1=Vpy;S2=Vp(1−y)Switching decision often involves part of the customers instead of all customers. When negative event only happen to product 2, the customers instead of all customers. When negative event only happen to product 2, the customers that prefer product 1 (0 ≤ y < 0.5) will not consider switching to product 2; the customers that prefer product 2 (0.5 < y ≤ 1) switch to product 1 only if the loss of the social value is high enough to change their preference such that:(4)Vex>S1=Vpy,(0.5<y≤1).Similarly, when negative event only happen to product 1, the customers that prefer product 2 (0.5 < y ≤ 1) will not consider switching to product 1; the customers that prefer product 1 (0 ≤ y < 0.5) switch to product 2 only if the loss of the social value is high enough to change their preference such that:(5)Vex>S2=Vp(1−y),(0≤y<0.5)When negative social events are exposed in both firms’ supply chains, consumers may choose to stop purchasing from both firms if condition (4) or (5) is met. They stay with their preferred product otherwise. Note that in a market with low social value factor Ve or for the consumers who lean more toward indifference to ethical and social issues, a negative social event may not cause changes in consumers’ purchasing decisions. Accordingly, market segmentation under different situations is illustrated in Fig. 2.Clearly, a consumer's purchasing decision is determined by the relationship between his ethical disposition (x) and the ratio of two value factors (Vp/Ve). In situation (I) 0 ≤ Vp/Ve < 1, consumers consider the social value of the product higher than the functional value of the product. Extremely ethical consumers and conformists with x > Vp/Ve will definitely switch products when negative social events happen no matter how much they prefer the functionality of the products; they will cease purchasing when negative events happen to both products. In situation (II) and (III) Vp/Ve ≥ 1, consumers consider the social value of the product lower than or equal to the functional value of the product. They will not cease purchasing decision when negative social events happen to both products. They also hesitate to switch to a different product. In situation (II) 1 < Vp/Ve < 2, even some extremely ethical consumers who hold strong functionality preference between the products are going to stay with their functionality preference; only consumers who are quite indifferent between the product functionalities switch their decision. In situation (III) Vp/Ve ≥ 2 when the product's functional value is substantially higher than its social value, consumers, even the extremely ethical ones, will not change their purchasing decisions based on negative social event. We highlight the market reactions to the social performance of a firm's supply chain with Lemmas 1–3. Due to the page limit, proofs of the theorems and lemmas in this paper are included in a technical note as an appendix.Lemma 1The consumers with ethical disposition x > 0.5Vp/Vemay consider switching to another product when a negative SR event happens in the supply chain of the product they prefer. The consumers with ethical disposition x ≤ 0.5Vp/Ve do not change purchasing decisions upon negative SR events.The consumers with ethical disposition x > Vp/Vealways choose the product that has no negative SR event in its supply chain; when negative SR events happen in both supply chains, those consumers cease purchasing from both firms.In a market where consumers value the product's functional value more than twice as much as the product's social value (Vp/Ve > 2), exposure of negative SR events in a firm's supply chains do not influence the firm's market performance.Given the market shares of the two competing firms and considering the SR cost, the expected profit functions of the two firms in a time period are(6)πi=Miωi−Ke(e−λi)α=Miωi−Ke(1−ri)α,i=1,2Clearly, a better supply chain social performance requires higher SR cost; however, it may increase market share and the firms’ overall profit. The firms can avoid loss of sales due to negative exposure of irresponsible social practices and attract more socially sensitive sales with improved social performance. Thus, decision-making regarding social performance should focus on balancing the SR cost and the potential gain from the better social performance.Since we assume that Firm 1 follows conventional practices to maintain its social performance level whereas Firm 2 applies a proactive social program, Firm 2 needs to determine its optimal goal of social performance, e.g.,0≤λ2*≤λ0. To explore the proactiveFirm 2’s optimal SR policy, we first consider two representative distributions for the consumers in terms of product functionality preferencey: a uniform distribution and a bi-polar distribution. We then discuss the results for the general situation in which the consumer's product functionality preference is unknown. The uniform distribution of product functionality preference is commonly used to represent a mature and fully competitive market in which the two substitutable products offer similar functions and features as well as competitive prices. The bi-polar distribution of product functionality preference represents a different market in which the two firms have their own loyal customer groups.By specifying the distributions of consumers’ product functionality preference as g(y) = 1, ∀0 ≤ y ≤ 1, we find the following results.Theorem 1When consumers’ product functionality preference between Firm 1’s and Firm 2’s products follows a uniform distribution, the expected market shares for the two firms and the optimal supply chain social performance for Firm 2 are:In the situation 0 < Vp/Ve < 1,(I-1)If m < 0.5(Vp/Ve),(7)M1=0.5Np+0.5(1−r1+r2−r1r2)Ne+[(VpVe)21−m−r1+r2−r1r22(1−m)+(3r1−3r2+4r1r2)4(1−m)VpVe+7r2−7r1−12r1r224(1−m)(VpVe)2]Nc(8)M2=0.5Np+0.5(1+r1−r2−r1r2)Ne+[(VpVe)21−m−r2+r1−r1r22(1−m)+(3r2−3r1+4r1r2)4(1−m)VpVe+7r1−7r2−12r1r224(1−m)(VpVe)2]Nc(9)λ2*=min{max{ln[2αKe/ω2(1+r1)(Ne+Nc(1−m))−[3+4r12(1−m)VpVe+−7−12r112(1−m)(VpVe)2]Nc]/(α−1),0},λ0}If 0.5(Vp/Ve) < m < Vp/Ve,(10)M1=0.5Np+0.5(1−r1+r2−r1r2)Ne+[−mr1+mr2−r1r2+r2−r1+1−m2(1−m)]Nc+[(VpVe)213m2(r1−r2)(1−m)VeVp+(r1−r2+r1r2)(1−m)VpVe+(1+7m)(r2−r1)−12r1r2m24m(1−m)(VpVe)2]Nc(11)M2=0.5Np+0.5(1+r1−r2−r1r2)Ne+[−mr2+mr1−r1r2+r1−r2+1−m2(1−m)]Nc+[(VpVe)213m2(r2−r1)(1−m)VeVp+(r2−r1+r1r2)(1−m)VpVe+(1+7m)(r1−r2)−12r1r2m24m(1−m)(VpVe)2]Nc(12)λ2*=min{max{ln[2αKe/ω2(1+r1)Ne+(1+r1+m(1−m))Nc−[23m2(1−m)VeVp+2+2r1Vp(1−m)Ve+−1−7m−12mr112m(1−m)(VpVe)2]Nc]/(α−1),0},λ0}If Vp/Ve < m < 1,(13)M1=0.5Np+0.5(1−r1+r2−r1r2)Ne+0.5(1−r1+r2−r1r2)Nc+7(r1−r2)+12r1r224m(VpVe)2Nc(14)M2=0.5Np+0.5(1+r1−r2−r1r2)Ne+0.5(1+r1−r2−r1r2)Nc+7(r2−r1)+12r1r224m(VpVe)2Nc(15)λ2*=min{max{ln[2αKe/ω2(1+r1)(Ne+Nc)−7+12r112m(VpVe)2Nc]/(α−1),0},λ0}In the situation 1 ≤ Vp/Ve < 2,(II-2)If m < 0.5(Vp/Ve),(16)M1=0.5D+0.5[r1−r2]Ne+(r2−r1)VeVpNe+(r2−r1)1−m×[13VeVp−12+14(VpVe)−124(VpVe)2]Nc(17)M2=0.5D+0.5[r2−r1]Ne+(r1−r2)VeVpNe+(r1−r2)1−m×[13VeVp−12+14(VpVe)−124(VpVe)2]Nc(18)λ2*=min{max{ln[2αKe/ω2(2VeVp−1)Ne+Nc[2(1+m)3VeVp+112m(VpVe)2−1]]/(α−1),0},λ0}If 0.5(Vp/Ve) < m < 1(19)M1=0.5D+0.5[r1−r2]Ne+(r2−r1)VeVpNe+(r2−r1)×[1+m3VeVp+124m(VpVe)2−0.5]Nc(20)M2=0.5D+0.5[r2−r1]Ne+(r1−r2)VeVpNe+(r1−r2)×[1+m3VeVp+124m(VpVe)2−0.5]Nc(21)λ2*=min{max{ln[2αKe/ω2(2VeVp−1)Ne+Nc1−m[23VeVp−1+12(VpVe)−112(VpVe)2]]/(α−1),0},λ0}In the situation Vp/Ve ≥ 2,(22)M1=M2=12D;λ2*=λ0Note that0≤λ2*≤λ0, since λ2 = 0 is the best SR performance possible and λ2 = λ0 shows the social performance from mandated common practice.In this section, we assume consumers’ product functionality preference between the two firms’ products y follows a bi-polar distribution,g(y)={aify=01−aify=1∀0<a<1,and we find the following results.Theorem 2When consumers’ preference toward Firm 1’s and Firm 2’s products follows a bi-polar distribution, the expected market shares for the two firms and the optimal social performance strategy for Firm 2 are:(I)In the situation 0 < Vp/Ve < 1,(I-1)If Vp/Ve ≤ m,(23)M1=aNp+(a−ar1−ar2+ar1r2+r2−r1r2)Ne+(a−ar1−ar2+r2−r1r2+ar1r2)Nc+(−r2+r1r2+ar2+ar1−ar1r2)(VpVe)2Ncm(24)M2=Np(1−a)+(1−a+ar1+ar2−ar1r2−r2)Ne+(1−a+ar1+ar2−ar1r2−r2)Nc+(r2−ar1−ar2+ar1r2)(VpVe)2Ncm(25)λ2*=min{max{ln[αKe/[ω2(1−a+ar1)]Ne+(1−VpVe)2Nc1−m]/[αKe/[ω2(1−a+ar1)]Ne+(1−VpVe)2Nc1−m](α−1),0},λ0}If m < Vp/Ve < 1,(26)M1=aNp+(a−ar1−ar2+ar1r2+r2−r1r2)Ne+aNc+(r2−r1r2−ar2−ar1+ar1r2)×(1−VpVe)2Nc(1−m)(27)M2=Np(1−a)+(1−a)Nc+(1−a+ar1+ar2−ar1r2−r2)Ne+[−r2+ar2+ar1−ar1r2](1−VpVe)2Nc(1−m)(28)λ2*=min{max{ln[αKe/[ω2(1−a+ar1)](Nc+Ne)−1m(VpVe)2Nc]/[αKe/[ω2(1−a+ar1)](Nc+Ne)−1m(VpVe)2Nc](α−1),0},λ0}In the situation Vp/Ve ≥ 1(29)M1=a;M2=1−a;λ2*=λ0The results above indicate the SR strategies under two specific distributions of consumer product preference. However, there are some general guidelines that managers may apply when making decisions on their firms’ supply chain SR policies, regardless of the consumers’ disposition toward product preference.Lemma 4In the market with Vp/Ve ≥ 2, Firm 2 should conduct only common practices and avoid additional investment in supply chain social programs. In the markets with Vp/Ve ≤ 2, proactive investment may generate larger market share and higher profits for Firm 2 and may be considered a means to competitive advantage.Obviously, Firm 2’s optimal decision to maximize its expected profit takes different forms under different circumstances of Vp/Ve and m relationships. Nevertheless, when a product's functional value is more than twice as high as its social value, proactive strategy in supply chain social performance should be avoided.Lemma 5λ2*is always a non-increase function with respect to m.Note that the increase of m represents the increase in the consumers’ overall ethical disposition; clearly, as consumers lean toward higher social values, proactive investment starts to make sense and may bring additional profit for Firm 2. On the other hand, under the situations such as when the social environment for the global supply chain is harsh (very small α), when the market values the product's functionality much higher than its social value (high Vp/Ve ratio), or when the overall consumer ethical sensitivity is low (small m), proactive investment in supply chain social performance may not generate any additional market share for Firm 2 and should be avoided. Thus, firms should be very cautious when investing in supply chain social programs.Our numerical tests start with sensitivity analyses to discuss how various factors, such as market perception of a product's functional value versus social value (Vp/Ve), consumers’ ethical disposition distribution (m and Ne), and the supply chain social environment (α) influence the optimal proactive SR strategy (λ2*) in different scenarios. We then demonstrate how market segmentation and profits of the firms change when the optimal proactive SR strategy is adopted in different cases. In the following analyses, we first assume Np = 5 percent, Nc = 85 percent, and Ne = 10 percent as the percentages of permissive, conformist, and extremely ethical consumers in the market. These numbers are supported by the survey results of Fullerton et al. (1996). We choose λ0 = 3, α = 2, ω2 = $20, 000 per percent of market share, Ke = US$1 million as our baseline example. Uniform and bi-polar distributions for the consumer preference distribution are both tested in our numerical analyses. Both distributions indicate similar managerial insights. Due to the page limit, we show only the results from the uniform consumer preference distribution in this session. The results from the bi-polar distribution are available upon request.In practice, different types of products have different functional value Vp and social value Ve in their market. For the products with a lower Vp/Ve ratio, their social performance is relatively more important to consumers; for the products with a higher Vp/Ve ratio, the situation is the opposite. It is reasonable for the proactive Firm 2 to invest more aggressively and to pursue a lower negative SR event rate (λ2*) in its supply chain when the ratio Vp/Ve is lower in the market. Fig. 3a and b shows that our testing results support the intuitive presumption.Clearly, whether it is profitable for a firm to adopt the proactive SR strategy in its supply chain is determined by the market perception of the social value of a product. Our test demonstrates that if we make the public aware of the social value of a product, we are able to enforce the proactive SR strategy in the market and improve the supply chain SR performance.Since we assume Np = 5 percent, Nc = 85 percent and Ne = 10 percent, the disposition of the consumers’ ethical values is determined by the mode of the distribution of the conformists m. Fig. 4a andb shows how the proactive optimal SR strategyλ2*and investment C2 change with m, respectively. As shown in the figures, when the ethical disposition mode of the conformists (m) increases, Firm 2 should invest more and seek better supply chain social performance.We next assume that the percentage of permissive consumers Np stays at 10 percent as in the baseline case, while within the remaining 90 percent consumers, the percentage of extremely ethical consumers Ne increases and the percentage of conformists Nc decreases. Fig. 5shows howλ2*change with Ne at all Vp/Ve < 1 and 1 ≤ Vp/Ve ≤ 2 cases in three dimensions.Obviously, when Vp/Ve < 1, as Ne increases, the proactive Firm 2 shall increase its investment in social performance to lower the average number of negative events λ2. However, when 1 ≤ Vp/Ve ≤ 2, as Ne increases, the optimal average number of negative eventsλ2*first decreases and then increases; in other words, once the percentage of the extremely ethical consumers increases to certain level, the optimal proactive strategy is to stop investing in social practices and allows the SR performance to stay where it was. This result seems counterintuitive, but providing interesting insights into the relationship between consumer attitudes, competition and social performance. When Vp/Ve < 1, the proactive Firm 2 gets all the Ne market share of the extremely ethical consumers when negative events happen to Firm 1 but not to Firm 2. However, Firm 2 loses Ne market share when negative events happen to both Firms 1 and 2. Therefore, the proactive Firm 2 has a very high incentive to improve its supply chain's social performance to be much better than that of the common-practice Firm 1, with great potential benefit, when the number of the extremely ethical consumers increases. However,when 1 ≤ Vp/Ve ≤ 2, Firm 2 only gets a portion of the extremely ethical consumers when negative SR events happen to Firm 1 but not Firm 2. Firm 2 still holds half of the extremely ethical consumers when negative events happen to both Firms 1 and 2. As long as Firm 2’s SR performance is slightly better than that of Firm 1, it can keep or expand market share. Therefore, it is not economically beneficial for Firm 2 to further improve in supply chain SR performance when the number of the extremely ethical consumers increases to a certain very high level. In other words, for a market that values a product functionality higher than its social value (Vp/Ve > 1), having too many extremely ethical consumers may in fact discourage firms to invest in social programs since there is not enough economic incentive for those firms to keep improving their supply chain social performance.In conclusion, in all markets, educating the conformist consumers and raising their sensitivity and concern regarding ethical and social issues, increasing their ethical disposition, will enforce proactive investment to improve social performance in the global supply chain. However, having too many extremely ethical consumers in a market that values a product's functionality more than its social value (Vp/Ve > 1) may actually jeopardize supply chain social responsibility improvement.The three 3-D graphs in Fig. 6 demonstrate the environmental factor α’s impact on Firm 2’s optimal SR strategy and illustrate how changes in Vp/Ve and m continuously influence Firm 2’s optimal SR performance. The first graph (α = 1.1) characterizes the social environment that lacks law enforcement and social support for fair labor practices; the second graph (α = 2) represents the baseline example we use in the study, an average social environment; the third graph (α = 20) symbolizes a social environment in which supply chain social performance is strictly monitored, enforced, and supported by the local community in which the suppliers locate. The three graphs reveal the following. First, regardless of the product's social value (Vp/Ve) or the supplier's social environment (α), the proactive Firm 2 should take more strictly proactive action when consumers’ ethical disposition increases (mincreases). Second, the worse the social environment on the suppliers’ side, the more sensitive the proactive strategy is to the product's perceived social value and the ethical disposition distribution on the consumer's side. Third, when supply chain social performance is monitored more strictly (higher α), higher proactive investment should be made to improve supply chain social performance.A global supply chain's social environment is not only described by the environmental factor α but also characterized by the social investment limit Ke, which indicates the scale of the SR investment. In Fig. 7, we set Ke to be US$500,000, $1,000,000 and $2,000,000 for comparison. Clearly, low investment cost limit Ke encourages proactive improvement in supply chain SR performance and increases the chance for the proactive Firm 2 to adopt SR strategy as a means for market competition.In this section, we examine three cases: Vp/Ve = 0.8 (as an example of 0 ≤ Vp/Ve < 1), Vp/Ve = 1.6 (as an example of 1 ≤ Vp/Ve < 2), and Vp/Ve > 2. In each case, we evaluate how conformist consumers’ ethical disposition mode m influences the two firms’ market shares and profits. Notably, when Vp/Ve > 2, market segmentations of the two firms donot change; regardless of how m changes, the two firms share the market at the neutral product preference point. We omit the figures here due to its simplicity. The market segmentations and the profits for the other two cases are shown in Fig. 8a–d.When 0 < Vp/Ve < 1, Firm 2’s market gain from SR strategy is smaller than Firm 1’s loss. However, when 1 ≤ Vp/Ve < 2, Firm 1’s market loss equals Firm 2’s market gain. Notably, in both cases, the disparity between the market shares of the two firms grows wider as the mode of the ethical disposition of conformist consumers, m, increases. The above findings provide strong support that the proactive Firm 2 outperforms the common-practice Firm 1 in terms of market share and profit in all cases. Proactive supply chain SR strategy can serve as a more powerful competitive tool as the ethical attitudes among the majority of consumers rise. Note that the majority of consumers are neither permissive nor extremely ethical but they are conformist. Finally, the market is more sensitive to changes in consumer's ethical disposition in cases in which the market values the social value of a product more (lower Vp/Ve ratio).
