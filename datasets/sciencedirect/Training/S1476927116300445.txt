@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Searching novel, safe and effective anti-inflammatory agents has remained an evolving research enquiry in the mainstream of inflammatory disorders. In the present investigation series of thiazoles bearing pyrazole as a possible pharmacophore were synthesized and assessed for their anti inflammatory activity using in vitro and in vivo methods. In order to decipher the possible anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of the synthesized compounds, cyclooxygenase I and II (COX-I and COX-II) inhibition assays were also carried out. The results obtained clearly focus the significance of compounds 5d, 5h and 5i as selective COX-II inhibitors. Moreover, compound 5h was also identified as a lead molecule for inhibition of the carrageenin induced rat paw edema in animal model studies. Molecular docking results revealed significant interactions of the test compounds with the active site of COX-II, which perhaps can be explored for design and development of novel COX-II selective anti-inflammatory agents.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) include family of pharmacologically active compounds used in the therapeutic management of acute and chronic inflammation, pain, and fever. However, the long-term clinical usage of NSAIDs has been proved to be detrimental owing to the onset of gastrointestinal lesions, hemorrhaging, and nephrotoxicity (Bombardier et al., 2000; Silverstein et al., 2000; Kapupara et al., 2010). Despite the continuous efforts to improve the pharmacological index of NSAIDs, ulcerogenicity remains the most restraining obstructions in their clinical use (Bekhit et al., 2010). Cyclooxygenase (COX), the rate limiting enzyme of the prostanoid biosynthetic pathway, catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to important anti-inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins (PGs), prostacyclin (PGI) and thromboxane (TXA 2) (Bandgar et al., 2012; Mohamaadzaden and Sheibani, 2012; Celecoxib Drugs Future, 1997). These enzymes catalyze the formation of key mediators in recruiting inflammatory response. There are two isoforms of COXs (COX-I and COX-II) The COX-I is constitutively expressed in most tissues and organs and catalyzes the synthesis of PGs involved in the regulation of physiological, cellular activities, whereas COX-II is mainly stimulated by various stimuli such as cytokines, mitogens, and endotoxins in inflammatory sites (Kapupara et al., 2010; Song et al., 1999; Chandrasekharan et al., 2002). Classical NSAIDs, such as Indomethacin, inhibit both isoforms of COX (Ottana et al., 2005). Therefore, research on finding safe anti-inflammatory agents that selectively curtail the COX-II activity has recently gained a central importance in anti-inflammatory discourse.In the previous state of the art literature, the heterocyles containing sulfur and nitrogen possess a broad range of pharmaceutical activities. For example, Penicillin: a classical antibiotic isolated from Penicillium fungi possess therapeutically active thiazole moiety (Vane and Botting, 1996). Thiazoles and their derivatives are already characterized to hold an array of interesting biological activities such as anti-tubercular (Kapupara et. al, 2010; Smith and Dewitt, 1996) and anti-HIV (Fu et al., 1990; Herschman, 1996). Conversely, pyrazole derivatives have been reported in the literature to demonstrate anti-inflammatory (Dubois et al., 1998), antihypertensive (Gupta et al., 1999), and antimicrobial activities (Ashtekar et al., 1987; Maass et al., 1993; Barreca et al., 2002).Recently, multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have emerged as an imperative key model in combinatorial chemistry owing to its utility in synthesis of structurally diverse small drug-like molecules. Nevertheless, this methodology also allows the synthesis of compounds in a few steps and usually in a one pot operation. Another additional symbolic advantage from these reactions is the simplified purification, because all of the reagents are incorporated into the final product (Nasr and Said, 2003).The circumstantial literate and the current perspective promoted us to design the synthesis and investigate the biological role of thiazole bearing pyrazole derivatives as possible anti-inflammatory agents and focus on development of an effective pharmacophore model of the class. Hence, here we report the synthesis of thiazole bearing pyrazole derivatives 5a–5l. The effect of NO2, Cl, Br, OCH3 and CH3 substituent of the pyrazol-4-yl moiety on the anti-inflammatory profile was studied (Ozdemir et al., 2007; Kaplancikli et al., 2007). These substituents were selected on the basis of structure activity relationship (SAR) studies using in vitro COX-I and COX-II inhibition assay and in vivo rat models. Molecular docking studies were further performed to better understand detail interactions of thiazol compounds with COX-II structural model.In continuation of our investigations on the synthesis of biologically active heterocyclic compounds (Kamble et al., 2015; Acharya et al., 2014; Chobe et al., 2013; Mandawad et al., 2013; Dawane et al., 2010) here we report the Hantzsch-thiazole synthesis and the concurrent formation of thiazolyl-pyrazolone along with condensation of heteroaldehyde moiety on an active methylene group of pyrazolone under Knoevenagel reaction conditions. This is a four-component reaction (Bailey et al., 1996; Venkata and Rao, 2011) (Fig. 1).The synthesis was carried out as per method reported in the literature (Bailey et al., 1996; Venkata and Rao, 2011), which involves heating an equimolar mixture of phenacyl bromides, thiosemicarbazide, ethyl acetoacetate and heteroaldehyde in acetic acid using sodium acetate as a base. In the present reaction scheme, the thiocarboxamide part of thiosemicarbazide reacts with phenacyl bromide to furnish a Hantzsch-thiazole product (Bailey et al., 1996; Hantzsch and Weber, 1887; Polshettiwar and Varma, 2008). The hydrazine part of thiosemicarbazide reacts with ethyl acetoacetate to capitulate the pyrazolone (Bailey et al., 1996; Ryabukhin et al., 2007) moiety having an active methylene group. Furthermore, without isolation of the intermediate, addition of sodium acetate and heteroaldehyde to the reaction mixture gave the Knoevenagel product (Bailey et al., 1996; Ryabukhin et al., 2007; Madje et al., 2008) thiazol-2-yl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl-pyrazol-5(4H)-one 5a–5l.The structures of compounds 5a–5l were established on the basis of obtained spectral analysis (FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, Mass) and elemental analysis. The IR spectrum of compound 5a showed CO stretching band at 1674cm−1 of pyrazolone. 1H NMR of compound 5a exhibits typical singlet for CH3 of tolyl at δ 1.37 and downfield singlets for CH3 of pyrazolone at δ 2.91ppm. The 13C NMR of 5a showed the peaks at δ 17.9 for CH3 of pyrazolone, peak at δ 26.7 for tolyl CH3 and δ 162.1 for CO of pyrazolone. The obtained elemental analysis values are in good agreement with theoretical data. Mass spectra of all the compounds gave expected M+ peak corresponding with proposed molecular mass. Physico-chemical properties of all the derivatives are shown in Table 1.The NSAIDs, Celecoxib, Indomethcine and Aspirin were selected as standard drugs due to their structural similarities with the synthesized compounds. Like celecoxib, the present panel of synthetic compounds contains pentacyclic ring with two adjacent nitrogens. It has been reported in earlier studies that celecoxib and several NSAIDs exert their anti-inflammatory action primarily by inhibiting COX-II enzyme (Celecoxib Drugs Future, 1997). Of the tested compounds, six derivatives demonstrated selective COX-II inhibitors. Compound 5h exhibited significant COX-II inhibition (78.91±0.80%), followed by 5i (71.42±0.82%), 5d (66.99±0.33%) and 5j (61.84±0.73%). Structure activity relationship (SAR) revealed that introduction of electron donating phenyl substituent on pyrazole nucleus might have increased the COX-II inhibition potential, whereas introduction of electron withdrawing phenyl substituent on thiazole nucleus might be the underlying cause in arresting COX-II activity. These steric observations highlight the importance of electron donating phenyl substituent on pyrazole nucleus as possible pharmacophore for selective inhibition of COX-II.Two derivatives 5e and 5h were found to be more potent in protection of inflammation induced by Carrageenan at 180min (87.75and 92.85%, respectively) whereas compound 5h demonstrated prominent protection against inflammation (more than 80%) at 90min onwards. These test compounds were treated at a dose of 20mg/kg to determine the potentiality along with the reference drug Diclofenac. The results summarized in Table 3, clearly points out the significant anti-inflammatory activity of these compounds when compared with control group (P<0.05–0.001). Compound 5h shows non-significant difference (a) when compared with standard at 30, 90, 120, and 150min intervals indicating a promising activity as compared to the standard drug. Compound 5a, 5c, 5d and 5i demonstrated significant difference in comparison to control whereas non-significant difference when compared with standard at 30, 60 and 90min interval for its anti-inflammatory activity.In order to appreciate the potency and correlate the observed in vitro results to the structure of newly synthesized derivatives, we attempted an in silico molecular docking investigation. The main objective of molecular docking simulations was to define SAR by examining the interaction of the compounds with molecular model of COX-II obtained by X-Ray crystallography: PDB ID 3NT1 (Duggan et al., 2010). We also examine and discuss detailed interaction of compounds with highly conserved residues in COX-II active site.Newly synthesized compound 5e and 5i are found to be actively interacting with Arg-120 of COX-II. This Arg-120 is highly conserved among mammalian COX enzymes. For example, in bovine COX the fatty acids are all oriented in the COX channel in a way that guanidinium group of Arg-120 interact with carboxylate of the arachidonic acid (AA) substrate and its ω-end is inserted in hydrophobic cavity lined by Ser-530 such that carbon-13 of substrate is placed below Tyr-385 for proper catalytic proceeding of COX reaction (Garavito et al., 2002). Biochemical studies have already identified that interaction between Arg-120 and the carboxylate of the fatty acid substrate is fundamental requirement for COX reaction to occur (Malkowski et al., 2000; Bhattacharyya et al., 1996). In a crystal structure analysis of COX-II in complex with AA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) revealed the fact that these substrates can attain higher degree of conformational freedom within the active site owing to two reasons; first being larger volume of the COX-II channel and second reason being possibility of lack of interaction with Arg-120. These facts are held responsible for attaining productive or non productive conformation of these COX substrates (Vecchio et al., 2010). The same study also demonstrated that side chain of Arg-120 has differential conformation in positioning around AA and EPA substrates in COX-I as compared to COX-II. This fact can aid in design of COX-II specific therapeutic agent (Duggan et al., 2010). Another mechanism of AA and EPA induced productive conformation in cyclooxygenase channel of COX-II was proposed that centered on contact with Arg-120. According to this scheme, if side chain of Arg-120 loses contact with carboxylate of the substrate, this event might result in its dual ionic interaction with Glu-524 reinforced by a hydrogen bond finally stabilizing both side chains, ultimately leading to closure of COX channel entrance upon substrate binding (Vecchio et al., 2010). These facts clearly mark the importance of Arg-120 in catalysis of COX reaction. Additionally, Arg-120 is also actively involved in inhibitory effect of many reported drugs. For example, inhibitor flurbiprofen binds COX-II with its carboxylate moiety ion-paired to residues Arg-120 (Kurumbail et al., 1996; Picot et al., 1994). Mutagenesis experiment involving replacement of Arg-120 to alanine resulted in a complete loss of enzyme inhibition by naproxen. However, similar mutation of Arg-120 to more charged group like glutamine resulted in slight increased in the potency of inhibition by naproxin as IC50 values were reported to improve and a greater extent of inhibition was observed (Duggan et al., 2010). Crystallographic details of COX-II inhibition by the p-methylthio naproxen analog demonstrated that naproxen analog maintain the original binding conformation including the hydrogen-bonding interaction of its carboxylate group and Arg-120 (Duggan et al., 2010). Duggan and co workers on basis of their point mutagenesis data suspects that Arg-120 interacts with carboxylate group of naproxen by hydrogen bonding instead of ion-pairing interaction. On the contrary, Kurumbail et al. (1996) in their crystal structure analysis demonstrated that the carboxylate from flurbiprofen shares a salt bridge with the guanidinium group of Arg-120. These facts indicate that polar interaction at this structural position may be required for effective COX-II inhibition. Another study indicate that COX-II was found to be very sensitive to mutation at this site when inhibited by drug indomethacin concluding that its carboxylic acid group interact with Arg-120, furthermore interaction with Arg-120 plays a major role in binding of inhibitor piroxicam (Rowlinson et al., 2003). Compound 5i displayed one of the best binding free energy value of −11.62Kcal/mol among the series of compounds exactly coinciding with the experimentally observed% inhibition value (71.42% inhibitionby compound 5i compared to % inhibition of Celecoxib) Table 2. This observation is again supported by comparable in vivo percent inhibition of paw edema in rats by compound 5i (Table 3).The thiazole derivatives 5a, 5c, 5d and 5i synthesized in this study appear to make hydrophobic contact with His-90 and Gln-192 (Table 4). These two residues are part of an important side pocket of the COX active site which forms a major anchoring point that contributes to substrate and inhibitor binding. The potency and selectivity of diarylheterocyclic inhibitors that contain phenylsulfonamides or phenylsulfones scaffolds (e.g., SC 558) are in part determined by interactions with residues in this side pocket (Rowlinson et al., 2003). Hence, chloro-methyl, bis-chloro and mono-chloro substitutions on R and R′ position of compound 5a, 5c and 5d respectively my lead to lipophily mediated inhibition of COX-II.Thiazole compound 5h is observed to uniquely interact with residues Phe-205, Phe-209, Val-228 and Val-344. Interestingly, all of these residues are known to provide lipophilic stability to substrates since they line up the hydrophobic groove that supports the ω-end of AA and EPA at the opening of COX channel (Duggan et al., 2010). Similarly, Tyr-348 is also observed to interact inimitably with compound 5h. Tyr-348 holds a very key therapeutic position since it is located in the active site of COX-II; and secondly, point mutation by phenylalanine at this location is known to adversly affect acetylation of Ser-530 in case of inhibition by Asprin (Rowlinson et al., 2003). All these points clearly imply the possibility of involvement of residues like Phe-205, Phe-209, Val-228, Val-344 and Tyr-348 in thiazole based COX-II inhibition.All derivatives generated from thiazole scaffold are found to be in van der Waals distance of Val-349 and Leu-352 (Table 4). Val-349 is characterized to play pivotal role in COX-II inhibition by variety of inhibitors. For example, hydrophobic interaction of Val-349 with inhibitors like Naproxen is validated biochemically by performing series of mutagenesis experiments. It was observed that V349A mutant of COX-II has IC50 value of 3.5μM and showed 75% inhibition. When same position was replaced with bulkier hydrophobic group like isoleucine and leucine, a sharp increase in sensitivity was observed (IC50 value of 0.28 and 0.35μM respectively accompanying more than 95% inhibition). The increased inhibition in these mutants was attributed to increased hydrophobic interactions between the alpha-methyl group of inhibitor and residue at position 349 (Duggan et al., 2010). Crystallographic and biochemical kinetic data from Duggan et al. (2010) demonstrates that the (S)-alpha-methyl group of naproxen inserts into a small hydrophobic cleft below Val-349, which may serve to anchor naproxen within the COX-II active site and thereby reinforce the canonical binding orientation. In case of inhibitors lacking methyl group at alpha position, for example, indomethacin has an indolyl-2-methyl group at alpha position that inserts itself in lipophilic pocket above Val-349 to form a strong enzyme-inhibitor complex (Kurumbail et al., 1996; Prusakiewicz et al., 2004). Likewise, diclofenac is known to adopt an inverted orientation inserting chlorine atom present on its lower dichlorophenyl group deep into the lipophilic cavity on top of Val-349 (Rowlinson et al., 2003). Naproxen makes lipophily mediated contacts with Leu-352 via its naphthyl backbone. Unusually, the side chain of Leu-352 is known to possess multiple rotamer states that are observed in complex with flurbiprofen, indomethacin, and diclofenac (Duggan et al., 2010). Leu-352 is observed to attain differential side chain conformation when it is present in vicinity of naproxen and para-methylthio naproxen analog. However, structural reasoning behind the rotation of the residue in the presence of naproxen or its total loss to rotate in company of the methylthio derivative still remains elusive. Additionally, crystallographic data of Rowlinson et al. (2003) suggest that side chain of Leu-352 surround the phenyl group attached to acetic acid moiety of diclofenac, thus providing hydrophobic support in stabilization of COX-II-diclofenac complex. Therefore, it can be convincingly predicted that residues like Val-349 and Leu-352 might involve in inhibitory activity of COX-II via present thiazol compounds.Molecular docking results from this study indicate that all of the synthesized thiazole derivatives form contact (either polar or hydrophobic) with conserved residue Tyr-355 (Table 4). For example compound 5e and 5i are observed to make hydrogen bond using oxygen atom from central methylene-pyrazolone moiety with terminal OH oxygen atom from side chain of Tyr-355 (Fig. 2).Interestingly, the similar hydrogen bonding interaction of the carboxylate oxygen O1 of AA and EPA with the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr-355 (known to stabilize productive conformation within the cyclooxygenase channel of COX-II) is reported by Vecchio et al. (2010); indicating a very crucial role played by this residue in catalysis of COX reaction. Tyr-355 plays its structural role in inhibition via indomethacin by interacting with carboxylate group of this inhibitor (Rowlinson et al., 2003). Tyr-355 side chain is demonstrated to be important in binding the carboxylate of arachidonate and hence this position is more sensitive to inhibition by competitive inhibitors. This residue is reported to have a major role in binding of piroxicam to COX-II active site. Tyr-355 lies just at junction of anchoring site near the membrane interface of COX-II (Bhattacharyya et al., 1996). Hence, this residue is known to drive the affinity of inhibitors such as flurbiprofen and indomethacin. Mutagenesis at this position by phenylalanine greatly reduced potency of inhibitors like arylcarboxylic acids, indomethacin and meclofenamic acid (Kurumbail et al., 1996; Mancini et al., 1995; Greig et al., 1997). Furthermore, biochemical mutagenesis data on replacement of Tyr-355 to phenylalanine resulted in complete abrogation of inhibition by naproxen (Duggan et al., 2010). Crystallographic inhibition study of COX-II by flurbiprofen demonstrated that it binds with usual conformation allowing its carboxylate moiety to make hydrogen-bonding contact to the residues Tyr-355 thus playing an imperative role in inhibitory activity (Duggan et al., 2010). Plethora of literature has accumulated suggesting that unfavorable steric interactions with Tyr-355 might be responsible for the stringent stereoselectivity of the 2-arylpropionic acid class of COX-II inhibitors (Bhattacharyya et al., 1996; Picot et al., 2004; Loll et al., 1996). All these evidences clearly entail the possibility of involvement of Tyr-355 in thiazol based COX-II inhibition.All the novel thiazol compounds are observed to actively interact with Leu-359 while compound 5a, 5e and 5h share hydrophobic contact with Phe-381 and derivative 5a, 5c, 5d, 5i forms van der Waals contact with Leu-384. Lipophilic interaction of (S)-α-methyl group of the p-methylthio naproxen analog with Leu-359 is known to stabilize inhibitor-enzyme complex, while same hydrophobic contact is known to stabilize COX-II-flurbiprofen complex (Duggan et al., 2010; Kurumbail et al., 1996). Phe-381 is known to provide lipophilic stability to COX substrate, since it is a major constituent of the hydrophobic groove that supports the ω-end of AA (Vecchio et al., 2010); on the other hand, side chain of Leu-384 surround the phenyl group attached to the acetic acid moiety of diclofenac, thus might play a role in inhibition (Rowlinson et al., 2003). All these observations indicate the possibility that thiazol compounds might have interacted with Leu-359, Phe-381 and Leu-384 in observed COX-II inhibition.Compound 5a, 5e and 5h from the test panel described here are found to be interacting via hydrophobic contacts with residue Tyr-385. In catalytic context, the phenolic oxygen of Tyr-385 is known to participate in abstraction of the 13-pro-S hydrogen from AA and EPA substrates which is demonstrated as crucial event in initiation of the COX reaction (Malkowski et al., 2000). Moreover, interaction with Tyr-385 has been demonstrated to be of critical interest since it helps in proper orientation of AA within the COX active site and lead to formation of PGG2 (Thuresson et al., 2000). Tyr-385 is already characterized to play an imperative role in inhibition of COX-II via drug diclofenac by imparting stability to COX-II-diclofenac complex through forming a hydrogen bond via carboxylic acid portion of inhibitor (Malkowski et al., 2000). Naproxen and its p-methoxy group is known to align against the apex of the COX catalytic cavity forming van der Waals contact with Tyr-385, whereas methylthio substituent at the 6-position of the p-methylthio naproxen analog contacts Tyr-385 for inhibition process (Duggan et al., 2010). Tyr-385 is known to serve in chelation of carboxylate moiety of many reported NSAIDs (Kiefer et al., 2000). Thus, chloro and methyl substitution in case of compound 5a along with H and chloro substituents from comound 5e and chloro and methoxy substituents of compound 5h at R and R′ position might have played an important contribution in present COX-II inhibition.Molecular docking investigation data also points out that all compounds but 5e dynamically interacts with Trp-387. Crystal structure of COX-II complexed with naproxin demonstrates that p-methoxy group of naproxen makes a van der Waals contact with the side chain of Trp-387. Inevitable role of this residue was demonstrated in a mutagenesis experiment wherein W387F mutant resulted into reduced COX catalytic activity as well as inhibitory effect. This mutant form resulted in lower yield of PGG2 simultaneously elevating levels of uncyclized product, 11-hydroxy eicosatetraenoic acid (Thuresson et al., 2000) and carried out only 25% inhibition in case of naproxen (Duggan et al., 2010). Moreover, other inhibitors like Diclofenac and indomethacin also exert their inhibitory effect via interaction with Trp-387, while Flurbiprofen is characterized to form interactions with the Trp-387 residue via its phenyl ring (Kurumbail et al., 1996; Rowlinson et al., 2003). From the above points it becomes clear that experimental COX inhibitory data obtained from present thiazol compounds might be due to interaction with Tyr-385 and Trp-387.All of the synthesized thiazol derivatives seem to make hydrophobic interaction with Val-523. Hydrophobic environment at Val-523 position is believed to hold a key catalytic property. Active site of COX-1 has bulkier isoleucine at this position (Kurumbail et al., 1996). Natural replacement of smaller valine at this position increased the volume of COX-II active site by about 20% associating with increased efficiency of COX-II to oxygenate extensive number of substrates as compared to COX-I. Due to increased size in volume, COX-II can now accommodate and oxygenate larger substrates than AA like endocannabinoids 2-arachidonyl glycerol, arachidonyl ethanolamide, and N-arachidonyl glycine, utilizing the same general catalytic mechanism derived for AA (Kozak et al., 2000, 2001; Prusakiewicz et al., 2002).Crystallographic data on COX-II bound to p-methylthio naproxen analog clearly indicates that Val-523 hydrophobically interact with the proximal ring of the napthyl backbone of the inhibitor (Duggan et al., 2010). Mutagenesis study on human COX-II by prostaglandin E2 ELISA test demonstrates that mutating Val-523 to isoleucine significantly curtail the selectivity profile of highly selective COX-II inhibitors like celecoxib and rofecoxib (Gierse et al., 1996). Structural explanation for this effect can be persuasively clarified by the fact that steric interactions at upper part of catalytic site may result in increased pressure on Val-523, that is located at bottom of active site where inhibition occur. This effect would be more difficult to occur if valine is replaced by bulkier isoleucine (Duggan et al., 2010).An arylsulfonamide based drug Nimesulide is known to possess moderate COX-II selectivity and it implicitly binds to the side pocket lined by Val-523. Mutagenesis data of Guo et al. (1996) clearly demonstrates that replacement of this residue with glutamate, isoleucine, lysine or alanine eliminates time-dependent inhibition and drastically reduces the inhibitory effectiveness of nimesulide. Diarylheterocycle inhibitors insert their sulfonamide or sulfone groups into a side pocket bordered by Val-523 (Rowlinson et al., 2003) thus, playing major role in COX-II inhibition.Thiazole substituted derivatives 5a, 5d, 5e and 5i are observed to make contact with Met-522, while all compounds except 5h are known to hydrophobically interact with Gly-526 and Ala-527. The aromatic ring of diclofenac is known to make contact with the main chain atoms of Met-522, Gly-526, and Ala-527; hence these residues acquire an important position in inhibition of COX-II (Malkowski et al., 2000; Mancini et al., 1995). Ala-527 and Gly-526 are characterised to play a decisive role in inhibition of COX-II by naproxen by stabilizing the COX-inhibitor complex by providing hydrophobic contact support (Duggan et al., 2010). These evidences support the involvement of Met-522, Gly-526, and Ala-527 in thiazole based COX-II inhibition data reported in this study.According to Table 4 all the novel thiazole derivatives makes a contact with conserved Ser-530 residue. Compound 5h seems to be engaged in hydrogen bond via its side chain hydroxyl group with oxygen atom on central methylene-pyrazolone moiety (Fig. 2). Ser-530 residue is previously characterized to possess utmost catalytic significance. Ser-530 is involved in proper placing of C-13 of AA and EPA below the phenolic oxygen of Tyr-385 for abstraction of the 13-pro-S hydrogen necessary for COX reaction to occur (as explained in earlier section) (Vecchio et al., 2010). A virtual abolishment of COX-II inhibition by two clinically important NSAIDs (diclofenac and piroxicam) was observed in a site directed mutagenesis experiment of Ser-530 to alanine. This fact was also accompanied by elimination of time-dependent inhibition by nimesulide. Another mutagenesis study carried on human COX-II in which serine was replaced by methionine at 530 position demonstrated greater than 420 fold increase in IC50 value for drug diclofenac as compared to unmutated enzyme (Mancini et al., 1997). This fact thus verified that diclofenac binds in very close propinquity of Ser-530. Chelation of electron-rich centers in case of Ser-530 is believed to be of critical importance for successful acetylation of COX-II by Asprin; moreover, it also affects diclofenac’s non-covalent, time dependent inhibition (Rowlinson et al., 2003). The observed fact that S530A mutant is neither inhibited by piroxicam nor is susceptible to time-dependent inhibition by nimesulide thus indicate its important role in binding and inhibition not only by nimesulide but also piroxicam (Rowlinson et al., 2003). Additionally, it was also reported that S530A mutant abrogate time-dependent inhibition but successfully maintain competitive inhibition implying the fact that nimesulide interacts with Ser-530 leading to time-dependent inhibition (Rowlinson et al., 2003).Compound 5h is also one of the top scorers in terms of binding free energy value (−10.31Kcal/mol) obtained from molecular docking experiment. This in silico observation is in accordance with obtained in vitro COX inhibition data (78.91% inhibition) exactly accompanied by 92.85% of inhibition of paw edema at 180min interval (as observed from in vivo experiment). These readings indicates that compound 5h as enormous potential to be successfully utilized as lead compound for further drug development process.Table 4 clearly demonstrates that all the synthesized compounds in this study participate in interaction with residue Leu-531. Kiefer et al. (2000) suspected that Leu-531 might have critical role in catalysis as their crystallographic analysis showed involvement of Leu-531 in defining non-productive/inhibitory or productive conformation of substrate. This fact was later on confirmed and structurally explained by Vecchio et al. (2010). Their crystallographic data additionally demonstrated that the mobility of the Leu-531 side chain increases the volume available at the opening of the COX channel and contributes to the observed ability of COX-II to oxygenate a broad spectrum of fatty acid and fatty ester substrates. The dichlorophenyl group of diclofenac forms van der Waals interactions with Leu-531, also demonstrating a critical part in inhibition of COX-II. Thus, interaction of Leu-531 too might have played a role in inhibition of COX-II by present thiazol compounds.Interestingly, it is to be noted that, compound 5c demonstrated comparatively lower in vitro COX inhibition potential but scored high binding free energy value in docking study. Such anomalies in docking readings and observed experimental findings can be attributed to the limitations of currently employed docking and scoring functions and reduced ability of the currently employed docking software to fully consider the conformational flexibility in receptor systems (Ohno et al., 2011). However, present docking algorithm successfully provide an overall estimate of binding interactions between the newly synthesized thiazole compounds and residues at the active site of COX-II target protein.Phenacyl bromide (1mmol), thiosemicarbazide (1mmol), and ethylacetoacetate(1mmol) were taken in acetic acid (10mL), heated at 60–80°C for about 2–3h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and then sodium acetate (2mmol) and heteroaldehyde (1.2mmol) were added and heated at 80–85°C for about 2h. The product obtained was cooled, filtered, washed with water and recrystallized from acetic acid.Yellow powder; mp; 272–274°C; IR (KBr, cm−1): 3076 (ArCH stretching), 3030 (ArCH stretching), 2990 (CH stretching), 1677 (CO stretching), 1602 (CN stretching), 754 (CCl stretching);

The reaction mixture of 100% initial activity wells contained 160μl of assay buffer, 150μl of haem and 10μl of COX-I or COX-II enzyme solutions. While the reaction mixture of inhibitor wells was comprised of 150μl of assay buffer, 10μl of haem and 10μl of either enzyme COX-I or COX-II, 10μl of the test samples (1mM). The plates were carefully shaken for 5minutes and were incubated for another 5minutes at 25°C. After 5min incubation, 20μl of the colorimetric substrate solution was added to all the wells, followed by the addition of 20μl of arachidonic acid to all the wells. The plates were shaken gently for a few seconds and again incubated for 5min at 25°C. The absorbance of all the wells was read at 590nm using Thermo make Automatic Ex-Microplate Reader (M 51118170). Aspirin (1mM) were tested simultaneously as standard inhibitors. The COX inhibition activity (%) was calculated using following formula:COX inhibition activity(%)=1−TC×100where T is the absorbance of the inhibitor well at 590nM, C is the absorbance of the 100% initial activity without inhibitor well at 590nM.Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 100–150g were used in the present study. The experimental animals were maintained under standard laboratory conditions in an animal house of Nanded Pharmacy College approved by the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision on Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA: Reg No. 1613/po/a/12/CPCSEA) under 12h light/dark cycle and controlled temperature (24±2°C) and fed with commercial pellet diet and water ad libitum. All animals were acclimatized to the laboratory environment for at least one week before the commencement of experiment. The experimental protocol for the study was followed as per the norms of Institutional Animal Ethics Committee.The anti-inflammatory activity of the standard drug diclofenac and synthesized compounds was determined against Carrageenan induced acute paw edema in albino rats (100–150g). The 1% (w/v) solution of Carrageenan for injection was prepared in normal saline (0.9% NaCl) and 0.1ml was injected underneath planter region. The dose of standard drug and synthesized compounds, administered in animals was 20mg/kg, by oral route using oral feeding tube through tuberculin syringe. The stock suspensions of standard and synthesized compound were prepared in concentration of 10mg/ml of 2% w/v CMC in distilled water. An either sex of rats were fasted with free access to water at least 16h. The rats were divided in to seven groups each consisting six rats of either sex; as given below.1.Group A: Control; received 0.1ml suspension of 1% Carrageenan.Group B: Standard; received Diclofenac sodium 20mg/kg i.p. route.Group C: Test 5a; received 20mg/kg body weight of test compound in DMSO by i.p. route.Group D: Test 5c; received 20mg/kg body weight of test compound in DMSO by i.p. route.Group E: Test 5d; received 20mg/kg body weight of test compound in DMSO by i.p. route.Group F: Test 5e; received 20mg/kg body weight of test compound in DMSO by i.p. route.Group G: Test 5h; received 20mg/kg body weight of test compound in DMSO by i.p. route.Group H: Test 5i; received 20mg/kg body weight of test compound in DMSO by i.p. route.Edema was induced in each rat by injecting 0.1ml suspension of 1% Carrageenan in to the sub planter surface of the right hind paw. Test and standard groups receives respectively test and standard compound one hour before injecting Carrageenan. Paw volume of foot was measured using Plethysmometer (PLM-01, Orchid Scientifics) before Carrageenan administration and at 0, 30, 60, 120, 150 and 180min after Carrageenan administration. The mean of paw volume (ml) in each group was measured and the percentage inhibition/protection was calculated by the following equation.%inhibition=(Vt−Vo)Control−(Vt−Vo)test×100(Vt−Vo)Controlwhere Vt: paw volume at given time‘t’; Vo: paw volume at predose time.Molecular docking was performed using protocol described earlier by Kadam et al. (2014) and Gond et al. (2013).2D structures of all thiazole compounds were drawn in ChemDraw® 8.0 (Cambridge Soft, Cambridge, MA, USA) and their SMILES were obtained. Subsequent to this step, FROG2 server (Miteva et al., 2010) was employed to generate 3D conformers of these compounds in sdf format. For molecular docking analysis, AutoDock 4.2 (Huey et al., 2007; Morris et al., 1998) implemented in Python Prescription 0.8 (PyRx) was used. Open Babel utility in PyRx environment was employed to import ligand molecules in sdf format for subsequent energy minimization procedure using UFF forcefield (Casewit et al., 1992; Rappe et al., 1992, 1993). Before converting all the molecules to AutoDock readable pdbqt format, these molecules were minimized for over 200 steps applying conjugate gradient optimization algorithm, updating the molecules at every step.Structural model of COX-II in complex with Naproxen with PDB ID 3NT1 (Berman et al., 2000) was downloaded from Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org). This dimeric structural model of COX-II contains two identical monomers that were individually co-crystallized with solvent molecules, inhibitor Naproxen along with prosthetic group like Protoporphyrin IX containing Fe (Hemering), two co-factors in form of chloride ion and other crystallographic artefact like B-Octylglucoside and a few N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (NAG) molecules. COX-II is reported to be functionally active in monomeric state (Rouzer and Marnett, 2009), hence all the docking studies were carried out on single monomer. Since none of these prosthetic group or co-factors are directly involved in inhibition (Blobaum and Marnett, 2007), these were subject to removal prior to docking investigation. Receptor molecule was prepared in traditional pdbqt format after assigning charges to the receptor coordinate file by using ‘Make macromolecule’ command from AutoDock menu of PyRx.The validity of a docking system can be checked by testing the ability of a docking program to reproduce the experimental binding mode of a ligand. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) value of the predicted poses to experimentally verified pose is calculated following docking experiment. As RMSD value indicates the measure of spatial similarity between two structures, the prediction of binding mode is considered as successful if the RMSD value is typically found to be less than 2.00Å (Azizian et al., 2010). To obtain grid file, Auto-grid program was utilized. In order to cover entire active site, the affinity grid of 50×50×50 points was set using spacing of 0.375Å. The conformational search for obtaining optimal binding pose was carried out using the lamarckian genetic algorithm. Each lamarckian job was set to have 10 runs, restricting the initial population to 150 structures. The maximum number of energy evaluation and generation were set to 27,000. Single top individual was allowed to survive to next generation, rate of gene mutation and crossover was set to 0.02 and 0.8 respectively; the rest of parameters were set to default values. The final structures were clustered according to native autodock scoring function. The top ranked conformations of each ligand were selected. RMSD value of 0.36Å was obtained from the docking experiment of crystallographic ligand NPS analog back in inhibitor binding site of COX-II. This value indicates that predicted binding mode is nearly identical to the X-ray crystallography conformer (Supplementary Fig. 1), there by validating the docking system. Same set of parameters were used for virtual screening of synthesized compounds.PyMOL v0.99 (http://www.pymol.org) was utilized to visualize the resulting docked complexes and to render the images. Detailed interactions of thiazol compounds with COX-II were inferred from a JAVA based GUI of LigPlot program called LigPlot+ (Laskowski and Swindells, 2011; Wallace et al., 1995).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
To conclude our discussion, we hereby report effective synthesis of thiazole bearing pyrazole derivatives. Data obtained from in vitro anti-inflammatory screening assays of screened compounds, compound 5d, 5h and 5i demonstrated potent COX-II inhibitory activity. The in vivo results demonstrated compound 5h was found to be potent inhibitor of the carrageenin induced paw edema in rats. Results obtained from docking experiment are in perfect agreement with experimental in vitro readings of this study and previously described crystallographic data. Structural analysis of docked complexes revealed the interaction of highly conserved residues like Arg-120, Tyr-348, Val-349, Leu-352, Tyr-355, Tyr-385, Trp-387, Val-523 and Ser-530 to affect thiazol mediated COX-II inhibition. In short, the in vitro and in vivo biological assay data in light of molecular docking analysis reveals compound 5d, 5h and 5i as lead molecules for further development as effective anti-inflammatory agents.
