@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In the present work, a novel hybrid FE-Meshless quadrilateral element with continuous nodal stress is developed using radial-polynomial basis functions, named as Quad4-RPIMcns. Quad4-RPIMcns can be regarded as the development of the previous FE-Meshless quadrilateral element with radial-polynomial basis functions (Quad4-RPIM) and quadrilateral element with continuous nodal stress (Quad4-CNS). Similar to Quad4-RPIM, radial-polynomial basis functions are used to construct nodal approximations of Quad4-RPIMcns in the context of partition of unity, which avoids the possible singularity problem of constructing nodal approximations. The derivative of Quad4-RPIMcns shape function is continuous at nodes. Therefore, nodal stress can be obtained without any extra operation. Quad4-RPIMcns possesses Kronecker-delta property which is a very important property to impose essential boundary conditions directly as in the FEM. The numerical tests in this paper demonstrate that Quad4-RPIMcns gives better accuracy and higher convergence rate as compared to four-node iso-parametric quadrilateral element (Quad4). Additionally, Quad4-RPIMcns seems to have higher tolerance to mesh distortion than Quad4.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Due to the limitations of the human mind, it is difficult to grasp a complex system׳s behavior in one operation, thus finite element method (FEM) is implemented [76], which subdivides the system into individuals. The early concept of finite element was introduced by Turner [65]. Now FEM has became a well-established and powerful numerical procedure which is widely used by engineers in various fields, such as mining engineering [50,60,61] and surgery simulation [47]. Despite the obvious attractive advantages of FEM, significant drawbacks are well known as time-consuming and expensive task for mesh generation. Additionally, three-node triangular element (Trig3) produces lower accuracy due to the use of the low order of trial functions [15]. It is also well known that both Trig3 and four-node iso-parametric quadrilateral element (Quad4) are sensitive to the quality of meshes. However, it is difficult to avoid distorted meshes in many fields, such as the simulation of fracture propagation which requires numerous remeshing tasks [4,58].Due to these limitations, numerous approaches have been explored to improve FEM. As a results Meshless method as one sparking point among these promising approaches stands out. The Meshless method was first proposed by Lucy [40] to simulate astronomic phenomena, which was named as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Furthermore, a class of methods, which use moving least square approximations in the Galerkin weak form to construct the approximations, has been developed, including diffuse element method (DEM) [43] and element-free Galerkin method (EFG) [4,5]. This class of methods is consistent and stable, although their computational cost is more expensive than SPH [5]. By eliminating the mesh limitation, meshless method is significantly useful to solve the large deformation problems [12], simulate fracture propagation [51,8] and impact-induced failure [54].As a development of Meshless method, reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) [38] advanced at flexible time-frequency and space-wave number localization of window function. In Meshless Local Petrov–Galerkin method (MLPG) [1], weak form interpolation is carried out without the background cells, which also has high rate of convergence [48] and does not require meshes for trial functions and test functions. But the advantages of Meshless methods do not come without any cost. Technical problems are encountered for solid mechanics structure, such as the essential boundary conditions implementation handicap, because Kronecker-delta property may not always be possessed by Meshless methods.To capture essential boundary conditions, several methods are developed, including point interpolation method (PIM) [35], Lagrange multiplier method [39], penalty method [75], modified variational principles [5], perturbed Lagrangian [14] and coupling to finite elements [52]. In PIM [35], the Kronecker-delta property is ensured, thus essential boundary conditions are imposed through a straightforward and effective way. However, because pure polynomial basis functions are used to construct nodal approximation, the singularity problem of constructing nodal approximation appears when the nodes arrangement does not cooperate consistently with polynomial basis functions [35,66]. In order to overcome the shortcoming of PIM, a radial point interpolation method (RPIM) is introduced [27,29,66,28,34,73]. The main idea of RPIM was to map multi-dimensional space into one-dimensional space in terms of radial functions, which makes the selection procedure of basis functions become much more convenient [66]. The forms of radial basis functions can vary, including multi-quadrics (MQ) [22], reciprocal multi-quadrics (RMQ) [17], Gaussians (Exp) [70,18] and thin-plate splines (TPS) [18].During the last two decades, the partition of unity method (PUM) [2,11] has been developed and applied in many fields successfully, including solid mechanics [16], fluid mechanics [20] and heat transfer [49,42]. The concept of PUM is used to develop the hp clouds [48], generalized finite element method (GFEM) [56], particle–partition of unity method [55], numerical manifold method [9,10,71] and extended finite element method [6]. Furthermore, PUM provides a convenient approach to construct higher order global approximations without adding external nodes, thereby achieving higher accuracy and convergence rate [69].Recently, a family of smoothed finite element methods (S-FEMs) [36,45] relying on the strain smoothing technique [13] has been developed for a wide range of practical problems [30]. There are four ways of creating the smoothing domains to establish different S-FEM models: cell-based S-FEM (CS-FEM) [30], node-based S-FEM (NS-FEM) [46], edge-based S-FEM (ES-FEM) [37,7,74], and face-based S-FEM (FS-FEM) [44]. Since SFEM is able to provide an upper bound solution for solid mechanics problems [73,45], it is complementary to the solution of FEM. Furthermore, Thai-Hoang et al. [62] used a discrete shear gap technique to develop an alpha finite element method, which significantly improves the accuracy of FEM solution.Alternatively, hybrid FE-Meshless methods [53] are developed to synthesize the advantages of FEM and Meshless method. FE-Meshless methods are able to simplify the implementation of essential boundary conditions. Shape functions of FE-Meshless methods possess both inherit inter-element compatibility and higher order of global approximation. By inheriting the advantages of Meshless method, FE-Meshless methods are able to achieve better accuracy and faster convergence rate, compared to four-node iso-parametric quadrilateral element (Quad4) [53] and three-node triangle element (Trig3) [72]. However, FE-Meshless methods, which use pure polynomial basis functions to construct nodal approximations, also suffer from the singularity problem of constructing nodal approximation [27,69]. In order to avoid the singularity problem, radial basis functions introduced by [27] are used to construct nodal approximation in the context of hybrid FE-Meshless methods. Another development of hybrid FE-Meshless methods can be found in Ref. [59], in which nodal smoothing technology is used to obtain continuous stress field at nodes on quadrilateral mesh, named as Quad4-CNS. Then, a FE-Meshless method with continuous nodal stress on triangular mesh is developed by Yang et al. [72], which is named as Trig3-CNS.The present method can be regarded as the development of FE-Meshless methods with radial basis functions [69] and Quad4-CNS [59]. In the present method, radial-polynomial basis functions [27] are used to construct the nodal approximations in the context of partition of unity, in order to avoid the singularity problem of constructing nodal approximation on arbitrary scattered nodes. Additionally, the weight functions which have been successfully used in Quad4-CNS [59], are used to ensure the smoothness of stress field at nodes. The present work is restricted on quadrilateral elements and is named as Quad4-RPIMcns.The outline of this paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the partition of unity method (PUM); Section 3 presents the formulation of Quad4-RPIMcns in great detail, and some important properties of Quad4-RPIMcns are shown. The Galerkin weak form of two-dimensional solid mechanics problem is expressed in Section 4. Numerical tests are discussed in section 5 and some conclusions are drawn in the last section.Partition of unity method (PUM) provides an available approach to increase the order of global approximation without adding extra nodes [41]. The approximation of PUM is constructed using a set of weight functions and nodal approximations. The summation of weight functions is equal to one:(1)∑i=1nwi(x)≡1wherex=(x,y)represents the coordinates of an arbitrary point, n is the total number of the nodes in the computational domain V. The global approximationu(x,y)can be expressed in the following form:(2)uh(x)=∑i=1nwi(x)ui(x)whereui(x)is the nodal approximation associated to the node i. Various selections for weight functions are available in PUM, such as shape function of Quad4 [69] and smoothed weight function of Trig3-CNS [72]. The forms of nodal approximations are also various, including least-squares method [53] and orthogonalization least-squares method (CO-LS) [58]. In the present work, the weight functions presented in Ref. [59] is used to construct weight functions and the radial-polynomial basis functions used in RPIM [27] are selected to construct the nodal approximation.The present Quad4-RPIMcns is a development of Quad4-RPIM [69]. In order to get rid of the possible singularity of constructing nodal approximations , the radial-polynomial basis functions are explored in the least-square version of point interpolation [27].Firstly, for node i, the nodal support (or node patch) which includes the nodes of all elements connected node i is defined byΩi, as shown in Fig. 1. Here, node i is called central node, and other nodes in domainΩiare called satellite nodes. The element support domainΩ^is the union of the four node patchesΩ^=⋃i=14Ωias shown in Fig. 2.Considering a quadrilateral domainΩdescribed by four nodes{P1P2P3P4}, Quad4-RPIMcns global approximationuh(x)can be represented in the following form:(3)uh(x)=∑i=14wi(x)ui(x)=w1(x)u1(x)+w2(x)u2(x)+w3(x)u3(x)+w4(x)u4(x)wherewi(x)andui(x)are the weight functions and the nodal approximations associated with node i respectively.The weight functions{w1(x)w2(x)w3(x)w4(x)}with the global Cartesian coordinates are mapped from ’parent’ weight functions in the local coordinates [59]. The formulations for coordinate transformation are represented as(4)x=N˜1(ξ,η)(x1)+N˜2(ξ,η)(x2)+N˜3(ξ,η)(x3)+N˜4(ξ,η)(x4)(5)y=N˜1(ξ,η)(y1)+N˜2(ξ,η)(y2)+N˜3(ξ,η)(y3)+N˜4(ξ,η)(y4)whereN˜1(ξ,η),N˜2(ξ,η),N˜3(ξ,η),N˜4(ξ,η)are expressed in the following form:(6)N˜i(ξ,η)=(1+ξ0)(1+η0)/4,ξ0=ξiξ,η0=ηiη,i=1,2,3,4.Similar to the construction of the ‘non-conforming’ shape function for the rectangular element in the thin plate theory [76], the weight functions are written as [59](7)wi(ξ,η)=(1+ξ0)(1+η0)(2+ξ0+η0−ξ2−η2)/8,i=1,2,3,4.The weight functions of Quad4-RPIMcns have three features: (i) they satisfy the PUM condition:∑i=14wi(ξ,η)=1, (ii) the weight functions satisfy the Kronecker-delta propertywi(xj)=δij(i,j=1,2,3), (iii) the gradient of the weight functions is continuous over all the nodes:(8)[∂wi(ξj,ηj)∂ξ∂wi(ξj,ηj)∂η]T=0,i,j=1,2,3,4.Various selections have been proposed to construct nodal approximations with the Kronecker-delta property, such as LSPIM [53] and the reduced CO-MLS (CO-LS) [57,72], radial functions method [35,68]. Here, the radial-polynomial basis functions, introduced in Liu and Gu [27], are used to construct the nodal approximation of Quad4-RPIMcns.Using RPIM, the nodal approximation functionsui(x,y)can be represented as [27](9)ui(x,y)=∑j=1n[i]rj(x,y)aj+∑k=1Mpk(x,y)bk=r(x,y)a+p(x,y)bwhere M represents the number of polynomial terms andn[i]is the number of nodes in the domain Ωi.aandbare vectors yet to be determined.p(x,y)andr(x,y)represent for polynomial and radial basis functions respectively. In a six polynomial terms,p(x,y)can be expressed as(10)p(x,y)=[1xyx2xyy2]When considering three or four polynomial terms,p(x,y)are expressed asp(x,y)=[1xy]orp(x,y)=[1xyxy]. Then the radial basis function vectorr(x,y)is expressed as [27](11)r(x,y)=[r1(x,y)r2(x,y)⋯rn[i](x,y)]where the expressions ofri(x,y)are available in several forms [29]. For the present Quad4-RPIMcns, the multi-quadrics (MQ) [22,23] radial basis function is adopted and expressed as [27,29](12)ri(x,y)=(dj2+c)qwheredj=(x−yj)2+(y−yj)2, c and q are two parameters yet to be specified.The choice and effect of numerical values of the parameters c and q have already been studied by Kansa [24,25] and Liu and Gu [27] and Xu and Rajendran [68] in detail. In the present Quad4-RPIMcns, the best parameter combination, which had been proposed by Xu and Rajendran for Quad4-RPIM [68] with c=0.0001 and q=2.01, is adopted.Enforcing Eq. (9) to pass through all the nodes in domainΩi, the following equations are obtained:(13)ui=Ra+Pbwhereuiis a vector of corresponding nodal displacement of all the nodes in domain Ωi, the related matrixRandPare expressed as [27,29](14)R=[r1(x1,y1)r2(x1,y1)⋯rn[i](x1,y1)r1(x2,y2)r2(x2,y2)⋯rn[i](x2,y2)⋯⋯⋯⋯r1(xn[i],yn[i])r2(xn[i],yn[i])⋯rn[i](xn[i],yn[i])](15)P=[1x1y1x12x1y1y121x2y2x22x2y2y22⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮1xn[i]yn[i]xn[i]2xn[i]yn[i]yn[i]2](M=6,sosixcolumns)Obviously, there are totally (n[i]+M) parameters in Eq. (13). However, onlyn[i]equations are available. Nevertheless, according to the work finished by Liu and Gu [27] and Golberg et al. [19], vectors ofaandbcan be eliminated as proposed in their work and nodal approximation function in Eq. (9) is eventually expressed as [27](16)ui(x,y)=Φiui,i=1,2,3,4,Φi=r(x,y)Sa+p(x,y)Sbwhere(17)Φi=[Φ1iΦ2iΦ3i⋯Φn[i]i](18)ui=[u1u2u3⋯un[i]]T(19){Sb=[PTR−1P]−1PTR−1,Sa=R−1[I−PSb],a=Saui,b=Sbui.Wendland [67] gives the evident of the existence ofR−1for any scattered nodes.In defining the support of a given node, the first order nodal connectivity which includes the nodes of all the elements connected to the given node is usually considered. Such a support is called first order support. However, sometimes, as discussed in Xu and Rajendran [68], the first order support may not contain sufficient number of nodes. For example, any of the corner nodes of the mesh in Fig. 1(b) has only four nodes in the first order support. Four nodes are not sufficient to accommodate a quadratic polynomial basis that has six terms in the basis (see Eq. (10)). At least, six nodes are needed for the purpose. In such cases, a bigger support is defined based on the second order nodal connectivity by including the nodes of all the elements connected to the nodes in the first order support. Such a support is called second order support. In the present work, only three or four polynomial terms are considered and first order support is sufficient for the purpose [68].In Liu and Gu [27], a circular or rectangular shaped domain is used and the fields nodes locate inside are chosen for the construction of approximation. In the present paper, the nodal approximation is constructed by using the nodes in the first order nodal connectivity and this is the mainly difference between Liu׳s RPIM [27] and the RPIM adopted in the present work. Moreover, several schemes to select nodes for the construction of approximation based on three-node triangular background cells have been discussed in detail in Liu and Zhang [31] and Liu et al. [33].The Quad4-RPIMcns global approximationuh(x)can be represented in a common form:(20)uh(x)=∑i=1Nϕi(x)aiin whichϕi(x)is the shape function corresponding to the node i. N is the total number of nodes in domainΩ^. Substitution of Eq. (16) into Eq. (3), and then the Quad4-RPIMcns global approximationuh(x)can be constructed as(21)uh(x)=∑i=14wi(x)∑j=1n[i]Φj[i](x)aj[i]wheren[i]is the number of the supporting nodes for the construction of nodal approximation functionui(x). By manipulating Eq. (21), the shape function of Quad4-RPIMcns in Eq. (20) is reconstructed in the following way:(22)ϕi(x)=∑j=14wj(x)Φi[j](x).Some useful properties of Quad4-RPIMcns are shown as follows:(i)The derivatives of weight function are of zero value at the nodes, which is already discussed in Ref. [59].The derivatives of Quad4-RPIMcns global approximation are continuous at the nodes.Based on Eq. (3), the derivatives ofuh(x)can be represented as(23){u,xh(x)=∑i=14(wi,x(x)ui(x)+wi(x)ui,x(x))u,yh(x)=∑i=14(wi,y(x)ui(x)+wi(x)ui,y(x))Consider a pointP(xj)at node j with coordinatesxj(xj,yj), the following equations are obtained:(24)wi(xj)={1(j=i),0(j≠i),wi,x(xj)=0,wi,y(xj)=0,i,j=1,2,3,4.Substitution of Eq. (24) into Eq. (23) yields(25)u,xh(xj)=ui,x(xi),u,yh(xj)=ui,y(xi).Therefore,u,xh(x)andu,yh(x)are continuous at nodes and is equal to the derivative of the nodal approximations.(iii)The Kronecker-delta property.(26)ϕi(xj)=δijConsider a 2D solid mechanics problem defined in domain V and bounded byΓ(Γ=Γt+Γu), and then the standard Galerkin weak form for this problem can be expressed as(27)∫V(∇δu)T(D∇u)dΩ−∫VδuTb¯dΩ−∫ΓtδuTt¯dΩ=0whereDstands for the material constants matrix, ∇ represents the differential operator, and defined as(28)∇=[∂∂x0∂∂y0∂∂y∂∂x]Tb¯=[bx,by]Tis the body force vector,t¯is the prescribed traction on natural boundaries.By discretizing the domain V into a set of non-overlapping quadrilateral domainV=⋃i=1NVi, and substituting the approximation function into Eq. (27), then the system of equilibrium equation can be derived in the matrix form:(29)Ka=f(30)Kij=∑Kije,fi=∑fiewhere(31)Kije=∫VkBiTDBjdΩ(32)ai={u(xi),v(xi)}T(33)fi=∫ΓtϕiTt¯dΓ+∫VtϕiTb¯dΩ(34)Bi=[∂ϕi∂x0∂ϕi∂y0∂ϕi∂y∂ϕi∂x]TIt is noted that the present Quad4-RPIMcns and the node-based smoothed radial point interpolation method (NS-RPIM, or LC-RPIM originally) [32,34,73,26] have some common properties, such as the Kronecker delta property possessed by their shape functions. However, these two methods are very different from each other. The main difference between these two methods are as follows:•NS-RPIM is a Meshless method, but Quad4-RPIMcns is a hybrid FE-Meshless method based on the PUM [3,41].Due to the derivatives of shape functions for Quad4-RPIMcns are continuous at the nodes, nodal stress for Quad4-RPIMcns is continues and Quad4-RPIMcns does not require extra time to smooth nodal stress. However, the continuity of nodal stress for NS-RPIM is obtained by the strain smoothing operation [34,73].In the process of obtaining global stiffness matrix, NS-RPIM employs the nodal integration scheme with strain smoothing operation to perform the numerical integration, but Quad4-RPIMcns uses the same way as like in FEM to conduct the numerical integration. In other words, the numerical integration for NS-RPIM are based on smoothing cells, while Quad4-RPIMcns based on mesh.For NS-RPIM, the gradient is averaged over the smoothing domain leading to constant strain for the nodal integration. This means that the strains in the smoothing cells are not compatible in terms of satisfying the displacement–strain relations [34,73]. However, for Quad4-RPIMcns, the gradient is calculated as like in FEM, and the strains in the mesh for Quad4-RPIMcns is compatible.Numerical tests with the present Quad4-RPIMcns model were carried out, and results are compared to those of four-node quadrilateral element (Quad4), eight-node quadrilateral element (Quad8), and other three hybrid FE-Meshless methods, including Quad4-DNS [53], Quad4-CNS [59] and Quad4-RPIM [68]. Quad4-DNS and Quad4-CNS use polynomial basis functions to construct nodal approximations and Quad4-RPIM uses radial-polynomial basis functions to construct nodal approximations. Similar to the work in Ref. [68], in this section, the radial functions for Quad4-RPIM are constructed using the multi-quadrics (MQ) [22,23] and the corresponding best parameter combination proposed by Xu and Rajendran [68], says c=0.0001 and q=2.01, is selected.The number of polynomial terms for the nodal approximation of the hybrid FE-Meshless methods mentioned above will be taken as three or four, and their effects in the element performance will also be studied. For the convenience of description, a FE-Meshless methods with the superscript “a” means three polynomial terms are adopted for the corresponding nodal approximation, such as Quad4-RPIMcnsa, Quad4-DNSa, Quad4-CNSa and Quad4-RPIMa, and the superscript “b” means four polynomial terms are adopted, such as Quad4-RPIMcnsb, Quad4-DNSb, Quad4-CNSb and Quad4-RPIMb.The physical units used in the present work are based on the international standard unit system. Here, n defines the total number of the nodes in the computational model. To assess accuracy and convergence, the relative L2 errors in the displacement norm and in the energy norm are defined respectively as follows:(35)ed=∫Ω(uex−unum)2dΩ∫Ω(uex)2dΩ(36)ee=12∫Ω(εex−εnum)TD(εex−εnum)dΩ12∫Ω(εex)TD(εex)dΩwhere the superscript “ex” represents the exact or analytical solution and the superscript “num” denotes a numerical solution.A known problem of PUM is the linear dependence problems, which leads to the singularity of global (stiffness) matrices [63]. Nevertheless, the Quad4-RPIMcns seems to be free from this problem. The material parameters in this test are listed as Young׳s modulus E=1.0 and Poisson׳s ratioν=0.25, and the plane stress condition is assumed. The geometry sketch is shown in Fig. 3. According to the results of numerical tests, without applying boundary conditions, a total of three zero eigenvalues are found on all the meshes for Quad4-RPIMcns. Moreover, after applying boundary conditions, there are no zero eigenvalues that can be observed.A cantilever beam subjected to a bending moment is used to investigate the performance of Quad4-RPIMcns on distorted meshes, as shown in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 5, the cantilever beam is discretized by two elements to investigate the performance of Quad4, Quad4-RPIMcns, Quad4-RPIM, Quad4-CNS, Quad4-DNS and Quad8. The mesh distortion is controlled by a distortion parameter,2d/b, which is a widely used methodology to investigate the sensitivity of numerical methods to distorted meshes [68,6]. The parameters in the computation are taken as L=40, b=8, M=16, E=1000, v=0, and h=1. The plane stress condition is used.In this test, the element distortion sensitivity is measured by comparing the computed tip deflection at point A to the exact value, which is equal toML2/(2EIzz). The ratio of computed tip deflection at point A to the exact value is plotted in Fig. 6. Some conclusions can be drawn.First, compared to Quad4-RPIMcns, the Quad8 achieve more accuracy results. The accuracy of Quad8 decreases sharply with the increasing of the distortion parameter. It is noticed that Quad8 needs adding additional nodes, which increases the size of the global stiffness matrix.Second, the results of Quad4-RPIMcns and Quad4-RPIM are similar, which are much better than Quad4, Quad4-CNS and Quad4-DNS.Third, the results of Quad4-RPIMcnsb are better than those of Quad4-RPIMcnsa when the distortion parameter2d/bis less than 0.3. However, with the increasing of distortion parameter, the accuracy of Quad4-RPIMcnsb decreases sharply. When the meshes are severely distorted, the performance of Quad4-RPIMcnsb is worse than that of Quad4-RPIMcnsa.A two-dimensional cantilever beam subjected to a tip-shear force with length L, height D, and the unit thickness is studied for the various behaviors of Quad4-RPIMcns as a benchmark problem. The beam is fixed at the left end and subjected to a parabolic traction P at the free end in Fig. 7. The analytical solution is available and can be found in Ref. [64].The parameters in the computation are taken as L=48, D=12, P=1000,E=3.0×107, Poisson׳s ratioν=0.3, and the plane stress condition is assumed. In the computation, the nodes on the boundary of x=0 are constrained using the exact displacements given from the analytical solutions, and the traction is specified on the boundary at x=L using the analytical solutions.To examine the convergence of numerical solutions in Quad4-RPIMcns, four discrete models with regular grids are constructed as shown in Fig. 8. The convergence curves are plotted in Fig. 9. The accuracy of Quad4-RPIMcns in both displacement norm and energy norm is compared to Quad4-RPIM, Quad4 and Quad4-CNS.The present Quad4-RPIMcns gives results comparable to Quad4-RPIM, and much better results compared to Quad4 and Quad4-CNS. The convergence rates of Quad4-RPIMcnsa, Quad4-RPIMcnsb, Quad4-RPIMa, Quad4-RPIMb are −2.91, −2.91, −2.83 and −2.83 respectively in the displacement norm, which are all significantly better than the convergence rates of Quad4 (−2.16), Quad4-CNSa (−2.27), Quad4-CNSb (−2.25). The convergence rates of Quad4-RPIMcnsa, Quad4-RPIMcnsb, Quad4-RPIMa, Quad4-RPIMb are −1.61, −1.61, −1.62 and −1.62 respectively in the energy norm, which are also better than the convergence rate of Quad4 (−1.08), Quad4-CNSa (−1.19), Quad4-CNSb (−1.16). Note that both Quad4-RPIMcns and Quad4-RPIM with three-term basis can give as accurate results as with four-term basis for this text problem with regular meshes. Similar conclusions can be found in Ref. [68].Fig. 10shows the contour of σxon the regular mesh for Quad4, Quad4-RPIMa and Quad4-RPIMcnsa. It is found that the global stress field of Quad4-RPIMcns is smoother than that of Quad4 and Quad4-RPIM.As shown in Fig. 11, four distorted meshes are used to examine the influence of the mesh quality. The relative errors in the displacement norm edand the energy norm eeof four models are shown in Tables 1 and 2. It is found that the results of Quad4-RPIMcns, Quad4-RPIM are less sensitive to the mesh quality as compared to Quad4, Quad4-CNS and Quad4-DNS. Similar to the previous conclusion, both Quad4-RPIMcns and Quad4-RPIM with three-term basis can also give as accurate results as with four-term basis for this text problem with distorted meshes.In addition, the contours of σxon distorted meshes for Quad4, Quad4-RPIMa and Quad4-RPIMcnsa are shown in Fig. 12. It is seen that although the mesh is severely distorted, the stress contour given by the present Quad4-RPIMcns is still smooth, whereas that of Quad4 becomes obviously discontinuous when the mesh becomes distorted. The similar numerical results can be found in the reference associated to Quad4-CNS [59].Quad4-RPIMcns and Quad4-RPIM, which are both hybrid FEM-Meshless methods, are able to improve accuracy under regular and distorted meshes, however, they increase the bandwidth of global stiffness matrix, which leads to the increase of computational time. Therefore, it is critical to find the right balance between simulation speed and accuracy in Quad4-RPIMcns and Quad4-RPIM.The relative errors in both displacement norm edand energy norm eeversus the corresponding solution times for Quad4-RPIMcnsa, Quad4-RPIMa and Quad4 are shown Fig. 13. The convergence rates for Quad4-RPIMcnsa and Quad4-RPIMa are −1.25 and −1.23 respectively in the displacement norm, which are all significantly better than the convergence rate of Quad4 (−0.97). The convergence rates for Quad4-RPIMcnsa and Quad4-RPIMa are −0.69 and −0.70 respectively in the energy norm, which are also all significantly better than the convergence rate of Quad4 (−0.49). Moreover, Quad4-RPIMcnsa and Quad4-RPIMa yield more accurate results than Quad4 under the same solution time. Thus the present Quad4-RPIMcns is seen to be computationally more efficient than Quad4.As shown in Fig. 14, a cantilever beam with a tip-moment is considered. The bending momentM=2.4×104, Young׳s modulusE=3.0×107, Poisson׳s ratioν=0.3, D=12 and L=48. The plane stress condition is used. The analytical solution is available and can be found in Ref. [64].To examine the convergence of numerical solutions in Quad4-RPIMcns, four discrete models with regular grids are constructed as shown in Fig. 8. The convergence curves are plotted in Fig. 15. The accuracy of Quad4-RPIMcns in both displacement norm and energy norm is compared to Quad4-RPIM, Quad4 and Quad4-CNS.The numerical results of Quad4-RPIMcns and Quad4-RPIM are all significantly better than the results of Quad4 and Quad4-CNS. The convergence rates of Quad4-RPIMcnsa, Quad4-RPIMcnsb, Quad4-RPIMa, Quad4-RPIMb are −2.81, −2.81, −2.68 and −2.69 respectively in the displacement norm, which are all significantly better than the convergence rates of Quad4 (−2.17), Quad4-CNSa (−2.40), Quad4-CNSb (−2.36). The convergence rates of Quad4-RPIMcnsa, Quad4-RPIMcnsb, Quad4-RPIMa, Quad4-RPIMb are −1.68, −1.68, −1.66 and −1.66 respectively in the energy norm, which are also better than the convergence rate of Quad4 (−1.08), Quad4-CNSa (−1.22), Quad4-CNSb (−1.18).As shown in Fig. 11, four distorted meshes are used to examine the influence of the mesh quality. The relative errors in the displacement norm edand the energy norm eeof four models are shown in Tables 3 and 4. It is found that the results of Quad4-RPIMcns, Quad4-RPIM are less sensitive to the mesh quality as compared to Quad4, Quad4-CNS and Quad4-DNS.In this section Cook׳s skew beam is taken as an example, with all parameters and dimensions given by Cook [68] and shown in Fig. 16(a). Fig. 16(b) gives an example mesh with2×2element for this problem. Table 5gives numerical results of 5 types of mesh tested with the present Quad4-RPIMcns and other element types including Quad4-RPIM, Quad4, Quad4-CNS, Quad4-DNS, Quad8, NS-FEM-T3 [30,45,46] and ES-FEM-T3 [30,37].The present Quad4-RPIMcns gives results comparable to Quad4-RPIM, and much better results compared to Quad4, Quad4-CNS, Quad4-DNS, NS-FEM-T3 and ES-FEM-T3, but slightly inferior results compared to Quad8. This test problem too shows that both Quad4-RPIMcns and Quad4-RPIM with three-term basis can give as accurate results as with four-term basis. The similar conclusions can be found in Ref. [68].In this test, a practical test, homogeneous earth slope [21], is investigated. This earth slope is subjected to self-weight, as shown in Fig. 17. This slope is fixed at the bottom. The normal constraints are imposed on the both sides of the slope. The material parameters of this slope are Young׳s modulusE=8×107, Poisson׳s ratioν=0.43and unit weightγ=1.962×104. Three discrete models shown in Fig. 18are constructed. Due to the lack of theoretical solution, the mesh in Fig. 18 is refined to obtain a fined mesh with 12,255 elements and 12,528 nodes. A reference solution is calculated by Quad4 using this fined mesh. The reference solution for the horizontal displacement of point B and the vertical displacement of point A are −0.4209 and −1.6068 respectively. The horizontal displacement errors of point B and the vertical displacement errors of point A versus n achieved by Quad4-RPIMcns, Quad4-RPIM and Quad4, are plotted in Fig. 19.As seen from Fig. 19 the present Quad4-RPIMcns give results comparable to that of Quad4-RPIM, and exhibits better performance than the Quad4 element. Moreover, both Quad4-RPIMcns and Quad4-RPIM with three-term basis can give as accurate results as with four-term basis.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
A novel FE-Meshless quadrilateral element with continuous nodal stress (Quad4-RPIMcns) using radial-polynomial basis functions is developed in the present work. The radial-polynomial basis functions are used to construct nodal approximation in the context of partition of unity, which avoids the singularity problem of constructing nodal approximation. The weight functions of Quad4-CNS [59] are used to ensure the smoothness of stress field at nodes. The present method seems to be attractive due to the following reasons:•The radial-polynomial point interpolation basis functions are used to construct the nodal approximations of Quad4-RPIMcns, therefore Kronecker-delta property can be ensured, which is a very important property to impose essential boundary conditions directly.The stress field of Quad4-RPIMcns is continuous at the nodes, therefore the nodal stress can be conveniently obtained without any extra smoothing operation.Due to the continuous stress field at nodes, the stress field of Quad4-RPIMcns is smooth when the meshes are severely distorted. However, the stress fields of Quad4 become obviously fluctuated when the meshes are distorted.Quad4-RPIMcns is free from the linear dependence problem which is the main drawback of methods based on partition of unity.The present Quad4-RPIMcns inherits the property of high convergence rates and better accuracy from PUM and hybrid FE-Meshless methods. In the convergence study, Quad4-RPIMcns presents significantly higher convergence rates and better accuracy as compared to Quad4 and Quad4-CNS with three- or four-term basis. Furthermore, compared to Quad4, Quad4-CNS and Quad4-DNS, the Quad4-RPIMcns is less sensitive to the mesh distortion, which causes extreme aliasing of the nodal stress and then reduces the overall accuracy.The accuracy of Quad4-RPIMcns is comparable to Quad4-RPIM, but the stress field of Quad4-RPIM is not continuous at the nodes.In the mesh distortion test, the performance of Quad4-RPIMcns is compared to Quad4, Quad4-CNS, Quad4-DNS, Quad4-RPIM and Quad8 on different distorted meshes with various distortion parameters. The Quad4-RPIMcns and Quad4-RPIM are always more accurate as compared to Quad4, Quad4-CNS, Quad4-DNS. The Quad4-RPIMcns and Quad4-RPIM are both less sensitive to the distorted meshes, compared to Quad4, Quad8, Quad4-CNS and Quad4-DNS.It is well known that the ‘non-conforming’ element, whose derivative is only continuous at nodes, is widely used in the problems of the Kirchhoff-Love plate and shell models. Since the derivative of Quad4-RPIMcns shape functions is continuous at nodes, it is potentially useful to solve problems of bending plate and shell models.The formulation of Quad4-RPIMcns can be easily extended to three dimensions, such as 8-node hexahedral elements.Quad4-RPIMcns possesses Kronecker-delta property and is able to apply essential boundary conditions conveniently. However, Quad4-RPIMcns only enables the correct boundary conditions at nodes, but not along all the essential boundaries, which is a demerit of the present element. This demerit also exists in other hybrid FE-Meshless elements [53,68,72] which have been used successfully to solve solid problems. Similar to hybrid FE-Meshless QUAD4 element [53,68] and Trig3-CNS [72], no ill-effect has been found in the present work.Furthermore, similar to other hybrid FE-Meshless elements, Quad4-RPIMcns provides alternative approaches to improve accuracy of FEM without increasing the number of nodes, but it increases the bandwidth of the global stiffness matrix and increases the computational time. However, an assessment of computational efficiency (Fig. 13) shows that the present element is more efficient than the classical Quad4 element. Similar conclusions can be found in the reference associated to Quad4-RPIM [68]. Additionally, Quad4-RPIMcns does not require extra time to smooth nodal stress.In view of the above advantages, it is worth to further study the present Quad4-RPIMcns element and apply it for other problems including dynamic problems and geometry nonlinear analyses.
