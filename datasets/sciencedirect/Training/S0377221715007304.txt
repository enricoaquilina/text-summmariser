@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We say that a polygon inscribed in the circle is asymmetric if it contains no two antipodal points being the endpoints of a diameter. Given n diameters of a circle and a positive integer k < n, this paper addresses the problem of computing a maximum area asymmetric k-gon having as vertices k < n endpoints of the given diameters. The study of this type of polygons is motivated by ethnomusiciological applications.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
There exist a number of significant links between music and Operations Research (OR) (Chew and Raphael, 2010). In fact, due its versatility in the mathematical modeling of optimization problems, operations researchers have tackled problems from many fields. Music (representation, analysis, composition, expressive performance, etc.) also presents rich application areas for OR techniques11We refer as example the special cluster of papers featured in the journal INFORMS Journal of Computing in 2006. http://pubsonline.informs.org/toc/ijoc/18/3. This article is an example of the opportunities that abound for operations researchers to make significant contributions in musicology.Imagine that we are at a concert of salsa and we want to retain the intrinsic rhythmic pattern to dance appropriately. Then we should know the clave Son. The clave Son rhythm might be represented as the 16-bit binary sequence 1001001000101000 or, as usual for cyclic rhythms, by onsets represented as points on a circle as in Fig. 1(c). In this geometric setting, the clave Son is associated to a pentagon whose vertices are selected on a circular lattice of 16 points. So, the clave Son is represented by a special selection of k points on the circular lattice. This pattern has conquered our planet during the last half of the 20th century. But, what properties does this particular selection have? Notice that the polygon that represents the clave Son does not contain two antipodal points on the circle and moreover, it is easy to prove that this configuration is just the pentagon of maximum area without antipodal vertices (this later property produces a certain kind of asymmetry). Musicians have showed interest in finding similar patterns. Ethnomusicology is the discipline encompassing various approaches to the study of music that emphasize its cultural context. More specifically, Ethnomathematics is a domain consisting of the study of mathematical ideas shared by orally transmitted cultures. Such ideas are related to numeric, logic and spatial configurations (Ascher, 1998; Chemillier, 2002). Related to spacial configurations, the area is a useful measure of evenness of scales and rhythms in music theory (Arom et al., 1991; Rappaport, 2007). Moreover, many musical traditions all over the world have asymmetric rhythmic patterns. For instance, the Aka Pygmies rhythmic pattern in Fig. 1(b) has the so-called rhythmic oddity property discovered by (Arom et al., 1991). A rhythm has the rhythmic oddity property if when represented on a circle it does not contain two onsets (the black points in the Fig. (1) that lie diametrically opposite to each other. Thus, the property asserts that one cannot break the circle into two parts of equal length, whatever the chosen breaking point, as there is always one unit lacking on one side. This property produces a kind of perceptual asymmetry. The asymmetry of the pattern is to some extent intrinsic, in the sense that there exists no breaking point giving two parts of equal length. Note that the oddity property requires that the circle is divided into an even number of units. The notion of rhythmic oddity has received different mathematical treatments; see (Toussaint, 2010) for more details.An algorithm for enumerating all the patterns satisfying the rhythmic oddity property has been proposed in (Chemillier and Truchet, 2003). Asymmetric rhythmics can also be found in the flamenco music of Spain (Fig. 1(a)) and the clave Son in Cuba (Fig. 1(c)). See (Díaz-Báñez, 2013; Díaz-Báñez et al., 2004), and (Toussaint, 2005), for a detailed study on the preference of these rhythms in their cultural contexts.Inspired by these ideas, we introduce the following geometric problem:Problem 1.1Given n diameters (not necessarily equally spaced) in a circle and a positive integer k < n, select k endpoints of these diameters, no two of the same diameter, in such a way that their convex hull defines a k-gon of maximum area.Let us introduce some notation and related work. Let(p0,p0′),…,(pn−1,pn−1′)be n diameters of a given circle. LetS:={p0,p0′,p1,p1′,⋯,pn−1,pn−1′}be an antipodal set containing the 2n endpoints of the given diameters. A sub-polygon (of S) is a convex polygon whose vertex set is a subset of S. An antipodal polygon (on S) is a sub-polygon whose vertex set contains exactly one endpoint from each diameter(pi,pi′)of S (Aichholzer et al., 2015). An asymmetric polygon is a sub-polygon that contains no diameter. Therefore, an antipodal polygon is also an asymmetric polygon. Aichholzer et al. proved that an antipodal polygon of maximum area can be found in Θ(n)-time (Aichholzer et al., 2015). The linear time algorithms they proposed are strongly based on a simple characterization for the extremal antipodal polygons. Namely, that an antipodal polygon of maximum area has an alternating configuration (Aichholzer et al., 2015).The problem however, is significantly different if we ask for an asymmetric k-gon of maximum area with k < n vertices in S. It is not difficult to come up with examples for which the simple characterization stated above does not hold if k < n. Aichholzer et al.presented anO(nn−k+1)-time algorithm to compute an antipodal k-gon of maximum area. However, the existence of a polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem was left as an open question (Aichholzer et al., 2015).In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative. We distinguish two cases: if we are given a circular lattice with an antipodal set of 2n points (induced by n evenly spaced diameters), we show how to solve Problem 1.1 in constant time by providing a characterization of the solution. Otherwise, if the diameters are given in a general configuration, we show that the problem can be solved in O(kn4)-time using dynamic programming.The problem studied here is related to other optimization problems in operations research and mathematics. A similar problem consists of finding the unit-diameter polygon of maximal area. The first progress was made in (Reinhardt, 1922) where the optimality of the regular polygon was proved for polygons with odd number of sides. The problem of determining the largest area a plane hexagon of unit diameter can have was solved in (Graham, 1975), the octagon was solved in (Audet et al., 2002) and finally, a family of nearly optimal polygons is given in (Mossinghoff, 2006).In computational geometry, efficient algorithms have been proposed for computing extremal polygons with respect to several different properties (Boyce et al., 1985). Moreover, the so-called stabbing or transversal problems (see for instance Arkin et al., 2011) belong to the same family that our problem. Recently, it has been proved that the following problem is NP-hard (Díaz-Báñez et al., 2015): given a set S of line segments, compute the minimum or maximum area (perimeter) polygon P such that P stabs S, that is, at least one of the two endpoints of every segment s ∈ S is contained in P. In operations research, global optimization techniques have been extensively studied to find convex polygons maximizing a given parameter (Audet et al., 2007).Now, let us consider a different interpretation of the problem, let P be the convex hull of the given diameters. In this case, the solution to Problem 1.1 can be interpreted as the asymmetric polygon with k < n vertices that has its area closest to that of P. Therefore, this problem is related to the approximation of convex sets. In this setting, the best inner approximation of any convex set by a symmetric set is studied in (Lassak, 2002). Moreover, if we consider the “distance” to a symmetric set to be a measure of its symmetry (Grunbaum, 1963), then our solution to Problem 1.1 provides the best approximation of a convex polygon inscribed in a circle by asymmetric sub-polygons.Finally, it is worth mentioning that although there exist applications of operations research to music theory (see for example Schell, 2002), the research in music has illuminated problems that are appealing, nontrivial, and, in some cases, connected to deep mathematical questions. The problem introduced in this paper could be an example.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we consider the constrained version of Problem 1.1 in which the endpoints of the diameters are evenly spaced on the circle. In this case, we provide a characterization of the maximum k-gon which yields a constant time algorithm to solve Problem 1.1. The general version of this problem where the endpoints of the diameters are distributed anywhere on the circle is studied in Section 3. In this case, we show that Problem 1.1 can be solved in polynomial time using dynamic programming.In this section, we assume thatS={p0,p0′,p1,p1′,⋯,pn−1,pn−1′}is the set of endpoints of n evenly spaced diameters on a unit circle. That is, S partition the circle into 2n arcs of equal length. A k-gon Qkwith verticesq0,…,qk−1in S can be encoded by a sequence<a0,...,ak−1>,where aiis the number of arcs between the vertices qiandqi+1,0 ≤ i < k,qk=q0. For example, the clave Son in Fig. 1(c) can be encoded by the sequence < 3, 3, 4, 2, 4 > . In music theory, this sequence is called the interval vector (or full-interval vector) (McCartin, 1998). As with rhythmic patterns, we assume that the sequence<a0,…,ak−1>is cyclic, i.e., for i ≥ k,ai=aimodk. Throughout this section, we identify a sub-polygon with k vertices by its corresponding encoding sequence.Remark 2.1Let Qkbe a sub-polygon encoded by the sequence<a0,⋯,ak−1>. The following properties hold:1.The area of the polygon Qkis12∑i=0k−1sin(πnai).The area is invariant under permutations of the sequence<a0,⋯,ak−1>. That is, for any0≤i<j≤k−1,the area of the polygons given by the sequences<a0,…,ai,…,aj,…,ak−1>and<a0,…,aj,…,ai,…,ak−1>is the same.Polygon Qkis asymmetric if and only if there are no two indices i, j such thati≠jandai+ai+1+⋯+aj=n.The following technical results will be used later.Lemma 2.2Let a, b, n be positive integers witha−b≥2and2n>a+b. Then we havesin(πan)+sin(πbn)<sin(π(a−1)n)+sin(π(b+1)n)The previous inequality can be written as:2sin(π(a+b)2n)cos(π(a−b)2n)<2sin(π(a+b)2n)×cos(π(a−b−2)2n).Because0<π(a+b)2n<π,0≤π(a−b−2)2n<π(a−b)2n<πand from the fact that cos (·) is decreasing in (0, π), this inequality holds.□For ease of notation, a sequencea,⋯,aof c elements all equal to a is denoted bya,⋯,a︸c. The following lemma characterizes the k-gons (not necessarily asymmetric) of maximum area.Lemma 2.3Given a regular polygon of m vertices inscribed in a circle, the maximum area sub-polygon with k ≤ m vertices is encoded by any permutation of the following sequence<q+1,…,q+1︸r,q,…,q︸k−r>,wherem=kq+r,0 ≤ r < k.Leta0,a1,…,ak−1be a sequence encoding a sub-polygon Qkwith maximum area. Defineamax=max(a0,a1,...,ak−1)andamin=min(a0,a1,...,ak−1). Ifamax−amin≥2,then we switch amaxtoamax−1,and amintoamin+1. In this way, because k ≥ 3 we havem=∑i=0k−1ai>amax+aminand hence, Lemma 2.2 implies that the new polygon has larger area than the initial one leading to a contradiction. Therefore,amax−amin≤1. This implies that for some integer e and for every0≤i≤k−1,eitherai=eorai=e+1.Let u and v be the number of occurrences of the integers e ande+1respectively, that is,u(e)+v(e+1)=m. Thus, we have(u+v)e+v=kq+randke+v=kq+r. Consequently,v−ris a multiple of k. Since v ≤ k and r < k, we have only two cases: eitherv=r,orv=kandr=0. In the former case,e=qand in the later,ai=e+1=qfor every i. The result follows.□In this section, we show that if the number of vertices k is odd, then there is a permutation of the sequence of Lemma 2.3 such that its corresponding sub-polygon is asymmetric.Theorem 2.4Given a regular polygon of 2n vertices inscribed in a circle and positive integers k, q, r with2n=kq+r,0 ≤ r < k, the maximum area asymmetric sub-polygon with k vertices is given by the following sequences:For r even,<q+1,…,q+1︸r/2,q,…,q︸(k−r−1)/2,q+1,…,q+1︸r/2,q,…,q︸(k−r+1)/2>For r odd,<q,…,q︸(k−r)/2,q+1,…,q+1︸(r−1)/2,q,…,q︸(k−r)/2,q+1,…,q+1︸(r+1)/2>We note first that both sequences are composed by r occurrences of the elementq+1andk−roccurrences of the element q. Therefore, both k-gons are maximum area by Lemma 2.3. Moreover,ai=ai+(k−1)2for0≤i<(k−1)2,we say thatai+(k−1)2is the homologous element of aiin the sequence and vice versa. Notice that, except forak−1,every element in the sequence has its homologous element.We now prove that the encoded polygon is asymmetric. Let A and B be a partition into two subsequences of the proposed cyclic sequence so that A contains(k−1)2consecutive elements and B the other(k+1)2elements.Let SAand SBbe the sum of the elements of A and B, respectively. Ifak−1∉A,then B consists of the(k−1)2homologous elements of the corresponding of A andak−1and henceSB=SA+ak−1. On the other hand, ifak−1∈A,then B contains(k−3)2homologous elements of the ones in A plus two more elements, say ai, aj(recall thatak−1has no homologous element). ThereforeSB−SA=ai+aj−ak−1for some indicesi≠j. Regardless of the case, we have that SB> SA, SA< n and SB> n. As a consequence, any sum of(k−1)2consecutive elements is different from n.For an arbitrary partition of the sequence, we proceed in a similar way. If the sizes of A and B are arbitrary, we also have two cases. If|A|≤(k−1)2then SA< n and if|B|≤(k−1)2then SB< n. In both cases, the sequences correspond to asymmetric polygons.□Unfortunately, if the number of vertices k is even, the following result prevents us from seeking the solution as a permutation of the sequence of Lemma 2.3.Theorem 2.5If k is even, then no permutation of the sequence<q+1,…,q+1︸r,q,…,q︸k−r>corresponds to an asymmetric polygon.Setf(i)=ai+ai+1+⋯+ai+k/2−1. We havef(i+1)−f(i)=ai+k/2−ai,which implies thatf(i+1)−f(i)∈{−1,0,1}. Iff(0)=n,then the sequence is non-asymmetric. Assume that f(0) < n. Thus, f(k/2) > n (f(0)+f(k/2)=2n). Consider now the discrete function given by the integer values f(0), f(1),…, f(k/2). Since|f(i+1)−f(i)|is equal to 1 or 0, f(0) < n and f(k/2) > n, it follows that there exists an index j, 0 < j < k/2, such thatf(j)=nand the sequence generates a non-asymmetric polygon. The proof for the case f(0) > n is analogous.□In the following, we prove that it is possible to find the solution for the case k even by considering the sequence that provides the second maximum area.Theorem 2.6If k is even, then any permutation of the sequence<q+1,…,q+1︸r+1,q−1,q,…,q︸k−r−2>corresponds to the sub-polygon of k-vertices with the second maximum area.We first prove that if aiis an element of a sequence providing the k-gon with the second maximum area thenai∈{q−1,q,q+1,q+2}fori=0,…,k−1.Denote by amaxand aminthe valuesmax{a0,a1,…,ak−1}andmin{a0,a1,…,ak−1},respectively. Suppose thatamax≥q+3. Note that ifamin≥q+1,then∑i=0k−1ai>2nwhich is a contradiction. Therefore, we assume that amin≤ q. In this case, switching amaxbyamax−1≥q+2and aminbyamin+1yields a larger polygon according to Lemma 2.2. However, the new polygon cannot be the largest one because it contains an elementaj≥q+2,in contradiction with Lemma 2.3.Suppose thatamin≤q−2. Following a similar argument to the above case,amax≥q+1and by switching amaxand aminbyamax−1andamin+1≤q−1,respectively, the area of the new polygon increases. It cannot be the largest one because it contains an elementaj≤q−1.Using similar arguments we can show that the elementsq+2andq−1appear at most once in the k-gon with the second maximum area.Let A, B, C, D be the number of occurrences ofq−1,q,q+1,q+2,respectively. The we have:A+B+C+D=kA(q−1)+B(q)+C(q+1)+D(q+2)=2n(A+B+C+D)q+(−A+C+2D)=kq+r−A+C+2D=rC=r+A−2DNow, the area of the k-gon we are looking for is:S(A,B,C,D)=Asin(π(q−1)n)+Bsin(πqn)+Csin(π(q+1)n)+Dsin(π(q+2)n)Since 0 ≤ A, D ≤ 1, we have four cases to consider. Case(A,D)=(0,0)corresponds with the k-gon of maximum area (Lemma 2.3). Hence, the areas of the remaining cases are:S(1,B1,C1,1)=sin(π(q−1)n)+(k−r−1)sin(πqn)+(r−1)sin(π(q+1)n)+sin(π(q+2)n)S(0,B2,C2,1)=(k−r+1)sin(πqn)+(r−2)sin(π(q+1)n)+sin(π(q+2)n)S(1,B3,C3,0)=sin(π(q−1)n)+(k−r−2)sin(πqn)+(r+1)sin(π(q+1)n)We claim that S(1, B1, C1, 1) < S(0, B2, C2, 1) ≤ S(1, B3, C3, 0). To prove this claim, note thatS(0,B2,C2,1)−S(1,B1,C1,1)=2sin(πqn)−sin(π(q−1)n)−sin(π(q+1)n).By using Lemma 2.2 witha=q+1,b=q−1we have thatS(0,B2,C2,1)−S(1,B1,C1,1)>0. Notice that2n≥kq≥4q>2q=a+banda−b=2in this case.To prove the other inequality, we use the following trigonometric identities:sin(α)−sin(β)=2cos((α+β)/2)sin((α−β)/2)sin(3α)=3sin(α)−4sin3(α)Using these identities, we obtain the following:S(1,B3,C3,0)−S(0,B2,C2,1)=sin(π(q−1)n)+3sin(π(q+1)n)−3sin(πqn)−sin(π(q+2)n)=6cos(π(2q+1)2n)sin(π2n)−2cos(π(2q+1)2n)×sin(3π2n)=2cos(π(2q+1)2n)(3sin(π2n)−sin(3π2n))=2cos(π(2q+1)2n)4sin3(π2n)Because2n=kq+r,k ≥ 4 and from the fact thatC2=r−2≥0,we get that2n≥4q+2andπ(2q+1)2n≤π2. As a consequence,S(1,B3,C3,0)−S(0,B2,C2,1)≥0yielding the result.□The above result asserts that any sequence with coefficientsA=1,B=k−r−2,C=r+1,D=0provides the k-gon with the second maximum area. In the following result, we provide a sequence that in addition corresponds to an asymmetric k-gon.Theorem 2.7The sequence corresponding to the maximum area asymmetric k-gon for k even is as follows:<q−1,q+1,…,q+1︸r/2,q,…,q︸(k−r−2)/2,q+1,…,q+1︸(r+2)/2,q,…,q︸(k−r−2)/2>The proof is similar to that of Theorem 2.4. The sequence proposed, say Q, is a permutation of the sequence in Theorem 2.6. Therefore, its corresponding k-gon has the second maximum area. We show that it is also asymmetric.Observe that for 0 < i < k/2, it holds thatai=ai+k/2. We say thatai+k/2and aiare homologous elements for 0 < i < k/2.Let A and B be a partition into two subsequences of the cyclic sequence Q. First, suppose that A (and B) consists of k/2 consecutive elements. In this case, neither A nor B contains homologous elements. Let SAand SBbe the sum of the elements of A and B, respectively. If a0 ∈ A then ak/2 ∈ B andSA−SB=a0−ak/2=−2≠0. Similarly, if a0 ∈ B we haveSA−SB≠0proving our claim.Suppose now that the subsequence A contains less than k/2 consecutive elements. Then, every element in A has its homologous element in B except maybe for a0 or ak/2. If a0 ∈ A, thenSB−SA=ak/2−a0+au+av+⋯,whereau,av,…are elements of B having no homologous element in A. In this case, SB> SA. The case |B| < k/2 is analogous. Hence, there are no indices i, j, i ≠ j, so thatai+ai+1+⋯+aj=n. This completes the proof of the theorem.□(Díaz-Báñez et al., 2015) showed that the following problem is proved to be NP-hard: given a set of n line segments in the plane (or in a circle), find a maximum-area convex polygon having as vertices at least one endpoint from each segment. They also show that if the segments are pairwise disjoint, then the problem can be solved in polynomial time. A constrained version in which each segment joins two antipodal points on a circle was recently studied by (Aichholzer et al., 2015). They showed that this constrained problem can be solved with a simple linear time algorithm and they asked about the hardness of the problem of selecting k endpoints instead of n. As a consequence of the hardness result of (Díaz-Báñez et al., 2015), this problem becomes NP-hard if we remove the antipodality constraint.A dynamic programming algorithm presented in this section finds the asymmetric k-gon of maximum area in time O(kn4). For the special casesk=3andk=4we show how to solve the problem in linear time.LetS:={p0,p0′,p1,p1′,⋯,pn−1,pn−1′}be the set of the endpoints of n diameters in the unit circle and let O be the center of this circle. We define a wedge (i, j) as a convex polygon being the convex hull of O and a subsequence of points (need not be consecutive) of S visited when walking clockwise along the circle from pito pj, see Fig. 2(a). We say that piand pjare anchors of a wedge (i, j).A double-wedge (i, j, l, t) is the union of two disjoint wedges (i, j) and (l, t) such that: (1) this union contains no diameter and (2) eitherpt′lies clockwise between piand pj, orpj′lies clockwise between pland pt; see Fig. 2 for an illustration. The anchors of a double-wedge are the anchors of the wedges that form it.Lemma 3.1The maximum area asymmetric k-gon (k ≥ 3) on S is formed by the union of a double-wedge (i, j, l, t) and the triangles Opjpl and Opipt.Let Q be the maximum area asymmetric k-gon on S. Let pibe a vertex of Q and letpi′be its antipodal point. Let pj(resp. pl) be the first vertex of Q found when walking counterclockwise (resp. clockwise) frompi′along the boundary of the circle. Let ptbe the first vertex of Q found when walking counterclockwise from pialong the boundary of the circle. See Fig. 3.We prove by contradiction that pj, pland ptexist and are different from pi. Let SQ⊆S be the set of vertices of Q and its antipodal points and the asymmetric k-gon Q of maximum area on S is a maximum area antipodal on SQ. Suppose that pjdoes not exist or matches with pi, then all vertices of Q lie in the same semicircle of the two defined by the diameterpipi′,then Q would not be a maximum area antipodal polygon on SQ(Aichholzer et al., 2015), this is a contradiction. The proof that pland ptexist and are different from piis analogous, note that plcan matche with pt. The union of the wedges (i, j) and (l, t) contains no diameter because Q is an asymmetric polygon. We now prove thatpj′lies clockwise between pland ptorpt′lies clockwise between piand pj. Ifpj′lies clockwise between ptand pithenpt′lies clockwise between piand pj, ifpj′lies clockwise between pland ptwe are done, finally ifpj′lies clockwise betweenpi′and plwe obtain a contradiction because all vertices of Q would lie in the same semicircle of the two defined by the diameterpjpj′. Therefore, Q is not a maximum area antipodal polygon on SQ(Aichholzer et al., 2015).□When a double-wedge uses s points of S we say it is an s-double-wedge. For 3 ≤ s ≤ k, let f(i, j, l, t, s) be the area of the s-double-wedge of maximum area with anchors (i, j, l, t). Notice that fors=3either piand pj, or pland ptcoincide. By Lemma 3.1, the area of the maximum area asymmetric k-gon is equal to the maximum of{f(i,j,l,t,k)+AOpjpl+AOpipt},where (i, j, l, t) goes over all the possible anchors of a k-double-wedge. Therefore, having computed f(i, j, l, t, k) for all possible k-double-wedges, the maximum area asymmetric k-gon can be found in time O(n4).Lemma 3.2All possible values of f(i, j, l, t, s) with 3 ≤ s ≤ k can be computed in time O(kn5).Fors=3,ifi=jthenf(i,j,l,t,3)=AOplptelsef(i,j,l,t,3)=AOpipj. All possible values of f(i, j, l, t, 3) can be computed in time O(n3). For fixed values i, j, l, t and s (s > 3), the value of f(i, j, l, t, s) can be computed in time O(n). Ifpt′lies clockwise between piand pjthen:f(i,j,l,t,s)=max{f(i,m,l,t,s−1)+AOpmpj}for each pmbetween piand pjin clockwise,pm≠pl′andpm≠pt′. Otherwise, ifpj′lies clockwise between pland ptthen:f(i,j,l,t,s)=max{f(i,j,l,m,s−1)+AOpmpt}for each pmbetween pland ptin clockwise,pm≠pi′andpm≠pj′. In fact, all possible values of f(i, j, l, t, s) with a fixed value s (s > 3) can be computed in time O(n5) having computed the valuesf(i,j,l,t,s−1). Then, by iterating s from 3 to k, all possible values of f(i, j, l, t, s) can be computed in time O(kn5).□We now show how to improve this running time by computing all possible values of f(i, j, l, t, s) for a fixed value s > 3 in time O(n4). The following lemma is depicted in Fig. 4(a).Lemma 3.3Let f(i, j1, l, t, s) and f(i, j2, l, t, s) be the areas of the maximum area s-double-wedges with anchors (i, j1, l, t) and (i, j2, l, t), respectively, such that s > 3 andpt′lies clockwise between pi andpj1. Letpi,⋯,pr,pj1andpi,⋯,pq,pj2be the subsequences in S of the wedges (i, j1) and (i, j2), respectively. Ifpj1precedespj2when walking clockwise along the circle from pi, then pr also precedes pq.If pqlies clockwise betweenpj1(including it) andpj2we are done. Now, consider the case when pqlies clockwise between piandpj1. The subsequencespi,⋯,pr,pj1andpi,⋯,pq,pj2are part of the maximum area s-double-wedges (i, j1, l, t) and (i, j2, l, t), respectively. Therefore we have(1)f(i,j1,l,t,s)=f(i,r,l,t,s−1)+AOprpj1≥f(i,m,l,t,s−1)+AOpmpj1foreachpmliesclockwisebetweenpiandpj1(2)f(i,j2,l,t,s)=f(i,q,l,t,s−1)+AOpqpj2≥f(i,m,l,t,s−1)+AOpmpj2foreachpmliesclockwisebetweenpiandpj2From 1 and 2 we obtain the following inequalities:f(i,r,l,t,s−1)+AOprpj1≥f(i,q,l,t,s−1)+AOpqpj1f(i,r,l,t,s−1)+AOprpj2≤f(i,q,l,t,s−1)+AOpqpj2adding both we obtain that(3)AOprpj2−AOprpj1≤AOpqpj2−AOpqpj1Suppose that pqand prare inverted. Let z, x and y be the angles between pq, pr,pj1andpj2(see Fig. 5), then Inequality 3 can be written as:sin(x+y)−sinx≤sin(x+y+z)−sin(z+x)2cos(x+y2)sin(y2)≤2cos(x+z+y2)sin(y2)(4)cos(x+y2)≤cos(x+z+y2)Becausez+x+y<πand cos (·) is decreasing in the interval (0, π), Inequality 4 yields a contradiction.□The following lemma has an analogous proof to that of Lemma 3.3 and is depicted in Fig. 4(b).Lemma 3.4Let f(i, j, l, t1, s) and f(i, j, l, t2, s) be the areas of the maximum area s-double-wedges with anchors (i, j, l, t1) and (i, j, l, t2), respectively, such that s > 3 andpj′lies clockwise between pl andpt1. Letpl,⋯,pr,pt1andpl,⋯,pq,pt2be the subsequences in S of the wedges (l, t1) and (l, t2), respectively. Ifpt1precedespt2when walking clockwise along the circle from pl, then pr also precedes pq.LetS:={p0,p0′,p1,p1′,⋯,pn−1,pn−1′}be the set of the endpoints of n diameters in the unit circle and let k be an integer such that k < n. The asymmetric k-gon of maximum area can be found in time O(kn4).Having computed f(i, j, l, t, k) for all possible k-double-wedge, the maximum area asymmetric k-gon can be found in time O(n4). We show how to compute f(i, j, l, t, s) for all s-double-wedge with 3 ≤ s ≤ k in time O(kn4).Fors=3,f(i, j, l, t, 3) can be computed in time O(n3). For s > 3, ifpt′lies clockwise between piand pj,f(i,j,l,t,s)=max{f(i,m,l,t,s−1)+AOpmpj},for each pmbetween piand pjin clockwise,pm≠pl′andpm≠pt′. Suppose that we have computed for i, j, l and t the value r such thatf(i,j,l,t,s)=f(i,r,l,t,s−1)+AOprpj. Then, to computef(i,j+1,l,t,s)we do not need test each pmbetween piandpj+1,we need only to test each pmin the interval from prtopj+1. In fact, we can compute f(i, j, l, t, s) for all pjthat followspt′in clockwise for fixed values i, l, t and s in time O(n).The other case, whenpj′lies clockwise between pland ptis analogous. In fact, all possible values of f(i, j, l, t, s) with a fixed value s (s > 3) can be computed in time O(n4) having computed the valuesf(i,j,l,t,s−1). Then, iterating s from 3 to k, all possible values of f(i, j, l, t, s) can be computed in time O(kn4).□LetS:={p0,p0′,p1,p1′,⋯,pn−1,pn−1′}be the set of endpoints of n diameters in the unit circle, n ≥ 3. In the following, we prove that the triangle of maximum area on S contains no diameter. Using this characterization, we show how to find the largest triangle in linear time. We useto denote the clockwise arc from pito pjand ∠pipjpkto denote the inner angle of the triangle pipjpkwith apex pj.Lemma 3.6A maximal triangle with vertices in S contains no diameter.Suppose for a contradiction that the maximal triangle contains a diameter. Letpipjpi′be the maximal triangle. Let plandpl′be another diameter of points in S. If plis inthenpl′is in.The trianglespipjpi′andpipjpl′have a common base, the segmentpipj′,the height ofpipjpi′frompi′is smaller than the height ofpipjpl′frompl′; see Fig. 6. Therefore,Apipjpl′>Apipjpi′which is a contradiction. The proof in the case plis inis analogous.□Note that each triangle contains either two angles greater or equal than 2π/3, or two angles smaller or equal than 2π/3; we call such pair of angles the base angles of the triangle. A critical vertex is a vertex supporting a base angle. The following lemma is key to our algorithm.Lemma 3.7Let c1, c2, p, b2and b1be points in the unit circle that lie in this order when walking counterclockwise along the circle from c1.1.If ∠pb1c1 ≤ 2π/3 and ∠pc1b1 ≤ 2π/3, then the maximal triangle that contains p is c1pb1If ∠pb2c2 ≥ 2π/3 and ∠pc2b2 ≥ 2π/3, then the maximal triangle that contains p is c2pb2Using similar triangles we can show the following inequalities for the first case (see Fig. 7(a)):Apc2b2<Apc2b1<Apc1b1Apc2b2<Apc1b2<Apc1b1,and these ones for the other case (see Fig. 7(b)):Apc2b2>Apc2b1>Apc1b1Apc2b2>Apc1b2>Apc1b1.□LetS:={p0,p0′,p1,p1′,⋯,pn−1,pn−1′}be the set of endpoints of n diameters in the unit circle, n ≥ 3. The triangle of maximum area with vertices in S can be found in linear time.The idea of our algorithms is to iterate among the endpoints of the n diameters in clockwise order computing for each pithe maximal triangle with pias critical vertex. Let M be the triangle of maximum area with vertices in S. ThenM=max{Ti},where Tiis the maximal triangle with pias critical vertex. Lemma 3.7 allows us to find Ticomparing just two trianglespipjipmiandpipkipli(see Fig. 8), where ji≤ ki< li≤ miand the following inequalities hold:Note thatji+1≥ji,ki+1≥ki,li+1≥liandmi+1≥mi. If we have for a point pithe pointspji,pki,pliandpmi,then moving from these points in clockwise we can find forpi+1the pointspji+1,pki+1,pli+1andpmi+1. Therefore, we can compute the maximal triangle with pias critical vertex for all piin S in linear time.□Unlike the triangle, the quadrilateral of maximum area could contain diameters. However, we prove that the asymmetric quadrilateral of maximum area satisfies a property that allows us to find it in linear time.Lemma 3.9LetS:={p0,p0′,p1,p1′,⋯,pn−1,pn−1′}be the set of endpoints of n diameters in the unit circle, n ≥ 4. Let pi, pl,pj′andpt′be the vertices of a maximal quadrilateral. Then the arcsandcontain no other points of S, seeFig. 9.Certainly plis the farthest point of S frompipj′inorpt′is the farthest point of S frompipj′in.Suppose that pl(pt′) is the farthest point of S frompipj′in),thenpl′(pt) is the farthest point of S frompipj′in).In factpt′(pl) is the second farthest point of S frompipj′in).Hence the points pland pt(pl′andpt′) are consecutive in clockwise. Analogously we can prove that piand pj(pi′andpj′) are consecutive .□Note that the four possible asymmetric quadrilateral with vertices in the subset {pi, pj, pl, pt,pi′,pj′,pl′,pt′}have the same area because the segmentspipj′andpi′pj(plpt′andpl′pt) are parallel and equal. As a consequence of Lemma 3.9,pj=pi+1andpt=pl+1. From the above lemma we infer the following corollary.Corollary 3.10LetS:={p0,p0′,p1,p1′,⋯,pn−1,pn−1′}be the set of endpoints of n diameters in the unit circle, n ≥ 4. Let Q be a maximal asymmetric quadrilateral on S. If pi∈ S is a vertex of Q then its opposite vertex in Q ispi+1′orpi−1′.Let a, b, c, d, a′, e, f and d′ be clockwise points in a circle, where aa′ and dd′ are diameters. If d is farther than c from ae, then d is farther than c from bf.Let m be the intersection point of bd and cf, let n be the intersection point of ad and ce. Because d is farther than c from ae, Aace< Aade. Because triangle ane is common for the triangles ace and ade, Aanc< Adne. Since the triangles anc and dne are similar, ac < de. Moreover, bc < ac and de < df as they are in the same semicircle, respectively. From these inequalities, we infer that bc < df. Because the triangles bmc and dmf are similar, we know that Abmc< Admf. Since triangle bmf is common for the triangles bcf and bdf, Abcf< Abdf. Therefore, d is farther than c from bf; see Fig. 10.□We are now ready to show the main result of this section.Theorem 3.12LetS:={p0,p0′,p1,p1′,⋯,pn−1,pn−1′}be the set of endpoints of n diameters in the unit circle, n ≥ 4. The asymmetric quadrilateral of maximum area can be found in linear time.Let Q be the asymmetric quadrilateral of maximum area on S and letQi=piplpi+1′pl+1′be a maximal asymmetric quadrilateral withpipi+1′as a diagonal, using Corollary 3.10 we have thatQ=max{Qi}. The idea of our algorithm is to iterate among the endpoints of the n diameters in clockwise order and compute, for each pi, the maximal asymmetric quadrilateral Qiwithpipi+1′as a diagonal. Suppose that for an arbitrary point pi∈ S we have computedQi=piplpi+1′pl+1′where plandpl+1′are the farthest points (the farthest and the second farthest maintaining the asymmetry) frompipi+1′on S. To computeQi+1we need to find pmsuch that pmandpm+1′are the farthest points frompi+1pi+2′on S, using Lemma 3.11 we can infer that pmandpm+1′lie onandrespectively (see Fig. 11). Therefore, making a clockwise iteration on S we can find all the maximal asymmetric quadrilaterals in linear time, computing for each pithe farthest points (the farthest and the second farthest maintaining the asymmetry) plandpl+1frompipi+1′on S using the farthest points found in the previous step of the iteration.□

Extremal problems on convex polygons have attracted attention of researchers from areas as Operational Research, Combinatorial Geometry, and Computer Science, among others. In this paper, we efficiently solve a special case, originated from the study of musical rhythms. Consider a circle with points spread out on its boundary. If the points are equally spaced, they represent onsets of beats in the clock diagram notation (Rappaport, 2007). In our optimization problem, the polygon has k < n vertices being the endpoints of n diameters of the circle but no two vertices are in the same diameter. A polygon with this property is called an asymmetric k-gon and we have showed how to compute the maximum area asymmetric k-gon for two cases depending on whether the n diameters are equally spaced or not. The first case can be done in constant time by using a characterization of the optimal solution and, the general case can be solved by dynamic programming. This solves an open problem posed in (Aichholzer et al., 2015). Moreover, the casesk=3andk=4can be solved in O(n)-time by using nice properties of a solution. These properties do not hold for k > 4 and we left as open problem to improve the O(kn4)-time complexity for k ≥ 5 as well as to prove if the problem is 3-SUM-hard (Gajentaan and Overmars, 1995).
