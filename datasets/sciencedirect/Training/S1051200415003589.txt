Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is an adaptive decomposition method, which is widely used in time-frequency analysis. As a bidimensional extension of EMD, bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) presents many useful applications in image processing and computer vision. In this paper, we define the mean points in BEMD ‘sifting’ processing as centroid point of neighbour extrema points in Delaunay triangulation and propose using mean approximation instead of envelope mean in ‘sifting’. The proposed method improves the decomposition result and reduces average computation time of ‘sifting’ processing. Furthermore, a BEMD-based image fusion approach is presented in this paper. Experimental results show our method can achieve more orthogonal and physical meaningful components and more effective result in image fusion application.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a data driven processing algorithm, which employs no predetermined filter. EMD decomposes signal based on the local characteristics scale and presents time-frequency-energy distribution of data, which is suited to analyse nonlinear and nonstationary signals [1]. Due to the data-driven property, EMD has been found many successful applications in variant areas, such as biological, medical sciences, astronomy, engineering and others [12]. Recently, EMD based data-driven sparse representation over a highly redundant time-frequency dictionary method [3] has been proposed and used to detect intrinsic pattern or physical information from data, where traditional methods decompose signal to artificial harmonics components.For two-dimensional signals, bidimensional EMD (BEMD) is developed as a two-dimensional version of EMD. There are many applications of EMD/BEMD reported in the literatures for image analysis and processing. Some different approaches to extend EMD to two-dimensional are reported [2,12,16]. EMD/BEMD is widely used in image compression [6], multi-media coding [23], face preprocessing [24], image fusion [26], etc.Ensemble EMD (EEMD) [15], which was firstly proposed by Wu et al. to reduce the mode mixing problem, has been extended to multi-dimensional ensemble EMD (M-EEMD) [16]. Bidimensional statistical empirical mode decomposition (BSEMD) [28] termed a smoothing procedure instead of 2D interpolation by constructing envelopes coupling with a new extrema identification method. Dragomiretskiy et al. [18,19] created an entirely non-recursive 2D variational mode decomposition (VMD) model, where the modes are detected concurrently. VMD decomposed an image into a given number of modes such that each individual mode has limited bandwidth [19].‘Sifting’ process is the main procedure in EMD/BEMD, which generates the upper and lower envelope by interpolation method. In 2D condition, envelope generation methods require high computation time with interpolation approaches, such as radial basis function [4] or thin-plate splines [6]. Some other envelope generation algorithms are also proposed, such as finite elements based on Delaunay triangulation [13], spatial domain order-statistics filter [11], oblique-extrema-based approach [22]. These approaches have improved computation speed and decomposition result of EMD/BEMD, but more efficient and effective methods still need further research.In this paper, we proposed an effective and efficient BEMD method. The proposed method utilizes a mean approximation based generation approach. By defining the mean points in two dimensions, we build a mean approximation instead of envelope mean by Delaunay triangular mesh. Our experiments show that the proposed method decomposes images to more orthogonal components and consumes less computational time. In the following, we will introduce the basic concept and algorithm of BEMD in Section 2. Section 3 describes the proposed mean approximation based BEMD method. Some decomposition result and discussion are shown in Section 4. Further, a fusion image method based on the proposed mean approximation based BEMD method is described in Section 5. Section 6 gives a conclusion of this paper.Nonstationary signals have statistical properties that vary as a function of time and should be analysed differently from stationary data. Rather than assuming that a signal is a linear combination of predetermined basis functions, in EMD, the data is instead thought of as a superposition of fast oscillations onto slow oscillations [14]. EMD is designed to decompose those oscillations which intrinsically present in the signal.EMD decomposes signal into components called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) satisfying the following two conditions [1]: (a) The numbers of extrema and zero-crossings must be either equal or differ at most by one; (b) At any point, the mean value of the envelope defined by the local maxima and the envelope by the local minima is zero.Huang [1] also proposed an algorithm called ‘sifting’ to extract IMFsJk(t)from the original signalf(t):(1)f(t)=∑k=1KJk(t)+rK(t)whereJk(t),k=1,…,Kis IMFs andrKis the residue.The EMD is originally developed for one-dimensional (1D) data. Nunes [4] firstly extended it to two-dimensional BEMD, and decomposed images to bidimensional IMFs (BIMFs). The Bidimensional EMD (BEMD) process is conceptually the same as the one dimension EMD. The main process of the BEMD can be described as:Step 1 Find the location of local extrema (both maxima and minima) of the imageI(i,j);Step 2 Generate envelopes by maximum points (respectively, minima points) using 2D interpolation methods. Compute the local mean m as the average of upper and lower envelope;Step 3 Subtract the mean from the image to obtain a proto-BIMFr=I−mand judge whether r is a BIMF. If it is, go to Step 4. Otherwise, repeat Step 1 and Step 2 using the proto-BIMF r as input, until the latest proto-BIMF turns to be a BIMF;Huang proposed the Cauchy standard deviation (SD) criterion to judge a BIMF in his original paper [1], for the two-dimensional case, the SD criterion is:(2)SD=∑i=1M∑j=1N(rk(i,j)−rk−1(i,j))2rk−12(i,j)if SD is larger than a threshold ε, repeat the step 1 to step 3 withrk(i,j)as the input, otherwise,rk(i,j)is a BIMFdk(i,j). Follow the method in Nunes [5], in this paper,ε=0.12is used as the SD criterion;Step 4 Input the proto-BIMF r to the loop from Step 1 to Step 3 to get the next remained BIMF until it cannot be decomposed further.After the BEMD, the decomposition of the image can be rewritten as following form:(3)I(i,j)=∑k=1Kdk(i,j)+rK(i,j)Thedk(i,j)is the kth BIMF of the images, andrK(i,j)is the residual function. The basic idea of the BEMD is to decompose a signal into the sum of these BIMFs and the residue function, so thatd1represents the highest frequency of I,d2represents the second highest frequency of I andrKrepresents the lowest frequency of I. The principle of BEMD is to extract variations from the data by separating the fluctuation from the mean [10].In our previous work [20], to reduce the overshooting problem of cubic interpolation in one dimensional EMD, we proposed using mean points to build the extrema mean approximation instead of building average of upper and lower envelope. For two-dimensional signal images, mean approximation is built with careful mean point definition in this paper and we further discuss the mean approximation generating method for two-dimensional in this section.The first step in ‘sifting’ is to find the local extrema points in image. Following the method in [11], neighbour location method is used to detect the local maxima or minima points. A pointu(i,j)is considered as a local maximum (or local minimum) if its value is strictly larger (or lower) than the value of u at the nearest 8-neighbours of points(i,j)[11].In previous BEMD methods, RBF based [5] or Delaunay based method [7] etc. is used to build the upper and lower envelopes from the maximum and minimum points. These methods, which first generate upper and lower envelopes and then compute the mean of these envelopes, can be denoted as ‘envelope mean’ methods. Different from these ‘envelope mean’ methods, we propose a ‘mean approximation’ method in this section.Definition 1Mean approximationMean approximation is an approximation surface generated from mean points of extrema points.Definition 2Mean pointMean point is the centroid point of a neighbour extrema points set. InK−1dimensional space, the K neighbour points are these points which one point as a starting point and otherK−1points as end points, formed a set of linear independent vectors.Set the extrema points are{u1,u2,…,uK}∈RK−1, from one pointukto otherK−1points form a set of vectors{uku1→,uku2→,…,ukuK→}. These vectors are linearly independent if there exist scalarsa1,a2,…,aK−1not all zero, such that(4)a1uku1→+a2uku2→+⋯+aK−1ukuK→=0These extrema points{u1,u2,…,uK}∈RK−1form a neighbour extrema points set. The centroid point of the finite set of K neighbour extrema points{u1,u2,…,uK}∈RK−1is(5)umean=1K∑i=1KuiIn two-dimensional, mean point is defined as a centroid of the triangle which triangle vertices are extrema points built by Delaunay triangular mesh in our discussion.In our method, the all extrema points (maximum or minimum) treated as the same. A pointu∈R2is called extrema point if it is either maximum point or minimum point. As illustrated in Fig. 1, we divide the spatial domain into triangular meshes which vertices are the extrema points. This can be built by Delaunay triangulation method [7,13]. In such a triangular mesh, any triangle does not overlap with any other triangles in the mesh and a vertex of a triangle is not in the interior of an edge of another triangle in the mesh [13]. As in [13], symmetric extension is employed to mirror the image boundary parts to extended parts. For more discussion about the triangular mesh by Delaunay method, one can find it in [7,9,13].Our method firstly generates the mean points by Delaunay triangulation and then uses these mean points as new triangular mesh vertices to generate the 2D approximation. As illustrated in Fig. 2,{uetr,p|p=1,2,3}are three neighbour extrema points, they form a triangle and are the vertices of this triangle. The mean pointumean(i,j)is defined as:The location(i,j)of mean pointumean(i,j)is defined as:(6)iumean=⌊iuetr,1+iuetr,2+iuetr,33⌋(7)jumean=⌊juetr,1+juetr,2+juetr,33⌋{uetr,p|p=1,2,3}is the neighbour three triangle vertices of mean pointsumean(i,j)in Delaunay triangular mesh.The value of mean pointumean(i,j)is defined as:(8)umean=∑p=13ωpuetr,pwhereωpis the weight. We propose two approaches to compute the value of mean pointsumean(i,j)at location(iumean,jumean). One is the centroid approach as the location method, which is denoted as Value-C; the other one is a distance-based weight approach, which is denoted as Value-W. For Value-C approach, theωpis an equal weight{ωp=1/3|p=1,2,3}; for Value-W approach, theωpis a distance based weight, which is defined as:(9)ωp=disp/∑p=13dispdispis the distance between theumean(i,j)and its neighbour triangle vertices{uetr,p(i,j)|p=1,2,3}, we use theL2distance to measure the distance:(10)disp=(iumean−iuetr,p)2+(jumean−juetr,p)2The mean pointumeanis a centroid of the triangle whose vertices are extrema points. In our definition, mean points represent the location information of extrema points (centroid) and the amplitude information of extrema points (centroid or distance based weigh). In the next step, we build triangular meshes with vertices being the mean points by Delaunay method, and then cubic interpolation on triangles.The method of generating a mean approximation in two-dimensional signal (2-Dimensional Mean Approximation Empirical Mode Decomposition, denoted as 2D-MAEMD) can be described as:Step 1 Find the location of local extrema (both maxima and minima) of the imageI(i,j). A pointu(i,j)is considered as a local maximum (or local minimum) if its value is strictly larger (or lower) than the value of u at the nearest 8-neighbours of points(i,j).Step 2-1 Merge all extrema points to a extrema points set{uetr=umax∪umin}. Generate a Delaunay triangular mesh inuetr.Step 2-2 Compute the mean points as the centroid of triangles in Delaunay triangular mesh. These mean points form a new mean points setumeanby equation (6) to (10).Step 2-3 Generate the 2D approximation by connecting mean points setumeanusing surface interpolation. Delaunay triangulation and then cubic interpolation on triangles are used in our work.Step 3 Subtract the mean from the image to obtain a proto-BIMFr=I−mand judge whether r is a BIMF. If it is, go to Step 4. Otherwise, repeat Step 1 and Step 2 using the proto-BIMF r as input, until the latest proto-BIMF turns to be a BIMF.Step 4 Input the proto-BIMF r to the loop from Step 1 to Step 3 to get the next remained BIMF until it cannot be decomposed further.In 2D-MAEMD method, the mean approximation is computed directly from mean points of extrema points instead of the average of upper and lower envelope. Our method reduces the computation complex by generating the 2D approximation at one time instead of two times which generates upper and lower envelopes. To simplify the discussion, we just consider the computation time of building envelopes mean and mean approximation in the following.Let the number of maximum points in image isPmax, and the number of minimum points in image isPmin, normally,Pmax≈Pmin. In following, we use P for short (P=Pmax≈Pmin). Let the size of image isM×N. According to the discussion in [8,17], for cubic spline interpolation, we have:For the envelop mean building:(11)Tenvelopmean=Tupperenvelop+Tlowerenvelop+Taverage=O(MN•log(MN))+O(MN•log(MN))+O(MN)For the mean approximation building:(12)Tmeanapproximation=Tmeanpoints+TapproximationThe consuming time of mean points set detection is the addition of consuming time of Delaunay triangular mesh building and the consuming time of points value and position computation. According to the computational geometry theory (Theorem 9.1 in [9]), any triangulation of P points set in the plane has2P−2−ttriangles, t denotes the number of points in P points set that lies on the boundary of the convex hull of P points set. We can ignore the t points and slack the number of triangles to2P−2.Let the arithmetic operations involved include addition (ADD), division (DIV). So we have (Value-C):(13)Tmeanpoints=TDelaunay+Tmeanpointscomputation=O(2P•log(2P))+(2•(2P)−2)•3•(2ADD+1DIV)≈O(2P•log(2P))+(12P−6)•(3ADD)≈O(P•log(P))+O(P)Then equation (12) can be rewrote as:(14)Tmeanapproximation=Tmeanpoints+Tapproximation≈O(P•log(P))+O(P)+O(MN•log(MN))and then,(15)Tenvelopmean−Tmeanapproximation≈O(MN•log(MN))+O(MN)−(O(P•log(P))+O(P))In the image condition, the number of pixels in a image with sizeM×Nis always larger than the number of extrema points P in the image (MN≫P), so theO(MN•log(MN))+O(MN)>O(P•log(P))+O(P), our method can reduce the mean generation computation time. In this case, we use the cubic spline interpolation as an example for discussion. In fact, no matter what envelop generation method is used, if the computation time of envelop generationTenvelop>Tmeanpoints=O(2P•log(2P))+(12P−6)•(3ADD), our method can reduce the average ‘sifting’ computation. At the same time, as has been discussed by Chen et al. [21], Wang et al. [17] and others, the number of extrema points P in the proto-IMF is reduced approximately by half as the IMF increased by one, which also make theTmeanpointsbe further reduced.In this section, we examine the image decomposition result effectiveness of proposed 2D-MAEMD. The BIMFs decomposed from the proposed method are compared with the results produced by other two BEMD-based methods (Damerval method [7] and Nunes method [5]), a multi-dimension based method fasted multi-dimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition (FM-EEMD) [16,17] and an optimal based method Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) [18,19]. VMD method used an optimal method to decompose the frequency components, we followed the parameters suggested in [19].In this section, a synthetic texture image and two real images are used to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental computer is Inter(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60 GHz. The platform is MATLAB R2012a. The synthetic texture image in this experiment is formed by three cosine function components. Fig. 3 shows a256×256synthetic texture image and its components, which is defined as:(16)f(i,j)=∑k=13Ck(i,j)(17)C1(i,j)=cos⁡(6πi)cos⁡(6πj)(18)C2(i,j)=cos⁡(2πi)cos⁡(2πj)(19)C3(i,j)=cos⁡(π12i)cos⁡(π12j)This experiment compares the decomposition result, computation time and orthogonality index. Orthogonality index is first proposed in [1] to measure the orthogonal among components, further, Chen [10] proposed the index of orthogonality asIOmax,IOaveand energy measurement IEC as:(20)IOmax:=maxk≠l|<dl,dk>|‖dl‖2‖dk‖2(21)IOave:=Averagek<l|<dl,dk>|‖dl‖2‖dk‖2(22)IEC:=∑i∑j∑l|dl(i,j)|2∑i∑j|I(i,j)−rK(i,j)|2The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is another widely used measure of the differences between values by a model and the values actually observed. The MSE is defined as:(23)MSE(x(i,j),xˆ(i,j))=∑i=1M∑j=1N(x(i,j)−xˆ(i,j))2M×Nwhere x is the decomposed component andxˆis the actual component.The synthetic image decomposition results by 2D-MAEMD and compared methods are shown in Figs. 4–9. As the figures showed, the proposed methods present better result than other methods. Lower frequency components (BIMF2 and residue) are not correctly decomposed by FM-EEMD and VMD method. VMD used an optimal method to decompose the frequency components, in this case, componentC1is decomposed into two separate components BIMF2 and BIMF3 and componentC2is decomposed as BIMF1. Other more suitable parameters may improve the VMD decomposition result. FM-EEMD method is a noise ensemble method, the decomposed noisy BIMF1 influences the last residue component, but the BIMF2 and BIMF3 by FM-EEMD are good approximations forC1andC2. In synthetic image case, we use BIMF2, BIMF3 and residue by FM-EEMD to compare with other methods. Additionally, for this synthetic texture image, decomposition results that are more similar to the original components are better. The proposed method can achieve better approximate components than compared methods.Table 1shows the performance of synthetic image decomposition comparison. The computation time shown in Table 1 is in seconds. In synthetic image case, the orthogonality index of our methods is smaller than other compared methods, but the IEC measurement is larger than others. This is because the BIMFs by proposed method are more similar to original components. In fact, the orthogonality index of original components isIOmax=0.0014,IOave=0.0007,IEC=0.9985which is closer to our methods (IOmax=0.0172,IOave=0.0016,IEC=0.98302D-MAEMD Value-W) than others.The MSE between BIMFs and original signal components are presented in Fig. 10. Our methods achieve lower values of MSE and are more similar results to original synthetic components than other methods. The BIMF2 and BIMF3 of VMD are added as one component to compute the MSE withC1and the BIMF1 of VMD is used to compared withC2. The MSEs of VMD method are much larger than other methods (MSE ofC1is 3374.3231, MSE ofC2is 52202.6334), which are not presented in Fig. 10.In BEMD processing, a total CPU time of EMD is dependent on the number of extrema points, the size of image, the amount times of ‘sifting’ decomposed and other system set-up expenses. In this case, as showed in Table 1, the sifting times of compared BEMD methods and our methods are the same, total time and average ‘sifting’ process computation of 2D-MAEMD are faster than other two BEMD-based methods. And the proposed method is much faster than the fast multi-EEMD [17] and optimal based VMD [18,19].The experiment in this section further examines the proposed and compared methods' performance on standard test images ‘Lena’ and ‘Elaine’. The original images are shown in Fig. 11. The ‘Lena’ image decomposition results are shown in Figs. 12–17. The ‘Elaine’ image decomposition results are shown in Figs. 18–23, respectively. Table 2and Table 3show the decomposition performance. The computation time showed in Table 2 and Table 3 is in seconds.We can see that the proposed approaches indeed give comparable results than other BEMD methods for orthogonality index and computation time. In mean points' detection processing, the values of detected mean points are averaged or weight averaged of maximum and minimum points. The value and position of mean points are decided by neighbour maximum and minimum points and represent more ‘local’ information than the average of upper and lower envelop. This may help the proto-BIMF represent more ‘local’ frequency and improve the decomposition result. At the same time, though the amount ‘sifting’ times of 2D-MAEMD is larger than other two BEMD-based methods, the total consuming time is still smaller than those two. The average ‘sifting’ process consuming time of 2D-MAEMD is much faster than other two BEMD-based methods and saves about40%of consuming time in each ‘sifting’ processing. Multi-EEMD and VMD consumed more time, but we can find the IEC of multi-EEMD give better result.Table 4lists the computation time of average ‘sifting’ processing of ‘Lena’ image in different sizes by the BEMD-based methods. With the size of image growing, the performance of the proposed methods become more faster than other two BEMD-based methods. When the size of the testing image growing, the number of pixels in a image with sizeM×Nis growing faster than the number of extrema points P in the image. So the increasing of consuming time of envelop generation (Tenvelop) is larger than the increasing of consuming time of mean points generation (Tmeanpoints). At the same time, as we have discussed before, the number of extrema points P is also reduced approximately by half though the BIMF decomposition and further reduces the computation time [21,17]. According to Table 4, computation time of average ‘sifting’ processing of proposed methods only took about52%∼60%of compared methods.In the last decades, image fusion has became an important and useful technique for image analysis and computer vision. Image fusion is to combine information from two or more images which present the same scene with difference sharp in different parts and present a clearer image than any original images [25]. As real world images are typically nonlinear and nonstationary, an adaptive approach will be more effective for image fusion [27]. Based on the proposed 2D-MAEMD, we further propose an image fusion scheme with BIMF components and a weight fusion rule, which further presents the effectiveness of the proposed 2D-MAEMD method.Based on the BEMD method, our fusion algorithm firstly uses 2D-MAEMD to decompose the input images to BIMFs components. Secondly, a standard deviation based fusion rule is used to fuse the BIMFs components. Lastly, the fusion image is obtained with simple composite.Suppose there are two input images A and B with sizeM×N. The fused image denotes as F. Images A and B are decomposed into a series of BIMFs and residual by use of 2D-MAEMD method as:(24)IA(i,j)=∑k=1KdA,k(i,j)+rA(i,j)(25)IB(i,j)=∑k=1KdB,k(i,j)+rB(i,j)The same level BIMFs from images A and B are fused with their corresponding components by a weighting factor in our method. If the difference between the BIMFs in the same level is negligible (κ=0.01), an average weigh factor (1/2) is used to fuse the BIMFs; otherwise, a standard deviation weigh factor is used to fuse the BIMFs. Standard deviation describes the distributing of point value in the image/BIMFs, bigger standard deviation denotes a clearer image [25,26].The fused component is achieved at the corresponding level BIMF by [25]:(26)dFk(i,j)={0.5⋅dIA(i,j)+0.5⋅dIB(i,j),if‖dIA(i,j)−dIB(i,j)‖2<κ,σAσA+σB⋅dIA(i,j)+σBσA+σB⋅dIB(i,j),otherwise(27)rK(i,j)={0.5⋅rA(i,j)+0.5⋅rB(i,j),if‖rA(i,j)−rB(i,j)‖2<κ,σAσA+σB⋅rA(i,j)+σBσA+σB⋅rB(i,j),otherwisewhere σ is the standard deviation defined as:(28)σ=∑i=1M∑j=1N(d(i,j)−d(i,j)‾)2M×NM and N are the size of BIMF,d‾is the mean of d, defined as:(29)d‾=1M×N∑i=1M∑j=1Nd(i,j)L2norm is used as measurement of the difference between the corresponding components.At last, the fusion image is obtained with simple composite:(30)F(i,j)=∑k=1KdFk(i,j)+rK(i,j)In this section, simulation result of the proposed 2D-MAEMD based fusion method are described. Experiments are performed on two groups of images and compare the proposed fusion method with other fusion methods such as wavelet-based scheme and PCA-based scheme [31].For wavelet-based scheme, the discrete stationary wavelet transform (DSWT) is first employed to input images to obtain their multi-scale components. And then the same level corresponding wavelet coefficients from different input images are fused by maximum rule and then composed back to the fused image using inverse wavelet transform [31]. The ‘sym2’ wavelet, together with a decomposition level of 2, is used in the DSWT-based methods. For PCA-based scheme, the input images are arranged in two column vectors and their means are subtracted. The eigenvector and eigenvalues of these vectors are computed and the eigenvectors corresponding to larger eigenvalue obtained to compute the normalized components [31].Two performances measurements are used for comparison. One is quality metricQabf[29], which presents the edge information of fused image. Let the input images be A and B, their fused image is F, theQabfis defined as [29,30]:(31)Qabf=∑i=1M∑j=1N(QijAF⋅gA,ij+QijBF⋅gB,ij)∑i=1M∑j=1N(gA,ij+gB,ij)whereQijAFandQijBFare edge information preservation values,gA,ijandgB,ijare weighted importance factors defined in [29].Normalized Feature Mutual Information (FMI) is also employed as a mean of assessing image fusion performance [30]:(32)FMIFAB=IFAHF+HA+IFBHF+HBwhereIFAandIFBare the amount of feature information of A and B defined in [30], andHA,HBandHFare the histogram based entropies of the images A, B, and F. Noted that the greater the value ofQabfandFMIFAB, the better the fusion result.The two groups of multi-focus images are: ‘clock’ and ‘Octec2’. The original multi-focus images are shown in Fig. 24. Fusion images by the proposed methods and compared methods are shown in Fig. 25and Fig. 26. Proposed 2D-MAEMD based schemes present clearer result than compared methods. Table 5shows the performance of fusion result. Our methods improved the fusion result compared with wavelet-based scheme [31], PCA-based scheme [31]. The adaptive decomposition BEMD methods present more effective than wavelet-based scheme in image fusion.
