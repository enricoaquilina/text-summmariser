@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Aspirin (ASA) is a commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which exerts its therapeutic effects through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) isoform 2 (COX-2), while the inhibition of COX-1 by ASA leads to apparent side effects. In the present study, the relationship between COX-1 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) and aspirin related side effects was investigated. The functional impacts of 37 nsSNPs on aspirin inhibition potency of COX-1 with COX-1/aspirin molecular docking were computationally analyzed, and each SNP was scored based on DOCK Amber score. The data predicted that 22 nsSNPs could reduce COX-1 inhibition, while 15 nsSNPs showed increasing inhibition level in comparison to the regular COX-1 protein. In order to perform a comparing state, the Amber scores for two Arg119 mutants (R119A and R119Q) were also calculated. Moreover, among nsSNP variants, rs117122585 represented the closest Amber score to R119A mutant. A separate docking computation validated the score and represented a new binding position for ASA that acetyl group was located within the distance of 3.86Å from Ser529 OH group. This could predict an associated loss of activity of ASA through this nsSNP variant. Our data represent a computational sub-population pattern for aspirin COX-1 related side effects, and provide basis for further research on COX-1/ASA interaction.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA), the most widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) has been prescribed for over 100 years, because of its analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties (Singh and Triadafilopoulos, 1999). Taking a daily dose of ASA would reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke as well as many age associated diseases (Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration, 2002). ASA irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX) or prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PGHS) by acetylating a serine residue at position 529 (human COX residue numbering through this paper), and places a bulky substituent on serine oxygen, which inhibits binding of arachidonic acid (Scheme 1) (Roth and Majerus, 1975; Dewitt et al., 1990). COX enzyme with a molecular weight of 72kDa is a homodimeric, membrane-bound, hemoprotein and glycoprotein that is present in large amounts in the endoplasmic reticulum of prostanoid-forming cells (Smith, 1986). COX catalyses two separate cyclooxygenase (converting arachidonate to PGG2) and peroxidase (PGG2 go through a two-electron reduction to PGH2) reactions (Gierse et al., 1995), which only the cycloocygenase activity of the enzyme inhibited by ASA.There are two isozymes of COX that catalyze the first committed step in prostaglandin synthesis: COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues and blood platelets (Funk et al., 1991; Simmons et al., 1991). It produces cellular housekeeping functions of prostaglandins (Smith, 1989). On the other hand, COX-2 (which shares 62% amino acids identity with COX-1) is an inducible form, which is expressed during inflammation (Xie et al., 1991; Fletcher et al., 1992). ASA inhibits both isozymes of COX, but with a greater potency for COX-1 (Blobaum and Marnett, 2007).Besides its therapeutic effects, nearly 25% of individuals NSAIDs show some type of side effects, such as gastrointestinal dysfunctions (Bloom, 1988). In a study in United Kingdom, researchers indicated that, the responsible drug for over 60% of the deaths caused by adverse drug reactions is ASA (Pirmohamed et al., 2004). Variable drug response and side effects between individuals is attributed to genetic variations in genes that code for drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, or drug targets. The ASA therapeutic effects are achieved by COX-2 inhibition, nevertheless COX-1 inhibition leads to side effects (Crofford, 1997).Through personalized medicine strategies, researchers conducted series of experimental studies to classify ASA targets DNA polymorphism based on their effects on drug response or reactions. For instance, Halushka et al. reported that A-842G/C50T(P17L) haplotype was in association with increased potency of ASA as compared with the common allele based on linkage analysis (Halushka et al., 2003). To date, there is no complete information regarding the importance of the side effects of ASA and individual’s genotype variability. This study was undertaken to clarify the impact of COX-1 gene SNPs which could alter the amino acids on ASA/COX-1 interaction. The data could indicate that among the nsSNPs examined, individuals with a particular nsSNP can experience therapeutic effects of ASA with a minimal side effects. However, for determining the exact genetic background of the individuals in response to ASA all the examined nsSNPs should be genotyped.The humanized crystal structure of COX-1 was performed by mutagenizing the residues differing between human and sheep, and then was regularized with BuildModel command of FoldX version 3b5.1 (Guerois et al., 2002; Schymkowitz et al., 2005). Applied amino acid changes are summarized in Table S1 (see Supplementary material).In order to simulate the favorable position and orientation of intact ASA for acetylating Ser529, flexible docking of ASA in a monomer of COX-1 was accomplished with UCSF DOCK program version 6.4 (Allen et al., 1979; Kuntz, 1992). The basic requirement for docking in DOCK6.4 is a complex crystal structure of ASA/COX-1. Therefore, the co-crystallized ligand of 1Q4G (alpha-methyl-4-biphenylacetic acid) was replaced with ASA using guided ligand replacement (GLR) tool of PHENIX program version 1.7.2-869 (Adams et al., 2010).All SNPs of COX-1 gene were obtained from dbSNP version 2013.8.16 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) and only nsSNPs were chosen for further analysis. To configure the PDB files of protein variants containing specific nsSNP, the BuildModel command of FoldX was executed to mutagenize the amino acid of an nsSNP site. Finally, the predicted binding affinity between ASA and each protein variant with DOCK AMBER score was described using AMBERDOCK tool of DOCK6.4 (Graves et al., 2008), which calculates the binding free energy of protein variants with the given ASA position-orientation docking output.ASA is a widespread used medicine with many beneficial effects that made tremendous excitement for investigators to eliminate ASA side effects, and develop selective COX-2 inhibitors. The therapeutic effects of ASA are carried out by COX-2 inhibition. However, COX-1 is also the primary target of ASA, due to its structural similarities to COX-2, and therefore, experiencing side effects by the individuals who take ASA. Our aim of this investigation was to bring prescribing of ASA into a personalized medicine perspective, and to prepare a subpopulation pattern based on nsSNP polymorphisms data of COX-1. This could elucidate that which individual (genotype) would take advantage of using aspirin in association with showing no or minimal side effects. Because of limited information in this area, a detailed computational study was performed to elucidate COX-1 structural modeling.The proper human COX-1 3D coordinate for our computational analysis is not available in Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/). As an alternative way, we obtained the human COX-1 (Swiss Prot accession no. P23219) amino acids sequence from SWISS-PROT protein sequence data bank (http://www.expasy.org/sprot/) and aligned using NCBI’s protein-BLAST program to find the homologous sequences (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). The most similar sequence structure to human COX-1 is Ovis aries (sheep), which shares 96% sequence identity among all available PDBs. For this sequence the best resolved structure was 1Q4G at 2Å resolution (Gupta et al., 2004). All the interactive visualization and producing molecular graphic figures were carried out with UCSF Chimera package (Pettersen et al., 2004). Humanizing the structure of COX-1 protein was performed by FOLDX mutagenesis. The energy calculations demonstrated the compatibility of humanized structure and the sheep variation. Moreover, van der Waals’ clashes were 0.02Kcal/mol, below the error margin of FoldX (0.5Kcal/mol).Given the completion of the humanized structure of COX-1, 37 nsSNPs were chosen and their protein variant structures were prepared (van der Waals’ were blew the 0.02Kcal/mol).ASA inactivates COX-1 through covalent modification. Therefore, to predict the influence of nsSNPs influence on COX-1 structure and sequentially the ASA interaction, the whole computations were focused on the likelihood of starting acetylation reaction between intact ASA and different protein variants in the active site. With this purpose, at first flexible ligand docking of ASA and COX-1 monomer was performed. It should be noted that the protein structure was kept rigid. In our docking process, 80 sphere clusters complementary to the protein surface were generated. In the next step, 54 sphere clusters were selected according to the active site of the enzyme within 10.0Å RMSD from every atom of simulated ASA with the PHENIX program (Fig. 1). Cyclooxygenase active site lies at the end of a 25Å hydrophobic channel, whose walls were defined by four alpha helices. The ASA binding site corresponds to this active site from Arg119 to near Tyr384 (Picot et al., 1994).The principal of our flexible docking was based on the calculated force field scores with GRID command including chemical and contact scores. The docking parameters were set to score the best three binding position of ASA (Fig. 2).The efficiency and selectivity properties of ASA are somewhat astonishing because no neighboring groups such as glutamate and histidine are present in the vicinity of Ser529 to increase its nucleophilicity and reactivity (Dewitt et al., 1990). Since, the reaction of other acetylating agents with COX-1 does not lead to acetylation of Ser529, it has been suggested that the cause of this selective acetylation was due to salicylic acid moiety (Wells and Marnett, 1992). The only residue with positive charge in the active site is Arg119, which is located 9.7Å below the hydroxyl group of Ser529. Consequently, this resulted in a well-positioned situation to arrange the binding of salicylic acid moiety near Ser529 (Loll et al., 1995). Loll et al. illustrated that the hydroxyl group of Tyr384 and carbonyl oxygen of the bromoacetyl group in bromoacetylaspirin-COX-1complex were within H-bonding distance. This could suggest stabilizing the negative charge on the putative tetrahedrial intermediate during acetylation process, and therefore, increasing the reactivity of the acetyl group of ASA near the site of Ser529 would increase (Loll et al., 1995). Experimental site-directed-mutagenesis of Arg119 and Tyr384 (the reduced potency on R119Q, loss of function on R119A as well as loss of activity on Y384F mutants) suggested a critical role for these two residues (Hochgesang et al., 2000), According to these facts and in line with Tosco and Lazzarato docking results (Tosco & Lazzarato, 2009), the favorable binding pose in the active site was complex c, which represents orientation of ASA just before the acetylation process occurred (Fig. 2c). The occurrence of acetylation is supported by the fact that the distance within carbon of acetyl group and Ser529 OH group was 2.67Å which was less than 3.5Å. Moreover, the position of carboxylate group was compatible with the hypothesis of Arg119 initial ion pairing and was facing Arg119. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, in spite of lower energy, complexes a and b do not represent a well positioned carboxylate group due to Arg119. Consequently, the simulated ASA of complex c was used for further nsSNP scoring computations.To determine the impact of each nsSNP on COX-1 protein structure, and therefore the efficiency of ASA in acetylation of Ser529, DOCK AMBER score computation was accomplished. These computations could evaluate binding of the simulated ASA binding pose (ligand in complex c) and COX-1 nsSNP protein variants.The Amber score is calculated as: Ecomplex–(Ereceptor+Eligand), where the Es are, the internal energies as approximated by the Amber force field (Wang et al., 2004). Comparing different Amber scores are due to existence of an identical parameter (ligand or protein) in the computations. In this study, the identical parameter is the simulated ligand in complex c, which kept rigid in the Amber score process. This indicated that the ligands internal energy (Eligand) of all Amber score computations were identical. Therefore, the different values of Amber scores could be due to different protein variants.The importance of Arg119 for interaction of ASA with COX-1 has been documented, and the impact of R119A and R119Q mutants on the interaction has been experimentally defined (Hochgesang et al., 2000). Therefore, to perform comparing state, in addition to regular protein and nsSNP variants, the Amber scores for R119A and R119Q mutants were calculated (Table 1).In the present investigation, the calculated Amber scores, which represent binding free energies of COX-1 nsSNP variant–ASA complexes, were evaluated. This evaluation was made according to the fact that the more negative Amber score, the bigger binding free energy and the stronger interactions in the complex, and lead to increased potency of ASA acetylation and inhibition. The impact of each nsSNP could be understandable by comparing reported Amber scores of nsSNP variant and the regular protein included in Table 1. Intriguingly, Amber scores of two previously experimentally performed site directed mutagenesis (R119Q and R119A) were found to be in line with our computational predictions (Hochgesang et al., 2000).As mentioned above, R119A mutant showed loss of ASA activity. In our study, R119A represented the least negative Amber score among investigated variants that could be predicted as loss of ASA activity. Moreover, R119Q, which reported to have a reduced ASA potency by Hochgesang et al., showed more negative and less negative Amber score in comparison to the regular protein and R119A variant, respectively. Therefore, R119Q score could be explained as reduced potency of ASA in acetylation of COX-1.In the present study, 37 COX-1 nsSNPs were investigated. Among the analyzed nsSNPs, twenty two showed less negative and fifteen showed more negative Amber scores in comparison to the regular protein (see Chart S1, see Supplementary material). The most important one was rs117122585, which showed very similar score to R119A mutant. Comparing scores of rs117122585 and regular variant complexes represent weak interactions of rs117122585 complex, which would suggest that the pose of ASA (ligand pose of complex c) was not the best one for this protein variant. Hence, a new docking simulation for rs117122585 protein variant and ASA was executed.The docking result showed 2.10Å downward shift of acetyl group in comparison to the position in regular protein, which validated less negative score of the complex. In the new position, the distance between carbon of acetyl group and Ser529 OH was found to be 3.86Å, that is not presumable that acetylation could occur (Fig. 3). Consequently, the above findings confirmed our prediction on the Amber score. The Amber score and docking result could predict the loss of ASA potency to inhibit this nsSNP protein variant. These data suggested that no COX-1 related side effects by people who carrying this nsSNP could be expected. In contrast, this nsSNP variant could be considered as an advantage for ASA in these people. In the next step, our Amber score data on other nsSNP variants (see above) showed that 8 nsSNPs including rs181947887, rs185497478, rs5787, rs10306140, rs3842792, rs60893133, rs144142084 and rs5793 were more noteworthy than the other thirteen (with less negative Amber scores). These eight nsSNP complexes were found to have less negative Amber scores than R119Q mutant. These data suggested that these nsSNP variants could be introduced for analyzing reduced ASA potency with more certainty.Moreover, based on the difference of the Amber scores, it could be predicted that ASA might inhibit the above nsSNP variants with the same or reduced inhibition level in comparison to R119Q mutant. For instance, rs5793 nsSNP variant (Amber score −2.010448) is expected not to inhibit or show very low inhibition level by ASA. However, in spite of ASA reduced potency of R119Q mutant (Amber score −2.250692), a higher level of inhibition compared with rs5793 nsSNP variant could be expected. In the present study, the exact prediction of the influence of nsSNPs on ASA inhibition was relied on the known experimental site directed mutagenesis, the accurate inhibition level of other 13 nsSNPs was not predictable.Together, it was clear that the less negative score of these nsSNPs, the less level of ASA inhibition. In contrast, it was noted that fifteen nsSNP variants including rs189207093, rs137938866, rs147131934, rs139521520, rs5789, rs61757787, rs139956360, rs151025665, rs10985630, rs143030223, rs77027063, rs5794, rs145989297 and rs137963114 were expected to have an increased ASA inhibition potency. This inhibition had more negative Amber scores than regular protein variant. These data represent a theoretical pattern of COX-1 related side effects of each nsSNP, and suggest that people with any of these nsSNPs would experience more side effects than those carrying regular variant of the protein.
