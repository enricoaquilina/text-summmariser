@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we propose a practical way to synthesize and filter an ECG signal in the presence of four types of interference signals: (1) those arising from power networks with a fundamental frequency of 50Hz, (2) those arising from respiration, having a frequency range from 0.05 to 0.5Hz, (3) muscle signals with a frequency of 25Hz, and (4) white noise present within the ECG signal band. This was done by implementing a multiband digital filter (seven bands) of type FIR Multiband Least Squares using a digital programmable device (Cyclone II EP2C70F896C6 FPGA, Altera), which was placed on an education and development board (DE2-70, Terasic). This filter was designed using the VHDL language in the Quartus II 9.1 design environment. The proposed method depends on Direct Digital Frequency Synthesizers (DDFS) designed to synthesize the ECG signal and various interference signals. So that the synthetic ECG specifications would be closer to actual ECG signals after filtering, we designed in a single multiband digital filter instead of using three separate digital filters LPF, HPF, BSF. Thus all interference signals were removed with a single digital filter. The multiband digital filter results were studied using a digital oscilloscope to characterize input and output signals in the presence of differing sinusoidal interference signals and white noise.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
–In all ECG devices, several digital FIR filters are used to select the ECG signal in the presence of different interference signals, the most important types of these filters are:Low pass filter (LPF) to remove the undesired high frequency noise signal.High pass filter (HPF) to remove the undesired low frequency noise signal.Band stop filter (BSF) to remove the noise signal for power line frequencies of 50, 60Hz.BSF to remove the noise signal for muscles with frequencies of 25, 35, 45Hz.In Ref. [1], Mbachu presents a method of designing LPF, HPF, BSF with Kaiser window where these three filters are serially connected to process the signal within the range (from 0 to 100Hz), and with order of 200 for every filter and with interference signals attenuation of 13dB.In Ref. [2], Verma presents a digital Notch filter design using Hamming window to remove the effect of power line interference (PLI) with frequency of 50Hz and attenuation of 13.4dB is obtained. Also, presents an adaptive filter design to remove the effect of PLI and attenuation of 34.2dB is obtained.In Ref. [3], Madhukar Narsale et al. present a digital Notch filter design with frequency of 50Hz and with band width of 45 to 55Hz by using FPGA with sampling frequency of 500Hz, and attenuation of 13dB.In Ref. [4], Sharma and Dalal present a digital FIR filter with order of 450 and different windows to remove the effect of PLI and attenuation of 18dB is obtained.The serial using of these filters for high order affects on the structure of ECG signal so that the diagnosis operation may be different from the real case of the patient.The proposed filter achieves the ECG signal filtering under different interference signals effects, these signals differ in frequency with ECG signal band width within range (from 0 to 150Hz), with a filter order of 1500 and attenuation factor of 40dB for various interference signals. Also, the filter has a linear phase response, this reduces the filtered signal distortions and makes the diagnosis operation close to the real case.In this research, the following tools and software are used:–Digital programmable device (Cyclone II EP2C70F896C6 FPGA, Altera), which was placed on an education and development board (DE2-70, Terasic).

the multiband digital filter are:FCHPF=0.5Hz,FCBSF0_EMG=25Hz,FCBSF0_PLI=50Hz,FCLPF=150Hz.Filter order is: N=M−1=1500.Stop-band attenuation factor is: −40dB.Maximum transition band widths is: 0.9Hz.Processing speed is 1501 operation of adding, shifting, multiplying, dividing and conversion operations can be done in 1ms (sampling period) for digital samples of 10 bits length, this equivalent to 1.5 million operation per second by using parallel processing, so the processing is done simultaneously in real time. Input data flow speed is 10-bits per 1ms(10×1×1000/(8×1024))=1.2207KB/s.There is a possibility to develop this algorithm through serial connection for several filters in order to get high degree of attenuation and low transition band width.The practical design results of the multiband digital filter were taken by digital oscilloscope of type GDS-1052U at different cases of interference signals effecting in time and frequency domains for the ECG signal after and before filtering.Fig. 15 shows on channel 1 of the oscilloscope the ECG signal which has the QRS components and synthesized by DDFS_ECG without the interference of signal effect before filtering and on channel 2 the ECG signal after filtering by multiband digital filter, and this ensures that the filter must not distort the signal after filtering because it has a linear phase response.Fig. 16 shows on channel 1 of the oscilloscope the ECG signal which is under the white noise effect placed within the pass band of the filter which results from different sources (sampling, internal noise of the amplifiers, and different electronic elements in ECG devices) and with SNRINP=8/1 before filtering and on channel 2 the ECG signal is shown after filtering by multiband digital filter, where the filter is considered as an average value filter.Fig. 17a shows the ECG signal before filtering and Fig. 17b shows the ECG signal after filtering in frequency domain where we note that the quantity of interference signal attenuation is 3dB.Fig. 18 shows on channel 1 of the oscilloscope the ECG signal which is under the sinusoidal interference signal effect placed within the pass band of the filter with frequency of 152Hz which results from different external sources and with SNRINP=2/1 before filtering and on channel 2 the ECG signal is shown after filtering by multiband digital filter, where the filter is considered as a LPF filter.Fig. 19a shows the ECG signal before filtering and Fig. 19b shows the ECG signal after filtering in frequency domain where we note that the quantity of the interference signal attenuation is 35dB.Fig. 20 shows on channel 1 of the oscilloscope the ECG signal which is under the interference signal effect placed within the pass band of the filter with frequency of 50Hz to test the stop band (from 47 to 53Hz) which results from power source and with SNRINP=2/1 before filtering and on channel 2, the ECG signal is shown after filtering by multiband digital filter, where the filter is considered as a BSF filter.Fig. 21a shows the ECG signal before filtering and Fig. 21b shows the ECG signal after filtering in frequency domain where we note that the quantity of the interference signal attenuation is 35dB.Fig. 22 shows on channel 1 of the oscilloscope the ECG signal which is under the interference signal effect placed on the pass band of the filter with frequency of 25Hz to test the stop band (from 22 to 28Hz) which results from muscles signal effect and with SNRINP=2/1 before filtering and on channel 2, the ECG signal is shown after filtering by multiband digital filter in time domain, where the filter is considered as a BSF filter.Fig. 23a shows the ECG signal before filtering and Fig. 23b shows the ECG signal after filtering in frequency domain where we note that the quantity of the interference signal attenuation is 35dB.Fig. 24 shows on channel 1 of the oscilloscope the ECG signal which is under the interference signal effect placed on the pass band of the filter with frequency of 0.4Hz to test the stop band (from 0 to 0.5Hz) which results from breathing device effect and with SNRINP=2/1 before filtering and on channel 2, the ECG signal is shown after filtering by multiband digital filter in time domain, where the filter is considered as a HPF filter.Fig. 25a shows the ECG signal before filtering and Fig. 25b shows the ECG signal after filtering in frequency domain where we note that the quantity of the interference signal attenuation is 13dB.
