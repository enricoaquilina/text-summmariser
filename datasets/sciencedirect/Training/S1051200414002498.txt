@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Interference mitigation is one of the main challenges in wireless communication, especially in ad hoc networks. In such context, the Multiple Access Interference (MAI) is known to be of an impulsive nature. Therefore, the conventional Gaussian assumption is inadequate to model this type of interference. Nevertheless, it can be accurately modeled by stable distributions. In fact, it was shown in literature that the α-stable distribution is a useful tool to model impulsive data. In this paper, we tackle the problem of noise compensation in ad hoc networks. More precisely, this issue is addressed within an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmission link assuming a symmetric α-stable model for the signal distortion due to MAI. Based on Bayesian estimation, the proposed approach estimates the transmitted OFDM symbols in the time domain using the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. Unlike existing schemes, we consider the more realistic case where the impulsive noise parameters are assumed to be unknown at the receiver. Consequently, our approach deals also with the difficult task of noise parameters estimation which can be very useful for other purposes such as target tracking in wireless sensor networks or channel estimation. Simulations results, provided in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Bit Error Rate (BER), illustrate the efficiency and the robustness of this scheme.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the last few years, the great technological evolution in the field of wireless communication led to the emergence of sensor and ad hoc networks. Such networks consist of mobile devices that are likely to communicate with each other through wireless radio. Their specific infrastructure is one of the main reasons that caused the emergence of several problems [1]. Interference reduction is liable to be considered as one of the most important challenges in ad hoc networks. In fact, years ago, it has brought a great interest and many researches have been around dealing with this issue [2–6].Interference is due to the accumulation of signals radiated by nodes belonging to the considered network and/or external transmitters. Consequently, the amount of interference of a given node v corresponds to the number of other nodes whose transmission range covers v[2]. The ad hoc configuration gives to the Multiple Access Interference (MAI) an impulsive nature: the interfering pulses' amplitude may importantly vary and the MAI is conditioned by the presence of strong interferers. In practice, one of the most adopted solutions to mitigate interference is to reduce nodes' transmission power [3–5]. However, this solution affects the connectivity which is a basic property of ad hoc networks [7]. So, we are mainly concerned with searching for the most suitable method allowing interference mitigation while preserving the network's connectivity. More precisely, this issue is addressed considering an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmission link. Generally, OFDM systems are rather robust against impulsive noise due to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operation at the receiver that spreads the impulse over all the subcarriers. As long as the impulse does not contain too much energy, it does not influence much the transmission quality. However, the presence of an impulsive noise having high values can strongly degrade the system performance unless efficient compensation techniques are implemented [8].In the literature, several approaches have been proposed to compensate the effect of impulsive noise in OFDM systems. A classical technique of reducing the effect of impulsive noise is to precede the OFDM receiver with memoryless nonlinearity [9]. This technique is widely used in practice since it is very simple to implement and improves the communication performance of conventional OFDM systems in the presence of impulsive noise. However, it remains suboptimal and the detection of impulsive noise samples in an OFDM context is subject to errors. Other methods exploit specific properties of OFDM systems. In [10], Wolf considers the Inverse Fourier Transform (IFT) as a channel coding operation where pilot symbols are used for redundancy. Additionally, Abdelkefi et al. [11,12] propose to use the similarity between Reed–Solomon codes in the complex field and the OFDM system. The proposed decoding algorithm uses techniques that are similar to those used by Wolf [10] but these techniques are applied in a more general case. Indeed, rather than appending consecutive zeros in the frequency domain, the authors consider the use of pilots that are scattered along the carriers. Taking advantage of the sparse nature of the time domain impulsive noise, Caire [13] proposes a Compressed Sampling (CS) based method for impulsive noise cancellation where the null subcarriers are used to estimate the impulsive noise. In [14], a similar method was very recently proposed by Al-Naffouri et al. Indeed, like in [13], the authors make use of the null subcarriers to estimate and cancel the impulsive noise. However, instead of employing CS based on convex relaxation methods to estimate the impulsive noise, Al-Naffouri et al. jointly exploit the specific structure of the problem together with the available a priori statistical and sparsity information to obtain nearly optimal estimates at low complexity. Those approaches [11,13,14] behave well but it is not really convenient to use pilot symbols for something else than signalization. Moreover, the use of pilot symbols reduces the system spectral efficiency. In [15], the authors extend the CS algorithm proposed in [13] to a sparse Bayesian learning approach and two non-parametric algorithms are proposed to cope with the same problem. Although decoding techniques can lead to significant reduction of noise effects, they present the deficiency to be highly sensitive to the presence of Gaussian background noise. Recently, an iterative decoding algorithm over the Complex Numbers (CN) codes for impulsive noise channel was proposed by Haring and Vinck [16]. In spite of its good performance, the iterative decoding algorithm may introduce important communication delays as it has to be applied to each OFDM symbol. Also, the complexity of this algorithm is significant.In this paper, we are interested in exploiting the non-Gaussian behavior of the interference in order to limit its effects. In the literature, several mathematical models for impulsive interference have been proposed. Middleton [17] developed two types of non-Gaussian models which can be applied to impulsive interference. Fiorina [18] models the MAI with a generalized Gaussian distribution. Considering the impulsive nature of the MAI, Erseghe [19] proposes to use a Gaussian mixture model for the interference. Beaulieu and Niranjayan [20] assume that the signal is immersed in a mixture of Laplacian and Gaussian noise. Several works also rely on stable distributions to model the interference [21–25] despite the limits due to the unbounded path-loss model assumption [26]. In this paper, we chose to use the symmetric stable model for two main reasons. Firstly, the statistical properties of the α-stable distributions and the fact that Gaussians are special cases are important advantages of this approach. Secondly, this model results from a theoretical framework which gives an understanding of the model and its limits. Indeed, a general mathematical framework was recently proposed by Win et al. in [22]. They show the theoretical validity of the stable approach for different situations of interference in networks including ad hoc and cognitive radio. In [25], the authors suggest that the ad hoc configuration gives the shape of the MAI distribution which is then accurately represented by symmetric α-stable distributions. Taking advantage of this MAI modeling, a Bayesian approach is used dealing with the problem of interference mitigation by the joint estimation of the transmitted signal and the noise parameters.The lack of an analytical expression of their probability density function (pdf) makes difficult the use of a Bayesian estimation in the case of α-stable distributions. Therefore, only few works consider this issue. Among them, those of Buckle [27] that firstly emerged tackling this problem mainly aiming to make inference for all the parameters of stable noise. The proposed approach is based on a Gibbs sampler: a particular method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Moreover, a based MCMC method jointly with Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) scheme is applied by Godsill [28] in the case of symmetric α-stable noise. In [29], Godsill proposes an extension of his own work considering an alternative MCMC algorithm: the slice sampler. Additional works conducted by Lombardi [30] introduce a random walk MCMC method in order to make a Bayesian inference within the context of stable distributions. In another context related to a symmetric α-stable noise, Lombardi et al. [31,32] propose a Bayesian filtering and smoothing approach for Time Varying AutoRegressive (TVAR) models. A Scale Mixtures of Normals (SMiN) representation of the considered noise is used in this approach which is based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to compensate the effect of impulsive interference in OFDM systems based on the work conducted by Lombardi et al. [31,32]. Unlike existing methods that address impulsive noise mitigation in OFDM systems, we consider the difficult task where impulsive noise parameters are assumed unknown at the receiver which is a more realistic case. Indeed, the proposed approach is able to reconstruct the useful OFDM signal but also to estimate the parameters related to the impulsive noise using a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF). This parameter estimation of the impulsive noise characteristics could thus be used by the receiver in order to address and improve other inference tasks if needed: channel estimation, target localization or tracking, etc. Moreover, the proposed scheme has the great advantage of being bandwidth more efficient since it does not require the use of pilot symbols unlike previous publications. Finally, the proposed method could be used without any modifications for its implementation in different OFDM system configurations.The present paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, some preliminary definitions related to the α-stable distribution and its properties are presented. In Section 3, we introduce the OFDM system's model and its state space representation. Section 4 is devoted to the description of the proposed Particle Filter (PF) to estimate both of the multicarrier signal and the noise parameters. Simulation results are presented in Section 5 and conclusions are drawn through Section 6.Some properties of α-stable distributions, mainly those used in this work, are presented in this section; a more complete description can be found in [24,33].The stable distribution can be seen as a generalization of the Gaussian distribution. It has many interesting properties which made it an attractive statistical model. Two of the most important properties are the linear stability property and the Generalized Central Limit Theorem. One difficulty is that it has no closed-form expression for its pdf. It can be most conveniently described by its characteristic function as follows [24]:φ(t)={exp⁡(iμt−γ|t|α[1+iβsgn(t)tan⁡απ2]),ifα≠1exp⁡(iμt−γ|t|α[1+iβsgn(t)2πlog⁡|t|]),ifα=1Thus, the stable distribution is completely determined by four parameters α, β, γ and μ where:•α∈]0,2]is the characteristic exponent. It measures the heaviness of the tails of the distribution. In fact, the smaller the value of α, the heavier the probability mass in the tails of distribution (see Fig. 1(a)).μ∈Ris the location parameter. It corresponds to the median when0<α≤1and to the mean when1<α≤2(see Fig. 1(b)).γ>0is the scale parameter. It determines the spread of density around the location parameter μ (see Fig. 1(c)).β∈[−1,1]is the symmetry parameter. Whenβ=0the distribution is symmetric about μ. It is positive whenβ=1and negative whenβ=−1(see Fig. 1(d)).To denote an α-stable distribution with parameters α, β, γ and μ, we will use the conventional notationSα(β,γ,μ). An α-stable distribution is said to be standard whenγ=1andμ=0. For standardized stable distribution we will use the notationSα(β).The α-stable distribution pdf can be obtained analytically only for a few particular cases:α=2, corresponding to the Gaussian distribution,α=1andβ=0, yielding the Cauchy distribution, and finallyα=12andβ=1for the Lévy distribution.The following paragraph describes the representation of an α-stable distribution as a SMiN. This representation is of a great interest for the use of SMC methods as it will be shown later in the paper.The product of two α-stable variables satisfies the following property [33]:Let X andY>0be two independent random variables withX∼Sα1(.,.,.)andY∼Sα2(1,.,.). ThenXY1α1is stable with characteristic exponentα1α2.So the product of an α-stable variable X with a positive α-stable variable Y raised to the power1α1is also an α-stable variable with characteristic exponentα1α2.Let us consider a symmetric α-stable variableZ∼Sα(0,γ,0). Applying the above property in the case ofα1=2(Gaussian case) andα2<1, leads to the following SMiN representation of a symmetric α-stable distribution [34,35,31]:Z=XY12whereX∼N(0,2γ2)andY∼Sα2(1,cos⁡(πα4)2α,0)In other words, the symmetric α-stable noise can be rewritten as a product of a standard Gaussian variable and a positive α-stable variable. Hence, by conditioning on Y, Z is Gaussian. This result will be used later to facilitate inference using SMC methods, since it avoids any direct evaluation of the noise density function which is intractable. Moreover, conditionally Gaussian model allows to apply the Rao-Blackwellization technique, which leads to more efficient results.In the signal processing literature, noise sources are often assumed to be Gaussian. However, in many fields, the conventional Gaussian noise assumption is not a reasonable choice and can lead to the loss of resolution and/or accuracy. This is particularly the case of a noise that exhibits impulsive nature. The latter is found in various areas [36–40], especially in ad hoc networks [21,41]. In fact, impulsive noise tends to produce large amplitude excursions from the average value more frequently than Gaussian signals. It contains sharp spikes or occasional bursts. As a result, its pdf decays in the tails less rapidly than the Gaussian pdf [24]. The α-stable distribution is suitable for modeling this type of noise since their tails are more heavier than those of Gaussian distribution.As the α-stable distribution has known a great success in recent years, several works considered this modeling. This choice has been proved to be efficient in many areas such as audio and speech fields [31,32].In this section, we will firstly present some basic concepts of OFDM systems which are essential for understanding the rest of the paper; for more description see [42,43]. Thereafter, the dynamic model will be introduced.The block diagram of the considered OFDM system is illustrated in Fig. 2.•N andNcpdenote respectively the number of subcarriers and the cyclic prefix length.The bit stream is mapped into M-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (M-QAM) symbolsdn,i, where i denotes the ith subcarrier and n denotes the nth OFDM symbol.The resulting symbol stream is demultiplexed into a vector of N M-QAM symbols,dn=[dn,0⋯dn,N−1]T.After the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT), the obtained time domain signal is composed of N samplessn,t′that can be written as follows:sn,t′=1N∑i=0N−1dn,iexp⁡(j2πitN)fort=0,...,N−1A cyclic prefix of lengthNcpis introduced to avoid the Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) (see Fig. 3). The resulted signal is composed ofN+Ncpsamples{sn,t}t=0N+Ncp−1defined as:(1)sn,t={sn,t−Ncp+N′if0≤t≤Ncp−1sn,t−Ncp′ifNcp≤t≤N+Ncp−1The signal is serially transmitted in a time varying frequency selective channelh(t,τ)which is characterized by L independent propagation paths. We assume that the channel is static over several OFDM symbols. Assuming perfect time synchronization, the nth received OFDM symbol can be expressed as follows:(2)[rn,N+Ncp−1rn,N+Ncp−2⋮rn,Ncp⋮rn,0]︸rn=[hn,0hn,1⋯hn,L−10⋯00hn,0hn,1⋯n,L−1⋱⋮⋮⋱⋱⋱00⋯0hn,0hn,1⋯hn,L−1]︸Hn[sn,N+Ncp−1sn,N+Ncp−2⋮sn,Ncp⋮sn,0sn−1,N+Ncp−1⋮sn−1,N+Ncp−L+1]︸sn+wnwhere vectorsrn,snandwnhave the following respective sizes(N+Ncp,1),(N+Ncp+L−1,1),(N+Ncp,1)and the matrixHnis the channel impulse response of size(N+Ncp,N+Ncp+L−1).wncorresponds to the additive noise which takes into account the channel distortions. In the context of ad hoc networks, communications are affected by MAI and thermal noise. The thermal noise can be accurately modeled as a Gaussian distribution. However, the MAI shows an impulsive behavior and it has been shown that the symmetric α-stable distribution is an accurate model for the network interference [22,25]. Therefore, we assume here that the transmitted signal is corrupted by both white Gaussian noisevnand symmetric α-stable noiseun:(3)wn=vn+unAt the receiver, the inverse process of the transmitter is performed. After discarding the cyclic prefix, the received signal is fed to a serial to parallel converter. The resulting signal is demodulated using FFT. Thereafter, a decoding step using M-QAM scheme is performed to obtain the initial bit sequence.In this paper, we propose a time domain approach based on Bayesian estimation to jointly estimate the OFDM symbol and the impulsive noise parameters. In a Bayesian context, the estimation process requires a dynamic state-space (DSS) model system which includes both state and observation equations. The DSS model considered in this work, that was proposed in [44,45], will be described in the following paragraphs.The received signalrn,tcan be expressed before the removal of the cyclic prefix as follows:(4)rn,t=∑l=0L−1hn,lsn,t−l+vn,t+un,tfort=0,...,N+Ncp−1wherevn,tandun,tare respectively the Gaussian and the impulsive noise components. This observation equation takes into account the insertion of the cyclic prefix and the ISI due to the multipath channel, using the following definition ofsn,tfort<0:(5)sn,t=sn−1,N+Ncp+tift<0In matrix form, Eq. (4) can be rewritten as(6)rn,t=hnTsn,t+vn,t+un,tfort=0,...,N+Ncp−1where(7)hn=[hn,0⋯hn,L−101×(N+Ncp−1)]Tand the vectorsn,tis defined as the serial concatenation of the transmitted time domain samples(8)sn,t=[sn,t⋯sn,−L+101×(N+Ncp−t−1)]TIn fact,sn,thas a fixed sizeN+Ncp+L−1. To take into account the ISI owing to the multipath channel, the symbol vector corresponding to the nth OFDM symbol contains theL−1time domain samples from the previousn−1th OFDM symbol. Therefore, we initialize the vector of the nth OFDM symbol as follows:sn,0=[sn,0sn−1,N+Ncp−1⋯sn−1,N+Ncp−L+101×(N+Ncp−t−1)]TAt each time t,sn,tis obtained by shifting the elements of the previous vectorsn,tand adding the new samplesn,tsent by the transmitter (Fig. 4).We assume here that the impulsive noise componentun,tis a symmetric α-stableut∼Sα(0,γ,0). Exploiting the SMiN representation of a symmetric α-stable variable,un,tcan be expressed as follows [31]:un,t=λn,twn,twhereλn,t∼Sα2(1,cos⁡(πα4)2α,0)andwn,t∼N(0,2γ2)In addition, considering thatvn,tis a zero-mean Gaussian noise with varianceσ2, the observation equation becomes(9)rn,t=hnTsn,t+dn,twn,twheredn,t=2γ2λn,t+σ2.Due to the introduction of the cyclic prefix, the multicarrier signal may be characterized as a cyclostationary process. Using this property and the assumption of the independence between different samples of an OFDM symbol, we derive the following property:(10)E[sn,ksn,l⁎]={1,ifk=l+zNwithz∈Zandk∈[−Ncp;N−1]0,otherwiseAccording to the central limit theorem, the envelope of the multicarrier signal can be approximated as a circular Gaussian distributed random variable. A rigorous proof given in [46] establishes that the complex envelope of a bandlimited uncoded OFDM signal converges weakly to a Gaussian random process. Based on these results, Septier et al. [44,45] proposed an autoregressive modeling of the time-domain multicarrier signal. Using this model, the state equation of the vectorsn,tcan be written in the matrix form as(11)sn,t=An,tsn,t−1+bn,twhere the transition matrixAn,tis defined as:[ξn,tTI(N+Ncp+L−2)0(N+Ncp+L−2)×1]with, taking into account the insertion of the cyclic prefixξn,tT={[01×(N+Ncp+L−1)]T,if0≤t≤N−1[01×(N−1)101×(Ncp+L−1)]T,ifN≤t≤N+Ncp−1andbn,tis a Zero-mean Gaussian noise vector whose covariance matrix has a single non-zero valueE[bn,tbn,tH]=[σbn,t20⋯000⋮⋱⋮0⋯0]whereσbn,t2={1,if0≤t≤N−10,ifN≤t≤N+Ncp−1In fact, if the new samplesn,tbelongs to the cyclic prefix, it is then correlated with a sample of the previous vectorsn,tindicated by a one inξn,t. However, ifsn,tdoes not belong to the cyclic prefix, according to the independence property, we have no information about it and it can be seen as a noise sample. The rest of samples are shifted by one thanks to the identity matrix.Using the state equation (11) and the observation equation (9), we obtain the following DSS model:(12){sn,t=An,tsn,t−1+bn,trn,t=hn,tTsn,t+dn,twn,tBased on the below DSS model, we propose a time domain approach based on Bayesian estimation to jointly estimate the multicarrier signalsn,tand the α-stable noise parameters α, γ andλn,t. Let us note that we assume in this paper that the channel impulse response h and the AWGN varianceσ2are perfectly known by the receiver. For simplicity, the index of the OFDM symbol n is omitted in the following. The characteristic exponent α and the dispersion parameter γ are static parameters, so(13)αt=αt−1andγt=γt−1We denoteθt=[αtγtλt]Tthe time varying parameter vector.Consider the following general dynamic system described as(14){xt+1=f(xt,wt)yt=h(xt,vt)wherextis the state variable,ytis the measurement, f and h are two functions,wtis the process noise andvtis the measurement noise. The filtering problem for a such system (14), within a Bayesian framework, consists of computing the posterior pdf of the state vectorx0:t={xk,k=0,...,t}given the set of received observationsy0:t={yk,k=0,...,t}. However, the posterior pdf can be evaluated in closed form only in few specific cases including linear Gaussian state space model and finite state space Markov chains. In the first case, the analytical solution is obtained using the Kalman Filter (KF) [47] while in the second case it is given by the hidden Markov model filter. In other cases, where the dynamic system is nonlinear and/or non-Gaussian, approximation schemes must be employed. The standard approximation methods, such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) [48], are generally based on the assumption of linearity or Gaussianity in the model, which is not true in most nonlinear applications. Since the nineties, SMC methods, also known as PFs, have become a powerful methodology to cope with dynamic state estimation problems in general state space models, that may be both nonlinear and non-Gaussian [49–51,48]. These methods offer a number of significant advantages. Indeed, SMC methods are very flexible, easy to implement and applicable in very general settings. Moreover, they can be implemented on parallel machine efficiently due to their inherent parallelism [52,53]. Thanks to the exponential growth of computational power and the availability of parallel computers, SMC methods are already used in real-time applications appearing in fields as diverse as chemical engineering, computer vision, digital communications, localization, navigation, tracking and mobile robotics.The fundamental idea of the PF is to approximate the required posterior pdf by a set of M random numbers{x0:t(i),i=0,...,M}, called particles, with associated weights{ω˜t(i),i=1,...,M}p(x0:t|y0:t)≈∑i=1Mωt(i)δx0:t(i)(x0:t)where i is the particle's index,δ.(.)denotes the Dirac delta function andωt(i)=ω˜t(i)∑j=1Mω˜t(j)is the normalized weight associated to the ith particle. Each particlex0:t(i)is drawn from the importance functionq(x0:t|y0:t)and the associated weightω˜t(i)is updated using:ω˜t(i)=p(x0:t(i)|y0:t)q(x0:t(i)|y0:t)The Sequential Importance Sampling (SIS) method aims at computing an estimate of the required posterior pdf without modifying the previously simulated values of the state. For this purpose, the importance function should be constructed as follows:q(x0:t|y0:t)=q(x0:t−1|y0:t−1)q(xt|x0:t−1,y0:t)Then, the evaluation of the importance weights can be carried out recursively according to the following expression:ω˜t(i)=ω˜t−1(i)p(yt|xt(i))p(xt(i)|xt−1(i))q(xt(i)|x0:t−1(i),y0:t)Unfortunately, the SIS algorithm is known to suffer from degeneracy problems. Indeed, after a few iterations, the weights of several particles become very close to zero. In order to overcome this problem, we introduce a resampling step. The basic idea of resampling is to discard particles with low weights in favor of those highly weighted. As a measure of degeneracy, Liu and Chen have introduced in [54] the effective sample size defined as:Neff=1∑i=1M(ωt(i))2WhenNeffis under a predefined threshold, the resampling step can be applied. Several resampling methods have been proposed in the literature such as residual resampling [54], systematic resampling [55], etc. In this work, we employ the residual resampling.The main target of this work is to jointly estimate the transmitted multicarrier signal vectorstand the time varying parameter vectorθt. In the context of Bayesian estimation, we need to compute the joint posterior pdfp(st,θt|r0:t). However, this pdf is analytically intractable. Therefore, we propose to use SMC methods, introduced previously, in order to find an estimate of the required posterior pdf.More precisely, we employ the RBPF also known as the marginalized particle filter [56,57]. The latter is employed when the system is only partially linear and conditional Gaussian. Consequently, the linear component of the state variable can be marginalized out and estimated using an optimal linear filter. This is the basic idea conveyed by the Rao-Blackwellized PF.We can easily remark that by conditioning onθtour model becomes linear and Gaussian. We can then marginalize out the multicarrier signal vectorst. The joint posterior pdf can thus be written as:(15)p(st,θt|r0:t)=p(st|θt,r0:t)p(θt|r0:t)In Eq. (15), the first probability density can be obtained analytically using a KF. However, the second probability density is intractable and will be approximated by a PF as:(16)p(θt|r0:t)≃∑i=1Mω˜t(i)δθ˜t(i)(θt)Based on this, we obtain the following estimate of the joint posterior pdf(17)p(st,θt|r0:t)≃∑i=1Mω˜t(i)p(st|θ˜t(i),r0:t)where the probability densityp(st|θ˜t(i),r0:t)is Gaussian whose meansˆt|t(θ˜t(i))and covariance matrixΣt|t(θ˜t(i))are computed using a KF.To compute the meansˆt|t(θ˜t(i))and the covariance matrixΣt|t(θ˜t(i))of the probability densityp(st|θ˜t(i),r0:t)we applied the KF to the model described by Eqs. (11) and (9). The KF algorithm starts by respectively computing the predicted mean and covariance matrix using the time update equations(18){sˆt|t−1(θ˜t(i))=Atsˆt−1|t−1(θ˜t(i))Σt|t−1(θ˜t(i))=AtΣt−1|t−1(θ˜t(i))AtH+E[btbtH]rˆt|t−1(θ˜t(i))=hTsˆt|t−1(θ˜t(i))then the measurement update equations correct the statistics obtained previously by incorporating the new observation(19){St(θ˜t(i))=hTΣt|t−1(θ˜t(i))h⁎+dt2(θ˜t(i))Kt(θ˜t(i))=Σt|t−1(θ˜t(i))(hT)H(St(θ˜t(i)))−1sˆt|t(θ˜t(i))=sˆt|t−1(θ˜t(i))+Kt(θ˜t(i))(rt−rˆt|t−1(θ˜t(i)))Σt|t(θ˜t(i))=Σt|t−1(θ˜t(i))−Kt(θ˜t(i))hTΣt|t−1(θ˜t(i))whereSt(θ˜t(i))is the covariance matrix ofrt−rˆt|t−1(θ˜t(i))andKt(θ˜t(i))is the Kalman gain.Now, the posterior distribution of the multicarrier signal is identified, so the remaining task is the simulation of the particles in Eq. (17).The choice of the importance function is very important because it determines the efficiency and the complexity of the PF. Therefore, we must choose the importance function so that it helps to set up a non-complex filter while ensuring satisfactory results. There are several choices for the importance distribution for example the optimal importance function and the prior importance function [51]. In this work, we adopt the following importance function:(20)p(θt|θt−1(i))=p(λt|αt,γt)p(αt|αt−1(i))p(γt|γt−1(i))The parameterλtis a positive α-stable distribution. Its importance density is given by:p(λt)∼Sα2(1,cos⁡(πα4)2α,0)The characteristic exponent α and the dispersion parameter γ are static parameters. However, the estimation of such parameters using particle filtering intensifies the degeneracy problem. Considering this lack, we adopt the approach of artificial parameter evolution described in [50,31]. The sampling distribution of parameters α and γ are detailed in the following sections.The idea is to assume that the parameter α is time-varying by adding a small perturbation at each time pointαt=αt−1+ζtζt∼N(0,ϵt)Nevertheless, the main problem of this approach is the loss of information. The latter is due to the introduction of an additional variability to a parameter that is in fact static. In attempt to remedy this gap, authors propose in [50] a method based on sampling the updated values of the static parameter from a kernel smoothed density. Using this method helped to define the conditional density evolution as:p(αt|αt−1)=N(αt;dαt−1+(1−d)α¯t−1,h2Σt−1α)withh2=1−d2=1−3δ−12δ2whereα¯t−1andΣt−1αare respectively the mean and the covariance matrix of the Monte Carlo approximation ofp(α|r0:t−1)and δ is a discount factor in]0,1]. In [50], authors propose to choose its value around 0.95–0.99.As the characteristic exponent α, the importance density of the dispersion parameter γ is given as follows:p(γt|γt−1)=N(γt;dγt−1+(1−d)γ¯t−1,h2Σt−1γ)whereγ¯t−1andΣt−1γare respectively the mean and the covariance matrix of the Monte Carlo approximation ofp(γ|r0:t−1).Considering the importance function described previously, importance weights are updated according to:(21)ω˜t(i)∝p(rt|θ˜t(i),r0:t−1)p(θ˜t(i)|θt−1(i))q(θ˜t(i)|θ0:t−1(i),r0:t)∝ω˜t−1(i)p(rt|θ˜t(i),r0:t−1)In our case, the densityp(rt|θ˜t(i),r0:t−1)is Gaussian(22)p(rt|θ˜t(i),r0:t−1)=N(rt;rˆt|t−1(θ˜t(i)),St(θ˜t(i)))whererˆt|t−1(θ˜t(i))andSt(θ˜t(i))are respectively the innovation and the innovation covariance of the Kalman filter.At each time point t, the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimate of the multicarrier signalsˆtand the symmetric α-stable noise parametersγˆtandαˆtare respectively estimated according to the following expressions:(23)sˆt=∑i=1Mωt(i)sˆt|t(θt(i))(24)γˆt=∑i=1Mωt(i)γt(i)(25)αˆt=∑i=1Mωt(i)αt(i)Consequently, the MMSE estimate of the transmitted multicarrier signal is obtained at the end of the nth OFDM symbol,sˆN+Ncp−1.Finally, the proposed RBPF for interference mitigation, denoted by FPRB-ECSB, is summarized in Algorithm 1.In order to show the validity of our approach, several simulations have been conducted. Hereafter some details of the experiments carried out. The considered OFDM system is set with the following parameters: a Rayleich frequency selective channel withL=4paths, an OFDM symbol withN=64subcarriers, and a cyclic prefix ofNcp=8samples. Each subcarrier is arbitrarily modulated using 16-state quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM). With regard to the proposed PF parameters, we suppose that the parameter α is uniformly distributed on its support,U[0.2,2]. For the parameter γ, an inverse gamma priorIG(aγ,bγ)is chosen. The discount factor δ is set to 0.95 [50].Since we propose an algorithm based on α-stable distributions, this engenders processes with infinite variance and so the conventional expression of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) cannot be adopted in these simulations. As an alternative, we can use the variation of the dispersion parameter γ which is proportional to the variance in the case of white Gaussian noise. In the present paper, the OFDM signal is also affected by a Gaussian distortion. To take into account the effect of this component, we propose to use the variation of the dispersionlog10⁡(1/γ)by setting the ratio10log10⁡(σ/γ).In order to get insights about the appropriate number of particles to be used, we study the performance of the proposed algorithm for different number of particles M. The parameters of the α-stable noise are set toα=1.4andμ=0. Several values of γ have been consideredγ=1,γ=0.1andγ=0.01. In Table 1, the bias and the variance of the multicarrier signal estimate have been reported. Figs. 5 and 6show respectively the Box-and-Whiskers plots of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the characteristic exponent and the dispersion parameter estimate. At first, it can be observed that, even if the number of particles is small, the estimation results achieved by the proposed PF remain satisfactory for both of the multicarrier signal and the noise parameters. Moreover, we can denote that using a number of particles greater than 300 does not significantly improves the estimation results. Contrariwise, this increases the computational complexity of the PF. Consequently, we can conclude that using a number of particles between 200 and 300 seems to be a good compromise between efficiency and speed. Henceforth, the number of particles M is set to 200.Now, we study the influence of the characteristic exponent α on the performance of the proposed algorithm. For this purpose, several values of α have been considered:α=0.8,α=1.1,α=1.4andα=1.7. The MSE of the multicarrier signal estimate for different values of α is depicted in Fig. 7. From this figure, it can be denoted that the performance of the proposed algorithm degrades when the value of α decreases. Indeed, by decreasing the value of α, the observation noise gets more impulsive, making inference more difficult. In Fig. 8, the MSE of the dispersion parameter estimate is drawn for different values of α. As previously remarked, it can be observed that the proposed algorithm gives a more accurate dispersion parameter estimate when the value of α increases. However, we can see that the gap between the different curves decreases with γ. From these results, it can be concluded that the influence of the characteristic exponent on the estimation of the dispersion parameter is more significant at high impulsive noise power (a large value of γ). These remarks are also confirmed by the Box-and-Whisker plots of the MSE of the dispersion parameter estimate for different values of α and γ, shown in Figs. 9–11. Concerning the characteristic exponent estimation, Figs. 12–14show the Box-and-Whisker plots of the MSE of the characteristic exponent estimate for different values of γ. It can be seen from these figures that the estimation accuracy increases with the value of α. However, a performance degradation is observed forα=1.7. By comparing these figures, it can be remarked that this degradation becomes more pronounced when γ decreases (the power of the impulsive noise decreases). In fact, for an α equal to 1.7, the noise is dominated by its Gaussian component. As a consequence, there is not enough information to estimate the exponent characteristic α characterizing the impulsive component of the noise.Trying to put the accent on improvement realized through our approach, a comparative study with three state-of-the-art methods is established in terms of achievable Bit Error Rates (BERs). The proposed algorithm is compared with two conventional methods for impulsive noise compensation in OFDM systems. Those methods are the Blanking and the Clipping. Both of them operate in the time domain and cancel impulsive noise energy from the received signalrt,t=0,...,N+Ncp−1according to a specific threshold [58,59,9].•Blankingrt={rt,if|rt|<Tb0,otherwiseClippingrt={rt,if|rt|<TcTcexp⁡(jarg⁡(rt)),otherwiseIn this paragraph, we study the impact of the number of subcarriers N on the proposed FPRB-ECSB in term of BER. The parameters of the α-stable noise are set toα=0.8andμ=0. Two different values of γ have been consideredγ=0.0316andγ=0.0032. In Table 2, we report the BER performance of the proposed FPRB-ECSB versus the number of subcarriers. For comparison purposes, the BER performance of the Blanking and the Clipping methods are also reported. From this table, it can be firstly denoted that whatever the number of subcarriers is, the proposed algorithm outperforms both of the Blanking and the Clipping methods. Then, we can remark that the BER performance of the proposed FPRB-ECSB increases with the number of subcarriers. In fact, our algorithm deals with the estimation of static parameters which are the parameters of the impulsive noise. Since the online estimation is recursive, the parameters estimates are updated at each time instant (at each subcarrier in our context). So, when the number of subcarriers increases, the estimation of the multicarrier signal is improved. Contrariwise, the BER performance of both of the Blanking and the Clipping methods degrades when the number of subcarriers increases. This is principally due to the Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) which increases with the number of subcarriers. As a consequence, the gap between the proposed FPRB-ECSB and both of the Blanking and the Clipping methods becomes more significant when the number of subcarriers increases.Thus, simulations illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method for the joint estimation of the multicarrier signal and noise parameters.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
In this paper, we deal with the problem of impulsive interference mitigation in ad hoc networks. In this context, we consider more particularly an OFDM transmission link. In the proposed model, we assumed that the signal distortion due to MAI is represented by a symmetric α-stable distribution. We propose an approach based on Bayesian estimation using particle filtering, to jointly estimate the multicarrier signal and the noise parameters. Unlike existing approaches, we assume that the impulsive noise parameters are unknown at the receiver, which is a more realistic case. Moreover, the proposed method has the advantage of being bandwidth efficient as it does not require the transmission of pilot symbols. The efficiency and the robustness of the proposed algorithm for interference mitigation have been demonstrated through several numerical simulations. Based on the performed results, it can be firstly concluded that even with the presence of a very impulsive noise, the proposed algorithm achieves good performance. Furthermore, our algorithm offers a performance gain in comparison to conventional methods, especially when the impulsive noise has high values.
