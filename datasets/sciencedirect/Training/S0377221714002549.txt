@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Lease expiration management (LEM) in the apartment industry aims to control the number of lease expirations and thus achieve maximal revenue growth. We examine rental rate strategies in the context of LEM for apartment buildings that offer a single lease term and face demand uncertainty. We show that the building may incur a significant revenue loss if it fails to account for LEM in the determination of the rental rate. We also show that the use of LEM is a compromise approach between a limited optimization, where no future demand information is available, and a global optimization, where complete future demand information is available. We show that the use of LEM can enhance the apartment building’s revenue by as much as 8% when the desired number of expirations and associated costs are appropriately estimated. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the major results derived from our models and the impact on the apartment’s revenue of sensitivity to the desired number of expirations and associated costs.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Revenue management (RM) has been successfully employed by diverse industries (including the airline and hotel industries) to maximize revenue growth. Although the application of RM to the apartment industry has made significant progress there still exist some unique challenges, including lease expiration management (Wang, 2008).Essentially, RM aims to ensure that companies sell the right product to the right customer at the right time for the right price (Cross, 1997). RM leverages on-hand inventory with demand by dynamically setting the prices for products at various time points to maximize the seller’s revenue. There are several key differences between the application of RM in the apartment rental industry and other industries, however, which explain why RM techniques used elsewhere cannot be easily transported to the apartment industry. Lease expiration management (LEM) is the discipline of controlling the number of lease expirations at each future time point by dynamically setting rental rates for current rentals and is an important consideration in apartment RM. An apartment manager needs to manage the rental rates of leases not only by leveraging the number of rooms to be rented to current demand, but also by matching expected demand in the future, at the time when these leases expire and the units are available to be rented again.The rental rate of a lease is the monthly payment by the tenant, which can vary according to move-in date and the lease term (where ‘term’ specifies the length of time that a tenant will stay in an apartment) (Wang, 2008). Because a typical lease term lasts for months/years, the revenue accrued from a single lease makes up a large portion of the total annual revenue for an apartment complex. Consequently, the setting of rental rates becomes crucial and sometimes even risky for the apartment owner.Like many other service industries, demand in the apartment industry often shows a seasonal pattern (Joseph & James, 1996). In addition, the change in realized demand is dependent upon the change of rental rates to some extent. The higher that rental rates are set, the lower the number of leases that will be signed and the lower the number of units are available to re-rent when their leases expire in the future. Because an apartment owner usually has a limited, fixed number of units to lease, traditional apartment RM focuses on setting optimal rental rates at each decision point by balancing demand and available units, with the objective of maximizing total revenue. The “optimal” current rental rates will determine the “optimal” number of leases to be signed, and, as a result, will influence the rental rates at the future time points when these expire. This propagating dependence of rent setting is referred to as the “ripple effect,” and is also common in other service industries (for example, hotels.) A direct implication of the ripple effect is that setting the rental rates for current leases influences the rental rates for subsequent leases; the apartment owner will incur a significant revenue loss if this effect is not considered in the rental rates decision.In apartment RM implementation, demand forecasts play an important role in setting the optimal rental rates. If the future demand at any given rental rate could be forecast perfectly, then the rental rates for the subsequent leases could be set “optimally” with consideration of the ripple effect. In reality, however, it is almost impossible to forecast demand accurately; the resulting inaccuracy in demand forecast tends to increase over time. For apartments, in particular, this forecast inaccuracy becomes a major issue because of the long lease terms. Therefore, in a long term or even a finite time horizon, it is very difficult to set global optimal rental rentals for each rental time point.While the RM field for hotel management is fairly mature, and might appear to be directly relevant to the apartment rental industry, hotels and apartments crucially have different lengths of stay. Specifically, hotels usually have shorter lengths of stay and thus a larger volume of transactions, while apartments have longer lengths of stay and a lower volume of transactions. The greater volume of historical hotel transactions and the shorter time horizons involved makes demand forecasting for short stays/rentals easier for hotels than for apartments. Consequently the implementation of RM in the apartment rental industry is hampered by the difficulty of demand forecasting.To alleviate this problem, the practice of LEM has emerged in the apartment industry. Using prior experience or knowledge about predictable events, apartment operators often specify the number of leases desired to expire at different time points in the future. The rationale for the use of LEM is thus not only to improve the demand forecast with additional information, but also to better optimize the rental rates to enhance revenues. Fig. 1below is an example of LEM from a leading apartment company. It illustrates LEM estimates at different points in time from Sept 2011 to March 2013. The apartment manager manually manages lease expirations, aiming to match the actual number of lease expirations to the desired number of lease expirations. The number of desired expirations for each future time point is determined by the manager’s experience and historical data. The actual number of lease expirations is counted based on the number of units of move-outs. If the actual number of expirations exceeds the desired number of expirations, the extra rooms have a high possibility of being vacant, resulting in vacancy costs; insufficient move-outs will lead to shortage costs. Fig. 1 illustrates how, in practice, an apartment manager tries to use rental rates to match the actual number of lease expirations with the desired number of lease expirations, so that he can maximize the total revenue growth while simultaneously minimizing vacancy and shortage costs. The magnitude of such costs is often defined by the gap between the desired number of lease expirations and the actual number of lease expirations.LEM using the method described in Fig. 1 is a common practice for leading apartment companies in the United States, and has attracted growing interest in the apartment industry. Surprisingly and interestingly, theoretical studies on how to optimally set rental rates within the LEM framework remain scarce. To fill this gap, in this paper, we develop a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation of a dynamic pricing problem for controlling lease expirations, in which the apartment’s objective is to maximize the total expected revenue from customer leases over the finite horizon by setting the rental rates for a single lease term. Prospective tenants move in at different time points in a planning horizon all having the same lease term. A single lease term is the most widely used in the apartment industry in North America, with many apartment buildings requiring tenants to sign one-year leases due to regulations or convenience; many Canadian conventional apartments also require tenants to sign annual leases. We are interested in how to model LEM and how to merge LEM in an MDP model to improve revenues over an MDP model without LEM.Most MDP models in the literature either find the limited optimizations, as do the models used here (see, for example, Amaruchkul, Cooper, & Gupta, 2007; Gupta & Wang, 2008; Sivalenka, 2010), or provide heuristics (for example, Bertsimas & Popescu, 2003; De Boer, Freling, & Piersma, 2002; Zhang & Cooper, 2009). These studies do not, however, account for the ripple effect that is captured in our model. Our analysis shows that the use of LEM for a single-lease term in an MDP model can improve revenues over an MDP model without LEM if the desired numbers of lease expirations can be properly specified, and the associated shortage and vacancy costs can be appropriately estimated.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the related literature and Section 3 outlines problem description, notations and assumptions. The conditions under which the apartment company can enhance revenue through implementing LEM are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the strategy of rental rates and issues of LEM implementation. Numerical examples in Section 6 are included to illustrate the major results of the paper and a brief discussion on the implementation of LEM is given in Section 7. Conclusions are provided in Section 8. All proofs are provided in the Appendix A.The application of RM in the apartment industry is relatively new, although RM has become increasingly successful in service industries, including airlines (Smith, Leimkuhler, Darrow, & Samuels, 1992), hotels (Baker & Collier, 1999; Bitran & Mondschein, 1995; Bitran & Gilbert, 1996; Goldman, Freling, Pak, & Piersma, 2003; Weatherford, 1995), car rentals (Geraghty & Johnson, 1997), retail (Federgruen & Heching, 1999), and air-cargo (Amaruchkul et al., 2007). The apartment industry faces similar challenges to these service industries, in selling perishable products or services with capacity constraints.The present research is related to the literature on dynamic pricing in the context of RM. Dynamic pricing problems have been studied extensively in the economics, marketing, and operations literature. Here we review studies in the RM context that relate to our model. Bitran and Caldentey (2003) and Talluri and van Ryzin (2004) provide a detailed overview of dynamic pricing models in the context of revenue management (RM). Zhao and Zheng (2000) show a significant improvement in the expected revenue by using an optimal dynamic pricing policy over a single pricing policy. Gallego and van Ryzin (1994) analyze dynamic adjustment of price as a function of inventory and length of remaining sales period under stochastic demand. Zhang and Cooper (2009) develop an MDP formulation of a dynamic pricing problem for multiple substitutable flights between the same origin and destination, taking into account customer choice among the flights. Ozkan, Karaesmen, and Ozekici (2013) formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to maximize expected revenues over a finite horizon considering the dependence of the distribution of demand on external conditions and derive results to a related dynamic pricing formulation. These studies, however, do not include the ripple effect. Unlike those papers, the dynamic pricing problem in this paper considers the impact of the pricing (rental rate) policy on both the current number of rooms to be rented with a capacity constraint, and the number of rooms available to rent in the future when the current leases expire. Thus, we consider the ‘ripple effect’ by including the costs of a mismatch between the actual number of expirations and desired number of expirations in our MDP models.The research described here is also related to the application of RM in the apartment industry. The growing interest in apartment RM has been noted as a trend in multifamily property management (Sawh, 2012). Sawh (2012) pointed out that “although use of revenue management systems in the multifamily industry has initially been slow, interest and adoption has risen sharply in the past two years as companies strive to keep the revenue line as high as possible in a shrinking economy”. There have, however, been limited RM studies related to the apartment industry, in particular, to the use of LEM. While the apartment industry shares some similarities with the other industries, it faces its own unique characteristics (Wang, 2008). These unique characteristics, such as the ripple effect, lead LEM to being critical to the success of apartment RM. Sivalenka (2010) proposed the use of a linear programming (LP) optimization model to set rental rates. His model requires that future demand be known, which is not very useful in practice. As pointed out by Wang (2008), LEM has become important to apartment RM, but no theoretical studies have been done. The present paper makes the first theoretical contribution to the research stream on LEM in apartment RM by formulating LEM for a single lease term using MDP model to dynamically set rental rates over the planning horizon.We model the problem of setting apartment rental rates in a finite horizon as a MDP. The model presented in Section 4 does not consider LEM which allows us to set up a benchmark case in which the traditional apartment RM sets the optimal rental rates for a single lease term. This section gives the condition when the MDP model without LEM is equivalent to a static model. We present the MDP model with LEM in Section 5. We show revenue enhancement for the apartment with LEM by comparison to the model without LEM. The discussion of the impact of shortage costs and vacancy costs on the dynamic pricing policy and the revenue of the apartment is also included. We carry out numerical experiments to compare the performance of the models with and without LEM. The examples show that the MDP model with LEM can significantly enhance the apartment’s revenue, as compared to the model without LEM.Thus, the paper also contributes to the RM literature stream by proposing a compromise approach to improving revenue for apartments with only imperfect information on future demand, and by providing guidelines in setting rents under LEM for apartment RM practices.We address a problem for an apartment offering a single lease term. The apartment needs to set rental rates (pt: t=1,2,…,T) for each period (t) of a finite planning time horizon to maximize its revenue. A period is defined as a multiple of the basic time unit that the apartment uses, e.g., one month. We assume that the rental rates (pt) are set between upper and lower bounds, i.e.,pt∈[pt̲,pt‾]. The planning starts with period 1 at which C units are available for rent, where C is the fixed capacity of the apartment. The single lease term consists of L time units and T≫L. To simplify the discussion, we assume that all renewal leases will be new leases during the T time unit planning horizon. Let xtbe the state in the state spaceS=R. Denote xtand ytas the number of vacant units available which excludes and includes the number of prior leases expiring at the beginning of period t, respectively. Let Ut(pt) be the number of units rented out at time t at price pt(or equivalently, which is equal to the actual number of leases that will expire at time (t+L)). Thus, yt=xt+Ut−L(pt−L). Since the planning horizon is assumed to start from period 1, Ut−L(pt−L)=0 for t⩽L. For demand in each period t, we make the following assumptions:Assumption 1When the rent is being determined at time t, the demand Dτ(pτ,ξτ) for τ=1,2,…,t, has been observed, but the future demand, Dτ(pτ,ξτ) for τ=t+1,…,T, is unknown.For t=1,2,…,T,(i)demand Dt(pt,ξt)=dt(pt)+ξt, where dt(pt) is the expected (deterministic) demand at ptat time t and is finite and decreasing in pt. ξtis a random variable with cumulative distribution function Ft(.) and density function ft(.).Dt(pt,ξt) is concave and non-increasing inpt∈[pt̲,pt‾], whereE[Dt(pt‾,ξt)]=dt(pt‾)=0. We assume that the parameters of the demand function are chosen so that the probability of negative demand is essentially zero and can be ignored, where ξtfor different time periods are supported in the range [At,Bt] and independent with E[ξt]=0.We will discuss the two cases of RM without LEM and RM with RM. For ease of comparison between these cases, we use (N) to denote the solution for the case without LEM, and (W) for the solution for the case with LEM. In the case of RM without LEM, the apartment operator will set the optimal rental ratept∗(N)based on demand [Dt(pt,ξt)], state (xt), and units becoming vacant at time t(Ut−L). We use this case as a benchmark case. In the case of RM with LEM, the apartment operator specifies the number of leases desired to expire (nt+L) at different periods in the future t+L(t=1,2,…). The apartment owner’s objective is to set rental ratept∗(W)to maximize the revenue at time t while minimizing the difference between the actual number of expired unitsUtpt∗(W)and the number of leases desired to expire (nt+L) at time t+L. We then discuss the effects of the use of LEM by comparing the results with those in the benchmark case (RM without LEM). We summarize notations that will be used in this paper in Table 1.We start with the case of RM without LEM by examining conditions required for a revenue advantage from LEM to derive insights as to when apartment owners should consider implementing LEM.RM without LEM is the case with no ripple effect. The revenuert∗(xt)with the boundary condition of r0(x0)=0, for periods 1,2,…,t can be formulated as an MDP model:(1)rt∗(xt)=rt-1∗(xt-1)+maxpt̲⩽pt⩽pt‾E[ptLUt(pt)]=rt-1∗(xt-1)+maxpt̲⩽pt⩽pt‾Jt(pt),wherexo=C,xt=xt-1+minyt-1-L,Dt-1-Lpt-1-L∗,ξt-1-L-minyt-1,Dt-1pt-1∗,ξt-1, andyt=xt+minyt-L,Dt-Lpt-L∗,ξt-L, where Dt−1−L=0 and yt−1−L=0 for (t−1−L)⩽0 and Dt−L=0 and yt−L=0 for (t−L)⩽0. HereDt-1pt-1∗,ξt-1,Dt-1-Lpt-1-L∗,ξt-1-L, andDt-Lpt-L∗,ξt-Lare the realized demands for optimal rentspt-1∗,pt-1-L∗, andpt-L∗at time t−1, t−1−L and t−L, respectively. Ut(pt) is the number of units that can be rented out at time t, whose leases will expire at time t+L.maxpt̲⩽pt⩽pt‾Jt(pt)is the maximal expected revenue generated from time period t by setting the optimal rent.The first termrt-1∗(xt-1)in the right-hand side of Eq. (1) represents the maximum expected revenue accumulated from periods 1,2,…,t−1 without LEM while the second term E[ptLUt(pt)] is the revenue from period t at the rental rate pt. The number of units that can be rented out at time tUt(.) depends on the rental rate at time t.At time t, the apartment owner’s objective is to maximize the expected revenue E[ptLUt(pt)] by setting the optimal rent. With the demand function given in assumption 2, when the restriction ofpt∈[pt̲,pt‾]is removed, if ytis sufficiently high, the apartment can set the optimal rent atpto∗(N), which is the solution to: maxE[ptLUt(pt)]=E[ptLDt(pt)]=ptLdt(pt).This implies thatyt⩾dtpto∗(N), suggesting that the number of units that the apartment can rent out is the realization of demand,Dtpto∗(N),ξtthat will vacate at time t+L. Whenyt<dt(pto∗(N)), because demand is a decreasing function of the rent, the apartment should set a rentpty∗(N)to be higher thanpto∗(N). In addition, when ytis higher than the realizedDtpty∗(N),ξt,Dtpty∗(N),ξtunits can be rented out; otherwise, only at most ytunits can be rented out. Thus, foryt<dtpto∗(N), the number of units that can be rented out is given byminyt,Dtpty∗(N),ξt, wherepty∗(N)is the solution to maxE[ptLUt(pt)]=E[ptL min (yt,Dt(pt,ξt))]. Therefore, the number of units [Ut(pt)] that will vacate at time t+L can be expressed as:(2)Ut(pt)=Dt(pt,ξt)ifyt⩾d(pto∗(N)),min(yt,Dt(pt,ξt))ifyt<dpto∗(N).Define zt(pt)=yt−dt(pt) as the expected number of units that will be vacant at the end of period t. ThenMin(yt,Dt(pt,ξt))=dt(pt)+ξtifξt⩽zt(pt),dt(pt)+zt(pt)ifξt>zt(pt).With Assumption 2, denotingΛt(zt(pt))=∫Atzt(zt(pt)-ξt)ft(ξt)dξt, we have E [min (yt,Dt(pt, ξt))]=yt−Λt(zt(pt)). With (2), Jt(pt) in (1) can be written as:(3)Jt(pt)=ptLdt(pt)ifyt⩾dpto∗(N),ptL[yt-Λt(zt(pt))]ifyt<dpto∗(N).At time t, for a given yt, ifpty∗(N)>pto∗(N), then Jt(pt)=ptL[yt−Λt(zt(pt))] and Jt(pt)=ptLdt(pt) ifpty∗(N)⩽pto∗(N). With (1) and (3) and Assumption 2, we have:Proposition 1For 1⩽t⩽T, there exists a unique optimal rentpt∗(N), which is given by(4)pt∗(N)=maxpt̲,pto∗(N),pty∗(N)yt>0,pt‾yt=0,where(5)pto∗(N)={pt:dt(pt)+pt∂dt(pt)/∂pt=0},and(6)pty∗(N)={pt:yt-Λt(zt(pt))+ptFt(zt(pt))∂dt(pt)/∂pt=0}.Proposition 1suggests that the apartment which only offers a single-lease term can set the optimal rent based on the number of units available.At time t, for yt>0, ifpt∗(N)=pto∗(N), which holds whenmaxpty∗(N),pt̲⩽pto∗(N), the corresponding optimal demand will not be constrained by yt. Further, if for allt∈[1,T],pt∗(N)=maxpto∗(N),pt̲⩾maxpty∗(N),pt̲, this implies that in the planning horizon with T periods, the apartment has enough capacity to allow all rents to be set at optimums, for which the corresponding demands will not be constrained by ytat each time t. We refer to this case as thehigh-capacity case. On the other hand, at time t, ifmaxpty∗(N)>maxpto∗(N),pt̲),ytwould restrict the apartment to set rent atpto∗(N). Furthermore, if there exists some t∈[1,T] such that eitherpt∗(N)=maxpty∗(N),pt̲>maxpto∗(N),pt̲for yt>0, we refer to this case as thelow-capacity case.Define (E[C]) as the expected minimum capacity that the apartment needs to compensate for the demand, such that the optimal rent can be set atpt∗(N)=maxpto∗(N),pt̲for all t∈[1,T]. The following Corollary can determine the value of E[C].Corollary 1If there exists some ti∈[1,T], i=1,2,…, such thatpti∗(N)=max(pti̲,ptio∗(N))=max(pti̲,ptiy∗(N))andpt∗(N)=max(pt̲,pto∗(N))>max(pti̲,ptiy∗(N))for any other t≠ti, then E[C] is given by:(7)E[C̲]=maxi=1,2,⋯∑τ=ti-L+1tidτmaxpτo∗(N),pτ̲.From Corollary 1 and the discussion above, we can see that C⩾E[C] for the high-capacity case and C<E[C] for the low-capacity case. When C⩾E[C], sincept∗(N)=max(pto∗(N),pt̲)for anyt,pt∗(N)is thus independent of L. Therefore,rt∗(xt)will increase with L, suggesting that the apartment can increase its revenue by offering a longer lease term (L). However, this result is not necessarily true when C<E[C] since there exists some t such thatpt∗(N)=maxpty∗(N),pt̲. Thusyt=C-∑τ=t-L+1t-1minDτpτ∗(N),ξτ,yτfor t>L andyt=C-∑τ=1tminDτpτ∗(N),ξτ,yτfor t⩽L, whereDτpτ∗(N),ξτis the demand realized at time τ at the optimal rentpτ∗(N). ytis therefore implicitly dependent on the lease term (L) when t>L. A further examination is needed to investigate howrt∗(xt)changes with L.Even for a single lease term, the apartment RM problem is still a network problem, due to the multiple move-in periods and lengths of lease terms. In practice, a static model is widely used to model a network RM problem by assuming that demand is known for all t in the planning horizon T. If this is the case, the problem in (1) can be formulated as a static model:(8)ER=Emaxpt∑t=1TptLUt(pt)st.pt̲⩽pt⩽pt‾,yt=C-∑τ=t-L+1t-1Uτ(pτ)ift>L,yt=C-∑τ=1t-1Uτ(pτ)ift⩽L,andyt⩾0.where ER is the total expected revenue from leasing C units over T periods and Ut(pt) is given by (2). DenoteptSM∗as the solution of the optimal rent to (8).Under the assumption that the rent at each t is given, Bertsimas and Popescu (2003) proved that the revenue gained from an MDP model is no higher than that from a static model. The above discussions on both high-capacity and low-capacity cases also suggest that for C⩾E[C], revenue gained from an MDP model in (1) is the same as that from a static model in (8). This is because in the MDP modelpt∗(N)=maxpto∗(N),pt̲for all t∈[1,T], which is also the solution to (8) in the static model, i.e.,pt∗(N)=ptSM∗. Therefore, the implementation of LEM in an MDP model in (1) will not offer any revenue advantage. However, when C<E[C], the static model in (8) can be used to derive a global optimum. Without the availability of future demand information, the MDP model without LEM in (1) does not consider the impact of current rent decisions on the number of future expirations and thus on the rent in the future, leading to a limited optimization. The approach might result in a situation where too many units are allocated in the beginning periods of the planning horizon, which will lead to too few units available for the later periods. Because the apartment tends to set the rents to satisfy the current demand, this approach does not accommodate for LEM in which both current and future demands are considered. To examine the revenue enhancement by LEM, in section 5 we only consider the case C<E[C].LEM is used to control the difference between the desired number of lease expirations (nt+L) and the actual number of lease expirations [Ut(pt)] at time t+L by setting rent (pt) appropriately, in the hope of increasing revenue. The rent decision made at time t would directly impact the rent decision in the future at time t+L. In practice, nt+Lcan be estimated based on prior experience or can be specified ad hoc.In order to develop a rent strategy with LEM, we add two costs,ctv⩾0andcts⩾0wherectvdenotes the unit vacancy cost over the lease term if there are more actual expirations than desired (Ut(pt)>nt+L) andctsdenotes the unit shortage cost over the lease term if Ut(pt)<nt+L. These costs are similar to the shortage and overage costs in the newsvendor problem:ctvcan be estimated as the cost of holding a vacant apartment (utilities, overhead cost and amortized depreciation cost, etc.) whilectscan be estimated from the impact of rejecting a potential tenant. The LEM problem now becomes that of setting optimal rents considering not only the difference between nt+Land Ut(pt), but also the impact of vacancy and shortage costs on revenues. In the current practice of LEM, the apartment operators only focus on setting rents such that Ut(pt) can be as close to nt+Las possible. The total cost can be expressed as:(9)ctv[Ut(pt)-nt+L]++cts[nt+L-Ut(pt)]+.The problem of RM with LEM becomes the traditional RM problem whenctv=cts=0, that is RM without LEM, as discussed in Section 4.Consideration of these two added costs influences how the apartment building manager controls future lease expirations. For example, at time t, in order to reduce the total cost in (9), if the rent in Proposition 1 leads toUt(pt∗(N))>nt+L, then the existence ofctvmay result in a higher rent[pt∗(W)]to discourage less expirations; ifUt(pt∗(N))<nt+L, then the existence ofctsmay result in a lower rentpt∗(W)to encourage more expirations.With (2),vt∗(xt), and v0(x0)=0, the maximal expected revenue contribution from periods 1 to t, can be formulated by including the total cost in (9) intort∗(xt)in (1) as follows:(10)vt∗(xt)=vt-1∗(xt-1)+maxpt̲⩽pt⩽pt‾EptLUt(pt)-ctv[Ut(pt)-nt+L]+-cts[nt+L-Ut(pt)]+=vt-1∗(xt-1)+maxpt̲⩽pt⩽pt‾JtW(pt).The first termvt-1∗(xt-1)in the right-hand side of Eq. (1) represents the maximum expected revenue accumulated from periods 1,2,…,t−1 with LEM while the second termEptLUt(pt)-ctv[Ut(pt)-nt+L]+-cts[nt+L-Ut(pt)]+is the net revenue from period t at the rental rate pt. The smaller the difference between the actual number of lease expirations and the desired number of lease expirations at time t+L, the more revenue the apartment will gain. The number of units that can be rented out at time t, which is also the number of units that will expire at time t+L, depends on the rental rate at time t.Denotepto∗(W)andpty∗(W)as the optimal rents for the cases when Ut(pt)=Dt(pt,ξt) and when Ut(pt)=min (yt,Dt(pt,ξt)), respectively. Based on the discussion in Section 4,JtW(pt)in (10) becomes:(11)JtW(pt)=ptLdt(pt)-ctv[dt(pt)-nt+L]+-cts[nt+L-dt(pt)]+ifyt⩾dt(pto∗(W)),ptL[yt-Λt(zt(pt))]-ctv[(yt-Λt(zt(pt)))-nt+L]++cts[nt+L-(yt-Λt(zt(pt)))]+ifyt<dt(pto∗(W)).With Assumption 2, at time t, for a given yt, ifpty∗(W)⩽pto∗(W), thenJtW(pt)=ptLdt(pt)-ctv[dt(pt)-nt+L]+-cts[nt+L-dt(pt)]+; ifpty∗(W)>pto∗(W), thenJtW(pt)=ptL[yt-Λt(zt(pt))]-ctv[(yt-Λt(zt(pt)))-nt+L]+-cts[nt+L-(yt-Λt(zt(pt)))]+.Therefore,JtW(pt)in (11) becomes: whenpty∗(W)⩽pto∗(W),(12)JtW(pt)=Jtv(pt)=ptLdt(pt)-ctv[dt(pt)-nt+L]ifdt(pt)⩾nt+L,Jts(pt)=ptLdt(pt)-cts[nt+L-dt(pt)]ifdt(pt)⩽nt+L;and whenpty∗c(W)>pto∗(W),(13)JtW(pt)=Jtvv(pt)=ptL-ctv[yt-Λt(zt(pt))]+ctvnt+Lifyt-Λt(zt(pt))⩾nt+L,Jtss(pt)=ptL+cts[yt-Λt(zt(pt))]-ctsnt+Lifyt-Λt(zt(pt))⩽nt+L.With (10)–(13) and Assumption 2, the optimal rent with LEM can be summarized as:Proposition 2Withpty∗(N)given by(6), the optimal rentpt∗(W)to(10)is:(14)pt∗(W)=maxpt̲,pto∗(W),pty∗(W)ifyt>0;pt‾ifyt=0.where(15)pto∗(W)=ptv∗ifpts∗<ptv∗<dt-1(nt+L)dt-1(nt+L)ifpts∗⩽dt-1(nt+L)⩽ptv∗or2L∂dt(pt)/∂pt+ptL-ctv∂2dt(pt)/∂pt2>0pts∗ifdt-1(nt+L)<pts∗<ptv∗,(16)ptv∗=argmaxptptLdt(pt)-ctv(dt(pt)-nt+L),and(17)pts∗=argmaxptptLdt(pt)-cts(nt+L-dt(pt)).(18)pty∗(W)=ptvv∗ifptvv∗⩽ptnt+L∗,ptnt+L∗ifpty∗(N)<ptnt+L∗<ptvv∗,pty∗(N)otherwise.where(19)ptvv∗=pt:L[yt-Λt(zt(pt))]+Ft(zt(pt))ptL-ctv∂dt(pt)/∂pt=0,and(20)ptnt+L∗={pt:yt-Λt(zt(pt))=nt+L}.From the proof ofProposition 2, we can see that∂ptvv∗/∂ctv>0and thusptvv∗⩾pty∗(N). It is noticed thatptv∗in(16)andptvv∗in(19)are a function ofctv, andpts∗in(17)is a function ofcts.The impact ofctvandctsonptv∗,ptvv∗, andpts∗are summarized in Corollary 2.Corollary 2Forctv>0andcts>0,∂ptv∗/∂ctv>0,∂ptvv∗/∂ctv>0, and∂pts∗/∂cts<0.The optimal rentpt∗(N)at time t and the corresponding number of units rented outUt(pt∗(N))at time t are both independent of any requirements for lease expirations at period t+L. The total revenue thus accumulated might be limitedly optimal without LEM as a result of ignorance of the “ripple effect.” In (10), however, the optimal rentpt∗(W)at time t impacts the rent at t+L through the use ofnt+L,ctv, andctsin the context of LEM.We now examine the conditions under which the determination of optimal rents is independent ofctvorcts. Letxtvandxtsdenote the solutions of the following two equations:(21)argmaxptptLdt(pt)-xtv(dt(pt)-nt+L)-dt-1(nt+L)=0,and(22)argmaxptptLdt(pt)-xts(nt+L-dt(pt))-dt-1(nt+L)=0.In addition, since Proposition 2 shows thatptnt+L∗is the solution to yt−Λt(zt(pt))=nt+L, withΛt(zt(pt))>0,ptnt+L∗is valid for yt>nt+L. Thus, for yt>nt+L, letxtvvdenote the solutions to:(23)argmaxptptL-xtvv[yt-Λt(zt(pt))]+xtvvnt+L-ptnt+L∗=0.From (21) and (22), it can be easily derived thatxtv=-xts. Proposition 2 gives thatpty∗(W)is independent ofcts. Proposition 3 below shows that the conditions under which the rent decision does not vary withctvandcts.Proposition 3Ifctv>maxxtv,xtvv>0orcts>xts>0, then the optimal lease rate is given by(24)pt∗(W)=max(pt̲,dt-1(nt+L),pty∗(N))ifyt>0;pt‾ifyt=0.Ifxts>cts>0,pts∗>pt̲, and yt>0, thenpt∗(W)=pts∗and hencept∗(W)is dependent oncts, but is independent ofctv; ifxtv>ctv>0,ptv∗>pt̲, and yt>0, thenpt∗(W)=ptv∗andpt∗(W)is dependent onctv, but is independent ofcts. Whenpto∗(W)<pty∗(W), ifxtvv>ctv>0andpty∗(W)=ptvv∗⩾pt̲, thenpty∗(W)is dependent onctv. Therefore, the rent decision depends onctsifpto∗(W)⩾pty∗(W)⩾pt̲andxts>cts>0. In addition, the rent decision depends onctvif: (i)yt-Λtztptnt+L∗⩾nt+L,pty∗(W)>pto∗(W)⩾pt̲,ptvv∗⩽ptnt+L∗, andxtvv>ctv>0; or(ii)pto∗(W)⩾pty∗(W)>pt̲andxtv>ctv>0.Proposition 3 implies a useful implementation of LEM. At time t, after the apartment specifies the desired nt+L, it can obtainxtv,xts, andxtvvby (21)–(23). If the apartment is aware thatctv>maxxtv,xtvv>0orcts>xts>0, it can simply use (24) to determine the rent without accurately estimating values ofctvandctsto control the number of lease expirations at time t+L.(21)–(23) indicate thatxtv,xts, andxtvvare functions of nt+L. Corollary 3 below shows how they change with nt+L.Corollary 3(i)∂xtv/∂nt+L<0and∂xts/∂nt+L>0; (ii) whenxtv=xts=0,pto∗(N)=dt-1(nt+L); (iii)∂xtvv/∂nt+L<0for yt>nt+L; and (iv) whenxtvv=0,pty∗(N)=ptnt+L∗for yt>nt+L, wherepto∗(N)andpty∗(N)are given by(5) and (6)inProposition 1.A simple numerical example is used to illustrate the results of Corollary 3. We assume that the demand function at time t isdt(pt)=20-0.0001pt2. The single lease term is assumed to be L= 6. The change ofxtvor-xtswith nt+Lis shown in Fig. 2.Corollary 3 and the numerical example suggest that at time t, as nt+Lincreases,xtvxtswould decrease. Further, ifxtv=xts=0,pto∗(N)=dt-1(nt+L). This implies thatxtv=-xts>0if0⩽nt+L⩽dtpto∗(N), andxtv=-xts<0if nt+L>dt(pto∗(N)). Corollary 3 also suggests that for a given yt>nt+L, whenxtvv=0,pty∗(N)=ptnt+L∗. This implies that whenxtvv=0, the apartment will set the expected number of units that can be rented out at time t to be equal to nt+L. Ifyt>nt+L,xtvvwould decrease with nt+L. Also, if0⩽nt+L<yt-Λtztpty∗(N), thenxtvv>0.Comparing the rent decision for the case without LEM given by Proposition 1 with that for the case with LEM given in Proposition 2, we have:Proposition 4Forctv>0andcts>0, (i)pts∗<pto∗(N)<ptv∗; (ii) for a given nt+L,dt-1(nt+L)>pto∗(N)andpto∗(W)>pto∗(N)ifxtv>0;dt-1(nt+L)<pto∗(N)andpto∗(W)<pto∗(N)ifxts>0; (iii) foryt-Λtztptvv∗⩾nt+L,pty∗(N)<ptvv∗.In a planning horizon with T periods, if the apartment manager starts by allocating a capacity of C units, thenpty∗(N)<pto∗(N)in the beginning periods. Points (i) and (ii) in Proposition 4 suggest that with LEM, ifpts∗⩾pt̲, a rational selection of nt+Lshould ensure thatxtv>0. This is because ifxtv<0thenxts>0and thuspts∗<pto∗(N)whenctv<xtv.pts∗<pto∗(N)will cause the apartment to have fewer units available for later periods prior to any leases expiring (for t⩽L), as compared to the case without LEM. Therefore, with LEM andxtv>0, at the beginning periods, the apartment can set a higher rentpto∗(W)>pto∗(N). Also, without knowing future demand, RM without LEM will focus on finding limited optimal by setting lower rents to attract more demand because there are abundant units available. As a consequence, there will be insufficient units for late periods prior to any leases expiring (t⩽L). With LEM, however, higher rents might be set for the beginning periods so that there could be more units available for leasing for late periods prior to any leases expiring (t⩽L). In addition, Proposition 4 also indicates that a higher rent should be set ifyt-Λtztptvv∗⩾nt+Lsinceptvv∗>pty∗(N).With LEM, the apartment is able to set the “right” rents, which are neither too high to put off potential tenants nor too low to have too more vacant units. When attracting potential tenants becomes dominant for the apartment manager andctsis high, the manager can set a higher nt+Lthat satisfiesxts>0at time t, leading to a lower lease rate. A revenue loss might, however, be incurred if nt+Ldoes not reflect demand at time t+L, as compared to the case without LEM. Similarly, when enhancing potential revenue by discouraging potential tenants dominates andctvis high, the apartment can set a lower nt+Lthat satisfiesxtv>0so that a higher rent can be set. Therefore, by estimatingctvandcts, the apartment manager can attain a balance between attracting and putting off potential tenants by setting a reasonable nt+Lin implementing LEM.To compare revenues for the case RM with LEM to the case discussed in Section 4, withpt∗(W)in Proposition 2, the corresponding expected revenueRt∗(xt), which excludes the total cost in Eq. (9), can be expressed as:Rt∗(xt)=Rt-1∗(xt-1)+Lpt∗(W)Utpt∗(W). DefineJtpt∗(W)=Rt∗(xt)-Rt-1∗(xt-1)as the expected revenue gains at time t. The impacts ofctvandctsonJtpt∗(W)are summarized in Proposition 5.Proposition 5For a given yt, (i)∂Jtpt∗(W)/∂ctv⩽0for0<ctv<minxtv,xtvvand yt>nt+L; (ii)∂Jtpt∗(W)/∂cts⩽0for0<cts<xts.Proposition 5 raises a cautionary note for the apartment operator when nt+Lis smaller at time t (the casextv>0andxtvv>0from Corollary 3). If0<ctv<minxtv,xtvv, revenue decreases asctvincreases at time t. Also, the apartment should be careful when nt+Lis larger at time t for the case when0<cts<xts.When the full demand information for the entire planning horizon (T periods) is assumed to be known, the global optimal rentsptSM∗at each t, t=1,2,…, T, can be solved from a static model given in (8). To examine the effects of LEM, we now define a “perfect-match” scenario where:nt+L(SM)=UtptSM∗for an MDP model with LEM for all t=1,2,…,T. In the “perfect-match” case, from Propositions 2 and 3, and the discussions in Section 4, ifctv>maxxtv,xtvvorcts>xts, the rent decision from the MDP model with LEM is independent ofctvandcts, which is the same as that of the static model. Therefore, the MDP model with LEM for the “perfect-match” case allows the apartment to achieve the same revenue as that from the static model. Thus, we have:Proposition 6In the “perfect-match” scenario, for any t∈[1,T], if a set of nt+Lcan be chosen to be equal toUtptSM∗, and ifctv>maxxtv,xtvvorcts>xtsholds, the apartment can achieve the maximum incremental revenue by implementing LEM, and the resulting revenue is equal to that for the static model.Unlike the case without LEM, the setting of rents in the case with LEM depends on the desired nt+L, and costsctvandcts. With Proposition 6, the implementation of LEM allows the apartment to arrive at a solution which is between the solution of a global optimization (from the static model with full demand information) and the solution of a limited optimization (from the MDP model without LEM and future demand information). To achieve this, the apartment can use an MDP model with LEM by setting nt+L, which reflects partial future demand information.Implementing LEM raises an important issue on properly specifying nt+L. A proper value of nt+Lshould satisfy the condition of nt+L⩽dt(pt) because dt(pt) is the maximum expected number of units that can be rented out at time t. Since the specification of nt+Ltakes into account future demand information, we can expect that this will affect revenue significantly when LEM is implemented. In the case of a “perfect-match,” future demand information in the planning horizon is assumed to be available. In practice, however, it is very difficult for the apartment to obtain such a perfect-match solution because of extremely long lengths of stay in the apartment industry. In addition, future demand can be significantly influenced by many other factors, including changes in the economic situation and competition from other apartments. This cautions the apartment that a good LEM implementation is highly dependent on good knowledge and experience in estimating the future demand level in order to specify nt+L. We argue that if the specification of nt+Ldoes not properly reflect future demand, the apartment may even experience a revenue loss ifctvandctsare high. Furthermore, with a limited capacity (C) and no lease expirations for 1 ⩽t⩽L, we expect that no more than C leases will expire for any mL+1⩽t⩽mL+L, for m=1,2,…. Thus, a rational set of nt+Lshould also satisfy∑t=(m-1)L+1mLnt+L⩽Cfor m=1,2,…We now use numerical examples to illustrate the main results discussed in this paper. In Example 1, we will illustrate the impact of LEM on the rental rate policy and the revenue of the apartment in the “perfect-match” case with deterministic demand. The numerical example will compare rental rate strategies over the planning horizon in the cases with LEM to the case without LEM, and examine the increase in apartment revenue with implementation of LEM. The sensitivity analysis in this example will examine the changes of revenue with LEM with vacancy costs. In Example 2, we examine how the number of desired expirations will affect the performance of LEM and we will do a sensitivity analysis on how the revenue gain from implementing LEM changes with shortage costs. The results of this example imply that the manager should specify a reasonable set of numbers of desired expirations when the apartment implements LEM using the model that is presented in this paper. In Example 3, we compare the results from implementing LEM in the case with stochastic demand to the case with deterministic demand. We show that demand uncertainty reduces revenue enhancement as compared to the deterministic demand case.In the following examples, we assume that an apartment building with capacity (C=40units) offers a single lease term (L=6months) in a planning horizon (T=24months). The deterministic (or expected) demand is assumed to be a linear demand, dt(pt)=at−btpt, where bt=0.02 for all t and at=[20,21,19,20,19,22,28,30,31,25,15,14,16,20,19,20,21,19,29,29,33,20,14,16]. We assume that the same cvand csare estimated and prescribed for each t in T periods. In addition, we also assume thatpt=500. From (7), we have E[C]=77>C. Therefore, all examples are low-capacity cases.Example 1The “perfect-match” case with deterministic demandAssuming that a set ofnt+L(SM)=dtptSM∗can be given by the apartment, whereptSM∗can be derived from (8). Then nt+L(SM)=[8.22,8.72,7.72,7.05,4.30,4.00,7.38,8.38,8.88,7.05,4.30,4.00,6.00,9.02,8.52,6.14,5.26,4.26,6.79,7.77,9.77,6.14,4.00,5.53]. We find thatxtv>0andxts<0for all t, and for any cs⩾0 andcv>4626,pt∗(W)=maxpt̲,dt-1(nt+L),dt-1(yt)[from Propositions 2 and 3] in this perfect-match case. Fig. 3shows changes of rental rates in the planning horizon for different vacancy costs (cv).Fig. 3 shows that the apartment manager will set a high price when demand is favorable, for cases both with and without LEM. In the case without LEM, the manager tries to lease as many units as possible for each period by adjusting the rental price without considering the impact of the current decision on the future (myopic behavior). The case with LEM considers information on future demand and aims to meet the projected demand with future vacancies by controlling the number of expirations with dynamic pricing. Fig. 4shows revenue increase with cvfor this numerical example.The revenue for the case without LEM is $683,550. The revenue for the case with LEM remains $739,431 for cv>xv=4626, which is the same as the revenue from the static model in (8). The associated vacancy cost (cv) reflects the degree to which the apartment “discourages” lease expirations. In this example, the apartment can gain a maximum of 8.175% improvement in revenue by implementing LEM, as compared to the case without LEM.Example 2The impact of nt+Lon the revenue of an apartmentWe compare the revenue increment for cases with different sets of nt+Lfor four scenarios: (i) nt+L=nt+L(SM); (ii) nt+L<nt+L(SM); (iii) nt+L>nt+L(SM); and (iv) nt+L=dt(pt). In this example, we set nt+Lin scenario (iii) such thatxtv>0for all t. Therefore, among these four scenarios, the value ofctsaffects the pricing decision and consequently, the revenue, only in scenario (iv); it does not affect revenues for the other three scenarios.Fig. 5shows the impact of nt+Lon the revenue increments with LEM. Fig. 5(a) shows the changes of revenue increments withctvfor the first three scenarios and Fig. 5(b) shows the changes of revenue increments withctsfor scenario (iv). From Fig. 5 (a), we see that when nt+L=nt+L(SM), the apartment will enhance the profit the most with implementation of LEM.Fig. 5(b) shows that when nt+L=dt(pt) for all t, forcts<xts=386, the revenue drops asctsincreases. As a result, the apartment loses revenue with LEM as compared to the case without LEM. The example implies that the given set of nt+L=dt(pt) for an optimistic demand in implementing LEM forces a lower price to be set asctsincreases. This may lead to a potential revenue loss if nt+Lcannot reflect the future demand pattern. Even the worse, when the actual demand is unfavorable, it results in more vacant units and greater revenue loss. Whencts>xts, the rental rates for leases and the revenue do not change withcts(Corollary 2), and this results in a significant loss in revenue. The associated shortage costsctsreflect the degree that the apartment “encourages” lease expirations.Example 3To compare the case with stochastic demand to the case with deterministic demand, we use the same set of nt+Las given in Example 1. In addition, we assume that ξtfollows a uniform distribution in each period with ft(ξt)=1/ltand a mean 0, where lt=[2,3,2,3,2,3,4,5,6,4,3,2,2,4,3,2,3,4,5,6,7,5,3,2]. Results on the percent of revenue increase with cvfrom a 10,000-time simulation are shown in Fig. 6.In this example, the expected revenue without LEM is $672,776, which is 1.57% lower than the case of deterministic demand in Example 1. The example also shows that the implementation of LEM in the apartment enhances its revenue. Whencv>maxxtv,xtvv=4626, the rental rates given by Proposition 3 are unchanged with the value of cvin this example; as a result, the revenue is unchanged with the value of cv.
