@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The single-product, single-period newsvendor problem with two decision variables, namely price and stock quantity, is considered. The performance measure, in addition to the expected revenue, includes the variance of the income scaled with a risk parameter. We present conditions for the concavity of this risk-sensitive performance measure and the uniqueness of the optimal solution for both risk-averse and risk-seeking cases under the additive demand model, and compare the results to others previously published. These conditions are introduced in terms of the lost sales rate elasticity. Furthermore, we provide numerical examples that aim to endorse the theoretical results herein explained.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The newsvendor problem has been widely studied since it first appeared at the end of the XIX century. It is still the subject of further research that addresses more complex and realistic situations based on previous work. The problem, in its basic formulation, aims at finding an optimal replenishment policy of a perishable product in the face of an uncertain, stochastic demand. Such a solution is selected in a way that maximizes the expected profit, which is calculated as the difference between the expected income and the purchase cost of the good in question. Many modifications to this basic model have been proposed throughout the years, introducing additional complexity to the problem.On one hand, research efforts have focused on a profit-maximizer individual or business that wants to maximize the expected profit. The literature offers us a very diverse range of assumptions and approaches to different demand and inventory models. For example, Whitin (1955) introduced the effect of price in the stochastic demand, thus adding this decision variable to the problem, on top of the stocking quantity. Petruzzi and Dada (1999) used this price-demand relationship in several ways while presenting a single-period approach that maximized expected profit and established theorems that indicated how to select the stocking policy based on the statistical distribution that conferred the demand its stochastic nature. Such demand was presented in the form of an additive and in the form of a multiplicative model. Moreover, they presented a closed, analytical expression to determine the optimal price as a function of such stocking policy and compared it to the so-called riskless price as done by Mills (1959). Also, they showed how pricing decisions affect demand uncertainty under various modeling assumptions. Federgruen and Heching (1999) introduced a multi-period model for inventory control with backlogging which included a price-dependent stochastic demand and analyzed the optimal pricing and replenishment strategies to be set simultaneously in each period and how they compared when prices can be set bi-directionally or when only markdowns are allowed. Kocabiyikoglu and Popescu (2011) unified and introduced the concept of lost sales rate (LSR) elasticity and explained the monotonicity of the optimal price and stock as a function of this new concept. Moreover, they set the properties that the LSR elasticity must possess for the profit to be jointly concave as a function of pricing and stocking decisions and for the problem to have a unique optimal solution.On the other hand, and as opposed to the norm in financial analysis, a tradeoff between expected return and risk in planning problems has been absent for many years. All the articles mentioned above presented a price-dependent demand and a profit-optimizer decision maker that is risk-neutral. This decision maker seeks to maximize the expected profit by finding an appropriate balance between expected income and expected costs. However, these models do not take into account the variance of the income, and therefore it is likely to select an optimal policy that maximizes the expected income but presents a variability that turns this decision into a risky bet. Some research efforts have taken place with respect to this approach. However, albeit the demand keeps its stochastic nature, in many cases it is not presented as a function of the price and therefore the optimization is sought by means of only selecting an optimal quantity of product to purchase, thus disregarding pricing decisions. To the best of our knowledge, it was Lau (1980) who first considered a mean-standard deviation payoff criterion within the newsvendor model, although he only gave the equation whose root provided the optimal quantity. Chen and Federgruen (2000) presented this mean-variance analysis for different planning problems, namely, the newsvendor problem, the base stock problem and the (R, nQ) model. When dealing with the newsvendor problem, they applied a single-stage model that optimized a utility function for risk-neutral, risk-averse and risk-seeking decision maker over a feasible region given by an efficient frontier. Later on, Choi, Li, and Yan (2008) introduced stockout costs in the mean-variance analysis and presented results for various risk attitudes under demands that followed well-known statistical distributions. Wu, Li, Wang, and Cheng (2009) focused on the impact that stockout costs have on the optimal ordering decisions when comparing classic models and mean-variance analysis models, showing via numerical results that, for a given stockout price, a mean-variance analysis yields a lower optimal order quantity and a lower optimal value of the problem. Özler, Tan, and Karaesmen (2009) offered a one-stage, multi-product approach with value-at-risk considerations that included mathematical programming results for the case of one and two products and an approximation to the N-product case. Wang and Webster (2009) introduced an alternative approach by using a piece-wise linear loss-aversion utility function. Wang, Webster, and Suresh (2009) studied the newsvendor problem within the expected utility framework and considered three different classes of utility functions, namely, constant absolute risk aversion (CARA), decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA), and increasing absolute risk aversion (IARA), whereas Choi and Ruszczyński (2011) examined this model with an exponential utility function used to model a risk-averse decision-maker with a constant risk coefficient in the sense of the Arrow–Pratt measure.In the present paper, our aim is to combine the two approaches introduced above. That is, we present a mean-variance analysis of the newsvendor problem that includes a stochastic, price-dependent demand. This problem was presented before by Agrawal and Seshadri (2000), but it was approached from the perspective of the expected utility framework, selecting concave utility functions to model risk-averse situations and finding the relation of optimal pricing and stocking strategies with respect to the levels of risk aversion. There have been other similar efforts; in particular, Chen, Xu, and Zhang (2009) proposed a model based on a conditional value-at-risk decision criterion (CVaR), where it was analyzed how the optimal price and stock quantity changed when varying the η-quantile of the function they sought to maximize. Our work is focused on an alternative approach that penalizes the variability of the profit in the objective function and rests in earlier research done by Filar, Kallenberg, and Lee (1989) and Baykal-Gürsoy and Ross (1992) when tackling Markov decision processes. On this basis, we perform such analysis for an additive demand model under several risk assumptions, in order to yield results that allow us to discern how the newsvendor’s risk attitude affects the optimal stocking and pricing policies. In addition, these results are extended to the field of economics by providing an interpretation in terms of the (LSR) elasticity.The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the problem formulation. In Section 3, we focus on the risk-averse environment and set forth the assumptions under which the risk-sensitive performance measure can be both sequentially optimized and simultaneously optimized. We also provide insight about the behavior of the optimal pricing and stocking decisions as a function of the risk aversion, and show numerical examples where these results can be visually analyzed. In Section 4 we approach the problem again under a risk-seeking environment and state similar conditions under which the performance measure presents a predictable behavior. Finally, we summarize our conclusions in Section 5.Consider a decision maker who sells a perishable product, and has the ability to decide on the quantity to produce or buy and the price to set for the good he or she sells. Moreover, such a decision must be based on the expected revenue for the upcoming period, the production/procurement costs and the variability of the revenue. Assuming that the demand for a period is random and a function of the price we introduce the following risk-sensitive performance measure:(1)P˜(p,x)=pE(min{D(p,ϵ),x})−cx−λVar(p·min{D(p,ϵ),x}),where p is the price set for the good andϵis a continuous random variable with expected valueE(ϵ≥0)and finite varianceVar(ϵ). This random variable with support [A, B], where A < 0 and B > 0, has a probability distribution given by the continuous density function f and the cumulative distribution function F. We assume that F is twice differentiable everywhere on its domain. Furthermore, x is the inventory level set for the good, c is the production/procurement cost per unit of finished product andD(p,ϵ)is the demand for a single period given the price p and the realization of the random variableϵ. Finally, λ is a risk parameter greater than 0 for risk-averse cases, smaller than 0 for risk-seeking cases and equal to 0 in risk-neutral cases.Although the risk-sensitive performance measure defined in Eq. (1) lacks economic meaning, optimizing Eq. (1) must be understood as maximizing profit while minimizing variance (for a risk-averse newsvendor) or while also maximizing variance (for a risk-seeking newsvendor). Furthermore, the parameter λ can be considered as a scaling factor that balances the expected profit and the variance of the profit. In addition, the expression above contains several assumptions. It assumes that the procurement costs increase linearly with the quantity bought. Implicitly, this means that batch production is not more convenient economically than item-by-item production and the economies of scale do not apply. The introduction of the variability of the revenue weighted with the parameter λ is a different approach compared to that presented by Chen and Federgruen (2000), who presented the attitude towards risk modeled by a utility function that was concave, convex and linear for risk-averse, risk-seeking and risk-neutral settings, respectively. It is also different from CVaR-based models as shown by Chen et al. (2009). Finally, we introduce the demandD(p,ϵ)in the same fashion as Young (1978):D(p,ϵ)=g(p)ϵ+y(p),where both g(·) and y(·) model nonincreasing functions of p. In the present article, we assume that g(p) ≡ 1 andy(p)≡a−bpwith a, b > 0 and therefore we deal with an additive demand model of the formD(p,ϵ)=a−bp+ϵ,which includes a non-random term, usually referred to as riskless demand (Mills, 1959). Furthermore, this additive model implies that pricing decisions do not affect the variability of the demand, asVar[D(p,ϵ)]=Var(ϵ).The decision maker seeks to maximize the performance measure (1). We set forth the following assumptions:(A1)p ∈ (c, pmax] wherepmax≤ab,andy(p)=0,∀p∉(c,pmax],a+E[ϵ]b−pmax≤pmax−c,λ<14(B−E(ϵ))pmax,A+y(c)>0.(A1) indicates that the price to be set has to be bigger than the unit cost of production and smaller than pmax. The latter will never be greater than the price at which the riskless demand for the product, y(p), equals 0. When y(·) is a linear function, this value turns out to beab. (A2) imposes that pmaxwill always be at least as close toa+E[ϵ]bas it is to c. The third assumption will become important in the subsequent analysis and the last assumption imposes that regardless of how small A is, the lowest price that can be set guarantees that the realization of the demand,D(p,ϵ),will still be positive.Let us definez=x−y(p). We can transformP˜in (1) into a function of (p, z) as follows:P˜(p,x)=pE(min{ϵ,z})+py(p)−c(z+y(p))−λVar(pmin{ϵ,z})=pμ(z)−λp2σ2(z)+py(p)−c(z+y(p))=:P(p,z),whereμ(z)=E(min{ϵ,z})=E(ϵ)+∫zB(z−u)f(u)du,z∈[A,B],σ2(z)=Var(min{ϵ,z})=Var(ϵ)+∫zB(z2−u2)f(u)du−[∫zB(z−u)f(u)du]2−2E(ϵ)∫zB(z−u)f(u)du,z∈[A,B].As indicated by Petruzzi and Dada (1999), for a selected value of z we face shortages ifϵ>zand leftovers ifϵ<z. A very immediate interpretation of z is that of safety stock, for it is defined as the difference between the actual stock level and expected demand. Understanding the behavior of the functions above is crucial for the analysis that will be shown later. On one hand, μ(·) is an increasing function of z in [A, B], forμ(A)=A<0,μ(B)=E(ϵ)anddμ(z)dz=1−F(z). While σ2(·) is a nonnegative, increasing function of z, withσ2(A)=0,σ2(B)=Var(ϵ)anddσ2(z)dz=2[1−F(z)][z−μ(z)]≥0. After further simplifications, the decision-maker’s problem can be written as:(2)maxp,zP(p,z)=maxp,z(−p2[λσ2(z)+b]+p[μ(z)+a+cb]−c(z+a)).Sequential optimization seeks optimization of a function of several variables by sequentially selecting the optimal values of each variable that will, at the end, produce the maximum of the function that we need to maximize. Zabel (1970) proposes a method by which it is possible to find the optimal price that maximizes the performance measure for a given z. Then, this function can be expressed in terms of only one variable, z, and consequently optimized. However, finding the optimal price requires concavity of p with respect to z. To this end, we have(3)∂P(p,z)∂p=−2p(λσ2(z)+b)+(μ(z)+a+cb),(4)∂2P(p,z)∂p2=−2(λσ2(z)+b).The risk setting, λ > 0, and the nonnegativity of b and σ2(z) defines the performance measure P(·) such that P( ·, z) is concave, since∂2P(p,z)∂p2<0. Forcing (3) to be equal to 0 yields the price p that maximizes P( ·, z) for a given z:(5)p*(z)=μ(z)+a+cb2[λσ2(z)+b].Lemma 1The optimal price p*is uniquely determined by (5) and is increasing. Moreover, p*(z) ∈ (c, pmax], for any z ∈ [A, B].The optimal price atz=Ais greater than the cost c, forp*(A)=A+a+cb2b>c. On the other hand, an upper bound of p*(·) is given byp*(z)≤E(ϵ)+a+cb2b≤pmax,which is guaranteed by assumption (A2). It remains to prove that p*(·) is increasing. Indeed:(6)dp*(z)dz=1−F(z)2[λσ2(z)+b][1−4λ(z−μ(z))p*(z)].The expression above is always positive (i.e. p*(·) is increasing) provided that1−4λ(z−μ(z))p*(z)>0. However, we know that1−4λ(z−μ(z))p*(z)≥1−4λ(B−E(ϵ))pmax,whence we obtain the condition that for the expression above to be positive we need:λ<14(B−E(ϵ))pmax,which was assumed by (A3). Therefore, pmax≥ p*(z) > c, ∀z ∈ [A, B].□The optimal price for a given z, p*(z), is smaller in the risk-averse case (λ > 0) than in the risk-neutral case (λ=0). This conclusion is correct both mathematically and intuitively, for a risk-averse individual will set lower prices to make sure that sales are as high as possible, and endorses the results obtained by Agrawal and Seshadri (2000). The price in the risk-neutral case is in turn smaller than or equal to the optimal riskless price as observed by Petruzzi and Dada (1999). However, the results of Agrawal and Seshadri (2000) claim that the optimal risk-neutral price equals the optimal riskless price, whereas the model proposed in this paper suggests that the optimal risk-neutral price is in between the optimal risk-averse price and the optimal riskless price.The risk-sensitive performance measure under the best price function of the safety stock z is defined as(7)P*(z):=P(p*(z),z)=14(μ(z)+a+cb)2λσ2(z)+b−c(z+a)=12p*(z)(μ(z)+a+cb)−c(z+a),Its first derivative with respect to z is given by(8)dP*(z)dz=p*(z)(1−F(z))[1−2λ(z−μ(z))p*(z)]−c.(Kocabiyikoglu & Popescu, 2011) The lost sales rate (LSR) elasticity for a given price p and inventory level x is defined asκ˜(p,x)=p(G(p,x))p′1−G(p,x),whereG(p,x):=Pr(D(p,ϵ)≤x)and(G(p,x))p′≡∂G(p,x)∂p.Furthermore, for the additive case we know thatPr(y(p)+ϵ≤x)=Pr(ϵ≤x−y(p))=F(z).Hence, by means of a direct application of Leibniz’s Rule we can further simplify the expression above and write it in terms of z as shown below:κ˜(p,x)=p(G(p,x))p′1−G(p,x)=pbf(z)1−F(z)=:ɛ˜(p,z).Moreover, by means of Lemma 1, we can introduceɛ˜*(z):=ɛ˜(p*(z),z).Theorem 1Assume thatɛ˜*(z):=bp*(z)f(z)1−F(z)≥12.Then, the single-period optimal stocking and pricing policy for the case of additive demand is to stockx*=y(p*)+z*units to sell at the unit price p*, where p*is specified by Lemma1and z*is the unique root of the equationp*(z)(1−F(z))[1−2λ(z−μ(z))p*(z)]−c=0.See Appendix E.□The result shown by Theorem 1 matches that found by Kocabiyikoglu and Popescu (2011) for a risk-neutral individual (λ=0).Albeit we have analyzed the difference between the price p*(z) that maximizes the performance measure for a given value of z in risk-neutral and risk-averse environments, it remains to see what happens to z*(p), the value of z that maximizes this measure for a given price p. The first and second partial derivatives of P(·) with respect to z as well as the cross partial derivative yield(9)∂P(p,z)∂z=p(1−F(z))[1−2λp(z−μ(z))]−c,(10)∂2P(p,z)∂z2=pf(z)[2λp(z−μ(z))−1]−2λp2F(z)(1−F(z)),(11)∂2P(p,z)∂p∂z=[1−F(z)][1−4λp(z−μ(z))].A closer look to the formulae above reveals that in a risk-neutral setting P(p, ·) is concave for a given price p and the maximum of the performance measure is obtained atz=F−1(1−cp),which is a well-known result. When λ > 0 this objective function is still concave, for (A3) guarantees that2λp(z−μ(z))−1is negative. However, there is not a closed form that yields the optimum value z*, which solves the equation(12)(1−F(z))[1−2λp(z−E(ϵ)−∫zB(z−u)f(u)du)]−cp=0.Let us fix p ∈ (c, pmax]. In the following lemma we examine the dependence of z* on λ. This dependence is expressed byz˜*(λ)to indicate the value of z* at a given point p for some λ.Lemma 2The functionz˜*(·)is decreasing.See Appendix E.□The result above endorses that obtained under CVaR considerations by Chen et al. (2009) and also that yielded by the use of the expected utility framework by Agrawal and Seshadri (2000). In that sense, the model proposed here provides certainty with respect to the behavior of the optimal order quantity in additive models of the forma−bp+ϵin the face of risk-averse environments.Unlike the approach we took in Section 3.1, we focus now on giving conditions to jointly optimize price and quantity decisions simultaneously, thus guaranteeing that (2) has a unique solution.Theorem 2Ifɛ˜(p,z)≥12,then P(·) is jointly concave in p and z and the problem referenced by (2) has a unique price-quantity solution(p*,z*+y(p*)).See Appendix E.□The result shown by Theorem 2 also matches that found by Kocabiyikoglu and Popescu (2011) for a risk-neutral individual (λ=0).Notice that this condition for joint concavity is very restrictive as it requires the LSR elasticity to be greater than or equal to12in the whole domain of the function under study. This condition is sufficient to guarantee that (p*, z*) is a maximum, but it is not necessary. If P(.) were not jointly concave, the state of (p*, z*) as a critical point would not be altered, for the only necessary and sufficient condition for criticality is that the Hessian matrix is negative semidefinite at that precise point and this is guaranteed ifɛ˜*(z)≥12,which is in turn a sufficient condition for the existence of a unique maximum in P(·) (Cachon & Netessine, 2006).In order to illustrate the ideas previously exposed, we proceed with several numerical examples using different distribution functions for the random variableϵ. In particular, we presentϵas a random variable uniformly distributed in [A, B], and a random variable normally distributed with meanμ=0and standard deviationσ=10,and truncated below A and above B. For both cases, we use the following parameters to define the problem:A=−10,B=10,a=35,b=1,c=10,andλmax<14Bpmax≤11400. In addition, we include the case of a uniform distribution with expectation different from 0 withA=−3,B=40,a=35,b=1.5,c=10,andλmax<14(B−E(ϵ))pmax. Per Assumption (A2), pmax≥ 22.5 in the first two cases and pmax≥ 23.83 in the case of the uniform distribution with expectation different from 0. Table A.1 contains, for these three distributions, the optimal values of p, z and P(p, z) for each value of λ that was put to the test. All tables and figures referenced can be found in Appendix A and Appendix C, respectively.With respect to the uniform distribution centered at 0, Fig. C.1 shows the optimal price p*(·) and its first two derivatives for different values of λ that range from λmax, representing the most risk-averse newsvendor, to 0, representing a risk-neutral newsvendor. In this case, the impact of risk-aversion on the optimal price p*(·) is not very significant, being 2.32% whenz=10but it is interesting to verify that increasing risk-aversion leads to smaller optimal prices and how this price is concave in [A, B]. Also, Fig. C.2 shows how the LSR elasticityɛ˜*is always greater than12,which in turn guarantees that P*(·) is concave. Note that since p*(·) differs very little for different values of λ, the curves ofɛ˜*(·)almost overlap. Also, the optimal value of the objective function P* is inversely proportional to the value of λ and its optimum value changes only 3.45% between the most risk-averse situation and the risk neutral situation. It is worth mentioning that in this caseɛ˜(p,z)≥12and therefore the performance measure is jointly concave.In the case of a truncated normal distribution, when comparing the most risk-averse situation with the risk-neutral case, the optimal price p* reveals a difference of 2.44% atz=10,which is very similar to that is found in the previous numerical example. Again, and endorsing the theoretical results, p*(·) is concave andɛ˜*(z)≥12,which guarantees the existence of a unique optimum. Such optimum yields a gap of 3.02% between the most risk-averse case and the risk-neutral scenario. This difference is as well very similar to that is shown for the uniform distribution (3.02% vs. 3.45%). Unlike the uniform case, this distribution does not provide P(·) with joint concavity, as there are some values ofɛ˜(p,z)under12.Finally, the uniform distribution with mean different from 0 yields a bigger gap of the optimal price at the right extreme of the interval, with this price at the risk-neutral case being 5.12% greater than in the most-risk averse case forz=B=40. The optimal lost sales rate elasticity remains greater than12at all times, which produces a concave curve for P*(·) that has a more significant variation between the risk neutral case and the most risk-averse situation (7.83%). Like in the case of the truncated normal distribution,ɛ˜(p,z)is smaller than12in some regions, which leads to a surface that is not jointly concave.We also calculate the values ofz˜*(λ)for different λ and a given pricep=20,using the same parameter values specified at the beginning of this section. The results can be found in Table A.2 and show, as claimed by Lemma 2, that the risk-aversion is inversely proportional to the optimum value of z*(20).In order to show the effect that risk aversion has on the profit, Tables A.1 and A.2 also include the expected profit and the standard deviation of the profit for each case considered. These can be calculated directly from (1). Intuitively, the expected profit and the standard deviation of the profit should decrease as the level of risk aversion increases. Indeed, this is the case in all the different scenarios presented.Whereas the expressions of all the partial derivatives previously obtained are still valid for risk-seeking situations, the conditions under which the performance measure is concave are greatly modified by the fact that λ < 0. We turn now our attention to this case in which, again, we are seeking the maximization ofP(p,z)=pμ(z)−λp2σ2(z)+py(p)−c(z+y(p)).Furthermore, we set forth the following assumptions, some of which were explained formerly (we refer the reader to Section 3 for the justification of the first three of them). The fourth assumption will become relevant in the next section. Note that in this case we have not included any assumption on the value of λ; this condition will be addressed as part of the analysis that will follow.(B1)p ∈ (c, pmax] wherepmax≤ab,andy(p)=0,∀p∉(c,pmax],a+E(ϵ)b−pmax≤pmax−c,A+y(c)>0,E(ϵ)<y(c).Lemma 3The risk-sensitive performance measure P( ·, z) is concave for each z, ifλ≥−bVar(ϵ).We proceed as in the risk-averse case. However, the inequality∂2(p,z)∂p2=−2(λσ2(z)+b)<0does not hold for every value of λ. Therefore, settingλ≥maxz−bσ2(z)solves this problem and, given that σ2(·) is an increasing function, it is enough to setλ≥−bσ2(B)=−bVar(ϵ).□The result shown by Lemma 3 may not respect (B1). In fact, as shown analytically in Lemma 1, forλ=−bVar(ϵ)the price p*(z) goes to infinity and violates the assumption that this quantity cannot be greater than pmax. For that reason, we need to further restrict the possible selection of values for λ.Lemma 4For a fixed z and a value of λ in the interval[b(E(ϵ)−y(c))2aVar(ϵ),0)the optimal price is determined uniquely as a function of z as shown by (5) and its value is always contained in (c, pmax].See Appendix E.□In the risk-seeking case (λ < 0), the optimal price for a given z, p*(z), is greater than that is found for the risk-neutral case (λ=0). This conclusion is correct both mathematically and intuitively, for a risk-seeking individual will set higher prices in his pursuit of greater profit, accepting the risk of selling less as a result of such decision.Once the conditions for P( ·, z) to be concave is established, analogous to what was shown for the risk-averse case, we address the concavity of P*(·).Theorem 3Assume that for every z ∈ [A, B](13)ɛ˜*(z)≥bdp*(z)dz−2λp*(z)b[F(z)p*(z)+(z−μ(z))dp*(z)dz]1−2λ(z−μ(z))p*(z).Then the single-period optimal stocking and pricing policy for the case of additive demand is to stockx*=y(p*)+z*units to sell at the unit price p*, where p*is specified by Lemma4and z*is the unique root of Eq. (9).See Appendix E.□Obviously this condition for concavity requires evaluating the function for any z ∈ [A, B]. There exist, however, more expeditive approaches to rule out concavity: given any distribution, equation (13) shows thatɛ˜*(A)≥12andɛ˜*(B)≥−2λbp*2(B)1−2(B−E(ϵ))p*(B)λ. This means that if we find the optimal LSR elasticity values at the extreme of the intervals to be less than these quantities, P*(·) will not be concave. Also, by the definition of the LSR elasticity, if the chosen distribution has an increasing hazard rate, so does its optimal elasticity. This means that ifɛ˜*(z)<12for any given z, then its value atz=Awill not be greater or equal to12and therefore P*(·) will not be concave.In an effort to come up with a friendlier condition for the concavity of P*(·), we can estimate an upper bound of the right hand side of (13) and set(14)ɛ˜*(z)≥bK−2λa(ab+(B−E(ϵ))K),with K being the maximum value thatdp*(z)dzattains in [A, B]. A priori, if the behavior of the functionz↦dp*(z)dzis unknown, this maximum value can be large, with a rough upper bound given by1−4λ(B−E(ϵ))ab2(λVar(ϵ)+b),and therefore this expression might not be effective. If, like it was the case in risk-averse situations, this function is decreasing (i.e., p*(·) is concave), then it attains a maximum value of12batz=Aand the bound above becomesɛ˜*(z)≥12−λab(2a+B−E(ϵ)).This is potentially a very useful result, but requires the concavity of p*(·). In what follows, we show the conditions that are needed for such a case to take place.Lemma 5Ifλ≥maxz{−f(z)b4(a+B−E(ϵ))+f(z)Var(ϵ)},z∈[A,B],then the functionz↦dp*(z)dzis decreasing.See Appendix E.□The previous result allows us to state the following theorem.Theorem 4Assume thatλ≥maxz{−f(z)b4(a+B−E(ϵ))+f(z)Var(ϵ)},z∈[A,B],andɛ˜*(z)≥12−λab[2a+B−E(ϵ)].Then the single-period optimal stocking and pricing policy for the case of additive demand is to stockx*=y(p*)+z*units to sell at the unit price p*, where p*is specified by Lemma4and z*is the unique root of Eq. (9).Since λ is contained in a range that guarantees that the functionz↦dp*(z)dzis decreasing, then we have thatK=dp*(z)dz|z=A=12band therefore (14), which establishes a condition for the concavity of P*(·), can be written asɛ˜*(z)≥12−λab[2a+B−E(ϵ)].By virtue of (E.2) and (E.3) there exists a point z* ∈ (A, B) at which the function P*(·) attains a maximum, and such point is uniquely determined by the root of Eq. (9).□Given an appropriate range of values for λ, the LSR elasticity that is required in risk-seeking cases is greater than that is required in risk-averse situations.Defineɛ^*(p)=ɛ˜(p,z*(p)),and let pA and pB be prices in the interval (c, pmax] which yieldz*(pA)=Aandz*(pB)=B,respectively, and that may or may not exist. Then, ifɛ^*(p)>bp1B−E(ϵ),c<p≤pmax,the optimal safety stockz˜*(·)is a decreasing function of λ, i.e., given a price p, the optimal safety stock increases as we face more risk-seeking situations.See Appendix E.□We proceed now to present some examples for the risk-seeking case. As the reader may have noticed, this case is more intrincated than the risk-averse case, with more conditions to be satisfied for obtaining a desirable behavior of the performance measure. Our experience has been that selecting λ according to Theorem 3 induces a more significant impact on the optimal value of the objective function. These examples gave way to a larger range of values for the risk parameter, as we only require thatλ∈[b(E(ϵ)−y(c))2aVar(ϵ),0). As far as the optimal elasticity,ɛ˜*(z),Theorem 3 provides a more complex expression than Theorem 4 that needs to be evaluated at any z ∈ [A, B]. Despite this hindrance, it was not particularly difficult to find instances where this condition was satisfied and allowed us to get significant results. All the tables and figures referenced in the next lines can be found in Appendix B and Appendix D, respectively.We present the case thatϵis uniformly distributed in the range[−30,200]with demand given byD(p,ϵ)=600−60p+ϵ. The purchase cost of the item we sell isc=7. It can be seen in Fig. D.1 how optimal price p*(·) may not be concave for some values of λ but still is an increasing function of z and its value is held betweenc=7andpmax=a/b=10as expected whenever λ is greater than or equal tob(E(ϵ)−y(c))2aVar(ϵ). The risk-neutral case yields as well an optimal price which is 9.33% smaller than that of the most risk-seeking setting. Fig. D.2 shows for the most risk-seeking case thatɛ˜*(·)is always above the necessary and sufficient condition expressed by Eq. (13), thus conferring concavity to the performance measure for this value of λ. For clarity, we omit similar curves for other tested scenarios but, as the fourth chart in this figure shows, all cases satisfy (13). In this example, there is a considerable gap in the optimal value of the objective function between a risk-neutral scenario and the most risk seeking case, with the latter being 29.31% larger than the former.The last example introduces a normal distribution with mean 25 and variance 1600 truncated below by−30and above by 100. The demand follows the expressionD(p,ϵ)=175−35p+ϵwhereϵrepresents the random variable with the said distribution. The purchase cost of the item that we sell is nowc=2.7. These parameters produce a noteworthy effect on the objective function that is even more remarkable than that in the last example: the risk-neutral case yields an optimum value which is 77.80% lower than that of the most risk-seeking scenario. Likewise, the optimal price, is 17.81% lower whenλ=0than when it is at its minimum value. Albeit p*(·) is not concave in this case either, the condition for the concavity of P*(·), as established in Theorem 3, holds for all λ considered. Table B.1, in turn, displays the optimal pricing and safety stock decisions along with the optimum value of the objective function, the expected profit, and the standard deviation of the profit that they produce for the different values of λ that were attempted. Note that in both cases the impact of risk-seekingness in the nature of the profit as a stochastic variable is remarkable, to the point that, whenλ=λmin,the decision-maker faces scenarios where he or she must expect a loss in exchange for a much greater variability in the profit.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The approach that our model intends to give to the newsvendor problem aims at serving as a comparison with previously used models based on CVaR measures and the expected utility framework. Here we introduce a simple yet powerful variation of the single-period, price-dependent demand newsvendor problem with two decision variables (namely, price and stock quantity) by including the variability of the demand scaled by the attitude towards risk that the seller has. Such attitude can be risk-averse or risk-seeking. The latter is much scarcer in the literature and can be taken as a starting point for future research efforts. It also presents more difficult situations under this model given the complexity of the conditions that have to hold for the performance measure to behave appropriately. However, we show that when those conditions apply, the impact of a risk-seeking newsvendor on the objective function can be remarkable.We present results that back those found for risk-averse situations in other works with different models, plus we add conclusions for risk-seeking cases along with other findings that, despite being intuitive, need mathematical endorsement. For instance, it was shown that the optimal price for a given safety stock z, p*(z), is smaller in risk-averse cases than in risk-neutral cases. Conversely, in risk-seeking cases, this price is greater. In both scenarios, however, it is an increasing function of z. This price is also concave in z for the risk-averse case, whereas such concavity is guaranteed in a smaller range of λ for the risk-seeking case.Furthermore, it was found that the optimal safety stock as a function of the price, z*(·), always decreases as we face an increase in risk-aversion. Intuitively, one might think that the opposite would happen in risk-seeking cases (i.e.,z˜*(·)always increases as we turn to be more risk-seeking). However, this result is true only provided thatɛ^*(p)≥bp1B−E(ϵ).Finally, we comment on the values of λ. The restrictions that our models set on the range of values that this parameter may take have to be considered as a scaling measure of risk. Out of the proposed ranges for λ, the concavity of the objective function is not guaranteed, although it might occur. In particular, if we are concerned about a risk-averse environment, it makes sense to set the most averse case to the maximum value that λ can take (i.e.,14pmax(B−E(ϵ))) and scale our risk situations according to the range[0,14pmax(B−E(ϵ))). Similarly, we can identify the most favorable risk-seeking case according to the lower bounds described in Theorem 3 or Theorem 4, whatever suits us best, and evaluate different risk measures according to this scale. Having such bounds on the risk parameter is reasonable. It is seldom that the results hold for the entire range of λ . Even in models with the exponential utility function (in which the decision maker is equipped with a constant risk coefficient) or other measures of risk, the degree of risk aversion is somewhat bounded to obtain certain results. On the other hand, in real life problems, λ is usually small, or close to zero. Hence the results for large λ are not meaningful.The model proposed here also has some limitations which in turn provide research opportunities for the future. In particular, the demand is linear with respect to the price. Other relationships between price and demand that will yield different conditions for the concavity of the objective function can be proposed. It would also be interesting to see how the results found in this paper change when the risk measure is different. The standard semideviation proposed by Choi and Ruszczyński (2008) is a reasonable alternative, although the analysis of the optimality conditions for the concavity of the objective function seems more complicated in this case. Further research can also be done if we consider censored demand that originates when there is a loss of information that does not allow us to observe the true demand. This occurs, for example, in the case of stockouts. Recent research efforts have been made in this area (see Besbes & Muharremoglu, 2013; Huh, Levi, Rusmevichientong, & Orlin, 2011; Rudi & Drake, 2014; Sachs & Minner, 2014) from which new approaches and ideas can be drawn from. For more comments on research and an excellent survey the reader is referred to Qin, Wang, Vakharia, Chen, and Seref (2011).Theorem 1ProofFirst, we show that p*(·) is concave. Indeed, the second-order derivative of this function yields(E.1)d2p*(z)dz2=−4λ1−F(z)2(λσ2(z)+b)[F(z)p*(z)+(z−μ(z))dp*(z)dz],which is clearly nonpositive, sincez−μ(z)≥0for z ∈ [A, B] and the function p*(·) is increasing.Analyzing (8) at the extreme points of the interval [A, B] yields:(E.2)dP*(z)dz|z=A=A+a+cb2b−2bc2b>0,byassumption(A5),(E.3)dP*(z)dz|z=B=−c<0.Therefore, there exists a point z* ∈ (A, B) at which the function P*(·) attains its maximum. We claim that such a point is unique by showing that P*(·) is a concave function. Indeed,(E.4)d2P*(z)dz2=(dp*(z)dz(1−F(z))−f(z)p*(z))×[1−2λ(z−μ(z))p*(z)]−2λp*(z)(1−F(z))[F(z)p*(z)+(z−μ(z))dp*(z)dz].Note the similarity of the last term on the right-hand side to the right hand side of Eq. (E.1); hence this term is also nonpositive. The first term of the right-hand side, however, might take on a different sign. While (A3) guarantees that[1−2λ(z−μ(z))p*(z)]≥0,it is unclear what happens with the first part of the term. If we force it to be nonpositive, we have thatdp*(z)dz(1−F(z))−f(z)p*(z)≤0.However, since the functionz↦dp*(z)dzis decreasing, it attains its maximum atz=A:dp*(z)dz|z=A=12b⇒dp*(z)dz(1−F(z))−f(z)p*(z)≤12b(1−F(z))−f(z)p*(z)≤0.The last inequality is equivalent tobp*(z)f(z)1−F(z)≥12,from which we conclude that P*(·) is concave ifɛ˜*(z)≥12,∀z∈[A,B].□Lemma 2ProofGiven the complexity of Eq. (12), we proceed to see howz˜*varies with changing λ. Thus, if we rename the left-hand side of (12) as g(λ, z), the following holds∂g(λ,z)∂λ=−2p(1−F(z)[z−μ(z)],∂g(λ,z)∂z=f(z)[2λp(z−μ(z))−1]−2λpF(z)(1−F(z)).By means of the Implicit Function Theorem (Stewart, 2011) it turns out that(E.5)dz˜*(λ)dλ=2p(1−F(z˜*(λ))[z˜*(λ)−μ(z˜*(λ))]f(z˜*(λ))[2λp(z˜*(λ)−μ(z˜*(λ)))−1]−2λpF(z˜*(λ))(1−F(z˜*(λ))).The numerator in the formula above is always nonnegative. The second term of the denominator is always nonnegative as well but it is subtracted. Then, if the first term in the denominator is negative, the entire expression will become negative. This occurs, if:2λp(z˜*(λ)−μ(z˜*(λ)))−1<0,whenceλ<12p(z˜*(λ)−μ(z˜*(λ)))≤12pmax(B−E(ϵ)),but this is guaranteed by (A3). Therefore,z˜*(·)is decreasing.□Theorem 2ProofWe must show that the Hessian matrix of P(·) is negative semidefinite. This implies that∂2P(p,z)∂z2≤0andΔ(p,z)=∂2P(p,z)∂p2∂2P(p,z)∂z2−(∂2P(p,z)∂p∂z)2≥0.Note that the validity of the conditions above also implies that∂2P(p,z)∂p2≤0. Eqs. (4) and (11) are negative and nonnegative respectively. Likewise, the second-order partial derivative of z↦P(p, z) with respect to z is nonpositive as a consequence of a straightforward application of (A3):∂2P(p,z)∂z2=−2λp2F(z)[1−F(z)]−pf(z)[1−2λp(z−μ(z))]≤0.Finally, it remains to check that the determinant of the Hessian matrix is nonnegative:Δ(p,z)=2[λσ2(z)+b][2λp2F(z)(1−F(z))+pf(z)(1−2λp(z−μ(z)))]−[1−F(z)]2[1−4λp(z−μ(z))]2]]≥(1−F(z)){(4λbp2F(z)+(1−2λp(z−μ(z))))+F(z)[1−4λp(z−μ(z))]2−[1−4λp(z−μ(z))]2}≥0,where the inequality follows from the fact that2(λσ2(z)+b)≥2band from assuming thatɛ˜(p,z)≥12.□Lemma 4ProofGiven (5), it only remains to prove that c < p*(z) ≤ pmax. Indeed, ifλ∈(−bVar(ϵ),0),the right-hand side of (6) is always positive and thus p*(·) is increasing. Besides,p*(A)=A+a+cb2b>c. Therefore, p*(z) > c, ∀z ∈ [A, B].Nonetheless, as shown before, p*(z) may take values greater than pmax. Hence, if we requirep*(B)≤pmax≤ab,then p*(z) ≤ pmaxfor any z ∈ [A, B] (because p*(·) is increasing). Consequently,p*(B)=E(ϵ)+a+cb2(λVar(ϵ)+b)≤ab,which holds wheneverλ≥b(E(ϵ)−y(c))2aVar(ϵ),with the right-hand side being negative, as guaranteed by (B4). Now, it remains to require the numberb(E(ϵ)−y(c))2aVar(ϵ)being contained in the interval(−bVar(ϵ),0). This occurs, wheneverb(E(ϵ)−y(c))2aVar(ϵ)≥−bVar(ϵ),whence we obtain the necessary conditionE(ϵ)≥−y(−c). This condition, however, is always met by virtue of assumption (B3) and the fact thatE(ϵ)>A:−y(c)<A<E(ϵ)⇒−y(−c)<E(ϵ)−2bc<E(ϵ).Therefore, forλ∈[b(E(ϵ)−y(c)2aVar(ϵ),0)the function P( ·, z) is concave for all z ∈ [A, B] and p*(z) ≤ pmax. This concludes the proof.□Theorem 3ProofThe first-order derivative of P*(·) at the points A and B is given by (E.2) and (E.3), respectively. Therefore, there exists a point z* ∈ (A, B) at which the function P*(·) attains its maximum. Such maximum is unique if P*(·) is a concave function and we refer to Eq. (E.4) in order to prove it. Imposing concavity requires that[1−2λ(z−μ(z))p*(z)](dp*(z)dz[1−F(z)]−f(z)p*(z))≤2λp*(z)[1−F(z)](F(z)p*(z)+(z−μ(z))dp*(z)dz).This condition holds forz=B. For all other values of z, dividing both sides by1−F(z)and multiplying by b gives an expression in terms ofɛ˜*(z):ɛ˜*(z)≥bdp*(z)dz−2λp*(z)b[F(z)p*(z)+(z−μ(z))dp*(z)dz]1−2λ(z−μ(z))p*(z),z∈[A,B],which is a necessary and sufficient condition for P*(·) to be concave.□Lemma 5ProofA straightforward application of (E.1) gives a necessary condition fordp*(·)dzto be decreasing:−f(z)(λσ2(z)+b)−2λ(z−μ(z))(1−F(z))2λσ2(z)+b×[1−4λ(z−μ(z))p*(z)]≤4λ(1−F(z))[F(z)p*(z)+(z−μ(z))dp*(z)dz],z∈[A,B].Bounding both sides of this equation yields a sufficient condition for the concavity of p*(·). The condition above always holds forz=Aandz=B(the expression above becomes−f(A)≤0and−f(B)[1−4λ(B−E(ϵ))p*(B)]≤0respectively). For A < z < B, we establish that the largest value of the left-hand side has to be at most equal to the smallest value of the right-hand side. The largest value of the left-hand side is represented by the value that is closest to 0, which is1b(−2λ(B−E(ϵ))−f(z)(λVar(ϵ)+b)). Conversely, the smallest value of the right-hand side is2λ2a+B−E(ϵ)b. Therefore, we obtain that1b[−2λ(B−E(ϵ))−f(z)(λVar(ϵ)+b)]≤2λ2a+B−E(ϵ)b,whenceλ≥−f(z)b4(a+B−E(ϵ))+f(z)Var(ϵ).Since we want this range to be valid for all z, we can rewrite this asλ≥maxz{−f(z)b4(a+B−E(ϵ))+f(z)Var(ϵ)},z∈[A,B].□Lemma 6ProofWe analyze again (E.5) under the light of the implicit function theorem, but this time with the condition λ < 0. The numerator in this equation is still nonnegative, but the second term in the denominator is now nonpositive and is being subtracted. The first term of the denominator is always nonpositive. Hence, ifz˜*(λ)is to decrease with λ we must have thatf(z˜*(λ))[2λp(z˜*(λ)−μ(z˜*(λ)))−1]−2λpF(z˜*(λ))(1−F(z˜*(λ)))<0,but we know that this surely occurs inp=pAandp=pB,for if there existsp=pAsuch thatz˜*(λ)=Athis condition simplifies to−f(A)≤0,which always holds. Moreover, if there existsp=pBsuch thatz˜*(λ)=Bthis condition requires2λp(B−E(ϵ))−1≤0,or equivalentlyλ≤12p(B−E(ϵ),which also holds. For all other values of p we can assert thatdz˜*(λ)dλis nonpositive ifλ≤f(z˜*(λ))2p[f(z˜*(λ))(z˜*(λ)−μ(z˜*(λ)))−F(z˜*(λ))(1−F(z˜*(λ)))],where c < p ≤ pmaxand p ≠ pA, pB. If the right-hand side of this equation is positive, then the condition above always holds anddz˜*(·)dλ≤0. This right-hand side is positive as long asf(z˜*(λ))(z˜*(λ)−μ(z˜*(λ)))−F(z˜*(λ))(1−F(z˜*(λ)))>0,whence, after dividing by1−F(z˜*(λ))and multiplying by bp we obtain thatɛ^*(p)>bpF(z˜*(λ))z˜*(λ)−μ(z˜*(λ)),c<p≤pmax,p≠pA,pB.An upper bound of the right-hand side is given bybp1B−E(ϵ)Therefore, we can conclude that ifɛ^*(p)>bp1B−E(ϵ),c<p≤pmax,then, given a price p,z˜*(·)decreases. In other words, when λ decreases, i.e., as we focus on more risk-seeking situations,z˜*(·)increases. This concludes the proof.□
