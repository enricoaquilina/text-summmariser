We develop a stochastic dominance criterion for the case of mixed-normal distributions.This criterion is a generalization of the mean-variance rule, and a special case of the general SSD criterion.The resulting efficient set is significantly reduced relative to the SSD efficient set.Employing the mean-variance rule in portfolio selection without taking into account that the distribution is mixed normal leads to a loss of 2–3 percent per year.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Standard mean-variance analysis is based on the assumption of normal return distributions. However, a growing body of literature suggests that the market oscillates between two different regimes – one with low volatility and the other with high volatility. In such a case, even if the return distributions are normal in both regimes, the overall distribution is not – it is a mixture of normals. Mean-variance analysis is inappropriate in this framework, and one must either assume a specific utility function or, alternatively, employ the more general and distribution-free Second degree Stochastic Dominance (SSD) criterion. This paper develops the SSD rule for the case of mixed normals: the SSDMN rule. This rule is a generalization the mean-variance rule. The cost of ignoring regimes and assuming normality when the distributions are actually mixed normal can be quite substantial – it is typically equivalent to an annual rate of return of 2–3 percent.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Time series data are often characterized by regime switching with abrupt changes in the system's parameters. This presents several challenges, such as modelingthe regime switching process, empirically estimating the process parameters, and analyzing the implications of regime switching. One of the most important systems in which regime switching has been empirically documented is the capital market. This paper analyzes the implications of regime switching in the stock market to the problem of portfolio choice.The most widely employed framework for portfolio optimization is the Markowitz (1952) mean-variance (MV) analysis, which is also the foundation of the cornerstone Capital Asset Pricing Model (see Markowitz, 2014 for a review). The key assumption in this framework is that the return distributions are normal.11More generally, the mean-variance framework is justified in the broader case of elliptical return distributions, of which the normal is a special case, see for example Ingersoll (1987, pp. 104–113). One can also justify the mean-variance framework with the assumption of quadratic preferences. However, this is very restrictive, as the quadratic preference has several unacceptable properties (see Arrow, 1965).Regime switching has a fundamental implication for this framework: even if the return distributions are normal in each of the regimes, the overall distribution, given the probability of each regime, is not normal – it is a mixture of normals. Thus, the standard MV analysis, which is based on the assumption of normal return distributions is no longer valid in this framework.22A special case where mean-variance analysis is consistent with the regime switching framework is the case where one can fully predict the next-period regime with certainty. However, this contradicts the basic idea of regime-switching models, where the switch from one regime to the other is probabilistic.As the MV approach is inappropriate when there are regime switches, one must either assume a specific utility function, which is rather restrictive, or employ the more general stochastic dominance criteria, which are appropriate for the general case with any return distributions. This is the approach adopted here.The empirical evidence suggests that the market is characterized by two regimes: one with high volatility, and the other with low volatility. Ang and Bekaert (2004) find that the volatility in the high-volatility regime is almost double the volatility in the low-volatility regime. The difference is statistically highly significant. While the average return in the high-volatility regime is somewhat lower than the average return in the low-volatility regime, this difference is not statistically significant.33In the high-volatility regime Ang and Bekaert find a monthly return standard deviation of 5.04 percent with a standard error of 0.55 percent. In the low volatility regime the standard deviation is 2.81 percent with a standard error of 0.44 percent. The average return in the high-volatility regime is 0.13 percentwith a standard error of 0.62 percent, and the average return in the low-volatility regime is 0.90 percentwith a standard error of 0.32 percent(see Table 1 p. 89 in Ang and Bekaert, 2004). This is in contrast to the “bull market”and “bear market”classification, which typically refers to differences in the average returns across the regimes. Note that with daily return data, Kon (1984) does find differences in the average returns across regimes.This is consistent with earlier studies of Ang and Bekaert (2002a, 2002b, 2002c) who find that the difference in the volatilities of the two regimes is large and statistically highly significant, while the hypothesis that the means are the same in both regimes cannot be rejected. Moreover, while for the overall return distribution normality is clearly rejected, it is typically not rejected for each of the two regimes separately.Following the empirical evidence, in this paper we focus on regimes with different volatilities, but with no change in the mean return across the regimes. We develop the stochasticdominance criterion for the case of Mixed Normal return distributions when a riskless asset is available – the SSDMN criterion. This is a criterion for the preference of one portfolio over another for all risk averters. We show that this criterion is a generalization of the standard mean-variance rule, which emerges as a special case when the volatilities are equal across the two regimes.The stronger the assumptions made regarding the return distributions, the smaller the resulting efficient set, and the narrower the “menu” of relevant portfolios the decision-maker has to consider. The two frameworks which are typically employed, mean-variance (MV) and SSD, represent two extremes in this regard. On one extreme, the MV framework makes the strong assumption of normality and yields a single efficient risky asset (the one with the highest Sharpe, 1966 ratio). On the other extreme, the general SSD framework makes no distributional assumptions, but typically yields rather large efficient sets.44For sufficient conditions under which the two approaches yield identical efficient set while risk is not confined to variance, see Schuhmacher and Auer (2014).The SSDMN framework suggested here can be viewed as a middle road between these two extremes. It makes a weaker assumption about the distribution – the mixed normal is a generalization of the normal distribution which is encompassed as a special case – and it yields a smaller efficient set than the SSD efficient set.Suppose that the distribution is mixed normal, and the investor mistakenly assumes normality and employs the MV rule. What is the cost involved? Conversely, suppose that the investor ignores the fact that the distribution is mixed normal and employs the distribution-free SSD framework. What is the cost in this second case? These are key issues addressed in this paper.The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section reviews the related literature. The SSDMN criterion is derived in Section 3. In Section 4, we compare the empirical SSDMN, SSD and SSDR efficient sets by employing empirical data for a set of 311 mutual funds, as well as for the 100 Fama-French portfolios. We find that the SSDMN efficient set is much smaller than the SSD efficient set, and it is typically also substantially smaller than the SSDR (Second degree Stochastic Dominance with a Riskless asset) efficient set. Thus, the information that returns are mixed normal induces a reduction in the efficient set relative to the distribution-free SSD framework. Section 5 analyzes the potential economic cost of assuming normality and ignoring the two different regimes. Even with the very conservative assumption of no predictive power about the next period's regime we find that the economic loss can be substantial, in the order of several percent per year. Section 6 concludes the paper.The notion that the market oscillates between several possible “regimes” or “states” is widespread among both financial practitioners and academics. Market states, that are believed to persist for several months or years, may be driven by business cycles (Hamilton & Lin, 1996), financial crises (Schwert, 1989) and abrupt changes in monetary and fiscal policies (Christie, 1982; Hamilton, 1988). Regime-switching methodology is widespread, among others, in modeling macroeconomic factors (e.g. Hamilton, 1989), interest rates (e.g. Ang and Bekaert, 2002b, 2002c; Bekaert, Hodrick, & Marshall, 2001; Gray, 1996), credit spreads (e.g. Pedrosa & Roll, 1998), exchange rates (e.g. Bollen, Gray, & Whaley, 2000), real estate prices (e.g. Crawford & Fratantoni, 2003), time series correlation (e.g. Pelletier, 2006), electricity prices (e.g. Haldrup & Nielsen, 2006) and prices of other commodities (e.g. Vo, 2009). In particular, a growing number of studies have formalized this notion with regime-switching models of stock returns – see Hamilton (1989), Gray (1996), Bekaert, Hodrick, and Marshal (2001), Ang and Bekaert (2002a, 2002b, 2002c, 2004), Guidolin and Timmermann (2008), and Tu (2010). In these models the market typically has two possible states with well-defined distribution parameters, and transition probabilities that indicate the probability of switching from one state to the other. Ang and Bekaert develop maximum likelihood tests for identifying the two regimes and estimating their respective return parameters.Focusing on the equity market, the single most dramatic difference between the two regimes that Ang and Bekaert (2004) identify is the volatility. Several models based on the idea of regime-switching of the return volatility have been proposed. Schwert (1989) shows that return variance behavior can be captured by two processes, one in which the conditional mean and standard deviation follow a high-order autoregressive process and another in which returns can have a high or low variance, and switches between these states are determined by a two state Markov process. Hamilton and Susmel (1994) and Cai (1994) introduce an ARCH model with Markov-switching parameters in order to take into account sudden changes in the level of the conditional variance. Gray (1996) presents a Markov-switching GARCH model. Klaassen (2002) suggests a modification of this model – see also Dueker (1997), Haas, Mittnik, and Paolella (2004), and Marcucci (2005). Henneke, Rachev, and Fabozzi (2006) develop an algorithm to compute the Bayes estimator for a Markov-switching ARMA-GARCH model and demonstrate its advantage over other models in case of stock returns. Aragó and Salvador (2011) employ several multivariate GARCH models to show that this approach outperforms simpler models in portfolio hedging.Several studies focus on specific utility functions to analyze optimal behavior in the face of regime switching. For example, Graflund and Nilsson (2003) study the portfolio decision for typical Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) preferences in a regime switching model corresponding to a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Analyzing the optimal portfolios in four major economies, the US, the UK, Germany and Japan, they show that taking the different regimes into consideration substantially affects the portfolio decision. Zhang, Siu, and Meng (2010) solve the portfolio selection problem in a continuous-time Markovian regime-switching market. They obtain closed-form solutions for the optimal portfolio strategies in the cases of logarithmic utility and power utility. Tu (2010) analyzes the effects of regime-switching in a Bayesian setting with model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. He shows that the economic cost of ignoring regime switching can exceed 2 percentper year. Elliott and Sui (2010) also employ a continuous-time Markov chain whose states represent different market regimes to solve for the minimal risk portfolio. Bae, Kim, and Mulvey (2014) construct a stochastic program to optimize portfolios under the regime switching framework and use it to show that the regime information helps portfolios avoid risk during left-tail events. Fu, Wei, and Yang (2014) use dynamic programming approach to optimize a portfolio that also contains options.Zhou and Yin (2003a, 2003b) solve for the MV portfolio in a continuous-time framework where the market parameters depend on the market regime. They show that when interest rate is stochastic the optimal portfolio is substantially different from that in a single regime. Elliott, Siu, and Badescu (2010) solve for the mean-variance problem under a hidden regime-switching distribution while providing an algorithm for estimating the regimes’ parameters. Buckley, Saunders, and Seco (2008) extend the portfolio optimization problem to other objectives (e.g. target shortfall, expected exponential distribution) and show that optimization that takes the regime switching into consideration outperforms the simple mean-variance approach.The main contribution of the present paper to the existing literature is that it does not assume a specific utility function or objective function. Rather, it only makes the weak assumption of risk-aversion. Thus, it complements and extends previous studies by generalizing the results to a wide class of preferences.The market has two possible regimes, a and b, occurring with probabilities paand pb(pb= 1 − pa). In general, the probabilities paand pbare conditional on the information available at time t, i.e. we have pa(t) and pb(t). As the time index is not relevant for the analysis that follows, we suppress it in our notation. In both regimes the return distributions are normal, but with different parameters. Consistent with Ang and Bekaert (2002, 2004) and with the empirical evidence described in Section 4, we assume that the expected returns are the same across the two regimes, but that the variances and covariances are generally different.Given a certain portfolio with rate of return denoted by x, the return distribution is the weighted average of two normal densities with the same mean but different standard deviations. For example, see Fig. 1a, illustrating the case where the variance is different across the regimes but the expected return is not, and pa= pb= 1/2. Note that in this framework the mixed distribution f(x) = pafa(x) + pbfb(x) is no longer normal. As both fa(x) and fb(x) are symmetric around the same mean, so is f(x). The cumulative distribution F(x) is given by the weighted average of the cumulative distributions Fa(x) and Fb(x): F(x) = paFa(x) + pbFb(x), as shown in Fig. 1b.55The probability of drawing a return smaller than x is given by the probability of being in regime a times the probability of drawing a return smaller than x given regime a, paFa(x), plus the probability of being in regime b times the probability of drawing a return smaller than x given regime b, pbFb(x).As the return distributions are mixtures of normals, rather than normals, in a pair-wise comparison of two portfolios we cannot use the standard mean-variance analysis, and we must employ the more general stochasticdominance relations. Below we develop the SSD dominance criterion for the case of mixed-normal distributions. In Theorem 1, we first analyze the case where the two portfolios under consideration have the same mean return. Theorem 2 generalizes the result to the case where a risk-free asset exists and the two portfolios may have different means.Recall the Second degree Stochastic Dominance (SSD) rule:Let F and G be the cumulative return distributions of two investment prospects. F dominates G for all risk averters (i.e. for all non-decreasing and concave utility functions u, u’≥0, u”≤0) if and only if:(1)∫−∞x[G(t)−F(t)]dt≥0forallvaluesx(withatleastonestrictinequality).For proof and more detail, see Hadar and Russell (1969), Hanoch and Levy (1969), Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970), and Levy (2006). Graphically, this criterion is about the areas enclosed between F and G. If we label all the areas between the two cumulative functions where G > F as positive, and all the areas between the two cumulative functions where F > G as negative, the SSD criterion in Eq. (1) implies that the total area from −∞ up to any point x is non-negative. Appendix A provides a graphical example. Below we develop this general criterion for the case of mixed normal distributions.Consider two portfolios, x and y. Initially, we assume that the two portfolios have the same expected return E(x) = E(y) (this is later relaxed, when we add the riskless asset). We denote the standard deviation of x in regime a byσxaand in regime b byσxb.σyaandσybcorrespond to the standard deviations of y in the two regimes. Let us denote:σxmax=max{σxa,σxb}andσxmin=min{σxa,σxb}.Similarly:σymax=max{σya,σyb}andσymin=min{σya,σyb}.Denote the cumulative distributions corresponding to x and y by F and G, respectively. For x → −∞, F(x) is completely determined by the term corresponding to the regime with the higher σ, and the same is true for G.66The mixed-normal pdf f(x) is give by:f(x)=pa12πσa2e−(x−E(x))22σa2+pb12πσb2e−(x−E(x))22σb2. The ratio between these two terms is:paσbpbσae−(x−E(x))22(1σa2−1σb2). Note that if σa> σb, then as x → −∞ this ratio goes to ∞(regardless of the values of the p’s). Thus, in the far left tail only the term with the higher standard deviation matters.Thus, if x is to dominate y, we must haveσxmax≤σymax. Otherwise, ifσxmax>σymaxthis implies that F > G for x → −∞, and Eq. (1) does not hold.If we have bothσxa≤σyaandσxb≤σyb, then x trivially dominates y by SSD – the cumulative distributions cross only at the mean, F < G for any x < E(x), and there is symmetry around the mean, see Fig. 2. Thus, the interesting non-trivial case is the case where x has a lower volatility than y in one regime, but a higher volatility in the other regime.Theorem 1 states the necessary and sufficient conditions for the SSD dominance of one investment over the other in the mixed-normal framework when both investments have the same mean return. The theorem is based on the following two lemmas, proved in Appendix B:Lemma 1Consider a simple normal distribution f(x) (not a mixture of two normals) with mean E(x) and standard deviation σ. The area below the cumulative distribution F(x) to the left of the mean, denoted byArea(F)≡∫−∞E(x)F(x)dx, is given by:(2)Area(F)=cσwhere c is a constant (c ≈ 0.399). Thus, for all normal distributions, the area below the cumulative distribution between − ∞ and the mean is cσ.Let F and G denote the cumulative functions of two (non-identical) mixed-normal distributions:(3)F(x)=paFa(x)+pbFb(x),G(x)=paGa(x)+pbGb(x),where Fa, Fb, Ga, Gb are cumulative normal distributions with the same mean. Then F and G cross at most three times: once at the mean, and possibly also two more times, symmetrically around the mean.These two lemmas are employed in the theorem below:Theorem 1Let x and y be two investment prospects with mixed-normal return distributions F and G, respectively, with equal means, as described byEq. (3). Then, x dominates y by SSD if and only if: (i)σxmax≤σymaxand (ii)paσxa+pbσxb≤paσya+pbσyb.By Lemma 2, F and G cross at most once to the left of the mean. Thus, F dominates G by SSD if and only if F is below G for x → −∞, and the total area below F to the left of the mean is smaller than the corresponding area below G. In other words, if the distributions cross to the left of the mean, the “+” area is greater than the “−“ area, as shown in Fig. 3a (and unlike the situation shown in Fig. 3b). Note that the cumulative distributions are symmetric around the common mean. This allows us to focus only on the region to the left of the mean without loss of generality.As discussed above, F is below G for x → −∞ if and only ifσxmax≤σymax. This is the first condition for dominance.F is the mixed distribution: F(x) = paFa(x) + pbFb(x). Thus, the area below F,Area(F)≡∫−∞E(x)F(x)dx, is the weighted average of the two areas for Faand Fb, which are given by Lemma 1:Area(F)=pa∫−∞E(x)Fa(x)dx+pb∫−∞E(x)Fb(x)dx=c(paσxa+pbσxb).Similarly, the area below G is:Area(G)=pa∫−∞E(x)Ga(x)dx+pb∫−∞E(x)Gb(x)dx=c(paσya+pbσyb).Thus,Area(F)≤Area(G)⇔paσxa+pbσxb≤paσya+pbσyb.Hence, x dominates y for all risk averters if and only if the following two conditions hold:(i)σxmax≤σymax.paσxa+pbσxb≤paσya+pbσyb.Fig. 3a and b displays two situations, one where the above two conditions hold (with pa= pb= 1/2) and there is SSD dominance (Fig. 3a), and one where condition (ii) is violated, and there is no SSD dominance (Fig. 3b).Note that the above dominance condition is a generalization of the standard SSD criterion for the case of two normal distributions with the same mean. In the special case where the variances are equal across the two regimes(σxa=σxb,σya=σyb), the two conditions of Theorem 1 collapse to the single conditionσx≤σy, which is precisely the condition of SSD dominance for two normal distributions with the same mean.The above framework can be generalized to the case of more than two regimes. In the case of K regimes, the area below distribution F is:Area(F)=c(paσxa+pbσxb+⋯+pKσxK).Thus, the conditions of Theorem 1 generalize to:(i)σxmax≤σymax.paσxa+pbσxb+⋯+pKσxK≤paσya+pbσyb+⋯+pKσyK.Theorem 1 is very restrictive, because it only applies to the case where investments x and y have the same mean. However, with the introduction of a risk-free asset, the results can be generalized to the case of unequal means, as shown in the next section.Consider the case where there is a riskless asset yielding a rate of return rfand there are two portfolios, x and y, with possibly different means. Fig. 4shows the two portfolios in the mean-standard deviation plain. Portfolio x will be located at point xaif we are in regime a, and at point xbif we are in regime b. Similarly, Portfolio y will be located at point yaif we are in regime a, and at point ybif we are in regime b. As before, the mean return for each portfolio is constant across the two regimes, but now the means may be different across portfolios.When the risk-free asset exists, each of the portfolios can be “mixed” with this asset. In this context, portfolio x is said to dominate portfolio y if and only if for any mixture of y with rfthere exist a mixture of x with rfthat dominates it. If a proportion ω of the investor's wealth is invested in portfolio y, and a proportion (1 − ω) is invested in the risk-free asset, the “mixed” portfolio y* has a mean E(y*) = ωE(y) + (1 − ω)rf, a standard deviationσy*a=ωσyain regime a, and a standard deviationσy*b=ωσybin regime b . The theorem below provides the conditions of dominance of x over y when the means of the two portfolios are generally different and a riskless asset is available.Theorem 2(the SSDMN criterion)Let x and y be two investment prospects with mixed-normal return distributions F and G, respectively, with means that may generally be different. Investors can borrow and lend at the risk-free rate rf . Then, x dominates y for all risk averters if and only if:(i)E(x)−rfσxmax≥E(y)−rfσymax,andE(x)−rfpaσxa+pbσxb≥E(y)−rfpaσya+pbσyb.Let us first consider portfolio y*, which is the mixture of portfolio y and the riskless asset with the same mean return as that of portfolio x (see Fig. 4). Portfolio x dominates y if and only if it dominates y*: the dominance of x over y* will turn out below to be a condition on the slopes, so it holds for any level of expected return (thus, if x dominates y*, then for any combination of y and rfthere is a portfolio of x and rfwith the same mean that dominates it). On the other hand, if x does not dominate y*, this means that for any combination of x and rfthere are some risk averters that would prefer a combination of y and rfover it.As x and y* have the same mean, the conditions for x dominating y* are the conditions given by Theorem 1:(i)σxmax≤σy*maxandpaσxa+pbσxb≤paσy*a+pbσy*bNote that as y* is a scaled version of y that yields the same mean return as x, we have (from simple geometry):(4)σy*a=σyaE(x)−rfE(y)−rfandσy*b=σybE(x)−rfE(y)−rf.Thus, the conditionσxmax≤σy*maxtranslates toσxmax≤σymaxE(x)−rfE(y)−rfor:(5)E(x)−rfσxmax≥E(y)−rfσymax.i.e. the first condition is that the lower Sharpe ratio of x (among the two possible regimes) is larger than the lower Sharpe ratio of y.The second condition translates to:paσxa+pbσxb≤E(x)−rfE(y)−rf(paσya+pbσyb)or:(6)E(x)−rfpaσxa+pbσxb≥E(y)−rfpaσya+pbσyb.i.e. the Sharpe ratio when calculated with the weighted average standard deviation is higher for x than it is for y.Eqs. (5) and (6) are conditions for the dominance of x over y* for any risk-averter. Note that these conditions are expressed in terms of the original two portfolios, x and y. The exact same conditions hold for any other combination of y with the riskless asset. For example, consider the arbitrary combination y** shown in Fig. 4. This portfolio is dominated by portfolio x** if and only if the exact same conditions (5) and (6) hold. In other words, if conditions (5) and (6) hold, then for any combination of y with rf(such as y**) there exists a combination of x with rf(x**) that dominates it for all risk averters. In contrast, if (5) and (6) do not hold, for any combination of x with rf(such as x**), some risk averters prefer the combination of y with rfthat has the same mean (y**) over it.Note that the above SSDMN condition is a generalization of the SSD criterion for the case of two normal distributions. With normal distributions and a riskless asset the SSD criterion coincides with the ranking of investments by the well known Sharpe ratio. This is obtained here as a special case: if the variances are equal across the two regimes(σxa=σxb,σya=σyb), the two SSDMN conditions collapse to the single conditionE(x)−rfσx≥E(y)−rfσy– i.e. dominance by the Sharpe ratio.The mean-variance framework assumes normal distributions, and yields an efficient set of a single risky asset portfolio – the one with the highest Sharpe ratio. On the other extreme, the general stochasticdominance framework makes no assumptions about the distributions, and typically yields a much larger efficient set. The two-regime framework developed in this paper is a middle road between these two extremes: it makes an assumption about the distributions, but one that is weaker than the assumption of normality and encompasses it as a special case. How does this framework fare in terms of the size of the efficient set and in terms of the economic welfare relative to the two alternative frameworks? In order to address this question we perform the following empirical study.We should stress at the outset that our empirical analysis is illustrative – we are interested in the general properties of the SSDMN efficient set relative to the standard SD efficient sets, rather than in the identification of specific efficient assets. As a test of robustness we perform the empirical analysis with different sample periods, different asset sets, and different methodologies for identifying the regimes. We report detailed results for the set of all mutual funds with complete return records for the 1975–2000 period and the Ang–Bekaert regime identification methodology. We obtain similar results (reported only in brief) for the 1990–2009 period, the set of 100 Fama-French portfolios, and regime identification by the VIX index.In the two-regime framework one must first identify the two regimes, and then estimate the return parameters for these regimes. In identifying the two regimes, we first follow Ang and Bekaert (2004). They apply maximum likelihood techniques to identify and characterize the two regimes with a sample of monthly returns for the period of February 1975–December 2000. We follow their division of the sample period into the two sub-samples of low-volatility and high-volatility.77Ang and Bekaert (2004) report the ex-anteand ex-post(or smoothed) probability of being in the low-variance regime as a function of time. Following their analysis, we take the periods in which the smoothed probability of being in the low-volatility regime exceeded 50 percent as periods of the low-probability regime, and periods when this probability was below 50 percent as periods of the high-volatility regime.Overall, the sample period consists of 323 months. Of these, 140 months are in the high-volatility regime, and 183 months are in the low-volatility regime.To illustrate the relative properties of the various efficient sets, we take the entire set of mutual funds with complete monthly return records for the relevant 1975–2000 period available on the Center of Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database. There are 311 such funds. For each fund we calculate the average return and standard deviation in the high-volatility regime, and the average return and standard deviation in the low volatility regime. For 301 of the 311 funds (96.8 percentof the funds) the standard deviation in the high-volatility regime is significantly higher than the standard deviation in the low-volatility regime at the 5 percentsignificance level. For 287 of the 311 funds (92.3 percent) the standard deviation in the high-volatility regime is also significantly higher than the standard deviation in the low-volatility regime at the 1 percentsignificance level (these are obtained by conducting an F test for the ratio of the variances in the two regimes). This implies that the Ang and Bekaert procedure does indeed identify well the two different regimes their classification holds not only for their index data, but also for almost all individual funds as well. We also calculate the funds’ average returns in each one of the two regimes. Using the unequal-variance t-test (see Moser & Stevens 1992; Ruxton 2006) we test whether the means are significantly different across the regimes. For 294 of the funds (94.5 percent) the difference in the average return across the two regimes is not significant at the 5 percentlevel. This is consistent with the conclusions of Ang and Bekaert – while the difference in volatilities is large and significant across the two regimes, the differences in the average returns are typically not statistically significant.We next test the mixed-normality assumption by employing the Anderson–Darling test for normality (see, Anderson & Darling, 1952). For a preliminary indication regarding the normality of the market return distribution we first employ the test on the NYSE Value-Weighted Composite Index. The null hypothesis that the data is sampled from the normal distribution is rejected with a P value of 0.011. In contrast, with the index data corresponding only to the high-volatility regime the null hypothesis cannot be rejected (P value of 0.734). Normality also cannot be rejected in the low-volatility regime (P value of 0.096).We conduct the same analysis for the 311 funds examined in this paper. The null hypothesis of normality for the whole period is rejected at a significant level of 5 percent for 264 funds (84.9 percent). In contrast, with the data corresponding to the high-volatility and the low-volatility regimes the null hypothesis cannot be rejected for 236 funds (75.9 percent) and 173 funds (55.6 percent), respectively. Thus, while normality is rejected for the entire period, it is generally not rejected for each of the two regimes separately. Moreover, while the standard deviation is significantly higher in the high-volatility regime than in the low-volatility regime for about 97 percentof the funds, the differences in the means are generally not statistically significant. These findings are consistent with the assumptions made in the preceding analysis.In order to study the typical relative sizes of the different efficient sets, we would like to examine these sets for a large number of cases. To this end we perform the following analysis. We randomly draw a subset of 100 funds out of the total set of 311 funds. We then calculate the SSD, SSDR88The Second degree Stochastic Dominance rule with a Riskless Asset (SSDR) relates to SSD relations in the presence of the riskless asset. Namely, for two cumulative distributions F and G, a dominance of F over G by SSDR implies that for any portfolio composed of G and the riskless asset, there is a portfolio composed of F and the riskless asset, which dominates it by SSD. For the SSDR rule and more detail, see Levy (2006).and SSDMN efficient sets for this particular 100-fund subset. For the procedures for obtaining the SSD and SSDR efficient sets we follow Levy (2006). The risk-free rate is taken as the average 30-day T-Bill rate during the sample period, which is 0.54 percent. As with the other SD rules, the SSDMN efficient set is also obtained by a pair-wise comparison of each fund with all other funds. As in the regular SD procedure, a fund is in the efficient set if it is not SSDMN dominated by any of the other funds. We repeat this procedure of obtaining the efficient sets 1000 times, each time with a different random draw of 100 funds.The SSD efficient set contains on average 23.53 funds. The SSDR efficient set (which is by construction always a subset of the SSD efficient set) contains an average of 4.87 funds. The SSDMN efficient set contains an average of only 1.33 funds. Thus, the SSDMN criterion provides a further significant reduction of the efficient set relative to the SSDR efficient set. It is interesting to note that while the SSDMN efficient set is theoretically not always necessarily a subset of the SSDR efficient set, in practice, in our sample we find that this is always the case: all the funds in the SSDMN efficient set are also in the corresponding SSDR efficient set. Thus, the mixed-normal assumption significantly reduces the efficient set relative to the general SSD and SSDR criteria that take the discrete empirical return distribution as the true distribution. The smaller efficient set constitutes a great advantage – the "menu" of relevant funds from which investors should choose is narrowed down.We obtain similar results when we employ the 1990–2009 sample period, the 100 Fama-French portfolios sorted on size and book-to-market, and the identification of regimes by the VIX index.99The VIX index, well known as the “Fear Index”, serves as the market estimate for the next month's volatility as derived from option prices on the S&P 500 Index (see, for example, Baker & Wurgler 2007; Whaley, 2000). We divide the sample period into two sub-samples: one with low VIX and the other with high VIX, and we search for the cut-off value of the VIX which maximizes either the likelihood that the two regimes are normally distributed (assuming either equal or unequal means) or the probability that the variances in the two regimes are statistically different. The logarithmic likelihood function in case of two normal distributions is as follows:Λ=ln(L)=−Na+Nb2ln(2π)−Naln(σ^a)−Naln(σ^b)−12∑i=1Na(xi−μ^aσa^)Λ=ln(L)=−12∑i=1Nb(xi−μ^bσb^),where Naand Nbare the number of observations, andμ^a,μ^b,σ^aandσ^bare the estimated mean and standard deviation corresponding to the two groups, respectively. We conduct the test once when assuming different means and once when assuming equal means (i.e.μ^a=μ^b=μ^). All three tests yield the same VIX cut-of number of 17.9 percent.We randomly draw a subset of 50 portfolios and calculate the SSD, SSDR, and SSDMN efficient sets. We repeat this 1000 times, and report the average efficient set sizes across these 1000 subsets. The SSD efficient set contains on average 11.2 portfolios (22 percentof the portfolios in the subsample). The SSDR efficient set contains 1.48 portfolios on average (3 percent), and the SSDMN efficient set contains on average 1.10 portfolios (2 percentof the subsample). Thus, again, the SSDMN efficient set is smaller on average than the SSD and SSDR efficient sets.One could, of course, further narrow the efficient set to a single fund by neglecting regimes and assuming normality. In this case the efficient set contains only one fund – the one with the highest Sharpe ratio. While assuming normality produces the smallest efficient set, it comes at the price of ignoring the regimes, i.e. assuming normality when the actual distributions are better described by mixtures of normals. In order to estimate the utility cost of making this assumption, in the next section we conduct a direct expected utility analysis.There are two potential costs of ignoring the regimes and assuming normality when the actual distributions are in fact mixed normal. The first cost is the cost that may occur when the fund with the highest Sharpe ratio is not the fund that maximizes the investor's expected utility (due to the fact that in the two-regime case the distribution is not normal). Rather, one of the other funds in the SSDMN efficient set yields higher expected utility. We denote this cost as the “Wrong Fund Cost”. The second potential cost is the cost of assuming the wrong distribution in the asset allocation decision. Suppose that the investor actually does prefer the fund with the highest Sharpe ratio. Still, assuming normality may lead to sub-optimal asset allocation between the fund and the riskless asset if the distributions are in fact mixed normal. We call this second cost the "wrongdistributioncost". Below we separately analyze these two costs. Of course, in practice the cost will be a combination of both the wrong fund cost and the wrong distribution cost.When we conduct the efficient set analysis described in Section 4, for each of the 100-fund subsets we also record the fund with the highest Sharpe ratio. In all of the cases we examined, we found that this fund is in the SSDMN efficient set (even though theoretically this need not be the case). Hence, in the cases where the SSDMN efficient set contains only one fund, this was always the fund with the highest Sharpe ratio. In these cases the SSDMN analysis and the MV analysis yield the same fund, and there is no wrong-fund-cost (only possible the wrong-distribution-cost, to be analyzed in the next subsection). In the cases where the SSDMN efficient set contains two or more funds, it may be possible that for a particular risk averter the fund with the highest Sharpe ratio does not yield the highest expected utility. Thus, following the MV analysis and choosing the fund with the highest Sharpe ratio leads to a utility loss. In these cases we estimate the utility loss by first calculating the optimal asset allocation between the fund and the risk-free asset, and finding the certainty equivalent of this optimal allocation. We do this both for the fund with the highest Sharpe ratio and for the other fund(s) in the SSDMN efficient set. We report the annualized percentage difference in the certainty equivalents.To illustrate, let us examine one case in detail. For example, in one of the random draws of 100 funds the SSDMN efficient set contains two funds: fund A, which is the one with the highest Sharpe ratio, and fund B. The average monthly return of fund A is 1.42 percent, its standard deviation in the high-volatility regime is 4.95 percent, and its standard deviation in the low-volatility regime is 3.15 percent. The corresponding numbers for fund B are 1.61 percent, 5.96 percent, and 3.98 percent, respectively. Consider the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) preference Wγ/γ with γ = 0.2. For this preference, the expected utility obtained from a $1 investment in fund A is 5.0134.1010This expected utility value is calculated by drawing 100,000 returns from a mixed normal distribution with the parameters of fund A, and calculating the expected utility for the optimal asset allocation between fund A and the risk-free asset. Note that while theoretically the mixed normal return distribution may yield negative wealth values, this is aσxaevent that never occurred in our numerical simulation. Strictly speaking, for CRRA preferences one should assume a truncated mixed-normal distribution.This expected utility value is equivalent to that obtained by a certain rate of return of 1.34 percent.11115.0134=x0.20.2⇒x=1.0134Thus, fund A is equivalent to a certain monthly return of 1.34 percent(and for CRRA preferences this holds regardless of the size of the initial investment). Similarly, fund B is found to be equivalent to a certain monthly return of 1.50 percent. Hence, fund B is preferred to A for this preference, even though fund A has a higher Sharpe ratio. Translating these certainty equivalents to annual terms yields an annual certainty equivalent difference of 2.22 percent.12121.015012 − 1.013412 = 0.0222.We repeat this analysis for many random draws of 100 funds, and record the cost for various utility functions. The statistics on the wrong-fund costs are given in Table 1. The fund with the highest Sharpe ratio is inferior in about one quarter of the times, and the average associated utility cost is about 2.5 percentannually – quite a substantial amount! In the worst-case scenarios this loss can even exceed 10 percent. These results are consistent with the findings of Tu (2010).It is important to note that in this analysis, when finding the optimal asset allocation we are assuming that the distributions are mixed-normal for both funds. Thus, even in the case where the investor wrongly chooses the fund with the highest Sharpe ratio, he employs the correct mixed-normal distribution in his asset allocation, i.e. we are focusing only on the wrong-fund-cost, and do not include the wrong-distribution-cost. This second type of cost is discussed below.Even in the cases where the fund with highest Sharpe ratio is the one which yields the highest expected utility, assuming the wrong distribution of returns leads to a suboptimal asset allocation between the fund and the risk-free asset, and hence to a utility loss. In order to estimate the magnitude of this effect, we assume that the selected fund is the one with the highest Sharpe ratio, but that the asset allocation is conducted with the assumption of a normal (rather than mixed-normal) return distribution. Given this (suboptimal) asset allocation we then calculate the expected utility assuming that the true distribution is the mixed-normal return distribution with the empirically estimated parameters. We compare this expected utility with the expected utility obtained when the asset allocation is conducted with the (assumed to be true) assumption of a mixed-normal return distribution. Table 2reports the statistics on the annualized certainty equivalent difference, and the difference in the asset allocations under the two assumptions regarding the return distribution. We find that under typical values of the relative risk aversion parameter the asset allocation and expected utility are almost identical under both assumptions. The expected utility difference increases with the risk aversion parameter, but it remains very small even for very high values of risk aversion. Thus, we conclude that the wrong-distribution-cost is negligible relative to the wrong-fund-cost arising from investing in the wrong fund.Empirical evidence suggests that the market oscillates between a high-volatility regime and a low-volatility regime. While the return distributions are generally consistent with normal distributions in each one of these two regimes, the overall distribution is not normal – it is a mixture of normals. In this framework the mean-variance analysis is inappropriate, and one should employ the more general Second degree Stochastic Dominance (SSD) criterion. This paper develops the SSD criterion for the case of mixed-normal distributions. This criterion, called the SSDMN rule, is shown to be a generalization of the standard mean-variance rule, which is obtained as a special case when the volatility is the same across the two regimes.The mixed normal framework can be viewed as a middle road between two extremes: on the one hand the mean-variance approach that makes the strong (and empirically problematic) assumption of normality and yields a single efficient portfolio, and on the other hand the general SD approach that makes no assumptions on the return distributions, but yields much larger efficient sets. The two-regime framework we employ assumes mixed-normal distributions, which are consistent with the empirical evidence. This framework yields efficient sets that are typically much smaller than the SSD and SSDR efficient sets, which constitutes an important improvement, as it shrinks the menu of relevant alternatives one has to consider. We show that assuming normality and ignoring regimes, as in the mean-variance framework, can lead to a substantial welfare loss, typically on the order of 2–3 percenton an annual basis.It is interesting to contrast this result with Levy and Markowitz (1979) who conclude that assuming normality does not yield a significant welfare loss if returns are “not extreme”, typically bounded in the range −30 percent-+ 30 percent. In their own words:“the empirical results reported below would be less favorable to mean-variance approximations if we were dealing with much more speculative distributions.”(p. 312. See also Markowitz, 1991, 2014)How can these results be reconciled? There is a key difference between Levy and Markowitz's (1979) analysis and the present study. Levy and Markowitz assume that the true return distribution is the discrete empirical distribution (i.e. each one of the last T historical returns has a probability of 1/T to occur). Thus, the most extreme return possible is the most extreme return observed in the sample. In contrast, we assume that the true distribution is a mixed-normal distribution with the empirically estimated parameters. Thus, in our framework returns that are much more extreme (or “more speculative”) than those observed in the sample are possible, and this explains the significant welfare loss caused by assuming normality.Finally, this paper presents the most simple two-regime model possible. Estimation error problems may, of course, complicate the analysis. Furthermore, in our empirical analysis we assume no predictive power about next period's regime realization. The SSDMN criterion is perfectly consistent with predictive ability (as analyzed in Ang and Bekaert, 2004) – the regime probabilities may be conditional and time-dependent. Predictability may further enhance the value of taking regimes into consideration.
