@&#MAIN-TITLE@&#
Design and implementation of a realtime co-processor for denoising Fiber Optic Gyroscope signal

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
Algorithm for denoising of Fiber Optics Gyroscope sensor signal is proposed.Hardware architecture of the algorithm is developed.The resource utilization of the proposed algorithm is compared with DWT and Kalman filter.Co-processor of the proposed algorithm is developed.An acceleration of 65× over software implementation is obtained using the developed co-processor.
