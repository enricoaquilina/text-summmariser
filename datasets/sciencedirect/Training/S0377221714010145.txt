@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we address the issue of optimal selection of portfolio of projects using reinvestment strategy within a flexible time horizon. We assume that an investor intends to invest his/her initial capital on the implementation of some projects in a flexible time horizon. The investor’s motivation for considering a flexible time horizon is to maximize his/her gain by determining the optimal time horizon for investing on the selected portfolio of projects. Projects have different durations and their potential rates of return are also different. The profit yielded by the completed projects can be reinvested in the implementation of other projects. The implementation costs of projects can be allocated at equally spaced intervals with equal amounts during their life cycles or can be assigned to each project according to its estimated s-curve. We assume that the profit yielded by each project is accrued after the investment for the project ends. Therefore, in order to maximize gains, the investor needs to optimize three issues: combination of projects, schedule of the selected projects and the time horizon. An integer program is presented and discussed to address the given issues.Project portfolio selection problem (PPSP) is one of the most critical problems in the fields of project management, financial management, risk management and investment that has been the topic discussed by many researchers for more than 60 years (see Elton, Gruber, Brown, and Goetzmann, 2009; Hill, 2010; Hult, Lindskog, Hammarlid, and Rehn, 2012).PPSP can be defined as follows. A number of projects are available for investment. These projects are to be implemented in a given time horizon. Although these projects are performed with the same priority, they have different durations. Implementation of each project requires a predefined volume of investment that should be available at the commencement of each project. The capital required to cover the implementation costs of each project can be allocated at equally spaced intervals during its life cycle, or can be assigned to each project according to its s-curve (graphic display of cumulative costs, labor hours, percentage of work, or other quantities, plotted against time (PMBOK, 2004)). The amount of money, returned by each completed project, can be reinvested in the implementation of other projects. Each project can commence at any moment within the time horizon provided adequate investment is available. In PPSP by considering the limitation of the initial capital, the objective is to select a combination of projects to maximize the investor’s gains.Markowitz (1952) introduced the portfolio selection problem. Later on, Markowitz (2009), Miller (2002) and Sharpe (2012) advanced the idea of the portfolio selection problem.Different versions of PPSP have been studied in the literature. For instance, selection of project portfolios is considered in a stochastic, deterministic, and static or dynamic environments with various combinations of problem parameters such as prioritization of the projects, the dependencies between two or more projects (see e.g. Zuluaga, Sefair, and Medaglia, 2007; Janssen, Manca, and Volpe, 2009; Gregory, Darby-Dowman, and Mitra, 2011; Petit, 2012; Shen, Zhang, and Siu, 2014; Lim and Wimonkittiwat, 2014).Baker (1974), Danila (1989), and Shpak and Zaporojan (1996) studied some of the project selection methodologies and discussed several multi-criteria aspects of the PPSP. In addition, Mehrez and Sinuany-Stern (1983) formulated the PPSP as a multi-criteria decision making problem in which their approach is based on the search of utility functions.Petersen, Lockett, and Stratford (1967), Lockett and Stratford (1987), and Regan and Holtzman (1995) studied several 0–1 mathematical programming models which take into account the hierarchical decisions and the fund allocation problem between independent projects. Ghasemzadeh, Archer, Wang, and Iyogun (1999) presented a linear 0–1 programming model for the selection and scheduling of projects, which includes technical interdependency. Sefair and Medaglia (2005) and Medaglia, Graves, and Ringuest (2007) also presented some features of technical interdependence in linear project selection and scheduling models. The linear programming solvability is very important for applications to real-life problems. Mansini, Ogryczak, and Speranza (2014) introduced and surveyed the variety of linear programming solvable portfolio optimization models.Several researches for PPSP use fuzzy logic. For instance, Liu (2011) discussed the fuzzy portfolio optimization problem where the asset returns are represented by fuzzy data. He formulated a pair of two-level mathematical programs to calculate the upper bound and the lower bound of the return of the portfolio optimization problem. In addition, Bhattacharyya, Kumar, and Kar (2011) presented a fuzzy multi-objective programming approach to facilitate decision making in the selection of research & development (R&D) projects. They presented a fuzzy tri-objective R&D portfolio selection problem which maximizes the outcome and minimizes the cost and risk involved in the problem. They discussed how their methodology can be used to make decision support tools for optimal R&D project selection in a corporate environment.Belenky (2012) presented a 0–1 model for the PPSP in which a reinvestment strategy is implemented. There is a flaw in Belenky’s model that relates to the third statement of his model’s objective function in which the return from the selected projects is calculated incorrectly. An example is given in Appendix B which demonstrates this flaw.In all researches on PPSP time horizon is fixed. In this study, we consider a new strategy, namely flexible time horizon which creates a new perspective on the selection of the optimal portfolio of projects. Within this strategy, in one hand, more profitable projects find the opportunity to be added to the portfolio and thence increase the investor’s gain, and on the other hand, earlier completion of the selected projects would release the investor’s capital sooner. As such, the investor’s capital can be invested elsewhere to add to his/her gain even more.In this paper, we present an integer program based on the corrected Belenky’s model. In addition, we consider the reinvestment strategy within a flexible time horizon.It is assumed that at time instant k = 1 of the time horizon, there is no project in progress. Furthermore, we assume that projects are independent and their associated importance are equal. Therefore, the projects can be performed in any order. The objective of the problem is three fold: (i) determining the optimal portfolio; (ii) determining the optimal schedule for the selected projects; and (iii) determining the optimal time horizon.Suppose that the time horizon can be varied in the[T+λmin,T+λmax]∩Zwhere λmin  and λmax  are given as the lower and upper bounds of the time horizon tolerance, respectively. We formulate the problem as an integer program, based on Belenky’s notations (Belenky, 2012). We consider the following notations and assumptions:–the profit yielded by each project is accrued one period after the investment on the project is completed,no preemption of projects is allowed.–m: the number of projects,Nm= {1, …, m},NT+λmax={1,…,T+λmax},ωi: the number of consecutive time segments required for completing the investment in project i, i ∈ Nm, and ωi≥ 1,P: the initial capital,cji(h): the investment required at time instant h to implement project i that commences at time instant j, wherei∈Nm,j∈NT+λmaxand h ∈ {j, …, min (j + ωi, T + λmax)},dji(h): the amount returned at time instant h by project i that commences at time instant j, wherei∈Nm,j∈NT+λmaxand h ∈ {j + ωi+ 1, …, T + λmax}. Also, for h ∈ {1, …, j + ωi} we havedji(h)=0,αj={theamountoflossattimeinstantj,j>Ttheamountofgainattimeinstantj,j<Twhere j ∈ {T + λmin , …, T + λmax }. Here, the loss is due to the amount of extra time that the investor’s capital is engaged (αj≤ 0, j ∈ {T + 1, …, T + λmax }) and the gain is due to the shorter time that the investor’s capital is released (αj≥ 0, j ∈ {T + λmin , …, T − 1}).–xji={1ifprojecticommencesattimeinstantj0otherwisewherei∈Nm,j∈NT+λmax,λ+: the number of consecutive time units that the selected projects will be completed beyond the given time horizon,λ−: the number of consecutive time unit that the selected projects will be completed earlier than the given time horizon,yj, j ∈ {T + λmin , …, T + λmax }, for λ+ > 0 and λ− = 0 are defined as follows:yj={1j=T+1,…,T+λ+0otherwisealso, for λ− > 0 and λ+ = 0, yjis defined as follows:yj={1j=T−λ−,…,T−10otherwiseSuppose that λ* = λ+* − λ−*, where λ+* and λ−* are optimal values of λ+ and λ−, respectively. By changing the time period from [1, T] to [1, T + λ*], all feasible sets of projects and their schedules satisfy the system of constraints (2)–(20).(i)Since no project generates profit at time instant k = 1, all the projects that start at k = 1 can be financed only from the initial capital, so the inequality (2) holds.At any time instant k ∈ {2, …, T + λmax }, the required investment in all the selected projects cannot exceed the sum of the remaining part of the initial capital and the profit returned by all the selected projects up to this moment, so (15) and the inequalities (4) where–∑i=1m∑j=1kcji(k)xjiis the total investment needed at time instant k for the time segment [k, k + 1] to execute all the projects that commenced before or at time instant k,∑i=1m∑j=1k−1∑h=1k−1dji(h)xjiis the total capital that will be returned up to time instant k − 1 by all the selected projects that have commenced prior to time instant k,∑i=1m∑j=1k−1∑h=1k−1cji(h)xjiis the total investment that will be spent up to time instant k − 1 for implementing all the selected projects that commenced prior to time instant k.hold.Any project must commence only once within the time segment [1, T + λmax ], so the inequalities (3) hold.It is assumed that each of the m projects can commence at any time instant j within the time horizon,j∈NT+λmax,so project i will be completed at time instant j + ωi+ 1. As such, project i is finished by T + λ+ − λ− and therefore inequalities (5) hold.According to the objective function (1) and the definition of αj, (6), (7), (14), (17) and (19) ensure that loss will be considered. Moreover, (8), (9), (14), (18) and (20) ensure that gain will be considered.Inequalities (10), (11), (12) and (16) ensure that λ+λ− = 0 (i.e. λ+ and λ− together are not greater than zero). Therefore, loss and gain together are not considered.Inequality (13) ensures that λmin  and λmax  are the lower bound and the upper bound of the time horizon tolerance, respectively.Note that λmax  is obtained based on the assumption that all the projects are selected in the portfolio and performed sequentially. In addition λmin  is obtained based on the shortest duration of the projects. Therefore, we suggest λmin  and λmax  as follows:(21)λmin=min{min{1+ωi+1|i∈Nm}−T,0}(22)λmax=max{1+∑i=1m(1+ωi)−T,0}In order to illustrate the performance of the proposed model and demonstrate its effectiveness, we consider an example.ExampleSuppose m = 4, T = 5, P = 2000, ω1 = 2, ω2 = 1, ω3 = 5, ω4 = 3. The values ofdji(h),cji(h),i ∈ {1, …, 4}, j ∈ {1, …, 5}, h ∈ {1, …, 5} are given in Table A.1(Appendix A). Fig. 1shows the optimal schedule and the combination of projects to maximize their return, where first, second and fourth projects commence at time instant j = 1. Note that the third project is not selected (the third project cannot be completed within the given time horizon, i.e. [1, 5]). Now suppose that the time horizon, T, is flexible. In Fig. 2the implementation costs and the returns for each project at different time instants during the flexible time horizon is shown. According to (21) and (22), λmin  = −2,  λmax  = 11. Therefore, αj(for the definition of αjsee Section 2.2) is considered as Table A.2(Appendix A). Solving the model by BONMIN solver of GAMS software, we getx11=1,x52=1,x13=1,x24=1,λ*=2,λ+*=2,λ−*=0. The corresponding value of the objective function is 3695. It is clear that the optimal time horizon is T* = 7. Fig. 2 shows the optimal schedule of the selected projects where projects commence as follows: first and third projects at j = 1, second project at j = 5 and fourth project at j = 2. Because the selected projects are completed later than the given time horizon T = 5, loss is considered. The amount of loss is α6 + α7 = −75 − 80 = −155. Notice that by considering flexible time horizon, third project is added to the portfolio and the total profit has increased by 445.Now suppose T = 12. According to (21) and (22), λmin  = −9,  λmax  = 4. Therefore, αjis considered as Table A.2. Solving the model by BONMIN solver of GAMS software, we getx41=1,x12=1,x13=1,x14=1,λ*=−5,λ+*=0,λ−*=5. The corresponding value of the objective function is 4392. Fig. 3shows the optimal schedule of the selected projects where projects commence as follows: first project at j = 4 and second, third and fourth projects at j = 1. Because the selected projects are completed earlier than the given time horizon T = 12, gain is considered. The amount of gain is α7 + α8 + α9 + α10 + α11 = 542.For further analysis of the proposed model we use a more extensive dataset. Due to the unavailability of real datasets, the values ofωi,dji(h)andcji(h),i ∈ {1, …, m}, j ∈ {1, …, T + λmax }, h ∈ {1, …, T + λmax } are generated randomly using discrete uniform distribution. In addition, the values of αj, j ∈ {T + λmin , …, T + λmax } are generated randomly.11All datasets are available at http://profs.hsu.ac.ir/jafarzadeh/files/2014/06/Data-sets.rar.Suppose that P = 1000. Table 1shows the optimal value of the objective function for various values of m and T under fixed and flexible time horizons. As it can be seen, the objective function values are always higher under flexible time horizon when compared to fixed time horizon. For instance, when there are 40 projects and the time horizon is fixed at 15, the objective function value is 10 170. However, when the same instance is solved using a flexible time horizon, the objective function value increases to 14 284, an increase of 140.45 percent.Now suppose that we use our proposed model with λmin  = λmax  = 0 (i.e. corrected Belenky’s model) iteratively to determine the optimal value of the time horizon and thence the optimal value of the model’s objective function. To do so, the model (1–20 with λmin  = λmax  = 0) is solved for different values of the time horizon within the time interval [1, T + λ] where λ ∈ {λmin , …, λmax } (Note that λmin  and λmax  are easily calculated by (21) and (22).). The advantage of using the model (1–20) to obtain the optimal value of the time horizon is shown in Table 2. To explain, consider the instance with 50 projects. The model determines the optimal time horizon (57) in 28.32 CPU time. However, when the time horizon is determined iteratively by using the model with λmin  = λmax  = 0, the CPU time increases to 1808.44, an increase of nearly 64 times.In all research on the portfolio selection problem up till now, the time horizon has always been considered as a fixed value. In this paper, we considered a new strategy, namely flexible time horizon which creates a new perspective on the selection of the optimal portfolio of projects. Under this strategy, the investors may add more projects to the portfolio and therefore, increase their total profits. An integer program was presented and discussed to address specifically three issues, namely the optimal combination of projects, the optimal schedule of the selected projects and finally the optimal time horizon.There are still many aspects of this topic worth exploring in the future; such as: supplying part of the required investment through bank loans, interdependencies among projects, project preemption, and so on. We hope that the study presented here can inspire others to pursue further research in this area.Belenky (2012) considered the amount of money that will be available at time instant T as follows:(B.1)P+∑i=1m∑j=1T−ωi−1dji(T)xji+∑k=2T∑i=1m∑j=1k−1∑h=1k−1δji(h)xjiWe correct the Belenky’s objective function (B.1) as follows:(B.2)P+∑i=1m∑j=1T−ωi−1dji(T)xji+∑i=1m∑j=1T−1∑h=1T−1δji(h)xjiThe following example illustrates the flaw of Belenky’s objective function.ExampleSuppose that we have only one project (i.e. m = 1) and T = 4, P = 1000, ω1 = 1. Assume that the values ofcj1(h),dj1(h)andδj1(h)are as given in Table B.1. The objective function (B.1) for this example is:(B.3)P+∑i=11∑j=14−ωi−1dji(4)xji+∑k=24∑i=11∑j=1k−1∑h=1k−1δji(h)xji=P+(d11(4)x11+d21(4)x21)+δ11(1)x11+δ11(1)x11+δ11(2)x11+δ21(1)x21+δ21(2)x21+δ11(1)x11+δ11(2)x11+δ11(3)x11+δ21(1)x21+δ21(2)x21+δ21(3)x21+δ31(1)x31+δ31(2)x31+δ31(3)x31=P+δ11(1)x11+(δ11(1)+δ11(2))x11+(δ21(1)+δ21(2))x21+(δ11(1)+δ11(2)+δ11(3)+d11(4))x11+(δ21(1)+δ21(2)+δ21(3)+d21(4))x21+(δ31(1)+δ31(2)+δ31(3))x31By substituting the coefficients in Eq. (B.3), we get:(B.4)P+∑i=11∑j=14−ωi−1dji(4)xji+∑k=24∑i=11∑j=1k−1∑h=1k−1δji(h)xji=1000−200x11+(−200−200)x11+(0−200)x21+(−200−200+250+250)x11+(0−200−200+500)x21+(0+0−200)x31=1000−500x11−100x21−200x31According to the above calculations, one can observe that if the project commences at j = 1 (i.e.x11=1,x21=0,x31=0), the project’s implementation cost is accounted for more than once, whereas the returns from the project is considered only once. Therefore, the profit calculated by Eq. (B.4) is less than the actual profit. It is clear that the maximum value of the objective function in (B.4) is obtained forx11=0,x21=0,x31=0. The corresponding value of the objective function is 1000 (i.e. the profit is equal zero). By substituting the coefficients and the values of T and ω1 in Eq. (B.2), we get:(B.5)P+∑i=11∑j=14−ωi−1dji(4)xji+∑i=11∑j=13∑h=13δji(h)xji=1000+100x11+100x21−200x31The maximum value of the objective function in (B.5) is obtained forx11=1,x21=0,x31=0orx11=0,x21=1,x31=0. The corresponding value of the objective function is 1100 (i.e. the profit, yielded by project, is 100).
