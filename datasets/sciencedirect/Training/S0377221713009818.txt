@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Variational inequality theory facilitates the formulation of equilibrium problems in economic networks. Examples of successful applications include models of supply chains, financial networks, transportation networks, and electricity networks. Previous economic network equilibrium models that were formulated as variational inequalities only included linear constraints; in this case the equivalence between equilibrium problems and variational inequality problems is achieved with a standard procedure because of the linearity of the constraints. However, in reality, often nonlinear constraints can be observed in the context of economic networks. In this paper, we first highlight with an application from the context of reverse logistics why the introduction of nonlinear constraints is beneficial. We then show mathematical conditions, including a constraint qualification and convexity of the feasible set, which allow us to characterize the economic problem by using a variational inequality formulation. Then, we provide numerical examples that highlight the applicability of the model to real-world problems. The numerical examples provide specific insights related to the role of collection targets in achieving sustainability goals.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The variational inequality (VI) theory started with Fichera (1963) who studied the Signorini problem and with Stampacchia (1964) who applied such a theory to partial differential equations with unilateral constraints (see, for instance, Kinderlehrer & Stampacchia, 1980). For further information see also Ambrosio, Caffarelli, and Maugeri (2011), Facchinei and Pang (2003), Lions and Stampacchia (1967) and Stampacchia (1969). Variational inequality problems have been later developed to study the equilibrium behavior of decision makers in multi-tiered forward (Nagurney, 1999), reverse (Nagurney & Toyasaki, 2005), closed-loop supply chains (Hammond & Beullens, 2007; Qiang, Ke, Anderson, & Dong, 2013), financial networks (Daniele, 2006; Nagurney, 2003; Nagurney & Siokos, 1997), transportation networks (Daniele, Maugeri, & Oettli, 1998, 1999; Daniele, 2006; Nagurney, 2000), spatially distributed market networks (Daniele, 2006; Nagurney, 1993), electricity networks (Matsypura, Nagurney, & Liu, 2007; Nagurney, Liu, Cojocaru, & Daniele, 2007), the Internet (Nagurney, Parkes, & Daniele, 2007), and food supply chains (Yu & Nagurney, 2013). The models highlight how the interactions of diverse decision-makers result in equilibrium product flows and prices.In this paper, we apply variational inequality theory to study key issues in sustainable supply chain management. One key issue is product design for the environment. Measurers, such as limiting precious and hazardous contents, product dematerialization, increasing the amount of recyclable materials, and increasing the use of recycled materials, improve the ecological effects of products and reduce the dependency on virgin material availability and prices. This topic is especially important for electrical and electronic equipment waste (WEEE), which is the fastest growing waste stream. The main WEEE categories are large household appliances (e.g., washing machines and driers), cooling and freezing appliances, small household appliances (e.g., vacuum cleaners and telephones), CRT devices (e.g., TV sets and monitors), and lighting equipment (Savage, 2006). Governments worldwide are recognizing the importance of recovery operations for WEEE due to the product category’s high risks of hazardous material contamination as well as the potential economic value of the precious materials included. Legislation or regulations for reducing WEEE are being implemented in many countries, including the 27 Member States of the European Union (WEEE Directive 2002/96/EC), Japan, 25 states in the United States (Electronic Takeback Coalition, 2013]), Canada, and China. For example, the EU Directive 2002/96/EC on WEEE, together with Directive 2002/95/EC, hold producers and importers responsible for taking back and recycling end-of-life products and set mandatory target rates for the recycling and recovery of WEEE.Pressures of establishing sustainable supply chains come not only from environmental regulations, but also from a tight supply of materials. Due to tightened export controls for rare metals, some electronic product and car manufacturers have been trying to develop remanufacturing and/or manufacturing technologies that limit or avoid using rare metals (The Nikkei American Edition, 2010) as well as methods that allow for a better extraction of materials. Some other manufacturers have already started developing business models for collection and extraction of precious materials from end-of-use/-life products to produce parts of electronic products (The Nikkei American Edition, 2011).It is of utmost importance to develop models that allow for a comparison of different suggested policies with respect to their influence on manufacturers’ decisions concerning investment in recycling technology, the resulting product flows and prices. Studying this phenomenon is difficult because decisions concerning environmental product design are a result of the interaction of multiple decision-makers and factors. Equilibrium models are, therefore, excellent tools to study this issue. However, analyzing the issue of sustainable product design requires developing models with nonlinear constraints because manufacturers make decisions concerning product quantity as well as product characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, nonlinear constraints have not been used in the applications of VI in the context of supply chain management. The equivalence between optimization problems with linear constraints and VI problems is obtained by using a standard procedure because the Abadie constraint qualification is automatically true when the constraints are linear (5.1.4 Lemma in Bazaraa, Sherali, & Shetty, 1993) or directly (see Daniele et al., 1998, Daniele, Maugeri, & Oettli, 1999). However, when the constraints are nonlinear, one needs to prove that the feasible sets are convex in order to get the VI formulation. In addition, one needs to prove that a constraint qualification holds to guarantee the existence of the associated Lagrange multipliers. We verified that our model satisfies the Slater condition.We, therefore, first present a basic model in the context of reverse logistics that includes nonlinear constraints. We then provide mathematical details concerning conditions that are necessary to solve this type of problem. While we present an application of the use of nonlinear constraints in the context of sustainable supply chains, similar applications in forward supply chains, electricity networks and transportation networks occur. Our paper, therefore, contributes to opening up many new modeling opportunities in the growing area of network equilibrium models.We present a simple model that consists of m end-users and n manufacturers. Fig. 1represents the network structure of our model. End-users(i=1,…,m)hold end-of-life products and they decide on the quantity of products that they return to manufacturers. Manufacturers(j=1,…,n)produce new products and they are also responsible for recycling end-of-life products.Manufacturers produce a fixed amount of products to satisfy demand and maintain their market share. As in Qiang et al. (2013) manufacturers determine the quantities of virgin materials and recycled materials used in their production process. Virgin materials are obtained from virgin material markets and recycled materials are extracted from returned products. Manufacturers can sell recycled materials that they do not use in their production process. The rate of recyclability,α¯jss, determines the amount of recycled materials(s=1,…,o)that can be taken from one unit of returned products. The rate of recyclability is given in this model. Furthermore, manufacturers make decisions concerning product design. These product design decisions influence the amount of materials necessary for production of one unit of a product. The variables and parameters as well as the functions are listed in Tables 1–4.Securement of adequate amounts of end-of-life products is an essential issue to develop sustainable downstream supply chain operations. Reflecting manufacturers’ expected minimum collection rate by the regulatory authorities and a high market price for virgin materials, we assume that each manufacturer j competes in the downstream supply chain to obtain virgin materials and end-of-life products that contain valuable resources. In our model manufacturers seek to extract materials that have no quality difference between recycled ones and virgin ones, such as rare metals and high purity plastics. Manufacturers make decisions in the forward and reverse supply chain. As in Qiang et al. (2013) manufacturers decide on the amounts of products collected from end-users and the amounts of virgin materials acquired. This is because we assume the Cournot oligopoly model, in which manufacturing quantities, not prices, are control variables. This assumption stems from ICT manufacturing characteristics (Toyasaki, Wakolbinger, & Kettinger, 2013). In order to satisfy demand, each manufacturer j has to produce at leastz¯jproducts which include s materials,s=1,…o. Products can be either produced using virgin materialsqjsvor recycled materialsα¯ijsrqijr. Recycled materials that are not used in the production process can be sold. Each manufacturer j decides on the quantities of recycled materials sold in recycled material markets,xjs, for a price ofρjs(Xs). Furthermore, each manufacturer j makes decisions concerning product design and determines the amount of material s included in one product1βjs(see Table 4).If a material is not recycled, then it will be sent to a landfill. Thus, the amount of materials that will be sent to landfills is the difference between the returned product flow and the amount of products used in the recycling process (Qiang et al., 2013), that is,∑i=1mw¯ij·qijrwherew¯ij=1-∑s=1oα¯ijsr.In order to analyze the impacts of changes of parameters on the stakeholders, we apply the Nash equilibrium (Nash, 1951) to the economic network model. That is, each manufacturer j seeks to determine the level ofqijr,xjs, andβjsin order to maximize his/her profit, given the behavior of the other manufacturers as well as end-users. Thus, at equilibrium, no decision maker has an incentive to deviate from the equilibrium.Each manufacturer tries to minimize total costs incurred in the reverse logistics process for returned products and the production process for new products minus revenue from sales of recycled materials. Total costs consist of prices paid to end-users for returning their products, costs for acquiring virgin materials, transaction costs for returned products (including inspection and disassembly costs), recycling costs, costs for dumping residual waste in landfills, and production costs. Note that the functions of product acquisition costs, recycling costs, inspection and disassembly costs, transaction costs, dumping costs, and production costs are convex functions with respect to each of their endogenous variables. The revenue functions are concave with respect to their variables. Note that variables with“*”indicate equilibrium solutions. Manufacturer j aims to minimize product acquisition, recovery, and production costs as follows:(1)minQjr,Qjv,Bj,Xj∈K1j∑i=1mρijr∗·qijr+∑s=1ofjsQsv+c̃jQjr+∑s=1orjsα¯jsr,Qr+cj∑i=1mw¯ij·qijr+tj(Qv,Qr,Bj,Xj)-∑s=1oρjs(Xs)·xjs,where(2)K1j=Qjr,Qjv,Bj,Xj∈Rm+3o:τ¯j⩽∑i=1mqijr,(3)zj¯βjs-qjsv-∑i=1mαijsr¯qijr+xjs⩽0∀s=1,…,o(4)∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr-xjs⩾0∀s=1,…,o(5)b¯jsl⩽βjs⩽b¯jsu∀s=1,…,o(6)qjsv,qijr,xjs⩾0∀i=1,…,m,s=1,…,o.Constraint (2) shows that each manufacturer is expected to collect at leastτ¯jamount of products sold due to regulations by environmental regulatory authorities. For example, the WEEE Directive in the EU states that each Member State should collect 4kg of WEEE per capita (Savage, 2006).τ¯j=0,∀junless regulatory authorities enforce regulations that manufacturers need to achieve a minimum collection amount. Constraint (3) ensures that manufacturer j’s production amount is not larger than the amount that can be produced from acquired virgin and recycled materials minus recycled materials sold. Constraint (4) ensures that the total amount of extracted material is larger than the amount of sold recycled material s. Constraint (5) ensures that the transformation factor is between a lower and an upper bound that is provided by the possible production technology and constraint (6) ensures nonnegative material and product flows. As observed in many actual cases and previous research papers, the recycled material priceρjsis lower than the price of virgin materials,p4s. We assume that the unit recycled material price can take a value within the range of(-∞,p4s).We make the following assumptions, which will be denoted by (Hp. 1) in what follows:Let all the involved functions (such as the manufacturers’ costs for acquiring virgin materials, manufacturers’ transaction costs, manufacturers’ recycling costs, manufacturers’ costs for dumping in landfills, as well as manufacturers’ production costs) be continuously differentiable and convex and let the revenue function for the sale of recycled materials be continuously differentiable and concave.In order to get the variational formulation of the optimality conditions of the optimization problem (1)–(6), we have to prove thatK1j, which contains the nonlinear constraints (3), is a convex set. The first term of the nonlinear constraint (3),zj¯βjs, is strictly convex with respect toβjsbecausezj¯is a positive parameter and the other terms are linear with respect to the manufacturers’ variables; hence, the left-hand side of (3) is strictly convex.Then, the optimality conditions for all manufacturers, simultaneously, under the above assumptions of convexity and differentiability, can be expressed as the following variational inequality problem:Find(Qr∗,Qv∗,B∗,X∗)∈K1such that(7)∑i=1m∑j=1nρijr∗+∂c̃jQjr∗∂qijr+∂rjsα¯jsr,Qr∗∂qijr+∂cj∑i=1mw¯ij·qijr∗∂qijr+∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂qijr·qijr-qijr∗+∑j=1n∑s=1o∂fjsQsv∗∂qjsv+∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂qjsv·qjsv-qjsv∗+∑j=1n∑s=1o∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂xjs-ρjs(Xs∗)-∂ρjsXs∗∂xjs·xjs∗·xjs-xjs∗+∑j=1n∑s=1o∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂βjs·βjs-βjs∗⩾0∀Qr,Qv,B,X∈K1,whereK1=(Qr,Qv,B,X)∈Rmn+no+no+no:τ¯j⩽∑i=1mqijr∀j=1,…,n,z¯jβjs⩽qjsv+∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr-xjs∀j=1,…,n,∀s=1,…,o∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr-xjs⩾0∀j=1,…,n,∀s=1,…,ob¯jsl⩽βjs⩽b¯jsu∀j=1,…,n,∀s=1,…,oqjsv,qijr,xjs⩾0∀i=1,…,m,∀j=1,…,n,∀s=1,…,o.We need assumptions (Hp. 1) to prove that the optimality condition of minimization problem (1)–(6) is equivalently expressed in terms of the variational inequality. Indeed, using the usual necessary condition for a minimum, variational inequality (7) is necessary to get that(Qr,Qv,B,X)∈K1is a minimum of problem (1)–(6). Viceversa, variational inequality (7) is also a sufficient condition for minimization problem (1)–(6) in virtue of the convexity assumption.The behavior of the end-users is expressed with a sequence of equilibrium conditions. In the reverse chain, end-users have the options of either returning the product or not. Reflecting a series of legislations and regulations on WEEE and other end-of-life products such as end-of-life vehicles, it is assumed that end-users are not allowed to dump their unreturned products to landfills.End-users’ e-waste flow is controlled by their aversion to returning products (Hammond & Beullens, 2007; Qiang et al., 2013), disutility of holding products (holding cost), economic incentives, and the marginal value of unreturned products. In the reverse chain, the equilibrium law for the quantities of used products and for the costs are, respectively (Wakolbinger, Toyasaki, Nowak, & Nagurney, 2013):(8)aiqir∗-εiqi¯,qir∗+cˆijqijr∗+λi∗=ρijr∗,ifqijr∗>0⩾ρijr∗,ifqijr∗=0∀j=1,…,n;Condition (8) shows that end-users’ aversion to product returns minus disutility of holding end-of-life products plus the transaction costs for returning products, plus the marginal value for the products is equal to the buy-back price that consumers receive for selling used products if the amount of used products that are sold by consumers is positive. Letρijrdenote manufacturer j’s buy-back price from end-user i. This price, as we will show, will be endogenously determined in the integrated model.(9)∑j=1nqijr∗=qi¯,ifλi∗>0⩽qi¯,ifλi∗=0.Condition (9) shows that the total amount of end-of-life products that end-users hold is the same as the amount of products returned from end-users if the marginal value of the end-of-life products is positive.We make the following assumptions, which will be denoted by (Hp. 2) in what follows:Let all end users’ aversion to product returnsai(qir), transaction costscˆijqijrand disutility of holding end-of-life productsεiq¯i,qirbe continuous.The equilibrium conditions for all end-users simultaneously under the above assumptions coincide with the solution of the following variational inequality (Wakolbinger et al., 2013):FindQr∗,λ∗)∈K2such that(10)∑i=1m∑j=1naiqir∗-εiq¯i,qir∗+cˆijqijr∗+λi∗-ρijr∗·qijr-qijr∗+∑i=1mq¯i-qir∗·λi-λi∗⩾0∀Qr,λ∈K2,whereK2=Qr,λ∈R+mn+m.In the forward chain, in equilibrium, shipments that end-users and virgin material markets ship to manufacturers must be equal to shipments that manufacturers accept from end-users and virgin material markets. Analogously, in the reverse chain, in equilibrium, shipments of recycled materials to recycled material markets and shipments of materials that are not recycled and sent to landfills must be equal to shipments that recycled material markets and landfills accept from manufacturers. The equilibrium shipment and price pattern in the supernetwork must satisfy the sum of variational inequalities (7) and (10) in order to formalize the agreements between the tiers.Let us define the global constraint setK3as follows:K3=(Qr∗,Qv∗,λ∗,B∗,X∗)∈R+mn+no+m+no+no:τ¯j⩽∑i=1mqijr∀j=1,…,n,z¯jβjs⩽qjsv+∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr-xjs∀j=1,…,n,∀s=1,…,o∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr-xjs⩾0∀j=1,…,n,∀s=1,…,ob¯jsl⩽βjs⩽b¯jsu∀j=1,…,n,∀s=1,…,oqjsv,qijr,xjs⩾0∀i=1,…,m,∀j=1,…,n,∀s=1,…,o.We have the following definition.Definition 1EquilibriumThe equilibrium state for the economic network with end-of-life products, material transformation factors, recycled and virgin materials in the forward and reverse chain is the vector(Qr∗,Qv∗,λ∗,B∗,X∗)∈K3for which the flows between the tiers of the supernetwork coincide and which satisfies the sum of variational inequalities (7) and (10).The variational inequality that governs equilibrium conditions according to Definition 1 is now derived.Theorem 1Variational Inequality Formulation of the Economic NetworkThe equilibrium condition governing the economic network with end-of-life products, material transformation factors, recycled and virgin materials according toDefinition 1coincides with the solution to the variational inequality:FindQr∗,Qv∗,λ∗,B∗,X∗)∈K3such that(11)∑i=1m∑j=1maiqir∗-εiq¯i,qir∗+cˆijqijr∗+λi∗+∂c̃jQjr∗∂qijr+∂rjsα¯jsr,Qr∗∂qijr+∂cj∑i=1mwij·qijr∗∂qijr+∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂qijr·qijr-qijr∗+∑j=1n∑s=1o∂fjsQsv∗∂qjsv+∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂qjsv·qjsv-qjsv∗+∑j=1n∑s=1o∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂xjs-ρjsXs∗-∂ρjsXs∗∂xjs·xjs∗·xjs-xjs∗+∑i=1mq¯i-qir∗·λi-λi∗+∑j=1n∑s=1o∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂βjs·βjs-βjs∗⩾0∀Qr,Qv,λ,B,X∈K3.Variational inequality (11) is immediately obtained summing up inequalities (7) and (10) after some algebraic simplifications and viceversa.□Note that buy-back price paid from j to i for an end-of-life product,ρijr∗, does not appear in (11). The value ofρijr∗is determined in the market as the result of equilibriumqijr∗,βjs∗,qjsv∗, andxjs∗. That is, from VI (7)ρijr∗=-∂c̃jQjr∗∂qijr+∂rjsα¯jsr,Qr∗∂qijr+∂cj∑i=1mw¯ij·qijr∗∂qijr+∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂qijr,or from VI (10)ρijr∗=aiqir∗-εiqi¯,qir∗+cˆijqijr∗+λi∗.ρijrensures that a solution of variational inequality (11) is also a solution to variatonal inequalities (7) and (10).If we briefly denote by:Aij=aiqir∗-εiq¯i,qir∗+cˆijqijr∗+λi∗+∂c̃jQjr∗∂qijr+∂rjsα¯jsr,Qr∗∂qijr+∂cj∑i=1mw¯ij·qijr∗∂qijr+∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂qijr;Bjs=∂fjsQsv∗∂qjsv+∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂qjsv;Cjs=∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂xjs-ρjsXs∗-∂ρjsXs∗∂xjs·xjs∗;Di=q¯i-qir∗;Ejs=∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂βjs;by:V=Aiji=1,…,mj=1,…,n,Bjsj=1,…,ns=1,…,o,Cjsj=1,…,ns=1,…,o(Di)i=1,…,m,Ejsj=1,…,ns=1,…,o;and by:u=qijri=1,…,mj=1,…,n,qjsvj=1,…,ns=1,…,o,xjsj=1,…,ns=1,…,o,λii=1,…,m,βjsj=1,…,ns=1,…,o;then variational inequality (11) can be written in standard form as:(12)Findu∈K3suchthat:〈V(u∗),u-u∗〉⩾0∀u∈K3Since the setK3is closed, convex, but unbounded, in order to get the existence of the solution to variational inequality (12) (or equivalently (11)), we need to require a coercivity assumption (see Stampacchia, 1969; Maugeri & Raciti, 2009). For a generic discussion about the coercivity condition, please refer to Bigi, Castellani, Pappalardo, and Passacantando (2013).Theorem 2[Existence]Let assumptions (Hp. 1) and (Hp. 2) be satisfied and let the operatorV:K3→R+mn+3no+mbe coercive, namely:limu∈K3‖u‖→+∞〈V(u),u〉‖u‖=+∞,then variational inequality(12)admits a solution.If one substitutes functions from Table 5(functions used in the numerical examples) intoAij,…,Ejsdefined in V of problem (12), then one can seeV(u)consists of linear functions. So the product<V(u),u>is of quadratic type and‖u‖=u12+⋯+un2is of first order. Hence, the ratio<V(u),u>/‖u‖diverges to∞. Theorem 2 is satisfied.In this section we explore the Lagrangian theory associated with variational inequality (12) (or equivalently (11)), so that we better understand the behavior of the market.The utility of exploring Lagrange theory is that it permits us to express the solution of the variational inequality as the solution of the system of equations derived from the KKT conditions when the strong duality holds. Such a system allows us to apply alternative numerical methods (which are not presented in this paper) in order to calculate the solution. Moreover, the Lagrange multipliers which are complementary to the sign constraints contribute to finding the marginal costs and provide a more complete and direct knowledge of the problem. Hence, we set:aj=τ¯j-∑i=1mqijr⩽0,∀j=1,…,n;bjs=z¯jβjs-qjsv+∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr-xjs⩽0∀j=1,…,n,∀s=1,…,o;cjs=xjs-∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr⩽0,∀j=1,…,n,∀s=1,…,o;djs=b¯jsl-βjs⩽0∀j=1,…,n,∀s=1,…,o;ejs=βjs-b¯jsu⩽0∀j=1,…,n,∀s=1,…,o;fjs=-qjs⩽0∀j=1,…,n,∀s=1,…,o;gij=-qijr⩽0∀i=1,…,m,∀j=1,…,n;hi=-λi⩽0∀i=1,…,m;kjs=-xjs⩽0∀j=1,…,n,∀s=1,…,o;G(u)=aj,bjs,cjs,djs,ejs,fjs,gij,hi,kjsi=1,…,m,j=1,…,ns=1,…,o.As a consequence, we remark thatK3can be rewritten asK3=u∈R+mn+3no+m:G(u)⩽0and it is easy to verify the so-called Slater condition (see Daniele, 2001; Jahn, 1996), namely(13)G(u)isconvexand∃u¯∈R+mn+3no+m:G(u¯)<0,(namelyu¯∈intK3).Recalling that the problem of strong duality between Lagrangian function associated with the problem (11) and its dual problem, the following result holds true.Theorem 3Let us assume that(Hp. 1)and(Hp. 2)are satisfied. Then a vectoru∗∈K3is a solution to variational inequality(12)(or equivalently(11)) if and only if Lagrangian multipliers associated with constraintsaj⩽0,bjs⩽0,cjs⩽0,djs⩽0,ejs⩽0,fjs⩽0,gij⩽0,hi⩽0andkjs⩽0exist.See Facchinei and Pang (2003).□In virtue of Theorem 3, we can calculate the Lagrange multipliers associated with constraintsaj⩽0,bjs⩽0,cjs⩽0,djs⩽0,ejs⩽0,fjs⩽0,gij⩽0,hi⩽0andkjs⩽0and the solutionu∗to variational inequality (12).The introduction of the Lagrange function is characterized by the fact that sign constraints are included in such a function and it allows us, when the strong duality holds, to express the solution of the variational inequality by means of the system of equations derived from the KKT conditions. The existence of the solution to the variational inequality is guaranteed by Theorem 2.Industry efforts for electronic products focus primarily on two areas – dematerialization (i.e., using less material overall) and alternative material use (Electronic Product Stewardship, 2009). Environmental policies for WEEE strongly focus on collection targets for used products. Our model seeks to describe interactions between these three areas. Material transformation factorβjsreflects the degree of product dematerialization, manufacturers’ possibility of using recycled materials,qijr, reflects alternative material use instead of virgin material use,qjsv, andτ¯jreflects collection targets for WEEE.The network for the numerical examples consists of two types of sources for used PCs (e.g. private households and companies), i, and four manufacturers, j. We assume that manufacturers extract all metals that can be recycled. We treat these materials as one unit s, that iss=1, in this analysis. Fig. 2represents the network structure of the numerical examples. The variational inequality formulation of the economic network applied in the numerical examples corresponds to (11). Note that production constraints for manufacturers, that is, condition (3) are nonlinear with respect toβj1,qj1v,qijr, andxj1.We use the example of Dell as a representative manufacturer. In 1999, Dell sold 322,580 tons of products (Kenney, 2007) and reported 20,047 million USD costs of goods sold (Edge: Work-Group Report, 2000). From this data, we estimate weekly production quantities and calculate production costs as costs of products sold per ton minus costs for acquiring raw materials because these costs are explicitly captured in our model.The transportation, sorting, recycling and dismantling costs per ton were taken from an article by Boon, Isaacs, and Gupta (2002). The collection costs are taken from a working paper by Atasu, Toktay, and Van Wassenhove (2008) that argues that nonlinear collection costs are appropriate due to diseconomies of scale. According to Sodhi and Reimer (2001), the value of recycled materials (40% metals) per ton of e-waste is USD 9193.46. Since price is dependent on demand in our model, we use a base value of USD 8000 plus a premium which depends on manufacturers’ demand.The data about consumer behavior was taken from EPA (2011). According to EPA (2011), in 2009, 72 million computers were sold in the US and 18 million were collected for recycling (25% of computers sold). In the same year, 70.5 million were in storage (57.9 million residential storage and 12.6 commercial storage) and 0.9 million were disposed or collected for recycling per week (EPA, 2011). If we add the 70.5 to the 0.9 then we get 71.4 million available for end-of-life management at any given week. Hence, the amount available for end-of-life-management is approximately the same as the annual production. We assume two sources (e.g., private households and other than private households) and 4 manufacturers. Therefore, we double the amount available at each source to twice the annual production amount. The functions and parameters used in the numerical examples can be found in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. We assume that each decision-maker within a tier has an identical set of functions.In the base model, manufacturers do not have the option of selling recycled materials (xjs=0;∀j,∀s). They use recycled materials only in their own production processes. This type of recycling system is used by many electronic manufacturers in Japan, for example, Sharp, Sony, and Mitsubishi Electronic (The Japan Machinery Federation & Manufacturing & Science Technology Center, 2008). Due to insufficient quantities of recycled materials and inadequate information sharing about qualities of recycled materials, establishing a market for recycled materials (e.g. plastics) is very difficult. For example, most flame retardants used in plastics of electronic products are quite specific to electronics; thus, using recycled plastics from electronics in a different industry and product is difficult in terms of safety and material compatibility (Electronic Product Stewardship, 2009). In Section 5.4 this assumption is relaxed and resale of recycled materials is possible.Various solution methods for variational inequalities have been developed. Bigi et al. (2013) classifies the algorithms for equilibrium problems based on their characteristics. Bigi and Passacantando (2012) and Taji and Fukushima (1996) developed calculation methods using a gap function approach. Their methods can solve a variational inequality problem without reformulating it as a complementarity problem.We apply the Euler method (Dupuis & Nagurney, 1993) to calculate the equilibrium solution in the numerical examples. The process is initialized with a vector of material transactions, transformation factors and prices. Then, the system will evolve by the discrete-time adjustment process (16) until a stationary/equilibrium point is achieved. Hence, at a given iteration, all the materials, transformation factors, and prices can be solved in closed form using the simple formula (16) and (17). These computations can be done simultaneously for all the variables. As we show in (16) and (17), this algorithm can also be interpreted as a discrete-time adjustment process in which the material transactions, transformation factors, and prices adjust at the tiers until the equilibrium state is reached. As a future research extension, different algorithms could be applied and compared with respect to their convergence time. The Euler method was implemented in Matlab. The convex setK3andV(u)are defined as (12). The complete statement of the algorithm takes the following form.Step 0: InitializationSetu0∈K3. LetTdenote an iteration counter and setT=1. Set the sequenceaTso that∑T=1∞aT=∞,aT>0,aT→0, asT→∞(which is a requirement for convergence).Step 1: ComputationComputeuT∈K3by solving the variational inequality subproblem:〈uT+aTV(uT-1)-uT-1,u-uT〉⩾0,∀u∈K3.Step 2: Convergence VerificationIf|uT-uT-1|⩽∊, with∊>0, a pre-specified tolerance, then stop; otherwise, setT≔T+1, and go to Step 1.In order to apply the algorithm to our numerical example, we first rewrite variational inequality (12) by explicitly including sign constraints (2)–(5) and their associated Lagrange multipliers (see (15)) as follows:(14)FindY∈R+mn+7no+m+nsuchthat:〈F(Y∗),Y-Y∗〉⩾0∀Y∈R+mn+7no+m+nwhereY=(Qr,Qv,λ,B,X,μ,ν,γ,δ,∊).The explicit formula of the variational inequality problem (14) are as follows.(15)Find(Qr∗,Qv∗,λ∗,B∗,X∗,μ∗,ν∗,γ∗,δ∗,∊∗)∈R+mn+7no+m+nsuchthat∑i=1m∑j=1naiqir∗-εiq¯i,qir∗+cˆijqijr∗+λi∗+∂c̃jQjr∗∂qijr+∂rjsα¯jsr,Qr∗∂qijr+∂cj∑i=1mwij·qijr∗∂qijr+∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂qijr-μj∗-∑s=10νjs∗βjs∗α¯ijsr-∑s=10γjs∗α¯ijsr·qijr-qijr∗+∑j=1n∑s=1o∂fjsQsv∗∂qjsv+∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂qjsv-νjs∗βjs∗·qjsv-qjsv∗+∑j=1n∑s=1o∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂xjs-ρjsXs∗-∂ρjsXs∗∂xjsxjs∗+γjs∗+νjs∗βjs∗·xjs-xjs∗+∑i=1mq¯i-qir∗·λi-λi∗+∑j=1n∑s=1o∂tjQv∗,Qr∗,Bj∗,Xj∗∂βjs-νjs∗·qjsv∗+∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr∗-xjs∗-δjs∗+∊js∗·βjs-βjs∗+∑j=1n∑i=1mqijr∗-τ¯j·μj-μj∗+∑j=1n∑s=1oβjs∗·qjsv∗+∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr∗-xjs-z¯j·νjs-νjs∗+∑j=1n∑s=1o∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr∗-xjs∗·γjs-γjs∗+∑j=1n∑s=1oβjs∗-b¯jsl·δjs-δjs∗+∑j=1n∑s=1ob¯jsu-βjs∗·∊js-∊js∗⩾0∀Qr,Qv,λ,B,X,μ,ν,γ,δ,∊∈R+mn+7no+m+n.Sign constraints (2)–(5) can be included in functionF(Y)where Y includes the variables and the Lagrange multipliers because, as verified in Section 4, the Slater condition holds in the economic network problem. Note that now the feasible set of variational inequality (14) is the nonnegative orthant. In this case, an iteration of the general iterative scheme takes on the closed form expression as follows (Nagurney & Zhang, 1996).(16)YT=max{0,YT-1-aT-1F(YT-1)}.Alternatively, in order to speed up the convergence process, the upper bounds of the transformation factors of material s for manufacturer j can be kept in the feasible set as it is the case for relationship levels in Wakolbinger and Nagurney (2004). In this case an iteration for the transformation factors can be expressed as:(17)BT=min{b¯u,max{0,BT-1-aT-1F(BT-1)}},whereb¯u∈R+nois the upper bound of the transformation factor andb¯u=4in the numerical analysis.In what follows, in order to apply the Euler method, we require the operator F to be strict monotone (Nagurney & Zhang, 1996) (see Figs. 1 and 2).Theorem 4The vector function F that enters the variational inequality(14)is strictly monotone with respect toY=(Qr,Qv,λ,B,X,μ,ν,γ,δ,∊), that is,〈F(Y′)-F(Y″),Y′-Y″〉>0∀Y′,Y″∈R+mn+7no+m+n,withY′≠Y″.Since the following proof is analogous to Nagurney and Toyasaki (2005), we just describe the key points of the proof.From the definition ofF(Y), the left-hand side of inequality (14) is(18)〈(F(Y′)-F(Y″))T,Y′-Y″〉.The explicit formulation of (18) is(19)∑i=1m∑j=1naiqir′-εiq¯i,qir′+cˆijqijr′+λi′+∂c̃jQjr′∂qijr+∂rjsα¯jsr,Qr′∂qijr+∂cj∑i=1mwij·qijr′∂qijr+∂tjQv′,Qr′,Bj′,Xj′∂qijr-μj′-∑s=10νjs′βjs′α¯ijsr-∑s=10γjs′α¯ijsr-aiqir″-εiq¯i,qir″+cˆijqijr″+λi″+∂c̃jQjr″∂qijr+∂rjsα¯jsr,Qr″∂qijr+∂cj∑i=1mwij·qijr″∂qijr+∂tjQv″,Qr″,Bj″,Xj″∂qijr-μj″-∑s=10νjs″βjs″α¯ijsr-∑s=10γjs″α¯ijsr·qijr′-qijr″+∑j=1n∑s=1o∂fjsQsv′∂qjsv+∂tjQv′,Qr′,Bj′,Xj′∂qjsv-νjs′βjs′-∂fjsQsv″∂qjsv+∂tjQv″,Qr″,Bj″,Xj″∂qjsv-νjs″βjs″·qjsv′-qjsv″+∑j=1n∑s=1o∂tjQv′,Qr′,Bj′,Xj′∂xjs-ρjs(Xs′)-∂ρjsXs′∂xjsxjs′+γjs′+νjs′βjs′-∂tjQv″,Qr″,Bj″,Xj″∂xjs-ρjsXs″-∂ρjsXs″∂xjsxjs″+γjs″+νjs″βjs″·xjs′-xjs″+∑i=1m∑j=1nq¯i-qijr′-q¯i-qijr″·λi′-λi″+∑j=1n∑s=1o∂tjQv′,Qr′,Bj′,Xj′∂βjs-νjs′·qjsv′+∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr′-xjs′-δjs′+∊js′-∂tjQv″,Qr″,Bj″,Xj″∂βjs-νjs″·qjsv″+∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr″-xjs″-δjs″+∊js″·βjs′-βjs″+∑j=1n∑i=1mqijr′-τ¯j-∑i=1mqijr″-τ¯j·μj′-μj″+∑j=1n∑s=1oβjs′·qjsv′+∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr′-xjs′-z¯j-βjs″·qjsv″+∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr″-xjs″-z¯j·νjs′-νjs″+∑j=1n∑s=1o∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr′-xjs′-∑i=1mα¯ijsrqijr″-xjs″·γjs′-γjs″+∑j=1n∑s=1oβjs′-b¯jsl-βjs″-b¯jsl·δjs′-δjs″+∑j=1n∑s=1ob¯jsu-βjs′-b¯jsu-βjs″·∊js′-∊js″The terms that include Lagrangian multipliers are canceled out, except for the terms that includeνjs.

Thus, these functions are strictly monotone (Nagurney, 1999). From Table 5,ai,-∊i,rjs,cj,-ρjsare also strictly increasing monotone functions.-νjsβjsα¯ijsrand-νjsβjsare strictly monotone functions. Hence,F(Y)is strict monotone if and only ifY′not equalY″.□Regulatory measures often focus on collection rates, e.g., in the recast of the WEEE directive mandatory collection targets of 65 percent are proposed. Our numerical example analyzes how these changes impact manufacturers’ decisions in forward and reverse supply chains. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the impacts of the minimum required collection amounts (τ¯j) on virgin materials bought and products collected as well as the transformation factor.Fig. 3(a) indicates that, in the base case of the numerical example studied, it is in manufacturers’ financial interest to collect 2348 tons of WEEE. Recycled material is cheaper than virgin material up to the collection amount of 2348 tons. Hence, if the minimum required collection rate is below this limit, then it has no effect on manufacturers’ behavior. Total costs that manufacturers incur remain the same up to that level of the minimum required collection amount. As Fig. 3(b) shows, in this setting, the most efficient product design is chosen (i.e.,β∗=4.0) due to high input prices. This implies that the effect of virgin material input prices is greater than the influence ofβon production costs.If the minimum collection amount is raised above 2348 tons, then manufacturers are forced to collect more end-of-life products and their total costs increase. As anticipated by policy-makers, recycled materials substitute for virgin materials and the quantities of virgin materials bought decrease. Once the quantity of virgin materials purchased becomes zero, then manufactures start reducing the transformation factor,β, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Manufacturers use a product design that requires more inputs and save production costs.Based on this result, we next analyze which factors most effectively affect product dematerialization (i.e.,βincreases). Three factors can be considered based on our model. The first factor that could affect product dematerialization is manufacturers’ recyclability rate (α¯ijsr). Manufacturers have introduced new technologies that allow for dematerialization of products. For example, a FRD screen uses a bit more than 50 percent of materials of CRT screens in terms of weight (Electronic Product Stewardship, 2009). However, economic inefficiency of recycling smaller materials in products has also been pointed out. Recycling FRD is more costly due to smaller amounts of recyclable materials included and complicated product designs (PC 3R Promotion Association, 2011). The second factor that could influence dematerialization is demand for new products (i.e.,z¯j). Manufacturers need to appropriately deal with increasing demands for products and rising costs of raw materials. Some manufacturers, such as Hitachi, try to cope with these conditions by pursuing dematerialization (The Nikkei American Edition, 2012); others, such as Sharp, increase the use of recycled or alternative materials (Souma, 2009). The third factor is the impact of providing manufacturers with the possibility of selling recycled materials. In the next three subsections, we observe impacts of these three options on the material transformation factor,β, and on the trade-off between virgin and recycled material use.Concerning the percentage of recyclable materials that can be extracted from products, two opposing trends can be observed. On the one hand, manufacturers, like Sony in Japan increase the amount of materials that can be extracted by providing product parts with labels that indicate their material compositions and by designing their products in such a way that they can be easily disassembled. On the other hand, manufacturers develop technologies to lighten products and use fewer raw materials. A pilot study about rare metal recycling from PCs conducted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry Japan argued that the smaller amounts of recyclable materials included in products lower the economic efficiency of recycling (The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry Japan, 2012). Here, we examine the impact of changes in the percentage of recyclable material s that manufacturer j can extractα¯ijsron new product design. Results are shown in Table 7.The final results of the analysis in Section 5.2 provide the starting values for this analysis. In this caseτj=4550,α¯ijsr=0.4andβj1=3.0. The parameterα¯ijsris then systematically reduced. For the parameter rage ofα¯ijsrexplored in the paper, the amount of recycled materials acquired always stays the same. Manufacturers acquire as much as required by the collection target in all cases. The reason is that the target rate is above the rate that manufacturers would acquire if they could freely chose their collection rate. This situation does not change even ifα¯ijsris reduced. Hence, manufacturers cannot improve their situation without violating regulations concerning minimum collection rates.The parameterα¯ijsrhas a relatively strong influence on the amount of virgin materials acquired and the transformation factor. A reduction of the original value ofα¯ijsrfirst leads to an increase in the transformation factor and then it leads to an increase in the amount of virgin materials acquired. Hence, this shows that improving product design is less costly than acquiring virgin materials in this case. Manufacturers first use their resources more efficiently and then buy additional virgin materials to reach their production goals. Due to high transaction costs (i.e., collection, sorting and dismantling) associated with the end-of-life products, manufacturers do not increase recycled material usage to reach their production goals.Impacts of changes in collection targets on product design also strongly depend on the demand for this product. Changes in demand can be caused by economic conditions. Furthermore, demand changes as products reach different stages in their product life-cycle, that is, introduction, growth, maturity and decline phases. Table 8shows how changes in quantities of new products produced influence the demand for virgin and recycled materials and the transformation factor.As in the previous case, the starting scenario of this analysis is the ending scenario of Section 5.2. As in Section 5.3, the amount of products that is recycled is stable and stays at the level required by the collection target. An increase of demand for new products first increases the transformation factor and then leads to more virgin material being acquired and used because improving product designs is more cost efficient than acquiring additional virgin materials in this case. Due to high transaction costs caused by necessary procurement and treatment of end-of-life products, manufacturers do not increase usage of recycled materials to meet demand.Increases in demand for new products similarly influence material acquisition and product design decisions as reductions in the amount of recyclable materials included in products. Both lead to improved product design and increasing production and sourcing costs for manufactures. In case of increases in demand, however, these costs are partly or fully offset by increasing sales revenue.We also analyze impacts if recycled material s cannot only be used as a raw material for producing new products but can also be sold in a recycled material market as it can be observed in the case of high purity plastics. We assume thatθ¯s=2000andκ¯s=0.01. The numerical examples indicate that in this case for a minimum required collection amount of up to 3550, the results are exactly the same as in the case without the sales option. These results are shown in Figs. 3(a) and (b). However, when the minimum collection rate increases further and reaches values of 4050 and 4550, then manufactures still choose the most efficient product designs and sell some of the recycled material on the market for recycled materials. These results indicate the importance of establishing markets for recycled materials and for providing manufacturers with easy access to these markets.In this paper, we provide an example of an economic network with nonlinear constraints. The model from the context of reverse logistics consists of three tiers. In that case, unlike a model with linear constraints, we need to carefully verify the convexity of the feasible set and satisfaction of a constraint qualification. We first present end-users’ and manufacturers’ behavior and the resulting equilibrium and optimality conditions. We provide conditions that ensure that the problem can be formulated as a variational inequality. Using Lagrange theory, we prove that the model can be solved. Finally, we provide numerical examples that highlight how the model developed in this paper can be used by policy-makers and manufacturers to anticipate effects of new legislation and changes in economic conditions. The numerical examples show the possible negative influence of required minimum collection amounts on product design decisions. Furthermore, the numerical examples indicate how changes in demand and percentages of recyclable material included can reduce this effect. The importance of the establishment of sound markets for recyclable materials and of providing manufacturers easy access to these markets is highlighted.We anticipate that other economic networks that have previously been formulated using variational inequalities would also benefit from the introduction of nonlinear constraints. Examples could be forward supply chains, electricity networks, transportation networks as well as closed-loop supply chains with nonlinear constraints. The model and proofs in this paper provide a foundation for future research in this area.
