@&#ABSTRACT@&#
An n-unit system provisioned with a single warm standby is investigated. The individual units are subject to repairable failures, while the entire system is subject to a nonrepairable failure at some finite but random time in the future. System performance measures for systems observed over a time interval of random duration are introduced. Two models to compute these system performance measures, one employing a policy of block replacement, and the other without a block replacement policy, are developed. Distributional assumptions involving distributions of phase type introduce matrix Laplace transformations into the calculations of the performance measures. It is shown that these measures are easily carried out on a laptop computer using Microsoft Excel. A simple economic model is used to illustrate how the performance measures may be used to determine optimal economic design specifications for the warm standby.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The analysis of systems configured with warm standby components as a way to improve system reliability and availability has been of considerable research interest. The early work on the analysis of systems with warm standbys was strongly influenced by three papers. Gnedenko (1965) investigated an n-component system with one warm standby and repair facility. Under the assumptions that the operating components and warm standby had exponential lifetimes and the distribution of time to perform repair was arbitrary, Gnedenko determined the Laplace transformation of the distribution of time until first system failure, the mean time until first system failure, and explored a number of limit theorems. Gopalan (1975) extended this result by assuming a single operating unit and n−1 warm standbys with one repair facility, and constructed the Laplace transformation of system availability and system reliability. Gopalan applied these results to the special cases of one and two warm standbys. Subramanian, Venkatakrishnan, and Kistner (1976) changed Gopalan’s model by allowing r repair facilities and assumed that the operating system had an arbitrary life distribution, while the warm standbys had an exponential distribution of time until failure, and the repair time distribution was also exponential. By viewing the stochastic process defined by the number of failed standbys at time t as a birth-and-death process, they derived a system of equations to determine the mean time until system failure and system availability.The study of systems configured with warm standbys has accelerated in recent years. Wang, Lai, and Ke (2004) used the simplification of exponential unit lifetimes and repairs to study K out of M+W systems, where M is the number of operating units and W is the number of warm standbys. Srinivasan and Subramanian (2006) considered the case of a three unit system with two warm standbys having lifetimes with exponential distributions. Under the assumption that the operating unit’s lifetime and the repair time had arbitrary distributions, they constructed expressions for the system reliability and point availability; however, computational efficiency was a question left for future research. Papageorgiou and Kokolakis (2010) considered two-unit parallel systems with multiple warm standbys without the possibility of unit repair. They determine an expression for system reliability recursively based on the number of warm standbys. Amari, Pham, and Misra (2012) examined a k-out-of-n warm standby system without repair. Under the assumption of exponential unit lifetimes, they constructed an expression for the distribution of system lifetime as well as several other reliability measures. Eryilmaz (2013) analyzed a k-out-of-n system without repair equipped with a single warm standby, and derived an explicit expression for the system reliability. Additional active research streams which study systems provisioned with warm standby units include the analysis of general coherent systems (Eryilmaz, 2011), k-out-of-n systems (Amari & Pham, 2010, Eryilmaz, 2013), and other specified system configurations (Bulama, Yusuf, & Bala, 2013), the analysis of phased missions (Levitin, Xing, & Dai, 2013, Mohammad et al., 2013), and the impacts of dedicated repairmen (Vanderperre & Makhanov, 2013), multiple warm standbys (Wang, Yen, & Fang, 2012), and imperfect switching (Yuan & Meng, 2011, Yun & Cha, 2010).Two other works warrant special consideration because of the use of distributions of phase type. Perez-Ocon and Montoro-Cazorla (2006) assumed a one-unit system with (n−1) warm standbys, where the operating unit’s lifetime and the repair time have distributions of phase type and the warm standbys have exponential lifetimes. By modeling the system as a level-dependent quasi-birth-and-death process, they were able to show that the system operational periods and repair periods follow distributions of phase type, and developed computationally tractable expressions for system reliability, availability, and other measures of system performance. Ruiz-Castro and Fernandez-Villodre (2012) examined a one-unit system with (n−1) warm standbys, where the operating unit is subject to repairable and nonrepairable failures and warm standbys are subject to only repairable failures. All distributions of times until failure as well as the distribution of repair times were assumed to be discrete phase type. A block replacement of the entire system occurs at the time when all units have experienced a nonrepairable failure and removed from the system. Tractable transitory and stationary characteristics of the system were determined.The purpose of this paper is to extend the known analytic results for systems with warm standbys to the case that the systems under study are subject to both repairable and nonrepairable failures. Unlike the Ruiz-Castro and Fernandez-Villodre (2012) investigation, it will be assumed that nonrepairable failures occur to the system as a whole instead of a single operating unit. Such a perspective is useful for modeling a variety of practical scenarios; for example, the nonrepairable failure might represent the end of the system’s useful life, perhaps resulting from product or process obsolescence, or the failure of a critical subsystem operating in series with the system composed of warm standbys. Alternatively, the exact duration of the mission of the system may not be known with certainty, and thus the occurrence of a nonrepairable failure could represent the end of the system’s mission. In all of these cases, it is of interest to investigate the behavior of the system over a time period whose duration is described by a probability distribution. The interested reader is referred to the early work by Bryant and Murphy (1980) using this perspective applied to alternating renewal processes, and by Bryant and Wells (1984) using this perspective applied to more general systems. The occurrence of repairable and nonrepairable failures will also redirect our attention from first system failure and steady state or long run measures, such as availability, to measures which are more appropriate for systems viewed over finite but random time intervals.IIdentity matrix0, 1Vector of zeros, ones, respectivelyXTime until failure of an operating unit, X∼F(x)=1 −e−λx, x⩾0, and λ>0WTime until failure of the unit in standby,W∼F1(w)=1-e-λ1w,w⩾0, and λ1>0YTime required to repair a unit, Y∼G(y), y⩾0VTime required to perform block replacement, V∼G1(v), v⩾0TTime until a nonrepairable failure, T∼H(t), t⩾0T1Time until the first system failure, T1∼K(t1), t1⩾0UAccumulated system uptime over the random interval [0,T], U∼J(u), u⩾0f̃(s)Scalar-valued Laplace-Stieltjes transformation ofF(x),f̃(s)=∫0∞e-stdF(t)FAMatrix-valued Laplace Stieltjes transformation ofF(x),FA=∫0∞exp(At)f(t)dtΨRandom interval reliability, P{T1>T}ΛRandom point availability, P{System is operating at time T}The notational convention used throughout this paper is to use a capital letter to indicate a distribution function and the corresponding lower case letter for the density function if it exists. Thus F(x) is the distribution function andf(x)=dFdxis the density function. The survival function is written asF‾(x)=1-F(x).In the sequel, significant attention will be given to continuous distributions of phase type, or more simply, phase distributions. A distribution is of phase type if and only if it can be represented as the distribution of time until absorption in a finite state continuous-time Markov chain in which absorption is certain given any initial state (Neuts (1981)). Phase distributions are useful for representing evolutionary processes, such as the degradation of a component or the steps required to perform a repair, and are therefore appropriate for the current investigation. Moreover, phase distributions are dense in the class of life distributions and include all finite mixtures of convolutions of Erlang distributions; consequently, they are a robust assumption about the lifetime of a process under study. Finally, phase distributions can enhance computational tractability as indicated in the work of Perez-Ocon and Montoro-Cazorla (2006) and Ruiz-Castro and Fernandez-Villodre (2012).Let A∗ be the infinitesimal generator of a continuous-time Markov chain with k+1 states, 0, 1, 2, …, k, where state 0 is absorbing for any initial state. Let 0 be a (1 ×k) vector of zeros and 1 a (k×1) column of ones. A∗ can be written asA∗=00A0A,where A is a k×k stable matrix with negative diagonal elements and non-negative off-diagonal elements such that the row sums are nonpositive, and A0=−A1. Letα∗ be the 1×(k + 1) initial probability vector of the Markov chain. Thenα∗=[α0,α], with α0+α1=1. For notational convenience, it is assumed throughout that α0=0.If H(t) is the distribution function associated with the time until absorption, then(1)H(t)=1-αexp(At)1,t⩾0,and is absolutely continuous with probability density function(2)h(t)=-αAexp(At)1,t⩾0.Sinceαand A uniquely determine H, H is said to have representation (α, A).Because of the presence of phase distributions, matrix Laplace transformations will naturally arise in the calculations encountered in this work. A matrix Laplace transformation (MLT) is a k×k matrix defined by(3)FA=∫0∞exp(At)f(t)dtwhere f(t) is a density function defined on [0,∞), and A is a k×k stable matrix as described in Section 2.1, (Bryant & Murphy, 1983). These transformations have three characteristics which augment the tractability encountered in the calculations. First, the MLT of a convolution is the product of the MLT of each term in the convolution. So if f(t)=g*h(t), where g(t) and h(t) are two density functions, andg∗h(t)=∫0tg(u)h(t-u)du,then FA=GAHA. Second, if two matrices, A and B, commute, then so do their MLT’s,FAGB=GBFA.Third, the computation of the MLT is fundamentally no more difficult than computing the ordinary (scalar) Laplace transformation, and the resulting matrix expression corresponds to the scalar expression. So, for example, while an exponential random variable with density function f(t)=λe−λt, t⩾0, has a scalar Laplace transformation,f̃(s), defined byf̃(s)=∫0∞λe-λte-stdt=λs+λ,its MLT takes the formFA=∫0∞λe-λtexp(At)dt=λ[λI-A]-1.where I is a k×k identity matrix. Note that the negative sign appearing before the matrix A in this expression coupled with the fact that the eigenvalues of A have negative real parts implies that FAreduces tof̃(s)when A is a 1×1 matrix. More generally, if F is a distribution of phase type with representation (β,B), then the MLT of F is given byFA=(I⊗β)[(A⊗I)+(I⊗B)]-1(I⊗B1)=-(I⊗β)[(A⊗I)+(I⊗B)]-1(I⊗B0),where M⊗N denotes the Kronecker product of the matrices M and N. As another example, if F is a truncated normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ where it is assumed that μ is much larger than σ, say, μ>5σ, then(4)FA=exp{μA+σ2A2/2}.In many cases in which A has special structure, the elements of FAare simple functions off̃(s). For an example of a 2×2 case, if A is the generator for a generalized Erlang or hypoexponential distribution given byA=-aa0-b,then(5)FA=f̃(a)a(a-b)(f̃(b)-f̃(a))0f̃(b).Alternatively, if A is the generator for an Erlang distribution,Ak×k=-aa00⋯00-aa0⋯000-aa⋯0000-a⋯0⋮⋮⋮⋮⋱⋮0000⋯-a,then(6)FA=f̃0(a)f̃1(a)f̃2(a)f̃3(a)⋯f̃k-1(a)0f̃0(a)f̃1(a)f̃2(a)⋯f̃k-2(a)00f̃0(a)f̃1(a)⋯f̃k-3(a)000f̃0(a)⋯f̃k-4(a)⋮⋮⋮⋮⋱⋮0000⋯f̃0(a),wheref̃j(a)=ajj!∫0∞tje-atf(t)dt.In each of these cases, the computation of FAis straightforward.The system under investigation is initially similar to the one explored by Gnedenko (1965), consisting of n brand-new operating units in series and one brand-new warm standby at time 0. When a unit fails, it is immediately sent to the repair facility. The time until failure of an operating unit, X, has distribution function F(x)=1−e−λx, x⩾0, and λ>0, while the time until failure of the unit in standby, W, has distribution functionF1(w)=1-e-λ1w,w⩾0, and λ1>0. If an operating unit fails and the standby is available, the standby is instantly and flawlessly brought into operation, implying that the fault detection and switching mechanisms are perfect.The repair of a unit restores the unit to as-good-as-new condition. The time required to repair the unit, Y, when no other unit is in the repair facility is a random variable with distribution function G(y), y⩾ 0. If one unit is being repaired and a second operating unit fails, there is no warm standby unit available to replace it, and a system failure occurs. No other unit can fail during a system failure. At the time of a system failure, the repair of the first unit in the repair facility is suspended, and a block replacement of the two failed components is executed to bring the system back to the as-good-as-new condition of time 0. This block replacement requires an amount of time V distributed as G1(v), v⩾0.A nonrepairable failure of the system, or alternatively, the mission of the system terminates after some random amount of time, T, distributed according to H(t), t⩾0. The random variables T, V, W, X, and Y are assumed to be mutually independent.The measures used to assess system performance in the literature have generally reflected the underlying assumption concerning the maintainability of the system. For a nonrepairable failure, reliability, or the distribution of time until first system failure, is frequently used. Alternatively, if failures are repairable, then system availability is generally concluded to be a more important measure. Because the system under investigation is subject to both repairable and nonrepairable failures, or equivalently, the system is being observed over a random time horizon, the standard metrics used to assess system performance, such as reliability and availability, require modification to be more meaningful. This study will focus on three such modified measures:(1)Accumulated system uptime, U, over the random time interval of length T, either expressed through the distribution of accumulated system uptime or its mean.Random interval reliability, or the probability of continuous operation over the random time interval of length T. This can be expressed as the probability that the time of the first system failure, T1, exceeds T.Random point availability, or the probability that the system is operating at time T.While not exhaustive, these metrics are clearly useful in the design of a wide range of systems.In what follows, these measures will be developed for two models. In the first model it is assumed that the distribution of time to do block replacement, G1(v), is arbitrary and that the distribution of time until nonrepairable failure, H(t), is a distribution of phase type with representation (α,A). In the second model, it is assumed that a block replacement policy is not available, the distribution of time to perform repair, G(y), is a distribution of phase type, and that the distribution of time until a nonrepairable failure, H(t), is arbitrary.Let T1 be the time of the first system failure caused by component failure distributed as K(t1), t1⩾0. Conditioning on the event that the time of a nonrepairable failure, {T=t}, then the event that the system remains operational over the interval [0,t] occurs if and only if one of the following three mutually exclusive events occurs—E1: {no failures occur over [0,t]}, E2: {one failure occurs at time z in [0,t], the repair of this unit requires more than (t−z) time units, but the remaining n units operate flawlessly over [z,t]}, and E3: {one failure occurs at time z and is repaired in y time units, where (y+z)∈[0,t], no other unit fails during the interval [z,z+y], and the system operates successfully over the interval [z+y,t]. ThenK‾(t)=P{T1>t}satisfies the integral equation:(7)K‾(t)=P{E1}+P{E2}+P{E3}=e-(nλ+λ1)t+∫0∞(nλ+λ1)e-(nλ+λ1)zG‾(t-z)e-nλ(t-z)dz+∫∫y+z<t(nλ+λ1)e-(nλ+λ1)ze-nλyK‾(t-(y+z))dG(y)dz.The MLT,KA=∫0∞eAtdK(t), is given by(8)KA=(nλ)(nλ+λ1)[Ik×k-GA1]A1-1A2-1,where Ik×kis a (k×k) identity matrix,GA=∫0∞eAtdG(t),A1=A-(nλ)Ik×k,andA2=A-(nλ+λ1)[Ik×k-GA1].As will be shown next, KAwill be useful for computing system performance measures.Theorem 1If H(t) is of phase type with representation (α,A), then the random interval reliability, Ψ, is given by(9)Ψ=α[I-KA]1,where KAis given by Eq. (8). To prove expression(9), note thatΨ=1-P{T>T1}=1-∫0∞P{T>t|T1=t}dK(t)=1-∫0∞αeAt1dK(t)=1-α∫0∞eAtdK(t)1=1-αKA1=α[I-KA]1.□If H(t) is of phase type with representation (α,A), then the random point availability, Λ, is given by(10)Λ=α[I-KA][I-G1AKA]-11,whereG1A=∫0∞eAtdG1(t)and KAis given in Eq. (8).Let a(t) be the probability that the system is operational at time t>0. The system will be operating at time t if one of the following two mutually exclusive events occur—E4: {the time of the first system failure exceeds t}, and E5: {the system fails at some time x<t, the block replacement requires y time units such that x+y<t, the system is operational in t−(x+y) time units. Then a(t) satisfies the integral equation(11)a(t)=K‾(t)+∫∫x+y<ta(t-(x+y))dG1(y)dK(x)DefineaA=∫0∞eAta(t)dt. Multiplying (11) by eAtand integrating over [0,∞) yields(12)aA=-A-1[I-KA][I-G1AKA]-1.Finally note that(13)Λ=P{the system is operational at timeT}=∫0∞a(t)dH(t)=∫0∞a(t)[-αAeAt1}dt=-αAaA1,and the theorem follows upon substituting (12) into (13). □Let U be the accumulated system uptime over the random interval [0,T]. IfJ‾(u)=P{U>u}, and if H(t) is of phase type with representation (α,A), then(14)J‾(u)=αϕu(G1A)eAu1,where ϕu(s) is the matrix-valued generating function associated withNT1(u)defined byϕu(s)=∑m=0∞P{NT1(u)=m}sm, andNT1(u)is the number of complete uptime cycles in the first u units of uptime.The random variables T1 and V with distribution functions K(t) and G1(v), respectively, are periods of system uptimes and downtimes. Taken together, they form an alternating renewal process. Employing results from Bryant and Murphy (1980) for an alternating renewal process,J‾(u)can be computed by:(15)J‾(u)=∑m=0∞P{NT1(u)=m}∫0∞H‾(u+v)dG1(m)(v)whereG1(m)is the m-fold convolution of G1. Assuming H(t) is of phase type with representation (α, A), this becomes(16)J‾(u)=∑m=0∞P{NT1(u)=m}∫0∞αeA(u+v)1dG1(m)(v)=∑m=0∞P{NT1(u)=m}α∫0∞eAvdG1(m)(v)eAu1=α∑m=0∞P{NT1(u)=m}G1AmeAu1Sinceϕu(G1A)=∑m=0∞P{NT1(u)=m}G1Am, Eq. (14) results upon substitution. □Let B=A−sI. The Laplace-Stieltjes transformation of the density of accumulated system uptime,j̃(s)=∫0∞e-stdJ(t), is given by(17)j̃(s)=α[I+sB-1(I-KB)(I-KBG1A)-1]1.The expressionP{NT1(u)=m}in Eq. (16) can be written asP{NT1(u)=m}=K(m)(u)-K(m+1)(u),where K(m) is the m-fold convolution of K. Substituting this into (16), multiplying by e−su, and integrating over [0,∞) yields(18)∫0∞e-suJ‾(u)du=-αB-1∑m=0∞KBm-KBm+1G1Am1=-αB-1(I-KB)(I-KBG1A)-11.Finally, noting that∫0∞e-suJ‾(u)du=1s(1-j̃(s)), Eq. (17) follows from Eq. (18). □The expected uptime, E[U] accumulated until the time of a nonrepairable failure is given by(19)E[U]=-α[A-1(I-KA)(I-KAG1A)-1]1.To illustrate the tractability of the expressions in Theorems 1–3, and to illustrate the sensitivity of the measures to changes in the failure rate of the standby unit, Table 1shows the computational results of the random interval reliability, Ψ, random point availability, Λ, and expected uptime, E[U], performed in Microsoft Excel. Excel was purposely chosen to indicate that specialized software is not needed in order to use these results. In this example, n=3, λ=0.2, G and G1 are assumed to be of phase type with representations (γ,C) and (γ1,C1), respectively, with γ=γ1=[0.50.5] andC=-0.20.20-0.2,C1=-0.10.10-0.1,and H(t) assumed to be Erlang with shape parameter 3 and scale parameter 1.0. Table 1 shows how Ψ, Λ, and E[U] vary with the failure rate of the warm standby, where λ1 is allowed to vary from 0 to the value of λ=0.2. Note that the value of λ1=0 corresponds to the case that the standby is cold, while the value λ1=0.2 corresponds to a hot standby. This latter case is exactly equivalent to a 3-out-of-4 system. As anticipated, each system measure improves as the failure rate of the standby unit decreases.Using the identical distributional assumptions given above in this section, but with the assumption that H(t) is exponential with parameter 1/E(T), Fig. 1shows the influence of the expected time until a nonrepairable failure on Λ, the random point availability. By direct computation it may be shown that as E(T) gets large, the value of Λ asymptotically approaches E(T1)/(E(T1)+E(V))=0.183, the system availability obtained if there were no nonrepairable failures.In this section, it is assumed that block replacement is not performed. Instead, a single repairman performs repair on the failed units on a first-come-first-served basis. As before it is assumed that when the system fails at the time of a second unit enters the service facility, the remaining operating units are suspended; that is, they cannot fail. The distribution of time to perform repair, G(y), is a distribution of phase type with representation (γ,C), (note that γ0≡0), and the distribution of time until a nonrepairable failure, H(t), is arbitrary. As before, it is assumed that the time until failure of an operating unit, X, has distribution function F(x)=1−e−λx, x⩾0, while the time until failure of the unit in standby, W, has distribution functionF1(w)=1-e-λ1w,w⩾0, and that T, W, X, and Y are mutually independent. The objective is to derive practical measures of system performance.Momentarily ignoring the nonrepairable failures, under these assumptions the system behavior can be modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain. If C in the representation of G(y) is a (j×j) matrix, then the (2j+1) state space of the Markov chain can be described as follows in Table 2.Note that the system is operating while in states 0, 1,…, j, and failed when it is in states j+1,…, 2j.Let M∗ be the (2j+1)×(2j+1) infinitesimal generator describing this systems behavior. Then M∗ can be written as(20)M∗=-(nλ+λ1)(nλ+λ1)e10′C0C-nλInλI0e1⊗C0C,where eiis a (1×j) unit vector in the ith direction, 0 is a (j×1) vector of zeros, 0′ is the transpose of 0, and C0=−C1. Note that the first row of this matrix corresponds to state 0, the next j rows to states 1,…, j, and the last j rows to states j+1,…, 2j, as described in Table 2.Next let μ∗ be the (1×(2j+1)) vector of probabilities denoting the chance of entering state k, k=0, 1, …, 2j, at time 0. Since the system is assumed to start with all (n+1) units operating, μ∗ is a unit vector indicating that the system starts in state 0. Finally, let 1j+1 be a ((j+1)×1) vector of ones. Define δ to be a (2j×1) vector by(21)δ′=1j+1′,0′.Recall that a(t) is the probability that the system is operational at time t>0. Then based on the definition of M∗, we immediately have:Lemma 1(22)a(t)=P{the system is operating at timet,t⩾0}=μ∗exp(M∗t)δ.Let M be a (j+1)×(j+1) matrix formed by deleting the last j rows and columns from M∗,(23)M=-(nλ+λ1)(nλ+λ1)e1C0C-nλI,and letμj+1be a (1×(j+1)) unit vector with a 1 in the first position. DefineHM∗=∫0∞exp(M∗t)dH(t)andHM=∫0∞exp(Mt)dH(t). Based onLemma 1, the following two measures can be computed.The random point availability, Λ, is given by(24)Λ=μ∗HM∗δ.SinceΛ=∫0∞a(t)dH(t), we have from Lemma 1,Λ=∫0∞μ∗exp(M∗t)δdH(t)=μ∗∫0∞exp(M∗t)dH(t)δ=μ∗HM∗δ.□The random interval reliability, Ψ, is given by(25)Ψ=μj+1HM1j+1.As before, let T1 be the time of the first system failure. By our previous partitioning of M∗, T1 has a phase distribution with representation (μj+1,M). Consequently, by conditioning on the time of a nonrepairable failure, we haveΨ=P{T1>T}=∫0∞P{T1>t|T=t}dH(t)=∫0∞μj+1exp(Mt)1j+1dH(t)=μj+1∫0∞exp(Mt)dH(t)1j+1=μj+1HM1j+1.□The expected uptime, E[U], accumulated before a nonrepairable failure is(26)E[U]=∫0∞μ∗exp(M∗t)δH‾(t)dt.Let χ(t)=1 if the time until a nonrepairable failure exceeds t, and equal 0 otherwise. Similarly, define ζ(t)=1 if the system is operational at time t, and equal 0 otherwise. Then the accumulated system uptime, U, can be expressed asU=∫0∞ζ(t)χ(t)dt.Taking expectations on both sides of this expression and using the mutual independence of the time until a nonrepairable failure, T, with the random variables that describe system behavior, we have by Tonelli’s theorem,(27)E[U]=∫0∞E[ζ(t)]E[χ(t)]dt.But E[ζ(t)]=P{ζ(t)=1}=a(t)=μ∗exp (M∗t)δby Lemma 1. Moreover,E[χ(t)]=P{χ(t)=1}=H‾(t). Therefore Eq. (27) becomesE[U]=∫0∞μ∗exp(M∗t)δH‾(t)dt.□Note that the matrix-valued integral in Eq. (26) does not admit an analytic solution since M∗ is singular. However, Eq. (26) is useful for numerical integration.For the case that n=3, λ=0.2, G is assumed to be of phase type with representation (γ,C) withγ=[0.50.5] andC=-0.20.20-0.2,and H(t) is assumed to be a truncated normal distribution with mean 2.0 and standard deviation 0.2, Theorems 5 and 6 were used with Eq. (4) to compute the random interval reliability, Ψ, and the random point availability, Λ, in Microsoft Excel. Fig. 2shows how the failure rate of the warm standby, λ1, influences Ψ and Λ. As before, λ1=0 and λ1=0.2 correspond to a cold and hot standby, respectively, while all values 0<λ1<0.2 correspond to warm standbys.The information in Fig. 2 can be useful in choosing a design for a standby component in a system. To make the utility for design considerations more explicit, Theorem 6 was used to perform a numerical integration in Microsoft Excel. Table 3shows how λ1 influences the expected uptime generated by the system before a nonrepairable failure renders the system economically obsolete.If the warm standby system under examination produces economic value, it may be possible to use the results of Section 5.1 along with cost information to make an economically optimal design decision; that is to answer the question, what are the warm standby specifications which will maximize expected profits? The costs associated with a specific warm standby design decision will naturally include costs arising from the design and creation of the standby unit, but also include the costs incurred from the differential delays in system restoration which typically depend on the “warmth” or failure rate of the standby. Information about these costs is assumed to be available and included in the analysis presented here. As a result, if two or more candidate warm standby designs are under consideration, the difference in the expected revenues as determined through the expected uptimes, E[U], in Theorem 6, along with the differential costs allows the analyst to select the design which maximizes expected profit.To illustrate, regression analysis shows that the relationship between E[U] and λ1 in Table 3 is almost linear over the small range 0⩽λ1⩽0.2, and takes the form E[U]=1.7893−0.2397λ1. Consequently, if the system generates a unit of monetary value for every unit of system uptime, the marginal expected revenue (MR) is 0.2397 for every unit decrease in the standby’s failure rate. This can be used with cost data for the design of the standby unit to determine an economically optimal failure rate and standby design. For example, let x=the decrease in the standby’s failure rate from 0.2. Assume for the sake of this illustration that it is known that the total expected cost of the warm standby’s design is of the formCost(x)=x2+0.04x,so that the marginal cost of reducing the standby’s failure rate isMC=∂Cost(x)∂x=2x+.04.Equating MR with MC to maximize expected profit results in an optimal design parameter of λ1=0.1005. More generally, assume a cost function of the formCost(x)=ax2+bx.It is easy to show that the standby should be designed to be (1) cold (λ1=0) if MR exceeds 0.4a+b, (2) hot (λ1=0.2) if MR is less than b, or (3) warm (0<λ1<0.2) with design parameterλ1=0.4a+b-MR2aif b<MR<0.4a+b.The purpose of this paper was to analyze systems configured with a warm standby in the case that individual components experience repairable failures but the entire system is subject to nonrepairable failures. Two different models, one using a policy of block replacement upon system failure, and the other without a block replacement policy, were constructed and employed to develop three measures of system performance: the distribution or mean of the accumulated system uptime over the life of the system, random interval reliability, and random point availability. These measures are natural extensions of system reliability and system availability for systems being observed over a random time horizon.It has been shown that under various distributional assumptions involving distributions of phase type, these performance measures are functions of matrix Laplace transformations. Matrix Laplace transformations of matrices which commute under multiplication also commute under multiplication, and possess formulae that are frequently the matrix analog of the scalar Laplace transformation. Consequently, the presence of matrix Laplace transformations in the performance measures actually increases the tractability of the calculations. An effort to underscore this fact was made by using Microsoft Excel for all of the calculations in the paper. Finally, an economic model was constructed to illustrate how the performance measures could be used to create an economically optimal design specification for the warm standby component.
