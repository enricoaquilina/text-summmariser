@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This study proposes a novel optical fiber sensor (OFS) network using three-dimensional (3-D) wavelength/time/spatial optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) scheme. The proposed 3-D modified quadratic congruence/M-matrix (MQC/M-matrix) coding scheme overcome the restriction of single pulse per row inherent in traditional three-dimensional codes and maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio even when source power is low. The 3-D system is implemented using optical switches (OSW), fiber-Bragg gratings (FBGs), optical splitter and optical combiner. The noises of phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN) and multiple access interference (MAI) in the decoding mechanism can be suppressed by using a spectral spreading scheme and balance-detection in the receivers. By constructing 3-D codes using bipolar pseudorandom (PN) codes rather than unipolar codes provides a significant increase in the maximum permissible number of active sensor nodes.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Recently, optical fiber sensors (OFSs) have been widely applied in measuring physical parameters, including temperature, pressure, rotation, acceleration, humidity, sound, vibration, and electromagnetic fields. OFSs are also commonly used in civil engineering, environmental and biochemical testing, and clinical biomedical fields. Furthermore, OFSs have advantages of their small size, light weight, low power, high sensitivity, high bandwidth, and ability to resist electromagnetic interference (EMI). In addition, OFSs possess the characteristic of light signal transmission, which enables multiplex measurements from multiple points by combining various multiplex network frameworks such as wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), time division multiplexing (TDM), frequency division multiplexing (FDM), and optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA) [1,2].The millimeter-wave radio-over-fiber (RoF) system [3–6] has attracted considerable interest as a potential means of realizing OFSs. Because RoF system can transmit analog sensor signals and seems likely to emerge as a rival to OFS networks in the future. Following the successful application of code-division multiple-access (CDMA) techniques in wireless communications, many researchers have investigated the feasibility of implementing optical CDMA (OCDMA) systems [4–19]. Compared to traditional electrical CDMA schemes, OCDMA systems have the advantage that various types of analog sensor signal can be multiplexed in the optical domain. Furthermore, high processing gains can be obtained using conventional broadband optical devices. OCDMA schemes allow multiple sensor signals in a local area network (LANs) to access the same fiber channel asynchronously without delays or the need for scheduling. Accordingly, OCDMA represents an attractive access technique for OFS networks. In an OFS network with OCDMA access, different node of sensor signals assign different codes. The advantage of the network is easily to add/remove the access points by changing the length of codes or using the specified codes for corresponding network.The performance of OCDMA systems is mainly degraded by the interference from other simultaneous sensor signals, which is called multiple access interference (MAI). In order to eliminate MAI, the spectral-amplitude coding OCDMA (SAC-OCDMA) system using spectral codes with fixed in-phase cross-correlation were proposed [16]. However, due to the usage of noncoherent broadband light source (BLS), the phase-induced intensity noise (PIIN) exists in these systems and causes considerable performance degradation. In SAC-OCDMA schemes, it is essential to identify the maximum number of serviceable wavelengths since this number dictates the maximum permissible code length and this in turn determines the maximum number of sensor nodes which can be accommodated simultaneously on the network. When the number of sensor nodes is large, it becomes impractical to use limited bandwidth of optical source and optical filters.Due to the unipolar characteristic of optical signals, the length of one-dimensional (1-D) optical codes must be increased if the maximum permissible number of active RBSs is to be increased. However, long code lengths decrease the data rate and increase the MAI effect at the receiver in time-spreading OCDMA schemes. To overcome the limit of 1-D code and hence multi-dimensional coding method such as two-dimensional (2-D) code [13,14,17] and three-dimensional (3-D) [18,19] code were proposed. The above 3-D coding configuration, the encoding and decoding functions are performed by delaying the optical pulse in the time domain using optical delay lines. Although suitable for optical digital modulation, this technique is less easily applied to the multiplexing of radio signals for transmission over analog links. Previously, Yang and Huang [13] performed optical spectra with fiber-Bragg gratings (FBGs) and spatial coding with star coupler. At nearly same time, Yen and Huang [14] performed time-spreading/wavelength-hopping multiplexing by time-spreading optical pulses with optical switches (OSWs) and spectral coding with arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG). In this study, we combine 1-D time-spreading, wavelength-hopping and spatial coding into 3-D wavelength/time/spatial process.In the proposed system, we propose new 3-D matrix and associated decoding scheme for a wavelength/time/spatial OCDMA system. We construct 3-D modified quadratic congruence/M-matrix (MQC/M-matrix) codes by extending 1-D MQC codes used for wavelength coding integrated with 2-D M-matrix codes used for time/spatial coding. The performance of multiple-wavelength OCDMA scheme is essentially governed by the PIIN in the receiver. Although various studies have proposed codes with a low in-phase cross-correlation to alleviate this unavoidable effect, the lower code weight leads to a large power loss and therefore these codes perform poorly at low signal power.The proposed MQC/M-matrix coding scheme overcome the restriction of single pulse per row inherent in traditional 3-D codes and maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) even when source power is low. Although the problems of PIIN and MAI still arise in the decoding mechanism of the proposed 3-D scheme, the use of a spectral spreading scheme and balance-detection in the receivers suppress their effects. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the MQC/M-matrix code construction and the system configuration. In Section 3, we analyze the code performance. Acknowledgement section is brief conclusion.In the study, we choose low cross-correlation code of MQC as wavelength-hopping code to suppress the PIIN effect. For ensuring the higher transmitted power is obtained in the 3-D OCDMA system, we choose high auto-correlation codes of M-matrices for each time and spatial codes in the OFS network. The 3-D wavelength/time/spatial code can be constructed by employing the following steps: (1) First, we construct MQC codes [9] used for wavelength domain. (2) Second, the M-matrix codes [13] are used for time/spatial domain. (3) We finally combine MQC codes with M-matrix codes to generate 3-D codes.LetXa=[xa(1)…xa(h)…xa(L)],Yb=[yb(1)…yb(t)…yb(M)] andZc=[zc(1)…zc(s)…zc(N)] represent ath MQC code, bth M-sequence code and cth M-sequence code used for wavelength, time and spatial domain. The code length for these code sequences are L=p2+p, M and N. Note that L, M and N need not be in same code length. The 3-D MQC/M-matrix codes can be expressed asRa,b,c=[xa(1)YbTZc, …, xa(λ)YbTZc, …, xa(L)YbTZc], whereYbTZcis an M-matrix. We can useRa,b,cas the wavelength-hopping, time-spreading and spatial codes for the OCDMA network.The elements of the eight decoding correlation functions at the receiver end for each PD are defined as:(1)Ra,b,c(1)(g,h,l)=XaYbTZcRa,b,c(5)(g,h,l)=XaYbTZ‾cRa,b,c(2)(g,h,l)=X‾aYbTZcRa,b,c(6)(g,h,l)=X‾aYbTZ‾cRa,b,c(3)(g,h,l)=XaY‾bTZcRa,b,c(7)(g,h,l)=XaY‾bTZ‾cRa,b,c(4)(g,h,l)=X‾aY‾bTZcRa,b,c(8)(g,h,l)=X‾aY‾bTZ‾c.whereX‾,Y‾, andZ‾are the complementary code sequences of X, Y, and Z.Table 1lists the correlation properties of the 3-D codes for each PD, where E- and D-mean the same and different code patterns in the 3-D codes, respectively. The abbreviations of W, T, and S mean the wavelength, time, and spatial code patterns in the 3-D codes.The receivers which compute the correlation subtractions:(2)Ra,b,c(1)(g,h,l)+Ra,b,c(4)(g,h,l)+Ra,b,c(6)(g,h,l)+Ra,b,c(7)(g,h,l)-Ra,b,c(2)(g,h,l)+Ra,b,c(3)(g,h,l)+Ra,b,c(5)(g,h,l)+Ra,b,c(8)(g,h,l).The correlation subtraction process suppresses MAI and PIIN effects in the decoder output and enables the desired sensor signal to be extracted.The conceptual schematic diagram of the wavelength/time/spatial OCDMA network sown in Fig. 1includes p2MN transmitter and receiver pairs and N star couplers. The system can support p2MN sensor nods. Every transmitter and receiver pair is assigned with a 3-D MQC/M-matrix codewordRa,b,c, a=1, 2, …, p2, b=1, 2, …, M and c=1, 2, …, N. The transmitter first encodes the radio signal with its corresponding codeword and then broadcast the encoded data to the receivers via the star couplers.The sensor signal is assumed as gk(t) at the transmitter has the form:(3)gk(t)=ak(t)cos(2πfrft).where frf is the frequency of the sensor signal and ak(t) is the complex envelope with a bandwidth Brf.The structure of the transmitter is shown in Fig. 2is composed of an unpolarized broadband source with flat spectrum, an Mach–Zehnder modulator (MZM), two sets of FBSs, one OSW, an optical splitter and N switches. The 3-D OCMDA scheme proposed in this study achieves spectral-amplitude coding using FBGs and time-spreads the transmission spectrum using an ON–OFF type switching technique. Initially, the broadband light pulse is encoded spectrally via two sets of FBGs according the spectral code sequenceXa. The second FBGs are arranged as the inversed ordinals of first FBGs to compensate the run-trip delays. After that, the radio signal is converted into an optical intensity modulation (IM) signal by directly modulating a spectrally encoded optical pulse. This optical signal is then sampled by an OSW driven with code sequenceYb. Therefore, the OSW outputs optical pulse amplitude modulation/IM (PAM/IM) signals whose pulses are positioned according to the signature code pattern with a frame period and chip width of TF(seconds) and TC, respectively. If the periodic frequency 1/TFis set to be at least twice the sensor signal bandwidth, then the decoders corresponding to each transmitter extract the radio signal by applying bandpass natural sampling theory [20,21] implemented using a system of balance detectors. Finally, the optical signals are passed to the splitter and switches for spatial encoding according to the spatial code sequenceZc.Fig. 3shows the structure of the receiver, which consists of two optical combiners, four OSWs and four balanced detectors. Each of the four balanced detectors has two sets of FBGs and two photodiodes (PDs). The operation of the receiver is described below. The optical signals obtain from the star couplers are first aggregated by the combiners. The upper optical combiner only receives and combines the signals sent from the star couplers matched to “1s” ofZc, so that the interference caused by the transmitters with the different spatial code sequences can be mostly removed. The lower optical combiner is used to receive and combine the signals sent from the star couplers according toZ‾c, so as to provide MAI cancellation information. The signals from the two combiners are passed to two 1×2 splitters, respectively. Thereby, the optical signals from the upper combiner are split into two equal portions and delivered to the first and second OSWs. Similarly, the optical signals from the lower combiner are also split into two equal portions and delivered to third and fourth OSWs. The first and third OSWs are driven with code sequenceYb, and the second and fourth OSWs are driven with code sequenceY‾b. After OSWs, the optical signals are delivering to balanced detectors. Every balanced detector has two sets of FBGs, two optical power adjustors and two PDs. Every set of the FBGs of the balanced detector has the same number of gratings and can be used to reflect back the same spectral components. The power adjustors are used to rectify the power level of the optical signals incident to the PDs.In order to simplify the analysis, we make some assumptions as follow.(1)Each broadband light source is ideally unpolarized and its spectrum is flat over the bandwidthv0-Δv/2,v0+Δv/2, where v0 is the central optical frequency andΔv/2is the optical source bandwidth.Each spectral component produced by the spectral encoder has identical spectral width.Each spectral component received by a user has the same power.The bit streams sent from different transmitters arrive at the receivers simultaneously.Intensity noise (including PIIN and MAI), shot noise and thermal noise are considered in photocurrent analysis. The effect of the dark current is neglected. The photocurrent noise is given by [22]:(4)〈i2〉=〈IPIIN2〉+〈Ishot2〉+〈Ithermal2〉=I2Bwτc+2eIBw+4KbKnBwRL.where I, Bw, τc, e, Kb, Tnand RLare the average photocurrent, noise-equivalent electrical bandwidth of the receiver, coherence time of source, electron’s charge, Boltzmann’s constant, absolute receiver noise temperature and receiver load resistor, respectively. The G(v) is one-sided source power spectral density (PSD). In accordance with Ref. [19], the coherence time τccan be written as:(5)τc=∫0∞G2(v)dv∫0∞G(v)dv2.Without the loss generality, we assume the receiver is intended to receive code matrixR1,1,1. Assuming bit synchronism, the PSD at PD1–PD8 of the receiver can be written as:(6)G1(v)=PsrMΔvN+12∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))·∑h=1Lxa(h)x1(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1(s)rext(h),(7)G2(v)=PsrpMΔvN+12∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))·∑h=1Lxa(h)x1‾(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1(s)rext(h),(8)G3(v)=PsrMΔvN+12∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))·∑h=1Lxa(h)x1(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1‾(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1(s)rext(h),(9)G4(v)=PsrpMΔvN+12∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))·∑h=1Lxa(h)x1(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1‾(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1‾(s)rext(h),(10)G5(v)=PsrMΔvN+12∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))·∑h=1Lxa(h)x1(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1‾(s)rext(h),(11)G6(v)=PsrpMΔvN+12∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))·∑h=1Lxa(h)x1‾(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1‾(s)rext(h),(12)G7(v)=PsrMΔvN+12∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))·∑h=1Lxa(h)x1(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1‾(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1‾(s)rext(h),(13)G8(v)=PsrpMΔvN+12∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))·∑h=1Lxa(h)x1‾(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1‾(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1‾(s)rext(h).where Psris the effective source power at the receiver, K is the number of active RBSs, m0 is optical modulation index, gk(t) is radio signal at kth RBS and a, b and c is given by:(14)a=k-1p2N+1,b=k-p2N(a-1)-1N+1,andc=k-p2N(a-1)-N(b-1).whereis floor function.The rect(h) function in Eqs. (6)–(13) is given by:(15)rect(h)=uv-v0-Δv2N(-N+2i-2)-uv-v0-Δv2N(-N+2i).where u(v) is step function.The average photocurrent at PD can be written as:(16)I=R∫0∞G(v)dv.where R is the responsivity of PD given by R=(ηe)/(hvc), η is the quantum efficiency, e is the electron’s charge, h is the Plank’s constant and vcis the central frequency of the original broadband optical source. Due to the noises of PDs 1–8 are independent, the total noise of the photocurrent can be written as:(17)〈i2〉=〈IPIIN2〉+〈Ishot2〉+〈Ithermal2〉=BwR2∫0∞G12(v)+G22(v)+G32(v)+G42(v)+G52(v)+G62(v)+G72(v)+G82(v)dv+2eBw(I1+I2+I3+I4+I5+I6+I7+I8)+4KbTnBwRL.To obtain the total noise of photocurrent, we need to calculate the output current of PDs 1–8 and the integral of G12(v)–G82(v). The output current of PDs 1–8 can be expressed as follows:(18)I1=R∫0∞G1(v)dv=PsrMΔvN+12×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1(s)rect(h)dv=Psr8LM(1+m0g)(M+1)(p+A-1)(M+1)(N+1)+BN+B+C+1,(19)I2=R∫0∞G2(v)dv=PsrpMΔvN+12×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1‾(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1(s)rect(h)dv=Psr8LM(1+m0g)(M+1)(A-2)(M+1)(N+1)+BN+B+C+1,(20)I3=R∫0∞G3(v)dv=PsrMΔvN+12×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1‾(t)∑h=1Lxa(h)x1(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1‾(t)=Psr8LM(1+m0g)(M+1)(p+A-1)(M+1)(N+1)+BN-2N+B+C+1,(21)I4=R∫0∞G4(v)dv=PsrpMΔvN+12×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1‾(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1‾(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1(s)rect(h)dv=Psr8LM(1+m0g)(M+1)(A-2)(M+1)(N+1)+BN-2N+B+C+1,(22)I5=R∫0∞G5(v)dv=PsrMΔvN+12×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1(t)∑h=1Lxa(h)x1(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1(t)=Psr8LM(1+m0g)(M+1)(p+A-1)(M+1)(N-1)+BN-B+C-1,(23)I6=R∫0∞G5(v)dv=PsrpMΔvN+12×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1‾(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1‾(s)rect(h)dv=Psr8LM(1+m0g)(M+1)(A-2)(M+1)(N-1)+BN-B+C-1,(24)I7=R∫0∞G7(v)dv=PsrMΔvN+12×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1‾(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1‾(s)rect(h)dv=Psr8LM(1+m0g)(M+1)(p+A-1)(M-1)(N-1)+BN-2N-B+C+1,(25)I8=R∫0∞G8(v)dv=PsrpMΔvN+12×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1‾(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1‾(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1‾(s)rect(h)dv=Psr8LM(1+m0g)(M+1)(A-2)(M-1)(N-1)+BN-2N-B+C+1.And the integral of G12(v)–G82(v) can be expressed as follows:(26)∫0∞G12(v)dv=Psr2MΔv2(N+12)2×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1(s)rect(h)2dv=Psr264pLMΔv(1+m0g)2(M+1)2(M+1)2(N+1)2(A-1)(p+A-1)+(M+1)(N+1)(BN+B+C+1)(p+2A-2)+(BN+B+C+1)2(27)∫0∞G22(v)dv=Psr2Mp2Δv2(N+12)2×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1‾(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1(s)rect(h)2dv=Psr264p2LMΔv(1+m0g)2(M+1)2(M+1)2(N+1)2(A-1)(A-2)+(M+1)(N+1)(BN+B+C+1)(2A-3)+(BN+B+C+1)2(28)∫0∞G32(v)dv=Psr2MΔv2(N+12)2×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1‾(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1(s)rect(h)2dv=Psr264pLMΔv(1+m0g)2(M+1)2(M-1)2(N+1)2(A-1)(p+A-1)+(M-1)(N+1)(BN-2N+B+C-1)(p+2A-2)+(BN-2N+B+C-1)2(29)∫0∞G42(v)dv=Psr2Mp2Δv2(N+12)2×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1‾(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1‾(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1(s)rect(h)2dv=Psr264pLMΔv(1+m0g)2(M+1)2(M-1)2(N+1)2(A-1)(A-2)+(M-1)(N+1)(BN-2N+B+C-1)(2A-3)+(BN-2N+B+C-1)2(30)∫0∞G52(v)dv=Psr2MΔv2(N+12)2×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1‾(s)rect(h)2dv=Psr264pLMΔv(1+m0g)2(M+1)2(M+1)2(N-1)2(A-1)(p+A-1)+(M+1)(N-1)(BN-B+C-1)(p+2A-2)(BN-B+C-1)2(31)∫0∞G62(v)dv=Psr2Mp2Δv2(N+12)2×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1‾(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1‾(s)rect(h)2dv=Psr264pLMΔv(1+m0g)2(M+1)2(M+1)2(N-1)2(A-1)(A-2)+(M+1)(N-1)(BN-B+C-1)(2A-3)+(BN-B+C-1)2(32)∫0∞G72(v)dv=Psr2MΔv2(N+12)2×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1‾(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1‾(s)rect(h)2dv=Psr264pLMΔv(1+m0g)2(M+1)2(M-1)2(N-1)2(A-1)(p+A-1)+(M-1)(N-1)(BN-2N-B+C+1)(p+2A-2)+(BN-2N-B+C+1)2(33)∫0∞G82(v)dv=Psr2Mp2Δv2(N+12)2×∫0∞∑k=1K(1+m0gk(t))∑h=1Lxa(h)x1‾(h)∑t=1Myb(t)y1‾(t)∑s=1Nzc(s)z1‾(s)rect(h)2dv=Psr264pLMΔv(1+m0g)2(M+1)2(M-1)2(N-1)2(A-1)(A-2)+(M-1)(N-1)(BN-2N-B+C+1)(2A-3)+(BN-2N-B+C+1)2.where g is the average value of the sensor signal gk(t), K is the number of active sensor nodes, A, B and C can be expressed as:(34)A=K-1p2N+1,B=K-p2N(a-1)-1N+1andC=K-p2N(A-1)-N(B-1)Substituting Eqs. (18)–(34) into Eq. (17), we can obtain the value total noise of the photocurrent. For a sinusoidal received signal, the carrier power P at the output of the receiver is:(35)P=12(m0RMPDPsr)2.where MPDis the photodiode gain (M=1 for pin photodiodes).The SNR can be expressed as:(36)SNR=P〈i2〉.We can get the theoretical SNR through our mathematical analysis. Table 2shows the parameter, which are used to calculate the numerical results.Fig. 4shows the total number of active sensor nodes versus SNR for OCDMA system using 2-D MQC/M-sequence [17] and 3-D codes MQC/M-matrix at Psr=−10dBm and 622MHz sensing frequency. It is observed that at the same SNR, the system using 3-D codes can support more sensor nodes. Furthermore, the performance of the system using MQC/M-matrix code is enhanced when L increases.Fig. 5shows the effective source power versus SNR for the number of active sensor nodes equal to 100. As shown in Fig. 5, when the effective source power is sufficient, the system using 2-D codes can ensure better performance above −25dBm. Besides, based on this numerical result, we can find that the system performance increases with the value of L provided that there is sufficient effective source power (i.e., increasing coding gain) at the receivers because the beating probability of any two different code sequences of the 3-D codes reduces when the value of time-spreading code increases and the PIIN can be further suppressed when the processing gain becomes large. As shown in Fig. 5, we can also find the proposed 3-D scheme can maintain low decay of slope even in the low effective power condition.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This study has implemented a novel 3-D OCDMA system using OSWs and FBGs. The proposed system uses code families with a multiple-weight-per-column property to ensure system performance even when effective source power is low. The 3-D system is designed to increase the utilization of a BLS with a finite bandwidth and release the sampling rate of OSW. In the proposed, the number of codec pair and required code length are more flexible than in a conventional OCDMA system. Unlike, some OCDMA systems, the current OSW-based scheme does not use fiber delay lines to perform time-spreading scheme and is there suitable for the transmission of sensor signal over an analog link.The SNR of the 3-D OCDMA system has been analyzed numerical for PIIN- and MAI-limited cases. Although MAI is produced in the current scheme when transmitting the sensor signals of sensor nodes from the same wavelength/spatial patterns, its effect is suppressed by the use of balanced detectors in the receivers. In addition, the PIIN effect is suppressed by using OSWs to implement the time-spreading scheme. Further, when there is a need to increase the number of measurement points, this system can be easily adapted to the new situation simply just increasing the coding length of 3-D codes. This system is thus highly applicable in OCDMA monitoring multiple sensors and applications using multiple point measurements technology. The main benefit of optical fiber sensors is their immunity from EMI and electrical fields. The flexible advantages of these properties can be applied to the monitoring of industrial machinery, testing the strength of buildings, security systems, and a wide range of other applications.
