@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
We discuss an on-line tool that facilitates access to a large collection of climate impacts on crop yields produced by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP; Rosenzweig et al., 2013) as part of the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison Initiative (GGCMI; Elliott et al., 2014b) and the Inter-Sectoral Impacts Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP; Warszawski et al., 2014). As displayed in Table 1, this collection comprises the output of seven crop models which were run on a global grid using climate data from five different general circulation models (GCM) under the current set of representative pathways (RCPs; Moss et al., 2010). The output of this modeling endeavor consists of more than 36,000 publicly available global grids at a spatial resolution of one half degree.This information has been used to gain an understanding of the interactions among water supply, irrigation, and climate change in global caloric production (Elliott et al., 2014b); multisectoral impacts of climate change (Piontek et al., 2014); and endogenous economic responses to increases in temperature (Nelson et al., 2014). The wide range of applications of these data can be expected to greatly expand the quantitative assessment of global climate change impacts at different levels of global warming as well as geographic scales.22For instance, Blanc and Sultan (2015) combined these data with climate data and estimated regressions that permit predicting yields from changes in climate without the need of running the underlying crop models.Importantly, the richness in crops and GCM models can inform our understanding of model uncertainty (e.g., Piontek et al., 2014) and therefore help to impose boundaries on the potential effects of climate warming as well as to illuminate research priorities. However, and despite being open access, the technical skills required to access these data are likely to represent an important barrier for many researchers, reducing the potential impact of this information.These barriers are particularly important for cross-disciplinary research. For instance, Hertel et al. (2010) point out that technical access barriers to geo-referenced data have slowed down our understanding of the effects of global environmental change on the long-run sustainability of the food system. From a more general perspective, Craglia et al. (2011) discuss the opportunities for on-line geoprocessing services to foster multidisciplinary collaboration. The advantages of on-line geoprocessing tools are many. In particular, shared access to common geospatial data results in considerable savings (Kiehle, 2006), allows users to leverage shared cyberinfrastructure for intensive computing via services such as HUBzero (McLennan and Kennell, 2010), and share workflow elements across different study areas (Yue et al., 2010; Hertel and Villoria, 2012).Against this background, in order to facilitate the use of these data, we have built a publicly-available, open-source tool that aggregates the data from the grid-cell level to larger geographic aggregates using harvested area and production as alternative weighting schemes. The tool is implemented in GEOSHARE's HUBzero cyberinfrastructure (McLennan and Kennell, 2010) using the statistical language R (R Core Team, 2014). Both HUBzero and R are open-source systems, thus saving users costly licenses. Moreover, because the data are entirely handled and processed by GEOSHARE's HUBzero computing resources, users do not require special processing capabilities nor Internet connectivity beyond what is required for ordinary web browsing.The main audience of the data are researchers modeling the effects of climate change on agriculture at global scales (Rosenzweig et al., 2014). Typically, these users are interested in the “shocks” to the crop productivity of a given region that are attributable to climate change (e.g., Nelson et al., 2014). The level of aggregation used in these models ranges from grid-cells (Piontek et al., 2014) to few global regions (Baldos and Hertel, 2015). Access to this type of data requires considerable skills in the use of GIS tools or the cyberinfrastructure needed to transfer large datasets in a systematic way. Therefore, this tool bridges the gap between the crop modelers generating the data repository and the final users of this information. The tool also facilitates obtaining summary statistics which can be useful for rapid understanding of the data, regional summaries, or visualization.The data in the AgMIP repository joins other large data collections, particularly those produced by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP533http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/.). To date, the standard way of delivering these data are simple data portals where users can download the raw data, usually compressed, directly into their computers (e.g., http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/). A typical user of the GGCMI archive would need to set up a Globus Online client (Foster, 2011), search the desired dataset in a multi-layered folder hierarchy, download the data, and use specialized tools to extract the information from the NetCDF files in which the data are stored. Given the potentially large volume of information, data download and storing may consume significant bandwidth and hardware resources. Aggregation from the grid-cells to the desired geographic units requires significant dexterity using specialized geoprocessing tools that involve constructing aggregation weights as well as concordances between coordinates and the desired geographic regions.The AgMIP tool goes a step forward and offers the possibility of aggregation to increase the impact of the data by facilitating its use by scientific communities working on global modeling of the effects of climate change in agriculture.44The size of these user communities is potentially large. For example, the Global Trade Project Analysis (GTAP) network has approximately 12,000 members, a fourth of which are active users of the GTAP data and model, and for which the study of the economic effects of climate change on agriculture is a main focus.At the most basic level the tool is simply a download platform of the raw data. The user using this service is probably literate with the GIS formats used in the climate community and have considerable experience using programming languages in large data environments. For this user, the tool saves the need to set up a Globus Online client. The tool also serves users who prefer to leave all the aggregation tasks up to the tool, but that provide customized aggregation schemes.The rapid uptake of the tool55As of September 1, 2015, since its release in March 2014, there has been 5563 runs (or aggregations) by 71 unique users.underscores the need for offering data tools in the climate realm that can lift some of the burden required by data preprocessing. This facilitates a more efficient use of resources because researchers in different communities can focus on their areas of expertise rather than on data handling and preprocessing. Therefore, by building this tool we hope to encourage other groups producing large and complex datasets to develop their own accompanying data delivery/processing tools. In the next section we demonstrate that this can be accomplished using common-use scientific software and shared cyberinfrastructure.The AgMIP tool is hosted in GEOSHAREs HUBzero cyberinfrastructure (https://geoshareproject.org/). HUBzero (McLennan and Kennell, 2010), is an open source software platform specializing in disseminating simulation and data tools via the world wide web. The HUBzero environment is highly flexible and the main requirement for researchers that wish to make their code public is that the code runs on Linux (McLennan and Kennell, 2010). HUBzero provides the Rappture toolkit that facilitates the development of interactive tools with a graphical user interface. Tools can also be developed using other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C/C++, etc. HUBzero has a well-defined tool development process to help and guide tool developers to develop, deploy, and publish their tools. Users access the AgMIP tool at GEOSHARE using an ordinary Web browser without having to download or compile any code specific to the tools. The AgMIP tool GUI is written in Java. Each HUBzero tool (whether written in Java or not) is a desktop application that runs in an isolated light-weight virtual machine container. Users can access the tool via a web browser using a graphical desktop sharing technology called Virtual Network Computing (VNC). HUBzero currently provides two types of VNC clients embedded in the web browser: HTML5, or Java Applet based client. GEOSHARE is open and users can freely access all the data and simulation tools.66HUBzero was originated in the nanotechnology community, which have developed many simulation tools (https://nanohub.org/tools/). Other HUBzero projects including driNET (http://drinet.hubzero.org), WaterHub (http://water-hub.org) and GABBS (https://mygeohub.org/groups/gabbs) provide geo-spatial data analysis tools such as SWATShare (https://mygeohub.org/groups/water-hub/swatshare), MultiSpec (https://mygeohub.org/tools/multispec), Water Deficit Viewer (https://mygeohub.org/tools/deficitviewer), and the Active Learning Tool (https://mygeohub.org/tools/act). A complete list of HUBs can be found at https://hubzero.org/sites.Fig. 1displays the conceptual workflow of the tool separated into three different steps. Each step in Fig. 1 is implemented as a tab in a graphical user interface shown in Figs. 2–4. The GGCMI output is stored in NetCDF files. Each file is identified by a 12 part file name that specifies crop model, climate model, representative concentration pathway, socio-economic pathway, CO2 fertilization (yes/no), irrigation (yes/no), a crop, and a time period (See Table 1 in the User's Manual for further details). For instance:are global grids of maize yields (one grid for each year in the period 2005–2099), projected by pDSSAT (Jones et al., 2003; Elliott et al., 2014a), using the climate projections of the Global Circulation Model HADGEM2-E, under representative concentration pathway RCP2.6, assuming no irrigation and allowing for CO2 fertilization.In order to retrieve the data, the first step in Fig. 1 requires the user to select a unique combination of crop model, climate model/scenario, and other choices, which are all presented in the tool's user front-end (Fig. 2). The user's selections create a character string that matches the file names stored in the ISI-MIP archive. This character string is used to retrieve all the available years – in most cases, each file stores information on 10 years worth of data – for the selected scenario. GEOSHARE's Hub and the ISI-MIP archive are connected through Globus Online (Foster, 2011), a service that facilitates transfer of large datasets.Once in GEOSHARE's Hub, the files are stored in a common server workspace. Before each data request, the tool checks whether the data has already been downloaded, and if so, indicates this to the user. This feature avoids downloading the same data more than once. At this point, the user can either download the raw NetCDF files for custom processing on her desktop, or proceed to aggregate the data (step 2 in Fig. 1 and GUI implementation in Fig. 3).Aggregation is performed by two R functions. The first function reads the data using the R NetCDF package by Pierce (2013). The second function performs the aggregation from grid-cells to larger geographic units. The user has the opportunity to select different aggregation schemes or upload her own. For example, aggregation from the grid-cell to country level requires a mapping that correlates each latitude and longitude pair with a unique country name. The mapping schemes are simple comma separated value files. By default, we have included regional mappings for country and country-AEZ regions. Simple guidelines for preparing these data files are in the User's Manual, which can be retrieved from either the description page of the tool, or the “Help” button of the tool's GUI.Rosenzweig et al. (2014) recommends using the gridded harvested area from the M3 crop dataset (Monfreda et al., 2008) to obtain regional production. It is important to keep in mind that this aggregation assumes that harvested areas are constant over time. This recommendation is implemented as the first option in the Aggregation tab (Fig. 3). The underlying R code performs the following operation:(1)ProductionR=∑g∈RYieldg×Areag.where R is a region comprised by a number of grid-cells indexed by g.In many applications, users need to weight the contribution of each grid-cell to obtain a regional average. A common practice is to weight each grid cell's yield by the harvested area of the chosen crop (e.g. Nelson et al., 2014). This option is also implemented in the tool, by choosing the option “Regional Yields Weighted by each Grid-cell's Harvested Area,” under Aggregation Options in Fig. 3. The operation performed by the underlying R scripts is given by:(2)ProductionR=∑g∈RYieldg×Areag/∑g∈RAreag.As before, the default is to use the grid-cell level harvested areas from the M3 crop dataset.Some users may be interested in other weighting schemes. For example, Baldos and Hertel (2015) use grid-cell level production to calculate production-weighted yield averages while Nelson et al. (2014) use modeled area weights from You and Wood (2006). Alternative weighting schemes can be uploaded and used instead of the provided defaults.The output of the R function is a comma-separated-value file with two columns, one identifying the aggregated region(s) and the other the aggregated value (e.g., production weighted average maize yield). We have chosen a comma separated value (CSV) format because of its versatility. The tool also produces a detailed description (Documentation in GUI displays) of the operations performed and suggests the citations that should be included when using the tool (see example in the next section).The last step in the workflow is to visualize the underlying information. As shown in Fig. 4, the tool creates a map of the chosen regions for each year in the dataset. These maps can be downloaded (in PNG format) for use in other applications.The GGCMI archive has the potential to be used in many settings. For instance, Baldos and Hertel (2015) explore the extent to which the future changes in crop productivity linked to future climate trajectories may affect global food security; for this, they aggregate the GGCMI shocks to a dozen of regions encompassing the world, and run an economic model that estimates future price changes. In a different setting Blanc and Sultan (2015) combine the GGCMI shocks with climate data to create crop models “emulators” that can serve as economic alternatives to running the global crop models. As stated above, we expect the present tool to encourage further applications of these data.We demonstrate the tool using projected maize yields from pDSSAT obtained under HadGEM2 (Collins et al., 2008) climate predictions for representative concentration pathways RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (Moss et al., 2010). We include output with and without CO2 fertilization. pDSSAT (Jones et al., 2003; Elliott et al., 2014b) is a modification of the DSSAT crop model that runs in global grids, given the basic information on biophysical attributes. The user of these yield shocks is advised to consult Rosenzweig et al. (2014) for a discussion of the different models and attributes.Fig. 2 shows the front-end of AgMIP tool with the relevant options checked. Fig. 3 displays the “Aggregation” tab. Beyond the included default mapping and weighting schemes, the tool is intended to give the user flexibility regarding choices of aggregation. To demonstrate such flexibility we created two additional regional mapping schemes. One maps each coordinate pair to a unique aggregate unit, which we label “World.” The other maps each coordinate pair into one of two categories: low latitude (regions within the tropics) and mid-latitude (between 23.5° and 66°).Fig. 5displays the global production-weighted average maize yield from 2005 to 2099. To gain some perspective on the size of this job, consider that each RCP-CO2 fertilization scenario of pDSSAT is stored in 9 NetCDF array files, each containing 10 years worth of data. And for each year there are 720×360 = 259,200 grid-cells, including non-land pixels. Thus, for the four sets of outputs illustrated in Fig. 3 (2 RCPs, with and without CO2), the tool downloads 36 NetCDF files to the HUBzero server and processes 324 (36 × 9) grids to aggregate to a single summary annual statistic. In the process, the final user is shielded from all the technical barriers implied by learning new download platforms and specialized formats, as well as pre-processing of the weighting schemes. Moreover, this can be all performed trough any standard web browser without any special bandwidth requirement.In Fig. 6we demonstrate an alternative mapping scheme in which the world is divided into low and middle latitudes as explained above. In addition, we demonstrate the effects of using production weights, area weights, and simple averages.Access to spatial datasets by non specialists is hindered by technical difficulties involving software and data formats as well as the need for strong Internet bandwidth and storage capacity. This short communication discusses a GEOSHARE tool that expands access to the outputs from the AgMIP GGCMI Project to the broader scientific community who can benefit from these data, but who may lack the resources to gain access to them.The main advantage of the GGCMI ensemble is that the results are spatially consistent across the globe which would not be the case if regionally trained model results were combined for different regions. Nevertheless there are some limitations that should be considered when using these data (see Rosenzweig et al., 2014; for an in-depth discussion). First, some of the crop models have been calibrated to national or grid cell yield observations which may cause implicit assumptions that suit cropping systems in these regions better than in others (Rosenzweig et al., 2014). Second, most of the crop models lack formal sensitivity analysis to weather extremes and year-to-year weather variability. An additional caveat is that the geographic weights (e.g., harvested area) used by the tool are assumed to be invariant to time (circa year 2000, see Monfreda et al., 2008).The results currently delivered by the GEOSHARE AgMIP tool are part of an ongoing project (Elliott et al., 2014b). The ISI-MIP/GGCMI has started its second phase in which the different modeling groups are focusing efforts on modeling intercomparison, evaluation and improvement. The discussed tool has been designed to deliver the new and improved datasets as they are publicly released.
