@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Fuzzy regression models have been widely applied to explain the relationship between explanatory variables and responses in fuzzy environments. This paper proposes a simple two-stage approach for constructing a fuzzy regression model based on the distance concept. Crisp numbers representing the fuzzy observations are obtained using the defuzzification method, and then the crisp regression coefficients in the fuzzy regression model are determined using the conventional least-squares method. Along with the crisp regression coefficients, the proposed fuzzy regression model contains a fuzzy adjustment variable so that the model can deal with the fuzziness from fuzzy observations in order to reduce the fuzzy estimation error. A mathematical programming model is formulated to determine the fuzzy adjustment term in the proposed fuzzy regression model to minimize the total estimation error based on the distance concept. Unlike existing approaches that only focus on positive coefficients, the problem of negative coefficients in the fuzzy regression model is taken into account and resolved in the solution procedure. Comparisons with previous studies show that the proposed fuzzy regression model has the highest explanatory power based on the total estimation error using various criteria. A real-life dataset is adopted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed two-stage approach in handling a problem with negative coefficients in the fuzzy regression model and a large number of fuzzy observations.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Regression analysis is usually adopted for investigating the relationships between independent (or input, explanatory) and dependent (or output, response) variables using a group of crisp observations in various research and application fields. The least-squares method is often applied to find regression coefficients to minimize the squared errors. In practice, observations are sometimes described in linguistic terms, such as “approximately equal to 100”, due to fuzzy, inexact, or insufficient information. In order to describe such fuzzy data, fuzzy set theory [36] is frequently adopted. Fuzzy regression models are developed to formulate a relationship between input and output variables in a fuzzy environment.Tanaka et al. [30] were the first to propose a linear programming technique for determining fuzzy regression coefficients in the case of fuzzy dependent variables and crisp independent ones. Since then, fuzzy regression has been used by many researchers for applications and the development of methodologies [8,10,11,15,17,22,26,35]. Although Tanaka [28], Tanaka et al. [29], and Tanaka and Watada [31] made some improvements to Tanaka et al.’s [30] original fuzzy regression model, the improved models still suffer some shortcomings, such as over-sensitivity to outliers, as pointed out by Redden and Woodall [23]. Wang and Tsaur [32] stated that Tanaka et al.’s [30] model possibly produces excessively wide ranges of estimation. Furthermore, Kao and Chyu [12,13] showed that fuzzy regression coefficients broaden the spread of estimated responses when the magnitude of the independent variables increases, even though the actual spreads of the observed responses are approximately constant or decreasing. These flaws lessen the explanatory power of the model.To overcome these problems, Kao and Chyu [12] proposed a two-stage procedure for determining the crisp coefficients and fuzzy error terms in fuzzy regression models based on Kim and Bishu’s [14] criterion. They also proposed a least-squares method to derive crisp regression coefficients [13]. Chen and Dang [5] improved Kao and Chyu’s [13] model and achieved better performance in the reduction of the total estimation error based on Kim and Bishu’s [14] criterion. Although several researchers [5,12,14] used Kim and Bishu’s [14] criterion to develop fuzzy regression models, the development of models using this criterion is flawed due to the fact that if the observed and estimated fuzzy responses do not intersect, the estimation error remains constant irrespective of the distance between the observed and estimated responses. In such circumstances, the measure does not reflect the actual difference between the responses. Another drawback commonly found in the literature is that the fuzzy regression model is limited to fuzzy observations with symmetrical triangular fuzzy numbers [7,9,14,20,25,33]. To minimize the distance between the observed and estimated fuzzy responses, Chen and Hsueh [2] considered fuzzy adjustment variables in the fuzzy regression models, and developed a mathematical programming method based on the distance criterion to determine the crisp regression coefficients and fuzzy adjustment variables simultaneously. In addition to dealing with non-symmetrical triangular fuzzy numbers, their approach has several advantages, including an effective reduction of the total estimation error, with the limitation that feasible solutions might not be found when the number of fuzzy observations is large.In most existing approaches, fuzzy regression models are formulated with the assumption that the sign of regression coefficients is positive [2,7,9–13,20,25]. When the relationship of the fuzzy response and a fuzzy (or crisp) independent variable has the opposite change, the formulations may be incorrect based on fuzzy arithmetic. Recently, Bargiela et al. [1] developed an iterative algorithm that employs the gradient-descent optimization technique to determine possible negative coefficients for fuzzy multiple regression models to achieve the minimum sum of squared errors. In their approach, they used defuzzification methods to defuzzify the observed and the predicted fuzzy responses for demonstrating the performance of the proposed fuzzy regression model. Chen and Hsueh [3] proposed a least-squares method to construct fuzzy regression models by minimizing the total estimation error. The concept of correlation coefficients was adopted in their approach to find a possible opposite change between the fuzzy response and a fuzzy (or crisp) independent variable.In the present study, a two-stage approach based on Kao and Chyu’s [12] and Chen and Hsueh’s [2] concepts is proposed to establish fuzzy regression models with crisp coefficients and resolve the problem of negative coefficients. Different from Chen and Hsueh’s [3] approach in which each correlation coefficient between the fuzzy response and a fuzzy (or crisp) independent variable must be calculated separately to find possible negative coefficients and which may require some iterations to determine the coefficients, the proposed approach is efficient. In the proposed approach, the fuzzy observations are first defuzzified into crisp values to calculate the crisp regression coefficients using the classical least-squares method. This stage constructs a defuzzified version of the fuzzy regression model. To incorporate the fuzziness of the input and/or output variables into the model, fuzzy adjustment variables are added into the model in the second stage. With the crisp regression coefficients treated as the known parameters, the fuzzy adjustment variables in the fuzzy regression models are determined using a mathematical program to minimize the total estimation error based on the distance concept. It is noted that the formulations of fuzzy regression models in the mathematical programming should consider the sign of the regression coefficient for each input variable based on the principle of fuzzy arithmetic.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates the fuzzy regression model with the fuzzy adjustment term. The solution approaches, namely the least-squares method and mathematical programming, are described in Section 3. In Section 4, three examples are used to illustrate applications, and the performance of the proposed models is compared with that of existing models. A fourth example is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach to a problem with negative coefficients in the fuzzy regression model. In addition, a real-life dataset is used as a fifth example to demonstrate the ability of the proposed two-stage approach to deal with a large number of observations, where the established fuzzy regression model has negative coefficients. Conclusions are provided in the final section.The traditional regression model is frequently used to express the relationship between the response and one or more explanatory variables. If the observations are fuzzy, the fuzzy regression model is applied to establish the relationship between the fuzzy response and fuzzy input variables. Let(X∼i1,…,X∼ip,Y∼i),i=1,…,n, be n pairs of fuzzy observations, each with a fuzzy response and p fuzzy input variables, which are characterized by membership functionsμỸiandμX̃ij, respectively. In general, for computational efficiency, triangular fuzzy numbers, which are defined as normal and convex sets, are used [36]. The fuzzy number ofX∼ijcan be expressed as a triple element set(Xijl,Xijm,Xiju)with the following membership function:(1)μX̃ij(x)=(x-Xijl)/(Xijm-Xijl),Xijl⩽x⩽Xijm(Xiju-x)/(Xiju-Xijm),Xijm⩽x⩽XijuwhereXijl,Xijm, andXijuare the smallest, most possible, and largest values, respectively,μX̃ij(Xijm)=1, andμX̃ij(Xijl)=μX̃ij(Xiju)=0. Let b0,b1,…,bpdenote the crisp estimates of the regression parameters. Referring to the traditional regression model, the fuzzy regression model can be formulated as:(2)Y∼^i=b0+b1X∼i1+b2X∼i2+⋯+bpX∼ip,i=1,…,nUnlike existing models which have fuzzy regression coefficients [9,14,20,22,25,31,33,35], the regression coefficients in (2) are crisp values, so that the problem of fuzzy responses with wide estimation spreads due to large explanatory variables is avoided. However, if the explanatory variables are crisp, the predicted or estimated responses in (2) are also crisp, leading to a large fuzzy error for a fuzzy response [2]. To deal with this problem, Chen and Hsueh [2] added a fuzzy adjustment termδ̃, which denotes a fuzzy number with the membership functionμδ̃. For generalization, this concept is also adopted in the present study because it effectively resolves the problem. The membership function of a fuzzy adjustment term is a triangular fuzzy number whenX∼ijandY∼iare triangular numbers. Letδ̃represent a triangular fuzzy number with the membership functionδ̃=(δl,δm,δu), which is defined as:(3)μδ̃=(δ-δl)/(δm-δl),δl⩽δ⩽δm(δu-δ)/(δu-δm),δm⩽δ⩽δuThe fuzzy adjustment term,δ̃, is added to (2), so that the proposed fuzzy regression model is formulated as follows:(4)Y∼^i′=b0+b1X∼i1+b2X∼i2+⋯+bpX∼ip+δ̃That is, b0 andδ̃can actually be combined in the formulation. Other than the regression coefficients, the three parameters of the membership functionμδ̃, i.e.,δl,δm, andδu, are regarded as variables to be determined. The coefficients andμδ̃should be determined to maximize the explanatory power ofY∼^i′for the fuzzy responseY∼i.Based on the fuzzy regression model (4), directly determining all coefficients and the three parameters ofμδ̃is difficult, since fuzzy observations represented as fuzzy numbers with membership functions are considered in the model formulation. To overcome this problem, a two-stage approach is used to find the optimal coefficients and parameters. In the first stage, the fuzzy observationsX∼ijandY∼iare defuzzified into crisp values. In fuzzy problems, defuzzification is usually adopted for simplification. Since the fuzzy regression model contains some fuzzy numbers, the problem can be simplified by using a crisp number to represent each fuzzy number. The crisp numbers can then be used to determine the relationship between the corresponding fuzzy numbers and the fuzzy response. Many defuzzification approaches have been developed, among which the centroid method is commonly used in solving fuzzy problems [6,24]. The defuzzified (crisp) values,XijcandYic, with respect toX∼ijandY∼i, respectively, can be determined by applying the centroid method as follows:(5a)Xijc=∫-∞∞xuXij(x)dx∫-∞∞uX̃ij(x)dx=13(Xijl+Xijm+Xiju)(5b)Yic=∫-∞∞yuYi(x)dx∫-∞∞uỸi(x)dx=13(Yil+Yim+Yiu)When the triangular fuzzy numbersX∼ijandY∼iare symmetrical, their centroids are the most likely values, i.e.,XijmandYim. Let X and Y be the matrix of the explanatory variables and the vector of the response variable, respectively, containing defuzzified values. Using the conventional least-squares method, the crisp coefficients of the fuzzy regression model can be obtained using:(6)B=(XTX)-1XTYwhere B is the vector of the estimate of the regression parameter.The use of the conventional least-squares method to determine the crisp coefficients from (6) neglects the fuzziness of fuzzy observations, i.e., fuzzy response and fuzzy input variables. This may cause a large fuzzy error when applying the fuzzy regression model for prediction if the difference in the spreads of the fuzzy response and fuzzy input variables is great. As an extreme case, if the fuzzy input variables degenerate to crisp numbers, considered as special fuzzy numbers, the fuzzy estimation error will be very large. As mentioned previously, the fuzzy adjustment term,δ̃, is included in model (4) to take into account the fuzziness of the problem so as to reduce the possible estimation error. The determination ofδ̃is achieved by finding the three parameters of the membership functionμδ̃, i.e.,δl,δm, andδu, to establish the fuzzy regression model with the minimum total error, which is defined as the difference between the estimated and observed fuzzy responses, i.e.,Y∼^i′andY∼i, respectively, based on the determined crisp regression coefficients. That is, the established fuzzy regression model should maximize the overlaps of membership functions of the estimated and observed fuzzy responses to minimize the differences between them. An optimization approach should be developed to find the optimal solutions. However, it is difficult to directly solve a problem containing more than one fuzzy input variable to determine the optimalδ̃. Since a fuzzy number can be described by a group of its α-cuts [18], fuzzy mathematical problems are commonly solved by using the α-cuts of each fuzzy input and the fuzzy adjustment term to transform the problem into a common numerical problem. The α-cuts of a fuzzy numberF∼can be defined as(F)α={x|μF̃(x)⩾α},α∈[0,1], which is a non-empty bounded closed interval of real numbers and can be denoted as(F)α=[(F)αL,(F)αU], where(F)αLand(F)αUare its lower and upper bounds, respectively. In this paper, the α-cuts ofX∼ij,Y∼i, andδ̃are denoted as(Xij)α=(X⌢ij)αL,(X⌢ij)αU,(Yi)α=(Yi)αL,(Yi)αU, and(δ)α=[(δ)αL,(δ)αU], respectively. In general, a crisp number λ can be considered as a degenerated fuzzy number with constant α-cuts as [λ, λ]. Based on the above descriptions, the arithmetic operations on fuzzy numbers can be performed using their α-cuts. For any two non-negative fuzzy numbers,A∼andB∼, the four basic arithmetic operations are respectively defined as:(7a)(A∼+B∼)α=(A)αL,(A)αU+(B)αL,(B)αU=(A)αL+(B)αL,(A)αU+(B)αU(7b)(A∼-B∼)α=(A)αL,(A)αU-(B)αL,(B)αU=(A)αL-(B)αU,(A)αU-(B)αL(7c)(A∼·B∼)α=(A)αL,(A)αU·(B)αL,(B)αU=(A)αL·(B)αL,(A)αU·(B)αU(7d)(A∼/B∼)α=[(A)αL,(A)αU]/[(B)αL,(B)αU]=[(A)αL/(B)αU,(A)αU/(B)αL],if0∉[(B)αL,(B)αU]The basic arithmetic operations shown above will be applied to build up the fuzzy mathematical problems in terms of α-cuts.In order to use α-cuts to represent the estimated fuzzy response in (4), the lower and upper bounds of the α-cuts ofX∼ijshould match the positive and negative values of coefficientsb1,…,bp, based on the fuzzy arithmetic operations [36]. The following variable substitutions are used: whenbi⩾0,(Xij)αL=(X⌢ij)αLand(Xij)αU=(X⌢ij)αU;whenbi<0,(Xij)αL=(X⌢ij)αUand(Xij)αU=(X⌢ij)αL. Note that the lower and upper bounds of the explanatory variable are swapped when its coefficient is negative. For a particular αklevel, the lower and upper bounds of the estimated fuzzy response in (4) are(Y∼^i′)αkLand(Y∼^i′)αkU, respectively, as obtained using the crisp coefficients determined in the first stage. They can be expressed as:(8a)(Y∼^i′)αkL=b0+b1(Xi1)αkL+b2(Xi2)αkL+⋯+bp(Xip)αkL+(δ)αkLand(8b)(Y∼^i′)αkU=b0+b1(Xi1)αkU+b2(Xi2)αkU+⋯+bp(Xip)αkU+(δ)αkUAs described above, the three parameters of the membership functionμδ̃, i.e.,δl,δm, andδu, should be determined to establish the fuzzy regression model with the minimum total error in the second stage. The total error is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the estimated and observed fuzzy responses for each α-cut in terms of a crisp interval. Fig. 1shows the α-cuts of the estimated and observed fuzzy responses for a particularαklevel. In the figure, the fuzzy error betweenY∼^i′andY∼iat the kth α level is12(Y∼^i′)αkL-(Yi)αkL+(Y∼^i′)αkU-(Yi)αkU, which is actually the average of the distance between the lower bounds and upper bounds of the two fuzzy numbers at the α level on the X axis.For the ith observation, the fuzzy error is the average of12(Y∼^i′)αkL-(Yi)αkL+(Y∼^i′)αkU-(Yi)αkUfor several α levels, since a group of α-cuts can describe a fuzzy number. Let Dibe the average error for the ith observation by m α-cuts, which is formulated as:Di=12m∑k=1m(Y∼^i′)αkL-(Yi)αkL+(Y∼^i′)αkU-(Yi)αkUThe above expression is called the Hamming distance in distance measures [36]. The measure Diis equivalent to the absolute difference of two real numbers if both the estimated and observed fuzzy numbers degenerate into crisp ones. The total fuzzy error for all fuzzy observations is∑iDi, which can be expressed as:(9)∑i=1nDi=∑i=1n12m∑k=1m(Y∼^i′)αkL-(Yi)αkL+(Y∼^i′)αkU-(Yi)αkUand the minimum total error is a function of the estimatesδl,δm, andδuin the model formulation in the second stage. Therefore, considering∑iDias the objective function and then minimizing it, the minimum fuzzy error can be achieved. Theoretically, better estimates can be obtained when more α-cuts are applied. However, only a few α-cuts are required to characterize a fuzzy number when the membership functions of fuzzy numbers are triangular, as suggested by Chen and Lu [4].In order to determine the parameters of the fuzzy adjustment term,δl,δm, andδu, that achieve the best explanation for the fuzzy regression model, the following mathematical programming problem, considering∑iDias the objective function, is formulated:(10)Min∑i=1n12m∑k=1m(Y∼^i′)αkL-(Yi)αkL+(Y∼^i′)αkU-(Yi)αkUs.t.(Y∼^i′)αkL=b0+b1(Xi1)αkL+b2(Xi2)αkL+⋯+bp(Xip)αkL+(δ)αkL(Y∼^i′)αkU=b0+b1(Xi1)αkU+b2(Xi2)αkU+⋯+bp(Xip)αkU+(δ)αkUi=1,…,n;k=1,…,mThis minimization problem is a constrained nonlinear problem, which can be solved by employing general commercial software packages. Applying (10), the optimal solutions can possibly be δl>0 and δu<0, i.e., the negative spread with respect toδm, for some particular problems, such as Example 3 in Section 4 of this paper, because the fuzzy adjustment term in (10) is used to help the solution approaches achieve the minimum total error. Therefore, the representation of +(δl,δm,δu) was changed to-(-δl,-δm,-δu)in the fuzzy regression model; however, the minus sign (−) before the fuzzy adjustment term is not treated as a fuzzy subtraction operator in the model because the three variables in the fuzzy adjustment term are designed to minimize the corresponding distance error in the solution approaches. In this case, the calculation of the estimated fuzzy response using the fuzzy regression model does not swap-δland-δu, as the operation is in fuzzy arithmetic. To prevent confusion, the symbol “−” before the fuzzy adjustment term is denoted as “−ˆ”, as expressed in (27) in the next section.From the solution approaches described above, some important points in the process of building fuzzy regression models are summarized below. To begin with, the crisp regression coefficients are determined in the first stage using the classical least-squares method so that the best-fitting regression model without considering fuzziness is obtained. The crisp regression coefficients represent the trend in scale between fuzzy response and fuzzy input variables. To include the fuzziness of the input and/or output variables into the model, the fuzzy adjustment termδ̃is added into the model in the second stage, whereδ̃can increase the explanatory power of the established fuzzy regression model. To find the optimalδ̃, a mathematical program is formulated to determine the three parameters ofδ̃by minimizing the total estimation error based on the distance concept, ensuring that the maximum overlaps of membership functions of the estimated and observed fuzzy responses can be achieved. By employing the proposed two-stage approach, a fuzzy regression model that considers both the crisp relationship (the trend) and the fuzziness between the fuzzy response and fuzzy input variables is formulated. In addition, although the solution approach has two stages, the application is easy and the computations are efficient, since the least-squares method and the mathematical program can be solved by employing general commercial software packages.This section presents five examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model. The first two examples were adopted from Tanaka et al. [29] and Sakawa and Yano [25], respectively, which are widely used for comparing the explanatory power of various fuzzy linear regression models. Only one input variable is considered in these examples. The third example, cited from Wu [34], contains two input variables. As mentioned before, few studies have considered negative coefficients in fuzzy regression models, and thus a fourth example that uses negative coefficients is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed fuzzy regression model. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed solution approach to real-life data, a fifth example that contains 506 observations from a dataset is adopted. Two α-cuts, α=0 and 1, are adopted to build up the fuzzy regression model for the five examples using the proposed approach, since triangular fuzzy numbers are used to characterize the fuzzy observations in all examples.To compare the performance of the proposed fuzzy regression model with that of existing models, a measure is needed to serve as the basis for evaluation and comparison. In the present paper, the proposed fuzzy regression model is established for minimizing the total error∑iDibased on the distances between the observed and estimated fuzzy responses. The lower∑iDiis, the better the performance. A measure proposed by Kim and Bishu [14] for calculating the difference between the membership functions of the observed and estimated fuzzy responses has been adopted by a number of researchers [2,5,9,12,15,20]. The measure for the ith observation can be calculated as follows:(11)ϕi=∫SỸi∪SỸˆi|μỸi(y)-μỸˆi(y)|dywhereμỸi(y)andμỸˆi(y)represent the membership functions of the observed and estimated responses, respectively;SỸiandSỸˆirepresent the supports ofμỸi(y)andμỸˆi(y), respectively; andϕidenotes the error in estimation. LetY∼^i=(Y^il,Y^im,Y^iu)andY∼i=(Yil,Yim,Yiu)be the estimated and observed fuzzy responses, respectively. Fig. 2shows the error in the estimation ofϕias the shaded area betweenY∼^iandY∼i. The explanatory power of the fuzzy regression model increases with decreasing total error∑ϕi. This measure considers the non-overlapping areas of the observed and estimated responses as the error; however, if the two responses do not intersect each other, the measure ofϕiremains constant, no matter where the two responses are. For comparing the performance with existing models, two measures, i.e.,∑iDiand∑ϕi, are used for the first three examples, since the two measures are different in nature.Example 1This example, designed by Tanaka et al. [29], contains five observations consisting of one fuzzy response and one crisp input variable. Several scholars, such as Kim and Bishu [14], Kao and Chyu [12,13], and Nasrabadi and Nasrabadi [20], also used this example to demonstrate the performance of their respective models. The five pairs of observations are represented as [xi,ỹi], whereỹiis a symmetrical triangular fuzzy number denoted by (yil, yim, yiu), as shown in the second column of Table 1. By defuzzifying the fuzzy numbers via (5b) and then applying the classical least-squares method, the regression coefficients can be derived as b0=4.95 and b1=1.71, which are crisp and exactly the same as those obtained in Kao and Chyu [13]. The mathematical program (10) is then solved; the estimates of the adjustment term parameters δl, δm, and δuare found to be −2.90, −0.44, and 2.02, respectively. Therefore, the fuzzy linear regression model (TW) is built up using the proposed approach as:(12)Y∼^TW′=4.95+1.71X+(-2.90,-0.44,2.02)The associated fuzzy regression models for this set of observations have been established by several scholars, such as Tanaka et al. (THW) [29], Kim and Bishu (KB) [14], Diamond (DM) [7], Nasrabadi and Nasrabadi (NN) [20], Wu and Tseng (WT) [33], Hojati et al. (HBS) [9], and Kao and Chyu (KC) [13], where the model name is shown in parentheses. The derived fuzzy linear regression models are:(13)Y∼^THW=(0,3.85,7.7)+2.1X(14)Y∼^KB=(3.11,4.95,6.84)+(1.55,1.71,1.82)X(15)Y∼^DM=(3.11,4.95,6.79)+(1.55,1.71,1.87)X(16)Y∼^NN=(2.36,4.68,7)+1.73X(17)Y∼^WT=(3.11,4.95,6.79)+(1.55,1.71,1.87)X(18)Y∼^HBS=(5.1,6.75,8.4)+(1.1,1.25,1.4)X(19)Y∼^KC=4.81+1.72X+(-2.2,0.12,2.44)It should be noted that regression models THW and HBS were derived using only the α-cut at α=0, whereas regression model NN was established using α=0.6147. According to Wu and Tseng’s approach [33], if the explanatory variables are crisp values and the dependent variables are symmetric fuzzy numbers, the fuzzy regression model (WT) will be the same as the model (DM) obtained using Diamond’s approach [7]. It is easy to find that (15) and (17) are identical in this example.To compare the performances of the above models, the absolute difference Dibased on two α-cuts, i.e., α=0 and 1, and Kim and Bishu’s criterion were applied to calculate the error in estimating fuzzy responses, as shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The total estimation errors of the proposed approach (TW) were 5.660 for absolute difference and 9.102 for Kim and Bishu’s criterion.Example 2Consider the example designed by Sakawa and Yano [25]. All observations for the independent and response variables are symmetrical triangular fuzzy numbers, as shown in the second column of Table 3. By defuzzifying these two fuzzy numbers via (5a) and (5b), the crisp coefficients can be obtained by applying the conventional least-squares method. Employing the mathematical programming model (10), the fuzzy regression model (TW) is established using the proposed method as:(20)Y∼^TW′=3.572+0.519X∼+(-0.800,-0.319,0.162)In Sakawa and Yano’s [25] approach, the value representing the degree of conformity between the estimated and observed responses must be pre-specified. As suggested by Kao and Chyu [13], the value of α=0.5 was adopted for comparison. The model is built up as:(21)Y∼^SY=(3.031,3.201,3.371)+(0.498,0.579,0.659)X∼Other researchers also used this example to illustrate the effectiveness of their approaches, such as Diamond (DM) [7], Nasrabadi and Nasrabadi (NN) [20], and Kao and Chyu (KC) [13], Wu and Tseng (WT) [33], and Hojati et al. (HBS) [9]. Their fuzzy regression models are formulated as:(22)Y∼^DM=(3.263,3.563,3.863)+0.521X∼(23)Y∼^NN=3.577+(0.447,0.547,0.647)X∼(24)Y∼^KC=3.565+0.522X∼+(-0.962,-0.011,0.938)(25)Y∼^WT=(3.286,3.569,3.851)+(0.517,0.52,0.522)X∼(26)Y∼^HBS=(3,3.41,3.82)+(0.5,0.52,0.54)X∼Based on the two criteria, Tables 3 and 4list the error of each observation and the total error in estimation for the above models. The two tables show that the performance of the proposed model (TW) is satisfactory in terms of total estimation error.Example 3This example has 15 pairs of fuzzy observations with two input variables and one response [34]. Asymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers are used to characterize the input variables and response, as listed in Table 5. Applying the proposed methods, the multiple fuzzy regression model is formulated as:(27)Y∼^TW′=3.453+0.496X∼1+0.009X∼2−ˆ(-10.628,-0.325,15.770)For comparisons of the explanatory power of the established fuzzy regression model with those of existing models, two error measures, i.e.,∑Diand∑ϕi, are adopted in this paper. The proposed two-stage approach is formulated to minimize the total absolute distance (∑Di) between the observed and estimated fuzzy responses using several α-cuts. In contrast to the concept of distance, the measure∑ϕiassesses the non-overlapping areas between the observed and estimated fuzzy responses. Compared with existing models, the established fuzzy regression models for the three examples have almost the best explanatory power based on the measure∑Di, since it is minimized by the proposed two-stage approach. In addition, the same results are achieved based on the measure∑ϕi, which was used as the target to be minimized by several models, namely HBS, KC, KB, and NN, in the comparisons [9,13,14,20].From the formulations,∑Diis determined using several α-cuts so that it is actually an approximate measure. More α-cuts should produce more accurate results. For demonstration purposes, the total estimation errors in terms of∑Difor the third example are explored based on various numbers of α-cuts, where, for m α-cuts, the kth level is determined asαk=k/(m-1), k=0,1,…,m−1. Fig. 3shows that the total estimation errors gradually converge when the number of α-cuts increases. With increasing number of α-cuts, the change of the total estimation errors for the two models in the trend seems the same as in the figure. This shows that only a few α-cuts are necessary to evaluate a fuzzy regression model when the membership functions of fuzzy numbers are triangular. In addition, as mentioned before, fuzzy regression coefficients could broaden the spread of estimated responses when the magnitude of the independent variables increases. In extreme cases, for the eighth fuzzy observations with a fuzzy input variable (12.0, 12.5, 13.0) and a fuzzy response (9.0, 9.5, 10.0) in the second example, the resulting estimated fuzzy responses and spreads from models TW, SY, and NN are [(9.120, 9.865, 10.611); 1.491], [(9.007, 10.438, 11.938); 2.931], and [(8.941, 10.414, 11.988); 3.047], respectively. This shows that the spreads of the estimated responses from models SY and NN become fuzzier than those from model TW and the observed fuzzy response.Example 4This example is designed to demonstrate the proposed solution procedure for the fuzzy regression analysis with negative trends between the fuzzy explanatory variable and fuzzy response. Twenty sets of observations with four fuzzy input variables and one fuzzy response are considered. All the variables are asymmetrical triangular fuzzy numbers. Applying the defuzzification process and the least-squares method, the coefficients of two input variables, namelyX∼2andX∼3, are determined to be negative. Based on the fuzzy arithmetic operations, the swapping process is performed for the lower and upper bounds of the α-cuts of these two input variables. After solving the mathematical programming model, the multiple fuzzy regression model is built up as:(29)Y∼^TW′=-13.134+0.995X∼1-0.051X∼2-0.115X∼3+0.118X∼4+(-2.248,0.773,3.024)This example adopts the Boston Housing dataset from the machine learning repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing.html) to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed solution approach to real-life data. This dataset contains 506 numerical observations with 13 continuous and 1 binary-valued variables. For this demonstration, the binary-valued variable (the fourth one in the dataset) is removed since this study mainly deals with fuzzy-type data. Among the 13 variables, the twelfth variable in the dataset is considered as the response variable, with the remaining 12 variables indexed asX1,…,X12, based on the sequence in the dataset. Examining the attributes in the dataset, some variables are obviously different in magnitude. Under such conditions, to minimize rounding errors in computations and avoid the lack of comparability in regression coefficients, all variables including the response are standardized beforehand using [21]:(30)Xik∗=1n-1Xik-X¯kskfor the kth variable in the ith observation, whereX¯kand skare the mean and the standard deviations of Xik, respectively. Then, considering the accuracy of measurements in observations, all standardized variables are fuzzified using:(31)X∼ik∗=(Xik∗(1-α),Xik∗,Xik∗·(1+β)),ifXik∗⩾0(Xik∗·(1+β),Xik∗,Xik∗·(1-α)),ifXik∗<0where α and β are determined randomly from the interval [0,0.2]. Note that the fuzzified variable could be an asymmetrical triangular fuzzy number.Using the fuzzy data in the proposed two-stage approach, the standardized fuzzy regression model is formulated as:(32)Y∼^TW′∗=-0.114X∼1∗-0.016X∼2∗-0.054X∼3∗-0.059X∼4∗-0.203X∼5∗+0.091X∼6∗+0.053X∼7∗-0.240X∼8∗-0.015X∼9∗+0.096X∼10∗-0.121X∼11∗+0.274X∼12∗−^(-0.0045,-0.0031,-0.0019)with the absolute difference (∑Di) of 11.0589. Note that there is no intercept term in the standardized regression model [21]. The above fuzzy regression model, similar to model (29) in the previous example, has several negative coefficients. In addition, to further investigate the performance of the proposed approach in this dataset, two- and fivefold cross validations are made using the fuzzified dataset. The results in terms of absolute difference are shown in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. Table 7 indicates that the absolute difference is large when the second half (254–506th) of observations are included in the training or testing data. Examining the original dataset, several particular response values, which are much smaller than the others, are found after the 405th observation, increasing the total estimation error (∑Di) in terms of absolute difference no matter what the training or testing model is. However,∑Divalues of the two runs in Table 7 are consistent, depending on whether those particular response values are involved. The above conditions also are demonstrated by the fivefold cross validation, as shown in Table 8. This shows that the established fuzzy regression model is applicable to real-life data with the proposed two-stage approach.In practice, the investigation of relationship between several explanatory and response variables is usually made for various purposes. Among them, forecasting the future trend of a specified object is often found in diverse applications. Due to the uncertainty and complexity of the system, knowledge-based technologies are usually developed to achieve more accurate predictions. Predictions for bankruptcy [19], tourism demand [27], and stock prices [16] are some examples. As demonstrated above, the proposed two-stage approach can be effectively applied to establish fuzzy regression models using real-life data. For real applications with fuzzy, inexact, or insufficient information in an uncertain environment, the proposed approach can be implemented to construct fuzzy regression models for specified purposes, such as for prediction problems.This paper proposed a two-stage approach to establish fuzzy regression models. To simplify the model-building processes, the fuzzy observations are first defuzzified into crisp numbers. The conventional least-squares method is then employed to determine the crisp regression coefficients, representing the trend in scale between fuzzy response and fuzzy input variables. However, the fuzziness of fuzzy observations is neglected in the defuzzification process. To incorporate the fuzziness into the model so as to reduce the fuzzy estimation error, a fuzzy adjustment term is included in the fuzzy regression model. The second stage of the proposed approach uses a mathematical programming model to determine the variables included in the fuzzy adjustment term in order to minimize total estimation error in terms of the absolute distance. The proposed two-stage approach is simple, since the conventional least-squares method and the mathematical programming model are used based on only a few α-cuts. The crisp regression coefficients avoid the possible fuzzy estimation error due to the larger magnitude of the input variables, as mentioned in the literature [12,13]. In addition, the crisp regression coefficients can be used to examine whether there is a negative trend between the fuzzy explanatory variable and fuzzy response, so that a more accurate model can be established.From comparisons using three examples with existing models, the performance of the proposed two-stage approach is satisfactory in terms of the distance and the area measures, where some models were constructed based on the latter. The proposed two-stage approach was applied to negative regression coefficients in a fourth example. In addition, to demonstrate applicability to real-life data, a fifth example that contains 506 observations from a dataset was adopted. Via two- and fivefold cross validations, the proposed two-stage approach showed satisfactory performance.
