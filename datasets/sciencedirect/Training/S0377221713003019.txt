@&#ABSTRACT@&#
It is well observed that individual behaviour can have an effect on the efficiency of queueing systems. The impact of this behaviour on the economic efficiency of public services is considered in this paper where we present results concerning the congestion related implications of decisions made by individuals when choosing between facilities. The work presented has important managerial implications at a public policy level when considering the effect of allowing individuals to choose between providers. We show that in general the introduction of choice in an already inefficient system will not have a negative effect. Introducing choice in a system that copes with demand will have a negative effect.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
What damage do the selfish choices of some afflict onto the welfare of all? The work presented in this paper answers this question in the context of public service systems.There is a substantial quantity of literature on the subject of equilibrium behaviour of a queueing system where congestion is a factor influencing behaviour [1,5,12,23,31,35,51]. This can be traced back to a series of short communications between Leeman [28,29] and Saaty [44]. This paper builds on this literature by considering the problem of public service systems. For most public services, congestion is a negative aspect of service quality. Examples of this are healthcare systems (waiting lists), transports systems (traffic jams) and/or schools (overcrowding of class rooms).The degree of central control that should be exercised is a very important question to be considered by governments and/or policy makers. What is the effect of allowing individuals to choose service provider?Of course, the motivation for the introduction of choice is to create competition in the hope that this would improve overall service quality (an economic evaluation of this point of view can be found in [40]). The aim of the work presented here is to use a game theoretical approach to quantify the effect of removing central control for a given system. For example, consider a situation where the particular providers of a system might have optimised their service delivery (perhaps due to competition). In this system if we were to start routing individuals so as to optimise overall quality of service, we would (by definition) notice an improvement over a situation where individuals had choice. This impact of choice is the one considered here. The approach proposed is based on a measure called the price of anarchy[2,7,8,10,14,18–20,34,41–43,47,52]. First introduced in [25] (a conference paper that has been reprinted in [26]), the price of anarchy is the ratio of the costs of the worst possible Nash equilibrium and the social optimum, and can therefore be interpreted as a measure of the efficiency of a system.The main contributions of this paper are as follows:•A novel connection is made: placing choice between public services within the formulation of routing games.Theoretical results are obtained as to the effect of demand and worth of service.It is shown that in a public service system with an adequate capacity to provide the perceived worth of service, a high price of anarchy is to be expected.A numerical approach based on heuristics is proposed to calculate the price of anarchy in a real world setting.The above ideas are demonstrated with a large scale real world case study.The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 will give a brief overview of routing games; Section 3 will interpret choice of public services as a routing game; Section 4 will study a particular model that gives an insightful conclusion as to efficiency of general public service providers under choice; Section 5 looks at an application using hospital performance data for elective knee replacement surgery in Wales; Section 6 makes concluding remarks.This section gives a brief introduction to routing games following very closely [37]. For a thorough overview of routing games the reader is encouraged to view [37,42].A non-atomic routing game (atomic routing games will not be considered in this work), is defined on a network G=(V,E), with vertex set V and edge set E, as well as a set of source-sink pairs: {(s1,t1), (s2,t2),…,(sk,tk)}. These pairs are called commodities. The set of all possible (si,ti) paths (for i∈[k]) is denoted asPi. Thus,Pidenotes the set of all the possible routes that player i may take to get from source sito sink ti. Only networks withPi≠∅foralli∈[k]are considered andP=⋃i∈[k]Pi. The graph G is allowed to have multiple edges and a vertex can participate in multiple source-sink pairs.The routes taken by traffic are called flows, wheref∈R⩾0|P|denotes a particular flow and fPis interpreted as the quantity of traffic of commodity i choosing path P forP∈Pi. A flow f is called feasible forr∈R⩾0kif and only if∑P∈PifP=rifor all i∈[k]. Thus, the vector r denotes a prescribed quantity of traffic that must travel from sources to sinks.What is now needed is some way of differentiating the various paths (indeed some paths may be better than others). Each edge e∈E of G has a cost functionce:R⩾0→R⩾0and it is assumed that ceis non-negative, continuous, convex and non-decreasing. Using this, one can quantify the efficiency of a flow f; we define the cost of a flow C(f):C(f)≔∑P∈PcP(f)fpwhere cP(f) naturally denotes the cost incurred by the traffic choosing path P. A routing game is then defined by the triple (G,r,c).Importantly this cost function takes into account the quantity travelling through a particular path. It is immediate to give an equivalent definition:(1)C(f)≔∑e∈Ece(f)fewhere fecorresponds to the quantity of traffic using edge e.Using this we give the following definitions:Definition 2.1For the routing game (G,r,c), the flow f∗ is an optimal flow if and only if f∗ minimises C (as given by (1)) over all feasible flows f.The next definition corresponds to an absence of central control. Note that the term “Wardrop equilibrium” [48] is also used however we choose to use the term “Nash flow” in line with [42].Definition 2.2For the routing game (G,r,c), the flowf̃is a Nash flow if and only if for every commodity i∈[k] and every pair of paths P1, P2 withf̃P1>0we have:cP1(f̃)⩽cP2(f̃)Thus,f̃is a Nash flow if and only if all used paths have minimum possible cost. This ensures that no user can improve their situation. We now state (without proof) two very powerful results obtained in [4].Theorem 2.3The flow f∗is an optimal flow for (G,r,c) if and only if f∗is a Nash flow for the instance (G,r,c∗) where:(2)ce∗(x)=ddxxce(x)=ce(x)+xddxce(x)The costce∗(x)is called the marginal cost for e. This powerful result shows that mathematically, Nash flows and optimal flows are analogous. The next result simply confirms this.Theorem 2.4The flowf̃is a Nash flow for (G,r,c) if and only iff̃minimises Φ where:(3)Φ(f)=∑e∈E∫0fece(x)dxThe function Φ is called the potential function for (G,r,c). As stated we give these results without proof but encourage the reader to see [37,42].The object of the work in this paper is to present a measure of the efficiency of a system, the measure we shall use is given by the following definition.Definition 2.5For the routing game (G,r,c), the price of anarchy denoted by PoA(G,r,c) is given by:PoA(G,r,c)=C(f̃)C(f∗)Note that the definition taken here differs slightly to the common definition taken as the worst case ratio. The price of anarchy quantifies the inefficiency created by choice. We illustrate these ideas through a famous example, known as, Pigou’s example [39].The network of Fig. 1corresponds to the routing game, where traffic has a choice of two paths to reach the sink. The upper arc corresponds to a large highway and the travel time is independent (say 1hour) of the quantity of traffic using that highway. The lower arc corresponds to a much smaller road, that is heavily affected by congestion and the time spent on this road is equivalent to the proportion of traffic that uses it. It is immediate to note that the Nash flow of this game is given byf̃=(0,1), since all traffic will go along the smaller road (thus incurring an hour of travel time), in the hope that at least a small quantity of traffic will use the larger road. The cost function for this game is:C(f1,f2)=C(1-x,x)=1-x+x2thus, the optimal flow isf∗=12,12. It is then straightforward to calculate the price of anarchy:PoA(G,r,c)=43.Note that the potential function for this game is:Φ(f1,f2)=Φ(1-x,x)=∫01-x1dx+∫0xxdx=1-x+x22minimising Φ givesf̃=(0,1)as required. For this simple game, calculating the Nash flow does not require using the potential function. However, optimising Φ gives an algorithmic approach. This will be the method used when calculating the price of anarchy for large systems.In the next section we show how these ideas will be used to measure the efficiency of a public service system.When choosing amongst public service systems it is reasonable to assume that individuals take into account three aspects: reputation, distance and congestion. As will become clear, our game theoretical model will take these factors into account.The first of these is a subjective aspect that could depend on individual satisfaction, word of mouth, and/or an official rating. It is accepted that reputation itself is dependent on the sequences of the various service centre visits, however the way in which the opinion of a particular individual diffuses through its social network will not be considered in this work. As such we assume that reputation is a constant parameter. This is in line with the previous mentioned idea of modelling choice for a given system (without letting competition play a role). Travel distances, although (arguably) subject to individual perception are also to be assumed constant (i.e. do not vary with the decisions made by individuals). Finally, congestion is an extremely dynamic factor that depends on the choices of individuals in the system. This is what justifies using a game theoretical approach. The model we propose takes these three factors into account in a linear way to create a non-atomic routing game. We allow for multiple demand and service nodes. Each demand node will have a unique demand rate whilst each service node will offer a different level of attractiveness (potentially based on reputation, congestion and expected length of stay). The pairing of these nodes is heterogeneous in nature due to travel distances.In particular let m and n be the number of demand and service nodes respectively. We have a distance matrixd∈R⩾0m×n, where dijdenotes the distances between demand node i and service node j. Every demand node has attributed to it a demand rate Λifor all i∈[m]. This demand rate is to be measured in procedures per unit time. Every service node has attributed to it a cost functionwj:R⩾0→R⩾0with arguments corresponding to the arrival rate at that node. We assume that wjis a continuous, non-negative, convex and non-decreasing function. This assumption is not a restrictive one. Non-negativity is a question of scale, and the non-decreasing constraint simply implies that facilities become less attractive with increased congestion. It can be argued that facilities with high volumes of a particular service deliver better quality but how facilities respond to high volumes corresponds to the modelling of competition that arises as a product of choice and is not the purpose of this work.Finally one last input to our model is a reward for serviceβi∈R⩾0as considered in [1,5,23,35,51,30]. By indexing the vector β by demand nodes the model we propose allows a partitioning of the population not only by geography but also by gender, morbidity and/or economic status which are all factors that will influence the choices of individuals [11,24,33]. The important modification to be made here is in the interpretation of βi. As mentioned in Section 2, to allow for this situation to be considered as a routing game one needs all latency functions to be non-negative. For this reason we call βia cost of balking as opposed to a reward for service. There are two immediate interpretations that can be given to βi:•Individuals experiencing a dissatisfaction as a result of deciding that none of the options were of high enough quality (i.e. low enough cost).Individuals opting to seek service through a private provider at a particular financial cost.Through careful partitioning of the population we can ensure endogeneity of individual welfare. For example in a healthcare setting, some patients would be willing to wait longer than others and/or be able to afford private care based on their socio-economic status. Furthermore, the actual interpretation of β for particular population partitions could be a mixture of the above two given. In Section 5 we will show an example highlighting how welfare can be considered in an endogeneous way.Note that these interpretations of βilend themselves well to considerations of public service systems, where equality is often as important as efficiency [32]. For example, in countries with public health systems such as the UK a series of waiting time targets are often imposed which may prove insightful when seeking to parametrize β.The decision variables are the λij; the arrival rate from demand node i to service node j. The balking rate from node i is:Λi-∑j=1nλij. Fig. 2gives a pictorial representation of the general system.This can be interpreted in the form of a routing game with the latencies of each edge given, as shown in Fig. 3.Note that the sources of the routing game of Fig. 3 correspond to the demand nodes, however there is only one sink. This sink corresponds to the state of “having made a choice”. The choice options in question correspond to the various paths. All commodities have n+1 possible paths, corresponding to the n service nodes as well as the balking option. From (1) and (3) we have the cost function and potential function given by:(4)C(λ)=∑i=1mαi∑jndijλij+∑j=1n∑i=1mλijwj∑i=1mλij+∑i=1mβiΛi-∑j=1nλijand:(5)Φ(λ)=∑i=1mαi∑jndijλij+∑j=1n∫0∑i=1mλijwj(x)dx+∑i=1mβiΛi-∑j=1nλijThe constantαi∈R⩾0is simply a weighting statistic for the relative importance of travel distances to the other factors (once again allowing for this coefficient to be dependent on population partitioning). Using this formulation of choice we obtain insights into the asymptotic behaviour of the price of anarchy. The first considers the sensitivity to the value of service:Theorem 3.1Assuming constant Λ we have:limβi→∞PoA(β)<∞foralli∈[m]The price of anarchy increases with worth of service, up to a point.ProofRecalling Definition 2.5 we have:PoA=PoA(β)=C(λ∗)C(λ̃)=C(λ∗(β))C(λ̃(β))Importantly we also have:(6)limβi→∞λ∗(β)=k∗andk∗∈R⩾0m×n. Indeed, as βiincreases, the arrival rate from demand node i increases until the value of service is large enough such that there are no more balkers. Similarly:(7)limβi→∞λ̃(β)=k̃Thus we have:(8)limβi→∞∑i′=1m∑j=1nλi′j∗-Λi′=limβi→∞∑i′=1m∑j=1nλ̃i′j-Λi′=0Recalling (4) we have:PoA(β)=∑i=1mαi∑jndijλij∗+∑j=1n∑i=1mλij∗wj∑i=1mλij∗+∑i=1mβiΛi-∑j=1nλij∗α∑jn∑i=1mdijλ̃ij+∑j=1n∑i=1mλ̃ijwj∑i=1mλ̃ij+β∑i=1mΛi-∑j=1nλ̃ijRecalling (6)–(8) we get:(9)limβi→∞PoA(β)=∑i=1mαi∑jndijkij∗+∑j=1n∑i=1mkij∗wj∑i=1mkij∗∑i=1mαi∑jndijk̃ij+∑j=1n∑i=1mk̃ijwj∑i=1mk̃ij<∞□Note (as demonstrated by the proof) that the case of a high value of βicorresponds to a model with no balking allowed for agents from demand node i. A particular case of the general model presented here was studied in [5,20] where homogeneous agents (from a single demand node) are presented with a choice of multiple M/M/1 facilities with no option of balking. Setting m=1, α1=0 and lettingwj(x)=1μ1-xin (9) gives an equivalent consideration. In [20] it is in fact shown that such an expression is bounded by n (the number of servers as M/M/1 queues are considered). In these two papers, geographic location of demand is however not taken into account and so congestion is the only factor dictating choice, indeed congestion at a facility might be dependent on its geographical proximity to demand. Note also that multiple server queues are not considered in [5,20].Whilst (9) gives an upper bound for the price of anarchy for the particular instance considered, whether or not a more general upper bound (as found in [20]) can be obtained for the more general model we have presented is an interesting research question.The following result considers the effect of demand on the price of anarchy.Theorem 3.2Assuming constantβ∈R⩾0mwe have:limΛi→∞PoA(Λ)=1In a system with insufficient capacity the price of anarchy is low.ProofWe have:(10)limΛi→∞λ∗(Λ)=l∗for somel∗∈R⩾0m×n. Indeed, as demand increases, each facility has an upper bound for it’s total arrival rate after which, due to βiit becomes more advantageous for agents to balk. Similarly(11)limΛi→∞λ̃(Λ)=l̃for somel̃∈R⩾0m×n. We can write the expression for the PoA as:PoA(β)=1Λi∑i′=1mαi′∑jndi′jλi′j∗+∑j=1n∑i′=1mλi′j∗wj∑i′=1mλi′j∗+∑i′=1i′≠imβi′Λi′-∑j=1nλi′j∗-λij∗+βi1Λi∑i′=1mαi′∑jndi′jλ̃i′j+∑j=1n∑i′=1mλ̃i′jwj∑i′=1mλ̃i′j+∑i′=1i′≠imβi′Λi′-∑j=1nλ̃i′j-λ̃ij+βiforalli∈[m]and so (recalling (10) and (11)) taking Λi→∞ gives the required result.□This shows that for a bad system, i.e. a system that is unable to cope with the total demand, the removal of central control does not create large levels of inefficiency. The fact that the price of anarchy is low when the congestion in the system grows is a phenomenon identified in [10]. Theorem 3.2 seems to indicate that there is a tipping point at which the price of anarchy starts to decrease and tends to one. In Section 4 we will give a result that identifies this tipping point for a particular case and observe it empirically in Section 5.Note that Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, correspond to the work presented in [20,41–43] in which bounds are obtained for all possible instances. The results we have obtained are concerned with specific instances corresponding to choice in public service systems. This allows us to obtain specific insights as to the effect of demand and worth of service. In the next section we consider a particular case of the routing game model which corresponds to a general case of public service systems.Consider the simplest situation of Fig. 3 i.e. a single source and a single facility. The options offered to individuals are thus to seek service or to balk. This is illustrated in Fig. 4:This scenario, which could arise with a single population and a single service centre does not necessitate the inclusion of distance which can be taken into account when setting a value of β and as such we assume α=0 (note that for simplicity of notation we suppress the indices i and j). Importantly this simple model can be used to model behaviour at a much higher level at which individuals are not choosing to use a particular facility but are at a national level choosing whether or not to use the public system. Individuals have the choice between balking and a freely provided service that becomes less attractive as congestion increases. Recalling (4) and (5), we have:(12)PoA(Λ)=λ̃w(λ̃)+β(Λ-λ̃)λ∗w(λ∗)+β(Λ-λ∗)We give the following result that identifies the tipping point discussed after the proof of Theorem 3.2.Theorem 4.1Assuming the particular model ofFig. 4we have:supΛ⩾0PoA(Λ)=PoA(x̃)wherex̃is the solution of w(x)=β.Choice causes the highest level of inefficiency when the capacity of the system matches the perceived worth of service.ProofIt is immediate to note that whenΛ>x̃we haveλ̃=x̃, as when demand is sufficiently high for the congestion to imply a cost of facility equal to β, then all extra demand will result in balkers. Similarly we have for Λ>x∗,λ∗=x∗ where x∗ is a solution of w∗(x)=β (recalling (2) and Theorem 2.3).Note that we also have due to the non-decreasing and convexity properties of w: w(x)<w∗(x) for all x>0 which impliesx∗<x̃as illustrated by Fig. 5.We now consider (12) over the three intervals:[0,x∗[,[x∗,x̃[,[x̃,∞[.•For Λ⩽x∗ we haveλ̃=λ∗=Λso that:(13)PoA(Λ)=1forΛ⩽x∗Forx∗<Λ⩽x̃, recalling (12) we now consider the derivative of PoA(Λ):(14)∂PoA∂Λ=∂∂ΛΛw(Λ)x∗w(x∗)+β(Λ-x∗)=w∗(Λ)(x∗w(x∗)+β(Λ-x∗))-Λw(Λ)β(x∗w(x∗)+β(Λ-x∗))2Evaluating the sign of (14) is not straightforward however recalling that PoA(Λ)⩾1 (by definition) and (13) it is sufficient to show that the sign of (14) does not change overx∗<Λ⩽x̃to imply:∂PoA∂Λ>0forx∗<Λ⩽x̃The derivative of the numerator of (14) is given by:(15)∂∂Λ(w∗(Λ)(x∗w(x∗)+β(Λ-x∗))-Λw(Λ)β)=∂w∗(Λ)∂Λ(x∗w(x∗)+β(Λ-x∗))and as Λ>x∗ and∂w∗(Λ)∂Λ>0this implies as required that PoA(Λ) increases forx∗<Λ⩽x̃.ForΛ>x̃, we have:(16)∂PoA∂Λ=∂∂ΛβΛx∗w(x∗)+β(Λ-x∗)=βx∗(w(x∗)-β)(x∗w(x∗)+β(Λ-x∗))2However as shown in Fig. 5, w(x∗)<β, which completes the proof as summarised by Fig. 6.□Theorem 4.1 is a re-statement of the more general theorem of [10,41] which states that the worst case instance of a price of anarchy is given in a Pigou network (as in Fig. 4) with one arc having latency w(x) and the other by w(Λ). Here we have restated the result placing it in the specific case corresponding to choice between using a public service or not. We specifically answer the question as to what demand causes the highest level of inefficiency. This result is insightful as it shows that the worst case equilibria is at a point at which the demand saturates the service to the point of worth of service. Recalling Theorem 3.2, we see that a system with a very high level of demand has a low price of anarchy (a fact noted in [10]), as does a system with a low level of demand. This leaves us with the situation shown in Fig. 6 implying that a system with capacity that provides a level of service near the perceived worth of service will have a high price of anarchy. Importantly, the authors suggest that this will often be the case in public service systems where systems are designed so as to “cope” with demand. This is in disagreement with some previous research that states that in general high prices of anarchy do not occur often [13].Fig. 7gives an initial confirmation of the above result through an example equivalent to a fictitious model of a public schooling system serving three neighbourhoods with two schools. It is assumed that the “cost” (congested related utility) of each of the schools is the same and given by w(x)=ex−30 so that for a class congested by less than 30 students we have a relatively low cost. In this case the cost of balking is equivalent to choosing to send students to a different option than the 2 schools immediately available. This game was solved numerically using [50].In the next section we propose a further example: an applied case study in a healthcare setting.Since 1948, the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom has given free healthcare to all patients at the point of service. One of the most potentially significant changes was introduced in 2009, when free choice of service provider was offered to all patients in England [36]. In Wales, however, patients are required to receive care at a given service provider based entirely on their home address. In [3], the Welsh First Minister Rhodri Morgan claimed that NHS choice is ‘not relevant to Wales’. This statement indicates that there is perhaps a particular characteristic relevant to the Welsh Healthcare system that would imply a negative effect of choice. This claim has motivated the work presented in this paper: How does choice effect the efficiency of a public healthcare system?The ideas of the previous section are now demonstrated on a large network of service and demand nodes. This add to previous literature applying selfish routing to telecommunications and transport [2,52]. The case study chosen is the choice of facility for elective knee replacement surgery across Wales. Using hospital data for such procedures spanning a period from 29/01/2008 to 29/03/2010 (26months) 14 service nodes and 22 demand nodes are identified. They are shown in Fig. 8and summarised in Tables 1 and 2.For the purposes of this case study the measure we will use for the attractiveness of each facility is the expected time spent in the system (note that this includes time spent on the waiting list).We assume that every facility is an M/M/c queue. For the readers unfamiliar with Kendall’s notation, this implies that a facility acts like a service centre with random (negative exponential distribution) inter arrival and service times and c servers. The service time distribution corresponds to the length of stay. The c servers correspond to the capacity of each facility (i.e. the number of beds), as shown in Fig. 9.Given an average arrival rate λ and an average service rate μ, such that0⩽ρ=λcμ<1, the mean time spent in the system for an M/M/c queue is given by [15]:(17)W=W(λ,μ,c)=1μ+λμcc!cμ1-λcμ2∑n=0c-1λμnn!+λμcc!1-λcμWe thus have:(18)wj(λ)=1μj+λμjcjcj!cjμj1-λcjμj2∑n=0cj-1λμjnn!+λμjcjcj!1-λcjμjforallj∈[n]where μjand cjare the service rates and number of servers at service node j∈[n].Convexity of (17) is a known result [27] and so combining functions (4), (5) and (18) with Theorem 2.4 gives two mathematical programs with solutions; the optimal flow and Nash flow for any public healthcare facility system: OPTMP and NASHMP.OPTMP:NASHMP:minimise(4)minimise(5)such that:(19)∑j=1nλij⩽Λiforalli∈[m](20)λij∈R⩾0m×nforalli∈[m],j∈[n](21)∑i=1mλij<cjμjforallj∈[n]Constraints (19) and (20) ensure non-negativity of all flows. Constraint (21) ensures that all our facilities are in steady state, i.e. that the arrival rate at all facilities is less than the corresponding service rate. This constraint is not technically needed as the objective function tends to infinity near this boundary. As such the routing game considered should not be considered as a routing game with capacities (as studied in [9]). We nonetheless include the constraint as certain approaches to solving the problem would require such a constraint to give a realistic solution (indeed solutions that do not obey this constraint could give objective function values approach −∞).An approximate capacity for each of the 14 units is calculated, but due to sharing of wards between specialties, it is difficult to obtain precise bed numbers for a particular surgery/unit. The 22 demand nodes correspond to the 22 unitary areas of Wales and demand rates for each are obtained from the data set. The properties of each hospital and demand node are given in Tables 1 and 2.Recalling Fig. 3, β can correspond to a cost incurred by patients choosing a private service provider and/or a lesser quality of life incurred as a result of not seeking treatment. We assume a homogeneous value of β for the purpose of our numerical experiments. This could of course be generalised to further compartmentalise the population to allow for certain patients to be willing to wait longer for a particular treatment. A distance matrix for these nodes was obtained using Google Maps Javascript API. For the purpose of this study a value of α=.8 is taken, this is based on research presented in [11,22].The two mathematical programs OPTMP and NASHMP are convex optimisation problem and as such can be solved relatively straightforwardly [38]. For the purpose of our work we use a genetic algorithm implemented in [21]. A population size of 200 is used with crossover rate of.5 and a dynamic mutation rate dependent on the overall progress of the algorithm.Two distinct aspects are considered. Firstly we aim to quantify the role played by the cost of balking β. Recall that from Section 3, balking may be interpreted as accepting a lower quality of life or seeking private treatment. For the demand rates of Table 2 the price of anarchy is calculated for varying levels of β and this simply examines the effect of the service value on the price of anarchy. The results are shown in Fig. 10which is an illustration of Theorem 3.1 as the price of anarchy is increasing but seemingly converging to some upper bound.The next experiment considers the effect of demand on the price of anarchy. Using the same distribution of demand (as given by Table 2) sensitivity analysis for an overall demand rateΛ=∑i=1mΛiand for β∈{40,70,100} is conducted. The results are presented in Fig. 11. We see that this empirical study confirms the general profile of the price of anarchy as given in Fig. 6. Furthermore the actual demand for service in this case study is given by Λ=9.68 which corresponds to a very high price of anarchy. This confirms the suggestion made by the authors after the proof of Theorem 4.1.The authors suggest that the above analysis is valuable when deciding to offer choice. In our particular example, the underlying structure seems to indicate a high level of inefficiency. Indeed if there was less or more demand on the system, then the price of anarchy would be low and as such introducing choice would have a reduced negative effect.Note that the above example assumed homogeneity of patients as far as β is concerned. As discussed in Section 3 it is possible to consider heterogeneous patients by carefully partitioning our population. We now illustrate this through two examples. The first assumes a single demand node (Λ=.61) and a single hospital (c=3 and μ=.17). We omit distance (as we have a single demand node) and partition out population into two quasi-equal parts as depicted in Fig. 12. Fig. 13shows the corresponding PoA for varying values of β1/β2 for fixed values of β2.We see first of all that there exists a value of β1/β2 that maximises the Price of Anarchy. For increasing values of β1/β2 the Price of Anarchy seems to converge (not necessarily to 1). This asympototic behaviour corresponds to the behaviour described by Theorem 3.1 for a homogeneous population. The above example is of course a very simple one and so the situation described in Fig. 14is also proposed.We once again partition our population into two groups to give the routing game shown in Fig. 15. In Fig. 16similar results to that of Fig. 13 are shown.We again see similar behaviour with the added complexities due to multiple demand nodes. Importantly, as shown in Fig. 17the Price of Anarchy in a heterogeneous cost of balking framework gives the same general behaviour for varying demand as seen in Figs. 7 and 11. This serves as an illustration of Theorems 3.2 and 4.1.These two examples (both solved using [50]) are meant as proofs of concept showing the capacity of our proposed model to deal with patients willing to wait longer than other and/or being able to afford price healthcare. Interesting further work would be to consider this more precisely.The work presented here has attempted to quantify the effect of choice on a public service system. Using theoretical results from routing game theory, generalised conclusions are obtained regarding the price of anarchy and an algorithmic approach for obtaining the price of anarchy is demonstrated. This measure takes into account the geographical disposition of the demand and service nodes, as well as various factors that influence choice such as the congestion of a particular service centre.The 3 following results are proved analytically:•The price of anarchy increases with worth of service, up to a point.In a system with insufficient capacity the price of anarchy is low.When considering the public service system as a whole, the highest level of inefficiency occurs when the capacity of the system matches the perceived worth of service.A large scale healthcare case study is given. Two aspects are considered. Firstly we confirm that increasing the perceived worth of knee replacement surgery monotonically increases the price of anarchy to some upper bound. Secondly, the effect of demand is considered. It is once again confirmed that the price of anarchy is bounded. Importantly we note that for the current demand in Wales a high price of anarchy is obtained.The main potential insight gained from the price of anarchy work is at a strategic level where systems can be designed so as to minimise the price of anarchy. As such, new facilities can be introduced in a way as to counteract the negative effects of choice, thus leaving competition to act as a potential vector for improvement. We are in essence proposing a novel location analysis problem which aims to site facilities with objective function corresponding to the price of anarchy.The authors would like to conclude by re-iterating that this work takes into account a single dimension of the introduction of choice. No consideration is given to potential benefits of competition. Whether or not individuals are happier with choice is a further subject for debate (one that the authors cannot claim to have sufficient expertise on). For example, in [45], a very negative essay on the subject of choice is given whereas in [53] it is reported that patients’ are happier when given a choice.This paper brings with it various avenues for further work. In particular, as in [7] it would be interesting to consider the presented models with elastic demand and/or model the underlying game using a different model. Perhaps as a differential game as in [49]. Other opportunities for further work would be to investigate the effects of partial information as in [17,46] as well as look at disruptions to service as in [6,16]. Finally as mentioned previously, a further detailed investigation of the effect of heterogeneous individuals is another interesting avenue for research.
