@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We introduce debt issuance limit constraints along with market debt and bank debt to consider how financial frictions affect investment, financing, and debt structure strategies. Our model provides four important results. First, a firm is more likely to issue market debt than bank debt when its debt issuance limit increases. Second, investment strategies are nonmonotonic with respect to debt issuance limits. Third, debt issuance limits distort the relationship between a firm’s equity value and investment strategy. Finally, debt issuance limit constraints lead to debt holders experiencing low risk and low returns. That is, the more severe the debt issuance limits are, the lower are the credit spreads and default probabilities. Our theoretical results are consistent with stylized facts and empirical results.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In the frictionless financial markets of Modigliani and Miller (1958), investment and financing decisions are completely separable. However, when we introduce financial frictions such as corporate taxes, bankruptcy costs, and financing constraints, there is no longer separability between a firm’s investment and financing strategies. Since their seminal study, the corporate finance literature has highlighted the role of financial frictions between investment and financing decisions.11A partial list includes Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988),Hoshi, Kashyap, and Scharfstein (1991),Kaplan and Zingales (1997),Hennessy and Whited (2007), and Livdan, Sapriza, and Zhang (2009).Brennan and Schwartz (1984) and Mauer and Triantis (1994) examine the interaction between investment and financing decisions in contingent claim models. These models have two major limitations. First, there are no financial frictions. Second, the firm is financed by a single type of debt, not various debt structures. The drawback of treating corporate debt as uniform is highlighted by the fact that different types of debt instruments have quite different effects on investment strategies (see Bolton and Freixas, 2000; Hackbarth, Hennessy, and Leland, 2007; Rauh and Sufi, 2010).Several recent studies have already begun the task of incorporating either financing frictions or various debt structures separately into investment timing decision (real options) models. Boyle and Guthrie (2003),Hirth and Uhrig-Homburg (2010), and Nishihara and Shibata (2013) examine investment timing decisions under internal financing constraints. Nishihara and Shibata (2010) and Shibata and Nishihara (2012) investigate investment timing strategies under debt financing constraints.22See, e.g., Stiglitz and Weiss (1981),Gale and Hellwig (1985), and Greenwald and Stiglitz (1993) for static models of the investment decision under a financing constraint.An interesting result among these earlier papers is that investment strategies are nonmonotonic with respect to financial frictions.33See Boyle and Guthrie (2003),Hirth and Uhrig-Homburg (2010), and Shibata and Nishihara (2012) for theoretical analyses. See Cleary, Povel, and Raith (2007) for an empirical analysis.Alternatively, most models consider a firm with only market debt (a single type of debt), assuming that dispersion of creditors prevents debt reorganization during financial distress. In practice, a leveraged firm in financial distress can try to restructure its outstanding debt into a more affordable form. A model allowing for debt restructuring approximates a firm with bank debt (i.e., nonmarket debt).44A partial list of structural models with bank debt includes Mella-Barral and Perraudin (1997),Fan and Sundaresan (2000),Broadie, Chernov, and Sundaresan (2007), and Hackbarth et al. (2007). None of these papers considers investment strategies.Sundaresan and Wang (2007) derive investment strategies under various debt structures by considering debt reorganization strategies for a firm under financial distress. However, these strategies are derived independently of financing frictions.In this paper, we assume that a firm can issue two classes of debt: bank and market debt. Following Bulow and Shoven (1978),Gertner and Scharfstein (1991), and Hackbarth et al. (2007), the only difference between bank and market debt is the bankruptcy procedure.55They assume that payments to market lenders cannot be changed outside the formal bankruptcy process and that the new owners can recapitalize optimally, although costs are incurred.Bank loan renegotiations are generally easier than bond restructuring, as suggested in Lummer and McConnell (1989) and Gilson, John, and Lang (1990). In addition, we assume that firms face issuance limits for debt. It is widely observed that firms face debt issuance limits in financing investment. Debt issuance limit constraints are typically needed to rule out corporate default by mitigating risk shifting from equity holders to debt holders (see Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Thus, imposing debt issuance limit constraints in economic models can thus capture an important feature of reality.We introduce debt issuance limit constraints along with market debt and bank debt to consider how financial frictions affect investment, financing, and debt structure strategies. Our model endogenously determines investment timing, coupon payment level, and debt structure (either bank or market debt issuance) in the presence of financial frictions. To be more precise, our model is solved as follows. Given a debt structure, we derive the optimal investment and coupon payment strategies under debt issuance limit constraints. We then choose the optimal debt structure by comparing equity value under bank debt with that under market debt.Our model builds primarily on three papers: McDonald and Siegel (1986),Sundaresan and Wang (2007), and Shibata and Nishihara (2012).66We incorporate the investment decision into a financing decision model having the choice of debt structure developed by Hackbarth et al. (2007).Our model becomes an all-equity financing model when the firm cannot issue any type of debt (i.e., McDonald and Siegel, 1986). Our model is a nonconstrained model under various debt structures when the firm can issue bank and market debt without issuance constraints (i.e., Sundaresan and Wang, 2007). Our model becomes a constrained model under a market debt structure when a firm can issue only market debt with an issuance bound constraint (i.e., Shibata and Nishihara, 2012). Our model can be regarded as a natural extension of these three papers, and yields several additional important implications.Our model provides four important results. The first result is that the type of debt that is issued at the time of investment depends largely on three parameters (debt issuance limit, volatility, and firm’s bargaining power during financial distress). The firm is more likely to issue market debt than bank debt when the debt issuance limit is increased.77This result is similar to that of Hackbarth et al. (2007) who do not consider investment strategies.In practice, the firms with higher (lower) debt issuance bounds are regarded as large/mature (small/young) corporations. Based on this definition, our results show that large/mature (small/young) corporations are more likely to choose market (bank) debt. Thus, this segmentation is broadly consistent with the stylized facts. In addition, we consider the effects of volatility and bargaining power. When volatility is sufficiently high, the firm prefers bank debt financing irrespective of bargaining power. When volatility is high and the firm’s bargaining power is low, the firm prefers bank debt financing. The reason is that higher volatility is more likely to lead to default, and a lower firm’s bargaining power is more likely to lead to bank debt issuance. When volatility is low and the firm’s bargaining power is high, the firm prefers market debt financing. This is because lower volatility is less likely to result in default, and a higher firm’s bargaining power causes less bank debt issuance. These findings fit well with the empirical findings of Blackwell and Kidwell (1988) and Denis and Mihov (2003).The second result is that the investment strategies (one of two solutions) are nonmonotonic with respect to the debt issuance constraints, while the coupon payments (the other solution) are monotonic with respect to the debt issuance constraints. Given a debt structure, the investment thresholds have a U-shaped relationship with the debt issuance constraints. The U-shaped relationship under bank debt financing is a new result, although the U-shaped relationship under market debt financing has already been established in Shibata and Nishihara (2012). The nonmonotonicity between investment and frictions is similar to that in previous related papers (see, e.g., Boyle and Guthrie, 2003; Cleary et al., 2007; Hirth and Uhrig-Homburg, 2010). Given a debt structure, the coupon payments are monotonically increasing with respect to the debt issuance constraints. These results imply that the optimal investment thresholds of the constrained levered firm are not in between those of the unconstrained levered firm and unlevered firm, while the optimal coupon payments of the constrained levered firm are in between those of the unconstrained levered firm and unlevered firm. Thus, it is less costly to distort investment thresholds than to distort coupon payments. Moreover, if the optimal debt structure strategies are changed from bank debt to market debt by increasing the debt issuance bound, the investment thresholds and coupon payments have a discontinuous curved relationship with respect to the debt issuance limit. In particular, the investment thresholds may have a discontinuous W-shaped relationship with the debt issuance limit.The third result is about the relationship between equity option values and its investment thresholds. Suppose, as a benchmark, there is no debt issuance limit constraint. Then, if the firm prefers bank debt financing, the investment thresholds under bank debt financing are lower than those under market debt financing. We call this a “symmetric relationship.” This implies that having the opportunity to choose the debt structure always hastens corporate investment (decreases the investment threshold) and increases its equity options value. Suppose, by contrast, the firm is financially constrained by its debt issuance limit. Then we show that there is not always a symmetric relationship between them. To be more precise, the investment thresholds under bank debt financing are not always lower than those under market debt financing, even when the firm prefers bank debt. This implies that having the opportunity to choose a debt structure does not always hasten corporate investment although its equity option value is increased. Thus, we show that financing constraints cause a distortion to the symmetric relationship between investment and its equity value.The final result is that debt issuance constraints create a low-risk and low-return outcome for debt holders. In our model, return and risk for debt holders can be measured by the credit spreads and default probabilities, respectively. We show that, the more severe the debt issuance bounds are, the lower are the credit spreads and default probabilities. Thus, we shed light on the determinants of the debt issuance limits for debt holders. Moreover, we show that the credit spreads and default probabilities for bank debt are higher than those for market debt. These imply that bank debt is high risk and high return compared with market debt. These results are consistent with the empirical results of Davydenko and Strebulaev (2007).The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model and derives the value functions. Section 3 provides the solution of our model and considers its properties. Section 4 discusses the model’s implications. Section 5 concludes.In this section, we begin with a description of the model. We then provide the value functions for the firms financed by bank debt and by market debt. Then, we formulate our model as an investment optimization problem for the firms financed by bank debt and by market debt with issuance limit constraints. As a benchmark, we derive the solutions to the two extreme cases in our model. One is the solution for an unlevered (all-equity financed) firm when the debt issuance limit constraints are strict (i.e., the model developed by McDonald and Siegel, 1986). The other is the solution for a firm financed by bank debt and market debt when the debt issuance limit constraints are immaterial (i.e., a model similar to that of Sundaresan and Wang, 2007).A firm possesses an option to invest in a single project at any time. If the investment option is exercised at time Ti (superscript “i” indicates investment strategies), the firm pays a fixed cost I > 0 at time Ti and receives an instantaneous cash flow Xtafter time Ti, where Xtis given by the following geometric Brownian motion:(1)dXt=μXtdt+σXtdzt,X0=x,where ztdenotes a standard Brownian motion, and the growth rate μ > 0 and volatility σ > 0 are constant parameters. For convergence, we assume that r > μ > 0,88The assumption r > μ ensures that the value of the firm is finite. See Sundaresan and Wang (2007),Kort, Murto, and Pawlina (2010), and Shibata and Nishihara (2011) in detail.where r is a constant risk-free interest rate. It is assumed that the current state variable X0 = x is sufficiently low so that the investment is not undertaken immediately.In this paper, we assume that the firm issues two classes of perpetual debt: market debt with a promised coupon payment flow c1 (subscript “1” indicates market debt) and bank debt with a promised coupon payment flow c2 (subscript “2” indicates bank debt). Following Bulow and Shoven (1978),Gertner and Scharfstein (1991), and Hackbarth et al. (2007), we assume that the only difference between bank debt and market debt is the bankruptcy procedure. Now suppose that the firm in financial distress tries to restructure the debt. Under market debt financing, the coupon payments to the market lender cannot be changed outside the formal bankruptcy process. Under bank debt financing, the coupon payments to the bank lender are reduced in the course of a costless private workout.Given a debt structure j ( j ∈ {1, 2}), let us denote byTjiandTjdthe investment (indicated by superscript “i” ) and default (indicated by superscript “d”) timings, respectively. Mathematically, the investment and default timings are defined asTji=inf{s≥0|Xs=xji}andTjd=inf{s≥Tji|Xs=xjd},wherexjiandxjddenote the associated investment and default thresholds, respectively. In particular,x1dandx2drepresent the formal bankruptcy threshold for market debt and the negotiation (coupon reduction) threshold for bank debt, respectively. Note that these defaults are defined only after issuing the debt at the time of investment in this model (i.e., the firm is an unlevered firm before investment).Fig. 1illustrates the difference between market debt and bank debt. On the one hand, the left-hand side panel demonstrates the case of market debt financing. Once Xt, starting at X0 = x, arrives at the thresholdx1i,where superscript “i” indicates the investment, the firm exercises the investment by issuing the market debt. If Xthits the formal bankruptcy thresholdx1dafter adopting the investment, where superscript “d” indicates the default, the firm is liquidated (the firm stops the operation). Mathematically, the investment and formal bankruptcy timings are defined asT1i=inf{t≥0|Xt≥x1i}andT1d=inf{t≥T1i|Xt≤x1d}.On the other hand, the right-hand side panel depicts the case of bank debt financing. Once Xt, starting at X0 = x, arrives at the investment thresholdx2i,the firm exercises the investment by issuing the bank debt. The investment timing is defined asT2i=inf{t≥0|Xt≥x2i}. If Xthits the coupon switching thresholdx2dfrom the above point, the normal coupon payment is changed to the reduced coupon payment. In addition, if Xthits the same thresholdx2dfrom below, the coupon payment is changed to the normal coupon payment. The timings for coupon switching are defined byT2d:=inf{t≥T2i|Xt=x2d},from the normal coupon to the reduced coupons as well as from the reduced coupon to the normal coupon.99For notational simplicity, we do not distinguishT2dfrom above and below.Thus, the firm pays the normal coupon in the regionXt≥x2d,while the firm pays the reduced coupon in the regionXt<x2d.1010See Dixit (1989) for the switching model.Because the reduced coupon payment in the regionXt<x2ddepends on Xtat the equilibrium, we can avoid liquidation under bank debt financing.In this subsection, we derive the value functions after the market debt is issued at the time of investment.Let us denote byE1a(Xt,c1)the equity value at time t after issuing the market debt at the time of investment, where the superscript “a” represents firm value after the market debt issuance. The value,E1a(Xt,c1),is defined as(2)E1a(Xt,c1)=supT1dEt[∫tT1de−r(u−t)(1−τ)(Xu−c1)du],whereEtdenotes the expectation operator at time t, and τ denotes the tax rate. Note thatT1dis the formal bankruptcy time that the equity holders optimize. As in standard arguments,E1a(Xt,c1)is given by(3)E1a(Xt,c1)=maxx1d{ΠXt−(1−τ)c1r−(Πx1d−(1−τ)c1r)(Xtx1d)γ},where Π ≔ (1 − τ)/(r − μ) > 0 and γ ≔ 1/2 − μ/σ2 − ((μ/σ2 − 1/2)2 + 2r/σ2)1/2 < 0. Then, the optimal threshold for formal bankruptcy is obtained by(4)x1d(c1)=argmaxx1dE1a(Xt,c1)=κ1−1c1,where κ1 ≔ (γ − 1)Πr/(γ(1 − τ)) > 0. Note thatx1d(c1)is given as a linear function of c1 withlimc1↓0x1d(c1)=0. The result is obtained by Black and Cox (1976).The debt value,D1a(Xt,c1),is given as(5)D1a(Xt,c1)=Et[∫tT1de−r(u−t)c1du+e−r(T1d−t)(1−α)Πx1d(c1)]=c1r+((1−α)Πx1d(c1)−c1r)(Xtx1d(c1))γ,where α ∈ (0, 1) denotes the proportional cost of formal bankruptcy. Becauselimc1↓0x1d(c1)=0in (4), we havelimc1↓0D1a(Xt,c1)=0. The total firm value is defined by the sum of the equity and debt values,V1a(Xt,c1):=E1a(Xt,c1)+D1a(Xt,c1),i.e.,(6)V1a(Xt,c1)=ΠXt+τc1r(1−(Xtx1d(c1))γ)−αΠx1d(c1)(Xtx1d(c1))γ.There are three components of the right-hand side in (6). The first, second, and third terms represent the values of the unlevered firm, the tax shield, and the formal bankruptcy cost, respectively. Obviously, we havelimc1↓0V1a(Xt,c1)=ΠXt.This subsection provides the value functions after the bank debt is issued at the time of investment.When the bank debt is issued at the time of investment, there are two types of regions: normal and renegotiation regions. On the one hand, let us denote byE2a(Xt,c2),D2a(Xt,c2),andV2a(Xt,c2)the equity, debt, and total firm values, respectively, in the normal region, where the superscript “a” stands for the normal region after issuing the bank debt. On the other hand, let us denote byE2b(Xt,c2),D2b(Xt,c2),andV2b(Xt,c2)the equity, debt, and total firm values, respectively, in the negotiation region during the period of financial distress. The superscript “b” indicates the negotiation (coupon reduction). The normal and negotiation regions are divided by the negotiation (coupon reduction) thresholdx2d. That is, the region{Xt≥x2d}is the normal region, while the region{Xt<x2d}is the negotiation region. The firm and bank negotiate and divide the surplusV2b(Xt,c2)−(1−α)ΠXtto avoid formal bankruptcy. The division of the surplus between the firm and the bank depends on their relative bargaining powers. Let us denote by η and 1 − η the bargaining powers of the firm and the bank, respectively (η ∈ [0, 1]).The equity and debt values in the normal region,E2a(Xt,c2)andD2a(Xt,c2),respectively, are given by(7)E2a(Xt,c2)=supT2d≥tEt[∫tT2de−r(u−t)(1−τ)(Xu−c2)du+e−r(T2d−t)E2b(XT2d,c2)],(8)D2a(Xt,c2)=Et[∫tT2de−r(u−t)c2du+e−r(T2d−t)D2b(XT2d,c2)].Here, the coupon switching times are defined byT2d=inf{t≥0,Xt=x2d}. The equity and debt values in the negotiation region,E2b(Xt,c2)andD2b(Xt,c2),respectively, are given by(9)E2b(Xt,c2)=Et[∫tT2de−r(u−t)((1−τ)Xu−s(Xu))du+e−r(T2d−t)E2a(XT2d,c2)],(10)D2b(Xt,c2)=Et[∫tT2de−r(u−t)s(Xu)du+e−r(T2d−t)D2a(XT2d,c2)],where s(Xt) is the reduced coupon payment in the negotiation region. The total firm value is defined byV2l(Xt,c2)=E2l(Xt,c2)+D2l(Xt,c2)(l ∈ {a, b}).We begin by solving the total firm values. By the standard variation principle, we have the following differential equations:(11)rV2a(x,c2)=(1−τ)x+τc2+μx∂V2a(x,c2)∂x+12σ2x2∂2V2a(x,c2)∂x2,Xt≥x2d,(12)rV2b(x,c2)=(1−τ)x+μx∂V2b(x,c2)∂x+12σ2x2∂2V2b(x,c2)∂x2,Xt<x2d,subject to the boundary conditionsV2a(x2d,c2)=V2b(x2d,c2),∂V2a(x,c2)∂x|x=x2d=∂V2b(x,c2)∂x|x=x2d.Thus,V2a(x,c2)andV2b(x,c2)are obtained by(13)V2a(Xt,c2)=ΠXt+τc2r(1−ββ−γ(Xtx2d)γ),Xt≥x2d,(14)V2b(Xt,c2)=ΠXt−τc2rγβ−γ(Xtx2d)β,Xt<x2d,where β ≔ 1/2 − μ/σ2 + ((μ/σ2 − 1/2)2 + 2r/σ2)1/2 > 1. Note that there is no bankruptcy cost term ofV2a(Xt,c2)in (13), in contrast withV1a(Xt,c1)in (6).We then derive the reduced coupon payment in the negotiation region. As in the derivation in Sundaresan and Wang (2007), the reduced coupon payment in the renegotiation region, s(Xt), is given by(15)s(Xt)=(1−αη)(1−τ)Xt,Xt<x2d.The reduced coupon payment s(x) is a linear function of x with limx↓0s(x) = 0. The lower the EBIT x is, the lower is the coupon payment s(x). This means that the firm does not need to consider formal bankruptcy once it is in the negotiation region.Let θe(Xt, c2) denote the fraction of firm valueV2b(Xt,c2)that the firm receives from renegotiation. Using Nash bargaining, θe(Xt, c2) is obtained by solvingθe(Xt,c2)=argmaxθ(θV2b(Xt,c2))η×((1−θ)V2b(Xt,c2)−(1−α)ΠXt)1−η=η−η(1−α)ΠXtV2b(Xt,c2).Thus, the sharing rules are(16)E2b(Xt,c2)=ηV2b(Xt,c2)−η(1−α)ΠXt=η(αΠXt−τc2rγβ−γ(Xtx2d)β),(17)D2b(Xt,c2)=(1−η)V2b(Xt,c2)+η(1−α)ΠXt=(1−αη)ΠXt−(1−η)τc2rγβ−γ(Xtx2d)β,whereXt<x2d. Moreover, the equity value in the normal region,E2a(Xt,c2)in (7), is rewritten as(18)E2a(Xt,c2)=maxx2d{ΠXt−(1−τ)c2r−((1−αη)Πx2d−c2r(1−τ−τηγβ−γ))(Xtx2d)γ}.The optimal coupon switching threshold is chosen to satisfy∂E2a/∂x2d=∂E2b/∂x2d,i.e.,(19)x2d(c2)=κ2−1c2,where κ2 ≔ (γ − 1)(1 − αη)Πr/(γ(1 − τ(1 − η)) > 0. Note thatx2d(c2)is a linear function of c2 withlimc2↓0x2d(c2)=0. The debt value in the normal region,D2a(Xt,c2)in (8), is given by(20)D2a(Xt,c2)=c2r+((1−αη)Πx2d(c2)−c2r(1−τ+τββ−γ−τηγβ−γ))(Xtx2d(c2))γ.It is straightforward to obtainlimc2↓0D2a(Xt,c2)=0.In this subsection, we formulate the investment decision problem for the firm financed by bank debt and by market debt with issuance constraints.Suppose that the debt structure j is given ( j ∈ {1, 2}). Following Wong (2010) and Shibata and Nishihara (2012), the firm’s debt issuance limit constraint is assumed to be(21)Dja(xji,cj)I≤q,for some constant q ≥ 0. The inequality (21) means that the ratio of the debt issuance amount to the investment cost is restricted by the debt issuance ratio q. In other words, the firm has access to debt issuanceDja(xji,cj)up to the amount qI ≥ 0. For example, the friction might arise because of the risk-shifting problem. Because issuing debt encourages risk shifting from equity holders to debt holders, investors are reluctant to lend beyond a certain amount (see Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Note that we have assumed q ∈ [0, +∞), not q ∈ [0, 1]. The reason is that the levered firm has the possibility of issuing the amountDja(xji,cj),which is more than the amount I, to maximize its value. The case ofDja(xji,cj)>Imay lead to the result q > 1, which implies that the excess is distributed to equity holders as a dividend.Let us denote byEjo(x)the equity options value of the firm constrained by debt issuance limit ( j ∈ {1, 2}), where the superscript “o” represents the options value before investment. Given a debt structure j, the equity options value of the constrained firm is defined asEjo(x):=supTji≥0,cj≥0E0[e−rTji{Eja(XTji,cj)−(I−Dja(XTji,cj))}],subject toDja(XTji,cj)≤qI. Using standard arguments in Dixit and Pindyck (1994), we haveE0[e−rTji]=(x/xji)βwhereX0=x<xji.We formulate the investment decision problem of the firm financed by bank debt and market debt with issuance constraints. Let us denote by Eo(x) the equity options value of the firm with optimal debt structure subject to issuance constraints. The equity options value Eo(x) is obtained by(22)Eo(x)=max{E1o(x),E2o(x)},whereEjo(x)is given by(23)Ejo(x)=maxxji≥0,cj≥0(xxji)β{Vja(xji,cj)−I},(24)subjecttoDja(xji,cj)I≤q,j∈{1,2},for anyx<min{x1i,x2i}.This problem is related to the issuance of either bank debt or market debt at the time of investment. The reason is that we can remove the mixed issuance of bank debt and market debt (we show that this assumption is correct below).1111Hackbarth et al. (2007) consider the mixed debt policy because they incorporate the priority structures of bank and market debt. Note that we do not introduce them.Before analyzing the optimal investment strategies for a firm with different debt structures subject to a debt issuance constraint, we first review two extreme cases briefly: the optimal investment problems of the unlevered firm and the levered firm with different debt structures without issuance constraints.In this subsection, we assume that q = 0, i.e.,Dja(xji,0)=0and cj= 0 for all j ( j ∈ {1, 2}).1212This problem is equivalent to the investment problem for an all-equity financed firm, which is the simple version of the seminal model by McDonald and Siegel (1986).Let us denote byEUo(·)the equity options value of the unlevered firm before investment, where the subscript “U” stands for the unlevered firm. When q = 0, we haveEja(xji,0)=Vja(xji,0)=Πxjifor all j ( j ∈ {1, 2}). Thus, the value,EUo(x),turns out to be(25)EUo(x)=maxxUi≥0(xxUi)β{ΠxUi−I},for anyx<xUi. The optimal investment strategy and the equity options value are(26)xUi*=ββ−11ΠI,EUo(x)=(xxUi*)β(β−1)−1I,where the superscript “*” represents the optimum.In this subsection, we assume that q is sufficiently large (q↑ + ∞). Then, the debt issuance constraint becomes immaterial.1313This problem is similar to that in Sundaresan and Wang (2007).Let us denote byENo(x)the equity options value for the firm financed by bank debt and market debt without an issuance constraint, where the subscript “N” represents the nonconstrained firm. The value,ENo(x),is formulated as(27)ENo(x)=max{E1No(x),E2No(x)},whereEjNo(x)is given by(28)EjNo(x)=maxxjNi≥0,cjN≥0(xxjNi)β{Vja(xjNi,cjN)−I},for anyx<min{x1Ni,x2Ni}( j ∈ {1, 2}).The solutions and equity option value for a given debt structure j are1414See Sundaresan and Wang (2007) and Shibata and Nishihara (2010) for a detailed derivation.(29)xjNi*=ψjxUi*,cjN*=κjψjhjxUi*,EjNo(x)=ψj−βEUo(x),where(30)h1:=(1−γ(1+α1−ττ))−1/γ≥1,ψ1:=(1+τ1−τ1h1)−1≤1,h2:=(ββ−γ(1−γ))−1/γ≥1,ψ2:=(1+τ(1−αη)1−τ(1−η)1h2)−1≤1.We summarize these results obtained in (29) as follows.Lemma 1Suppose that the firm does not have a debt issuance constraint (i.e., q is sufficiently large). The first property is that we havexjNi*≤xUi*andEjNo(x)≥EUo(x)for any j ( j ∈ {1, 2}). The second property is that ψ1 < ψ2implies thatx1Ni*<x2Ni*andE1No(x)>E2No(x). The third property is thatEUo(xUi*)=E1o(x1Ni*)=E2o(x2Ni*).Lemma 1 is easily demonstrated by Fig. 2which depicts the equity option value with the state variable. The first property is the same as that in the static model of Myers (1977). The second property corresponds to the third property. From these two properties, we havex1Ni*<x2Ni*if and only ifE1No(x)>E2No(x). We call this property symmetric relationship.Before solving our problem, we consider the properties of the solution and its value. We have the following two intuitive conjectures:xji*∈[xjNi*,xUi*]foranyq,x1i*≤x2i*ifandonlyifE1o(x)≥E2o(x).The first conjecture is implied by the fact thatxUi*=limq↓0xji*>limq↑+∞xji*=xjNi*for any q ( j ∈ {1, 2}). The second one is implied by the fact thatx1Ni*≤x2Ni*if and only ifE1No(x)≥E2No(x). However, interestingly, these intuitive conjectures are not necessarily correct.In this section, we derive the solution to the problem formulated in (22). Section 3.1 provides the solution to the investment decision problem for the constrained levered firm with a given debt structure. Section 3.2 examines the optimal debt structure by comparing the equity options values for a firm with bank debt and market debt with issuance constraints. Then, we obtain the solution to the problem (22).Given a debt structure j ( j ∈ {1, 2}), we define the constant critical valuexjpsatisfying(31)Dja(xjp,cj(xjp))=qI,where the superscript “p” represents the critical point and cj(x) is given as the optimal coupon payment of the nonconstrained levered firm given a debt structure j,1515Note that we havecj(xjNi*)=cjN*,wherecjN*is defined by the second term of (29).i.e.,cj(x):=argmaxcjVja(x,cj)=(κj/hj)xas shown in Leland (1994). Then,Dja(x,cj(x))is a strictly monotonically increasing continuous function of x withlimx↓0Dja(x,cj(x))=0andlimx↑+∞Dja(x,cj(x))=+∞. Thus, there exists a unique critical valuexjp.Suppose, for example,xjNi*>xjpfor any j ( j ∈ {1, 2}), implying that the investment threshold of the nonconstrained levered firm is strictly larger than the critical value. Then, the firm would prefer to issue more debt than the amount qI to maximize the equity value, while the debt holders restrict the amount to less than qI. Thus, the firm is financially constrained by its debt issuance bound. Suppose that, instead,xjNi*≤xjp. Then, the firm can choose the investment threshold to maximize the total firm value on the condition that the debt issuance is less than the bound qI. Therefore, the firm is not constrained. We summarize these results as follows.Lemma 2Given a debt structure j ( j ∈ {1, 2}), there exists a uniquexjpsatisfying(31). Then, ifxjNi*>xjp,the firm is financially constrained. Otherwise, it is not.Lemma 2 implies that, by comparing the magnitudes ofxjNi*andxjpfor a given debt structure j, we recognize whether the debt issuance constraint is binding. Using these properties, we have the following results (the proof is given in Appendix A).Proposition 1Suppose thatxjNi*>xjp≥0for a given debt structure j (j ∈ {1, 2}). Forxjp=0,we havexji*=xUi*andcj*=0. Forxjp>0,the solutions,xji*andcj*,are decided uniquely by two simultaneous equations:(32)fj1(xji*,cj*)fj2(xji*,cj*)−fj3(xji*,cj*)fj4(xji*,cj*)=0,Dja(xji*,cj*)−qI=0,where fj1, fj2, fj3, and fj4are given as(33)f11:=(β−1)Πx1i*+(βτr−(β−γ)(κ1x1i*c1*)γ(τr+αΠκ1))c1*−βI,(34)f12:=(κ1x1i*c1*)γγ(1r−(1−α)Πκ1)c1*,(35)f13:=τr−(κ1x1i*c1*)γ(1−γ)(τr+αΠκ1),(36)f14:=1r−(κ1x1i*c1*)γ(1−γ)(1r−(1−α)Πκ1),and(37)f21:=(β−1)Πx2i*+βτr(1−(κ2x2i*c2*)γ)c2*−βI,(38)f22:=(κ2x2i*c2*)γ×γ(1r(1−τ+τββ−γ−τηγβ−γ)−(1−αη)Πκ2)c2*,(39)f23:=τr(1−(κ2x2i*c2*)γ(1−γ)ββ−γ),(40)f24:=1r−(κ2x2i*c2*)γ(1−γ)×(1r(1−τ+τββ−γ−τηγβ−γ)−(1−αη)Πκ2).Suppose, on the other hand, thatxjNi*≤xjpfor a given debt structure j. We obtainxji*=xjNi*andcj*=cjN*. Substituting the solutions into the equity value in(23)yields(41)Ejo(x)=(xxji*)β{Vja(xji*,cj*)−I}.In the previous subsection, we considered the solutions and their values for a given debt structure j ( j ∈ {1, 2}). In this subsection, we examine the solutions to the problem (22). Recall that we cannot obtain the analytical solution ofEjo(x). By comparing the magnitudes ofE1o(x)andE2o(x)for given parameters, we obtain the solutions to the problem defined by (22) numerically.Suppose that the basic parameters are r = 0.09, μ = 0.01, I = 5, τ = 0.15, α = 0.4, and x = 0.4.1616Under the basic parameters, x = 0.4 always satisfiesx<min{xji*,xjNi*}for all j ( j ∈ {1, 2}).Whether bank or market debt is issued depends on the combination of the three key parameters: q (debt issuance limit), σ (volatility), and η (firm’s bargaining power).The upper left-hand side panel of Fig. 3depicts the regions ofE1o(x)>E2o(x)in (η, σ) space. Three lines indicate the boundaries ofE1o(x)=E2o(x)for q = 1, q = 0.8, and q = 0.6. Under the basic parameters, the boundary for q = 1 is the same as the one for q↑ + ∞ (i.e., the one for the nonconstrained levered firm). For the regions of smaller σ and larger η, we seeE1o(x)>E2o(x),i.e., the firm prefers market debt financing. For the regions of larger σ and smaller η, in contrast, we haveE2o(x)>E1o(x),i.e., the firm prefers bank debt financing. Importantly, an increase in q enlarges the regions ofE1o(x)>E2o(x). The next observation characterizes the effects of debt issuance limit parameter q.Observation 1Consider the optimization problem for the constrained levered firm defined by(22). First, as debt issuance limit constraint q increases, the firm becomes more likely to issue market debt. Second, when volatility σ is greater, the firm is more likely to prefer bank debt. Finally, when the firm’s bargaining power η is stronger (in other words, when the bank’s bargaining power is weaker), the firm is more likely to choose market debt.In the upper left-hand side panels of Fig. 3, we consider three points: Points A, B, and C. Point A is an arbitrary case where the firm prefers market debt financing for any q. Point B is an arbitrary case where the firm prefers market debt financing for larger q, while the firm prefers bank debt financing for smaller q. Point C is an arbitrary case where the firm prefers bank debt financing for any q.The other three panels of Fig. 3 demonstrate the equity options values with respect to q. The parameters of the upper right-hand, lower left-hand, and lower right-hand side panels correspond to those of Points A, B, and C, respectively. First, in the upper right-hand side panel, we confirmE1o(x)≥E2o(x)for all regions of q. Second, in the lower left-hand side panel, we see thatE2o(x)>E1o(x)forq<q^=0.71andE1o(x)≥E2o(x)forq≥q^. Finally, in the lower right-hand side panel,E2o(x)≥E1o(x)for all regions of q. Consequently, we have the following result.Observation 2Consider the optimization problem for the constrained levered firm defined by(22). For η ∈ (0, 1], there are three optimal cases, depending on the parameters.(i)There existsE2o(x)≥E1o(x)for all regions of q. Then, the constrained levered firm chooses bank debt issuance.There exists a uniqueq^such thatE2o(x)≥E1o(x)forq≤q^andE1o(x)>E2o(x)forq>q^. Then, the firm prefers bank debt issuance forq≤q^,while it prefers market debt issuance forq>q^.There existsE1o(x)≥E2o(x)for all regions of q. Then, the firm chooses market debt issuance.For η = 0, on the other hand, there exists only one case. The firm chooses bank debt issuance at the time of investment.Observations 1 and 2 are most closely related to the stylized facts on debt composition. According to the definition by Rajan (1992) and Hackbarth et al. (2007), the firms with larger q, larger η, and smaller σ (smaller q, smaller η, and larger σ) best approximate large/mature (small/young) corporations. Then, based on the above definition, small/young firms are more likely to issue bank debt, whereas large/mature firms are more likely to issue market debt. In addition, these implied results in Observations 1 and 2 fit well with the empirical findings. Blackwell and Kidwell (1988) observe that small and risky firms sell debt privately. Denis and Mihov (2003) and Rauh and Sufi (2010) find that low-credit-quality firms (the firm with high volatility) are more likely to have bank debt.In this section, we consider the more important implications of our model. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 investigate the effects of debt issuance constraints on the investment thresholds and coupon payments, respectively. Section 4.3 shows that a symmetric relationship between the investment thresholds and the corresponding values does not always exist. Section 4.4 considers the effects of having the choice of debt structure. Section 4.5 analyzes the effects of a debt issuance limit constraint on the credit spreads and default probabilities. Section 4.6 discusses how the debt issuance amount is determined by debt holders.This subsection examines the effects of a debt issuance constraint on the investment thresholds.The upper two panels of Fig. 4illustrate the investment thresholds with the debt issuance constraint ratio q (the parameters of the left-hand and right-hand side panels correspond to those of Points A and C in the upper left-hand side panel of Fig. 3, respectively). In the left-hand and right-hand side panels, the firm prefers market debt issuance and bank debt issuance, respectively. Recall from Lemma 2 that the firm is constrained by the debt issuance bound ifxjp<xjNi*( j ∈ {1, 2}), while it is not otherwise. In the upper left-hand side panel, for example, if q < 0.9449 (q < 0.7045) becausex1p<x1Ni*(x2p<x2Ni*), the firm is constrained by the market (bank) debt issuance bound. We havelimq↓0xji*=xUi*andlimq↑+∞xji*=xjNi*withxUi*≥xjNi*. The right-hand side panel follows similarly.Interestingly,xji*is not always in betweenxjNi*andxUi*for any q ∈ (0, +∞), given a debt structure j ( j ∈ {1, 2}). This implies that the first conjecture is no longer correct. That is, the investment thresholdsxji*are nonmonotonic with respect to q.Consider the intuition of the U-shaped relationship betweenxji*and q. When the firm comes up against the debt issuance limit constraints, an increase in q increases the debt valueDja(xji*,cj*). Then there are two conflicting effects ofxji*associated with increasingDja(xji*,cj*). The first is the “financing constraint effect” where an increase in q increasesxji*becauseDja(xji*,cj*)is increasing with respect toxji*. The second is the “leverage effect” where an increase in q decreasesxji*via(x/xji*)β{Eja(xji*,cj*)−(I−Dja(xji*,cj*))}. For low values of q, the second effect dominates the first effect. For high values of q, the first effect dominates the second effect. Thus, the investment thresholds have a U-shaped relationship with respect to q.1717As demonstrated in Fig. 4, to the extent that we have solved the investment thresholds numerically for various parameter values, we could not find any example of a monotonic relationship betweenxji*and q for any j.We summarize these results as follows.Observation 3Given a debt structure, the investment thresholds have a U-shaped relationship with the debt issuance bound q in almost all cases.Shibata and Nishihara (2012) have already shown a nonmonotonic relationship betweenx1i*and q. The new result obtained in Observation 3 is that we find a nonmonotonic relationship betweenx2i*and q. The nonmonotonicity property is consistent with theoretical studies by Boyle and Guthrie (2003) and Hirth and Uhrig-Homburg (2010) and an empirical study by Cleary et al. (2007).The two panels of Fig. 5provide the most interesting case, assuming that η = 1 and σ = 0.15 which correspond to the parameters of Point B in the upper left-hand side of Fig. 3. Under these parameters, we have already shown that the firm chooses bank debt issuance at the time of investment for0<q<q^=0.71,and market debt issuance forq≥q^=0.71. The thick dotted line shows the investment thresholds (coupon payments) at the equilibrium. An increase in q leads to a jump in the investment thresholds, because the debt structure strategy has changed from bank debt to market debt. We see that, at q = 0.71 the investment threshold jumps fromx2i*=0.6612tox1i*=0.6585. We have the following result.Observation 4Consider the optimization problem for the constrained levered firm defined by(22). Then, at the equilibrium, the investment thresholds have a discontinuous W-shaped relationship with the friction parameter q, depending on the two other key parameters, η and σ.With the optimal choice of debt structure, the relationship between the investment thresholds and debt issuance bound is a more complicated nonmonotonicity relationship, compared with the scenario in which firms have no choice of debt structure.This subsection examines the effects of a debt issuance bound on the coupon payments.The lower two panels of Fig. 4 show the coupon payments with respect to q. We see thatcj*is monotonically increasing with respect to q, given the debt structure j ( j ∈ {1, 2}).1818To the extent that we have solved the coupon payments numerically for various parameter values, we could not find any example of a nonmonotonic relationship betweencj*and q for any j ( j ∈ {1, 2}).The next observation summarizes this property of the coupon payments.Observation 5Given a debt structure, the coupon payments for the constrained levered firm are between those for the unlevered firm and those for the nonconstrained levered firm in almost all cases.Observation 5 contrasts with Observation 3, wherexji*is not always in the regions[xjNi*,xUi*]. Thus, it is less costly to distortxji*away from the regions[xjNi*,xUi*]than to distortcj*away from the regions[0,cjN*]. Moreover, note thatcj*≤cjN*impliesxjd*=xjd(cj*)≤xjd(cjN*)=xjNd*.In the right-hand side panel of Fig. 5, the thick dotted line shows the coupon payments at the equilibrium. An increase in q leads to a jump in the coupon payments fromc2*=0.3510toc1*=0.3302at q = 0.71. The reason is that the firm changes the debt structure strategies atq^=0.71. We summarize the result as follows.Observation 6Consider the optimization problem for the constrained levered firm defined by(22). Then, at the equilibrium, the coupon payments have a discontinuous curved relationship with the friction parameter q, depending on the two other key parameters, η and σ.In this subsection, we consider the relationship between the investment thresholds and the corresponding values. Recall in Lemma 1 that we have a symmetric relationship (i.e.,x1Ni*≤x2Ni*if and only ifE1No(x)≥E2No(x)) when q is sufficiently large. This result implies the second intuitive conjecture, i.e.,x1i*≤x2i*if and only ifE1o(x)≥E2o(x).Fig. 6shows the effects of volatility, σ, on the investment thresholds and equity options values, respectively. The key parameters are assumed to be q = 0.7 and η = 1 for σ ∈ [0.1, 0.2].1919For all the regions of σ ∈ [0.1, 0.2] with q = 0.7 and η = 1, we havexjNi*>xjp( j ∈ {1, 2}), implying that the firm is financially constrained by debt issuance bounds.In the left-hand side panel, we havex1i*<x2i*for σ < 0.1579. In the right-hand side panel, we see thatE1o(x)≥E2o(x)for σ ≤ 0.1495.2020We confirm one of the results obtained in Fig. 2: namely, that an increase in σ changes the firm’s debt capital strategies from market debt financing to bank debt financing.From these two results, we obtainx1i*<x2i*andE1o(x)<E2o(x)for σ ∈ (0.1495, 0.1579). We have the following result.Observation 7Under debt issuance limit constraints, a symmetric relationship is not always obtained. In particular, the investment thresholds with bank (market) debt financing are not always lower than those with market (bank) debt financing when the firm prefers bank (market) debt financing to market (bank) debt financing.Note that the finding in Observation 7 provides important new insights into the difference between the model with the choice of debt structure (our model) and the model without the choice of debt structure (the model of Shibata and Nishihara (2012)), as shown in the next subsection.This subsection examines how debt structure choice (market debt issuance or bank debt issuance) influences corporate investment when the firm is constrained with a debt issuance bound. Recall that it is assumed that the firm can issue only market debt at the time of investment in the previous model developed by Shibata and Nishihara (2012). Thus, this subsection makes clear the difference between our model and the previous model.Suppose, as a benchmark, that the firm is not constrained by a debt issuance bound (i.e., q is sufficiently large). Then, having the choice of market debt issuance or bank debt issuance always increases the equity options values and always hastens corporate investment (decreases the investment threshold), compared with having only the choice of market debt issuance. The reason is a straightforward result of the symmetric relationship (i.e.,x1Ni*≥x2Ni*if and only ifE1No(x)≤E2No(x)).Suppose that the firm comes up against the debt issuance limit constraint (for example, assume q = 0.7, η = 1, and σ ∈ [0.1495, 0.1579]). Then, interestingly, having the choice of market debt issuance or bank debt issuance delays corporate investment (increases the investment threshold) although it always increases the equity options value, compared with having only the choice of market debt issuance. Thus, we summarize these results as follows.Observation 8Suppose that the firm faces the debt issuance constraint at the time of investment. Then, having the choice of market debt issuance or bank debt issuance does not always hasten corporate investment although it always increases the equity options value.Our model is an extension of Shibata and Nishihara (2012) in that the firm can choose the optimal debt structure (i.e., the firm has the option of issuing bank debt). Our intuition is that choosing the optimal debt structure enables the firm to hasten its corporate investment even though the firm is constrained by the debt issuance bound. However, interestingly, this intuition is not always correct when the firm comes up against financial constraints.In this subsection, we consider the effects of debt issuance constraints on debt holders. To do so, the two key variables are credit spreads and default probabilities, which are regarded as measures of return and risk for debt holders, respectively. The credit spread and default probability are defined as(42)csk:=ck*Dja(xki*,ck*)−r,pk:=ETki*[e−r(Tki*−Tkd*)]=(xki*xjd(ck*))γ,k∈{j,jN},respectively (j ∈ {1, 2}). Note that the two measures above are defined at the optimal investment timeTki*.We have already recognized that debt issuance constraints cause(43)cj*≤cjN*,xjd*≤xjNd*,Dja(xji*,cj*)≤Dja(xjNi*,cjN*),j∈{1,2}.The first inequality has already been shown in the lower two panels of Fig. 4; the second inequality is straightforward because of the first inequality andxkd*=xjd(ck*); and the third inequality is obvious because of the definition of debt issuance constraints. Moreover, the debt issuance constraint does not always causexji*≥xjNi*,as shown in the upper two panels of Fig. 4. Thus, using these previously presented results, we cannot determine which is bigger: csjor csjN and pjor pjN.The upper two and lower two panels of Fig. 7depict the credit spreads and the default probabilities, respectively. The parameters of the left-hand and right-hand side panels correspond to those of Points A and C in the upper left-hand side panel of Fig. 3, where the firm prefers market and bank debt financing, respectively. We see(44)csj≤csjN,pj≤pjN.For both market and bank debt financing, we have the result that the debt issuance limit constraint causes a decrease in credit spreads and default probabilities. Regarding the first inequality, the debt issuance constraint leads to a decrease in the ratio ofcj*toDja(xji*,cj*),compared with the ratio ofcjN*toDjNa(xjNi*,cjN*). The implication of the second inequality is that, because γ < 0, the distance betweenxji*andxjd*is larger than the distance betweenxjNi*andxjNd*. This implies that the default for the constrained levered firm is less likely to occur than that for the unconstrained levered firm.Thus, the more severe the debt issuance bounds are, the lower are the credit spreads and default probabilities. These links between risk and return are the same as those traditionally suggested in the literature and also match the results by Gomes and Schmid (2010) and Borgonovo and Gatti (2013). The next characterizes the properties of financing constraints.Observation 9Debt financing constraints lead to a low-risk (low-default probabilities) and low-return (low-credit spreads) situation for debt holders.In addition, in both panels of Fig. 7, we have cs2 ≥ cs1 and p2 ≥ p1. These inequalities imply that bank debt is high risk and high return, compared with market debt. Importantly, irrespective of the firm’s preference of debt structure, the credit spread and default probabilities for bank debt financing are larger than those for market debt financing. Regarding the first inequality, the ratio ofc2*toD2a(x2i*,c2*)for bank debt issuance is higher than the ratio ofc1*toD1a(x1i*,c1*)for market debt issuance. The implication of the second inequality is that, because of γ < 0, the distance betweenx2i*andx2d*is smaller than the distance betweenx1i*andx1d*,implying that default of the firm financed by bank debt is more likely to occur than default of the firm financed by market debt. These numerical simulations suggest the following observation.Observation 10The credit spreads and default probabilities for bank debt are larger than those for market debt in almost all cases.The results presented are consistent with the empirical results of Davydenko and Strebulaev (2007) who find that the possibility of strategic debt service increases corporate credit spreads and default probabilities.So far, we have assumed that the debt issuance amount (i.e., q) is exogenous. This subsection examines how q is determined by debt holders for a given debt structure j ( j ∈ {1, 2}).Note that there is no arbitrage opportunity for debt issuance in our model, where debt holders provide the amount of qI and take the value ofDja(xji*,cj*)=qI. Additionally, credit spreads (return) and default probabilities (risk) are monotonically increasing with q. This implies that a decrease in q will enable debt holders to decrease their return and risk. In practice, it is natural for debt holders to determine q assuming, e.g., credit spreads are lower than 20 bp or default probabilities are lower than 5 percent. We now suppose that q is determined on the basis of amount of return and risk debt holders assume.In the upper left-hand side panel of Fig. 7 (σ = 0.1), suppose that q is decided such that credit spreads are lower than 20 bp. We then have q = 0.5759 and q = 0.8564 for the bank debt and market debt, respectively, which gives the resultD2a(x2i*,c2*)=2.8795andD1a(x1i*,c1*)=4.2820. Additionally, suppose that credit spreads are allowed up to 40 bp. We then have q = 0.6486 (i.e.,D2a(x2i*,c2*)=3.2430) and q = 0.9449 (i.e.,D1a(x1i*,c1*)=4.7245). By increasing the upper limit constraints of credit spreads, q is increased. In the upper right-hand side panel (σ = 0.2), for the upper limit constraints of credit spreads allowed up to 20 bp, we have q = 0.3385 and q = 0.4648 for bank and market debt, respectively. Thus, an increase in σ decreases q (i.e., the debt issuance amount).Similarly, we examine the upper limit constraints of default probabilities. In the lower left-hand side panel of Fig. 7 (σ = 0.1), suppose that q is decided such that the default probability is lower than 5 percent. We then have q = 0.4856 (i.e.,D2a(x2i*,c2*)=2.4280) and q = 0.9077 (i.e.,D1a(x1i*,c1*)=4.5385) for bank and market debt, respectively. Additionally, suppose that default probabilities are allowed up to 10 percent. We then have q = 0.5525 (i.e.,D2a(x2i*,c2*)=2.7625) and q = 0.9449 (i.e.,D1a(x1i*,c1*)=4.7245) for bank and market debt, respectively. By increasing the upper limit constraints of default probabilities, q is increased. In the lower right-hand side panel (σ = 0.2), for the upper limit constraints of default probabilities allowed up to 5 percent, we then have q = 0.3031 and q = 0.5688 for bank and market debt, respectively. Thus, an increase in σ decreases q.We have proposed a model that analyzes optimal investment strategies under an optimal structure of bank debt and market debt with issuance limit constraints. By considering various debt structures, we shed light on decisions regarding a firm’s investment, financing, and debt choice strategies. As a result, we can discuss the availability and effects of various debt structures under issuance constraints.We have four important results with respect to financial frictions. The first result is which type of debt is issued at the time of investment depends largely on three parameters (debt issuance limit, volatility, and bargaining power in the renegotiation during financial distress). In particular, increasing the debt issuance limit makes a firm more likely to issue market debt than bank debt. In practice, the firms with higher (lower) debt issuance bounds are regarded as large/mature (small/young) corporations. Based on this definition, our results show that large/mature (small/young) corporations are more likely to choose market (bank) debt. Thus, this segmentation is broadly consistent with the stylized facts.The second result is that, for a given debt structure, the relationship between investment thresholds and the debt issuance limit is nonmonotonic. Because we find a nonmonotonic relationship under bank debt financing in addition to market debt financing, we can conclude that the nonmonotonic relationship is theoretically robust. On the other hand, for a given debt structure, the relationship between coupon payments and the debt issuance limit is monotonic. Thus, it is less costly to distort investment thresholds than to distort coupon payments. Moreover, if the optimal debt structure strategies are changed from bank debt to market debt by increasing the debt issuance bound, the investment thresholds (and coupon payments) have a discontinuous relationship with the debt issuance bound. Thus, the optimal debt structure makes the corporate investment (and coupon payments) strategy more complicated, compared with the scenario in which firms have no choice of debt structure.The third result is that there is not always a symmetric relationship between investment thresholds and equity option values when there is a debt issuance constraint. More precisely, the investment thresholds under bank debt financing are not always lower than those under market debt financing, even when the firm prefers bank debt to market debt. This result contrasts with the result where there is a symmetric relationship when there is no debt issuance constraint. Thus, under a debt issuance constraint, having the choice of market debt or bank debt (having the additional choice of debt structure) does not always accelerate corporate investment although its equity option value is increased. We conclude that investment strategies under financing frictions are different from those under no financing frictions.The final result is that debt issuance constraints create low-risk and low-return situation for debt holders. More precisely, the more severe the debt issuance limits are, the lower are the credit spreads and default probabilities. In addition, the credit spreads and default probabilities for bank debt are larger than those for market debt. We conclude that bank debt is relatively high risk and high return, compared with market debt.
