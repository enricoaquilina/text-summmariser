@&#ABSTRACT@&#
An acetabular cup with larger abduction angles is able to affect the normal function of the cup seriously that may cause early failure of the total hip replacement (THR). Complexity of the finite element (FE) simulation in the wear analysis of the THR is usually concerned with the contact status, the computational effort, and the possible divergence of results, which become more difficult on THRs with larger cup abduction angles. In the study, we propose a FE approach with contact transformation that offers less computational effort. Related procedures, such as Lagrangian Multiplier, partitioned matrix inversion, detection of contact forces, continuity of contact surface, nodal area estimation, etc. are explained in this report. Through the transformed methodology, the computer round-off error is tremendously reduced and the embedded repetitive procedure can be processed precisely and quickly. Here, wear behaviors of THR with various abduction angles are investigated. The most commonly used combination, i.e., metal-on-polyethylene, is adopted in the current study where a cobalt-chromium femoral head is paired with an Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) cup. In all illustrations, wear coefficients are estimated by self-averaging strategy with available experimental datum reported elsewhere. The results reveal that the THR with larger abduction angles may produce deeper depth of wear but the volume of wear presents an opposite tendency; these results are comparable with clinical and experimental reports. The current approach can be widely applied easily to fields such as the study of the wear behaviors on ante-version, impingement, and time-dependent behaviors of prostheses etc.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Debris induced from the surface wear of a polyethylene acetabular cup is a major factor causing implant loosening [1–3]. The decrease of contact area between the cup and the femoral head causes higher stresses [4] and resulting in more polyethylene wear and debris [5–7]. Placement of acetabular cups at large abduction angles has been found as one of the main reasons for early failure of artificial hip joints caused by serious wear on the cup [8]. Therefore, the study of wear behaviors at different cup abduction angles is a significant task in the research of biomedical engineering problems.The wear depth of total hip replacement (THR) is usually estimated with penetration of the femoral head into the cup. Linear wear rate of polyethylene has been associated with osteolysis and subsequent component loosening [3,9]. Acetabular cup loosening due to polyethylene wear is the most frequent reason for long-term revision in THRs [1,2]. The volumetric wear is directly related to the square of the radius of the head, and head size is the most important factor in predicting debris generation [10,11]. In the past decade, wear behaviors of the hip implant and more significant knowledge were obtained through the use of the finite element (FE) method. For example, Maxian et al. [12,13] proposed a sliding distance formula associated with the FE analysis to estimate the polyethylene wear on acetabular cups and the linear wear rate. Teoh et al. [14] extended Maxian's model with the hypothesis of elasto-plasticity. Patil et al. [15] developed a FE model to study the relation between the acetabular abduction angles and linear wear rates. Oki et al. [16] used the FE simulation to verify that the abduction angle of the acetabular component significantly influences the cup loosening. Korhonen et al. [17] showed that the abduction angles can raise mechanical stresses in polyethylene cups. In 2005, Bevill et al. [18] investigated wear of THR with creep models. In Bevill's study, the iterative assessment of wear simulation depended on the initial geometry and the original contact status which yielded incapable results. Moreover, Uddin and Zhang investigated effects of various design parameters on the wear behaviors of acetabular cup, such as head size, clearance, cup thickness, and alternative material combination on the wear of acetabular cup [19]. Later on, the boundary element method (BEM) was adopted to reduce the number of variables on the implant models [20,21]; thus, model reform and arithmetic operation became relatively fast and easy. However, BEM involved with an asymmetric matrix system makes the problems complicated and imprecise [22,23]. In 2010, FE simulations with contact elements were further considered to study wear behaviors of hip implants by Wu et al. [24,25]. Sariali et al. [26] developed a FE model to evaluate the influence of the cup abduction angles on the contact pressures in hip arthroplasty. Queiroz et al. [27] presented a FE procedure to estimate the linear wear rates of acetabular cups in assemblages at various abduction angles. The above studies provided information that larger abduction angles produce higher linear wear rates. Moreover, Hua et al. [28,29] discussed the influences of the cup abduction angles and head lateral micro-separation by contact mechanics on the hip implant and concluded that larger cup abduction angles may raise the von Mises stresses on acetabular cups. Uddin showed that the contact pressures and its corresponding von Mises levels remain quite insensitive to the cup abduction angle [30].More clinical studies found that the wear behaviors are closely related to the abduction angles. The radiostereometric analysis is aware of the most accurate and precise technique to evaluate polyethylene wear. Udomkiat et al. [6] observed radiographs and suggested that more linear wear and volumetric wear rates were directly related to larger abduction angles. Little et al. [7] used three-dimensional images to explain that larger abduction angles of polyethylene acetabular cup might present higher linear and volumetric wear rates. Wang et al. [31] applied the Dorr method [9] to measure linear wear rate of THRs; they emphasized that the linear wear rates were significantly higher at larger abduction angles. Since clinical studies adopt a mathematical conversion formula reported by Charnley et al. [10] to calculate the volumetric wear, such estimation may not be sufficiently accurate [32]. An alternate process of measurement was designed to understand the volumetric wear of the acetabular cup by Uddin [33]. Moreover, experiments with a simulator were performed by Korduba et al. [34] to evaluate the effects of different abduction angles on volumetric wear rates of polyethylene cups; further results showed that larger cup abduction angles were associated with lower volumetric wear rates. Thus, further studies on the effect of abduction angles to the wear behavior of THRs are significant. Although previous numerical, clinical, or experimental studies on the THRs have given valuable results; factors such as variations of the contact region, the worn geometry, the wear coefficient, and von Mises stresses, among others, were never examined; the avenues of exploration for wear behaviors of THRs are still too numerous.In general, malposition of the components directly affects the wear behavior on the acetabular cup and further laxity of the joint may cause early failure of the prosthesis. The alignment of the prosthesis in surgery has been evaluated for many years, but the simulation of wear behavior under the effect of implant mal-position in hip joint arthroplasty is seldom discussed [5,7,8]. In practice, the geometry of contact regions between wear components is continuously changed and the wear behavior is related to its historical states. In order to solve such wear problems, a repetitive process is necessary with longer computational time. Such a repetitive process also meets with a large amount of errors from the computer floating point operations; further accumulation of such round-off errors may cause deviation of history-dependent results significantly. Moreover, the wear coefficient plays an important role in the calculation of wear values [35,36]. Wear coefficients are usually derived from specimen tests under existing environment and ranged from 0.02 × 10−6 to 2.5 × 10−6 mm3/N-m for ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) against cobalt-chromium (CoCr) material [37–39]. In the FE simulation, selection of wear coefficient from such extensive results is usually controversial. Using adjustment on the wear coefficient to match the experimental results is an inappropriate way. Therefore, we introduce a method of self-average to collect many published results to obtain a reasonable and acceptable wear coefficient for the FE simulations here.Referring to the above discussions, we propose an easy, fast, and precise FE approach to investigate the abduction angles on the wear of the hip arthroplasty. The alternate FE approach is based on an idea of contact transformation in which most of the computational processes are operated on the contact region that may significantly speed up the repetitive processes and cause fewer round-off errors. An efficient FE model of the implant is constructed and the derivation of wear coefficients is described. Formulations for wears and stresses are discussed in detail next.Archard's wear law states that the volumetric wear of a structure, e.g., a polyethylene acetabular cup, can be estimated by [40](1)V=KwHFnSwhere V is the volumetric wear, S is the sliding distance, H is the material hardening factor, Fnis the compressive normal force on the wear surface, and Kwis a dimensionless wear coefficient between 10−8 and 10−2[41].In progress of simulating the wear behavior for the polyethylene cup, the volumetric wear at point j at state i,Vi,j, can be written as(2)Vi,j=kwFi,jSi,jWherekw(=Kw/H)is the wear coefficient in unit of mm3/N-m derived from experiments,Fi,jis the corresponding compressive normal force andSi,jis the nodal sliding distance.In most numerical simulations, the wear depth at some node j is obtained based on a modification of the Archard model proposed by Marshek and Chen [42], i.e.,hj=kwpjSj, where h is the wear depth, kwis the wear coefficient, p is the normal contact stress, and S is the nodal sliding distance. The volumetric wear of the node is determined by a simple product of the average length, width, and depth of the connecting elements [12,27]. However, the above process to calculate the wear depth at node j directly from a questioningly nodal stress value of pjis contentious [20,21]. In the study, the nodal volumetric wear is calculated from Archard's wear law, (see Eq. (2)) and the corresponding depth of wear at node j at state i is derived by the formula of(3a)hi,j=kwFi,jSi,jAi,jIn the above equation,Ai,j=∑k=1nk(nj⋅nk)|det|i,jkindicates the effective area on the worn surface connecting node j, nk is the number of neighboring Gaussian points at node j, njis the unit normal vector of node j, and nkis the unit normal vector of Gaussian node k, as shown in Fig. 1. The coordinate of node j can then be updated and expressed as(3b)xi,j=xi,j−hi,jnjOnce the structural geometry has been updated, the refinement of the FE mesh can be carried out prior to the next calculation in the study [43].As described previously, the volumetric wear and wear depth depend not only on the material properties, such as surface hardness and wear property, but also on the geometry and the normal forces on the contact region. An alternative FE approach is described below to meet the above requirements and to reduce computational efforts.For the purpose of easily understanding the proposed procedure, a structure with two components, a and b, with partial contact at region c, is assumed. During the wear process, the above parameters change but the contact forces throughout the contact region must always be at equilibrium at any stage of assessment. The equilibrium equation for component i can thus be written asKiui=Fi−Biλciwhere F is the applied force vector, K is the stiffness matrix, u is the vector of displacements, and B is a Boolean matrix [44] including 0‘s and 1's used to transfer displacements or forces between the overall degrees of freedom (DOF) and DOF on the contact region c of each component.λcis a Lagrangian Multiplier indicating interaction forces on the contact region c. In the above equation, the left hand side specifies the internal force and the right hand side is the external force, so the equilibrium equations for the contact components a and b become(4a)Kaua+Baλca=FaKbub+Bbλcb=FbNote thatλca+λcb=0is on the contact region. A localized Lagrange multiplier method is considered and the equations for continuity on the contact region can be written as(4b)BaTua−uc=gBbTub−uc=−gwhere superscript T indicates the transposition of a matrix. ucis a vector of displacements on the contact region c and g is a vector of the natural gap between contact nodes on region c.Here, the natural gap between contact components is ignored, i.e., g = 0, specifying contact without imperfection. Therefore, equations in Eq. (4b) may be combined into the form(5)BaTua−BbTub=0After manipulations, Eq. (4a) yields(6)ua=(Ka)−1(Fa−Baλca)ub=(Kb)−1(Fb−Bbλcb)Substituting Eq. (6) into Eq. (5) and noting thatλcb=−λcaon the contact region c, we have(7)[BaT(Ka)−1Ba+BbT(Kb)−1Bb]λca=BaT(Ka)−1Fa−BbT(Kb)−1Fbwhere operationsBiT(Ki)−1Bifor component i is tedious and requires longer computational time. Obviously, the results ofBiT(Ki)−1BiandBiT(Ki)−1Fiin Eq. (7) are relevant to the contact DOF only. Therefore, a partition inverse strategy is used for the operation of(Ka)−1and(Kb)−1.Assuming that the resultant of(Ka)−1for component a can be specified as(8)(Ka)−1=[kiiakicakciakcca]−1=[PaLaMaNa]where(9a)Pa=(kiia)−1+(kiia)−1kica(kcca−kcia(kiia)−1kica)−1kcia(kiia)−1La=−(kiia)−1kica(kcca−kcia(kiia)−1kica)−1Ma=−(kcca−kcia(kiia)−1kica)−1kcia(kiia)−1Na=(kcca−kcia(kiia)−1kica)−1In the partitioned form of stiffness matrixKa, the sub-matrixkiiacorresponds to the noncontact DOFs of component a, sub-matrixkccacorresponds to the contact DOFs of component a andkicais the influence ofkiiaandkcca. In Eq. (8), P and N are sub-matrices related to the DOF on noncontact and contact region, respectively. The off-diagonal sub-matrices L and M represent the influence of the sub-matrices P and N. Now, the contact region is assumed to be free without applied forces. The loading vectorFacan be specified as(9b)Fa=[fia0]where sub-vectorfiacorresponds to externally applied loads at the non-contact DOF.Similar procedures can be applied to the operation of(Kb)−1. The insertion of the above partitioned form of(Ka)−1and(Kb)−1into Eq. (7) provides [45](10)(Na+Nb)λca=F¯abwhereF¯ab=Mafia−Mbfib.Finally, the contact forces can be specified with the form(11)λca=(Na+Nb)−1F¯cabThe shear effect on the wear is negligible [46]. The normal force at node j on the contact region can be derived as(12)Fj=λ˜j⋅n˜jwhereλ˜jis the nodal contact force derived from Eq. (11) andn˜jis the normal vector of node j derived by Gaussian quadrature. Eq. (12) can thus be used to estimate the wear information through Eqs. (2) and (3).In the wear analysis with FE models, revision of contact nodes is generally necessary. Once the normal forceFjat the contact node is positive, i.e., directed outward, the node is under tension, and wear does not occur. Such tensile nodes are removed from the contact region and the contact status is thus revised; then the overall computing procedure must be repeated with the updated FE model. Such a revision procedure is repetitively applied until all contact nodal forces are in compression. The process of detection of contact force is described in Fig. 2.In the case of non-zero clearance, i.e., the difference between radii of the cup and the head, some fictitious elements with very lower stiffness, say, 1.0, have to be added to fill up the clearance. After the first detection for contact nodes in each wear survey, such fictitious elements can be abandoned and the computation is performed subsequently. Therefore, result obtained from the current approach is significant even for cases with large clearance through the detection of contact node process.In this study, an efficient FE model of the prosthesis is constructed with three components: backing, acetabular cup, and femoral head [12,47]. The backing is composed of compact bone with an elemental layer, the acetabular cup is composed of UHMWPE, and the femoral head is composed of either stainless steel or CoCr. The material properties are listed in Table 1[20,21,48]. In the following demonstrations, the exterior diameter of the head for zero abduction case is 28 mm and 26 mm for nonzero abducted ones for purpose of comparison with available literatures. The clearance between the head and the cup is assumed to be zero for all simulating models, and all structures are manufactured without imperfection. Moreover, the thickness of cup is 8 mm and the backing is 3 mm. It is also assumed that the frictional perturbation for the compressive case is negligible [21,46]. The hexahedron 8 nodes element is used with three translational displacements on each node. Mesh convergence test prior to wear computation on the FE model is performed and a re-mesh procedure is also implemented after each iteration in the Newton–Raphson process [43]. The backing and acetabular cup are discretized into 2940 elements and 3702 nodes. The femoral head is discretized into 924 elements and 1906 nodes (see Fig. 3). Because the motion of the femoral head is assumed to be constrained, a hollow sphere shape is made for the femoral head.The contact feature between the cup and the head without clearance is shown in Fig. 4. Here, a relative location is chosen to put the equivalent loads on to make subsequent computation more easily. The hip trajectory (arc length) involves that from the flexion and the extension motion [15,27]. The contact region between the cup and the head is never full under external loadings [13,14,18]. Loads applied to the prosthesis are shown in Fig. 5[48], and the gait cycle is divided into 16 periods of loadings with different angles. The gait cycle involves two main phases: the stance phase and the swing phase. The stance phase lasts from heel strike to toe off and is used to describe the period in which the foot remains in contact with the ground. The swing phase is used to describe the period in which the foot is not in contact with the ground. A rate of 1.5 million gait cycles per year [49,50] is applied and the motion of cyclic sliding with incremental change in six months of service, i.e., 0.75 million gait cycles, is adopted to calculate volumetric wear and wear depth of the acetabular cup. The current wear analysis only focuses on the long-term steady-state wear with geometrical nonlinearity.Furthermore, the modified Newton–Raphson method with arc length search [51] is implemented in the study to ensure stability for each solution. The solver used here is written in F95 multi-thread system by the correspondence author.As described above, the wear coefficient plays an important role in the prediction of the wear behavior [35]. The derivation of the wear coefficientkwis discussed here. Archard's wear law states that the volumetric wear V is related to the wear coefficient, the normal force Fn, and the sliding distance S on the contact regions by (see Eq. (1)),(13)kw=1FnSVThe above equation shows that the wear coefficient is linearly proportional to the volume of wear [36,52]. Recent experimental literature has suggested that the wear coefficient is also dependent on the cross-shear (CS) effect [53]. However, the hip trajectory in this study under the only flexion-extension movement had a constant direction and thus the CS effect is not considered [54].Generally, the wear mass is the major information obtained from either experiments or clinics. Eq. (13) can thus be written in the level of mass as(14)F^n=k^wmwhere m is the wear mass,F^n=FnSρis a collection of environmental terms,ρis the mass density, andk^w=1/kw. The inverse of the wear coefficientkwcan be derived from the slope of theF^nversus m curve. As described previously, the wear coefficient derived from experiments is extensive (e.g., Saikko and Ahlroos [37]; Turell et al. [38]; Kang et al. [39]), a self-averaging strategy is thus introduced next to obtain the wear coefficients for the subsequent calculations.Here, the slope of the worn mass m vs.F^n, i.e.,k^w, for specimen i is designate byxi,wiis the weighting values for i-th specimen to be self-determined within [0.1; 1.0] and n is the number of specimens. The process is recursive until convergence. The self-averaged value ofxican be derived using the equation(15)x¯=∑i=1nwixi/∑i=1nwiThe implementation process and comments list in Appendix.The first demonstration of the current approach refers to the wear tests from the pin-on-disk device performed by Saikko and Ahlroos [55], Yao et al. [56], Saikko [57], Hill et al. [58], and Saikko and Kostamo [52]. The wear coefficients from experiments calculated by the self-average are listed in Table 2and those calculated by the slope of theF^n-mcurve are shown in Fig. 6. The wear coefficient derived here is within the range reported in literature [37,38].Here, the wear analysis of the prosthesis with a CoCr head of 28-mm diameter and a UHMWPE cup is demonstrated. Table 3lists clinical results from 2008 to 2013 as well as that derived by the current approach for one and ten service years. In this demonstration, a zero abduction angle is considered. The linear wear rate is assumed as the maximum wear depth at node of FE model divided by the service years and expressed as mm/year [15,27]. The linear wear rate is calculated from the worn volume as well as the effective area (see Eq. (3a)). In general, volumetric wear derived by clinical inspection was dependent on mathematical conversions based on the linear wear measurements [24,68]. For example, Engh et al. [66] adopted the computer-assisted technique [69] to determine the depth and volume of worn cup directly. The mean wear rate of Engh et al. was defined as the slope using a least-squares linear regression. In Table 3, the linear wear rate from clinical inspections ranged from 0.055 mm/year to 0.250 mm/year and 0.169 for one service year, and 0.181 for ten service years derived by the current approach.Fig. 7shows the profile of wear depth distribution on the acetabular cup by the compressive forces after ten service years derived by the current approach. It shows that the wear depth increases toward the center of the wear surface [18,70], and the maximum wear depth is located at the center of the cup, which has never been told in the clinical supplied information [46,71].The clinical inspections show that the abduction angle is an important factor that affects the wear of the cup [7,72]. However, the evidence in effect on wear of the cup with larger abduction angles is still equivocal. Now, a FE model similar to that used by Little et al. [7] is constructed to simulate a five-year follow-up study of wear for an acetabular cup with abduction angles between 0° and 60°. Fig. 8shows the curves of volumetric wear and the maximum wear depth of the cup with various abduction angles and service years from 0 to 5 derived by the current approach. In contrast to the proportional variation of wear depth to the abduction angle, the variation of volumetric wear presents inverse activity. Fig. 9shows the distribution of corresponding volumetric and linear wear rates versus different abduction angles. For example, the linear wear rate for abduction angle of 45° is approximately 1.04 times higher than abduction angle of 35°; comparable FE results done by Patil et al. [15] was 1.05. Some clinical and numerical studies suggested that linear wear rate is directly proportional to the abduction angle [16,31,46]. But, Queiroz et al. [27] declared a contrary finding. The apparent contradiction is induced by the worn part of the contact regions having never been accounted into the update of structural geometry in Queiroz et al. Moreover, the volumetric wear rate is inversely proportional to the abduction angle [73,74]. However, some clinical reports show contrary results [6,7]. In fact, the volumetric wear is highly dependent on the wear direction [24,32,68]. In 2014, Korduba et al. [34] reported that prior clinical studies did not actively quantify the wear by radiograph technique, making it difficult to correlate changes in abduction angle to quantitative changes in volumetric wear rates. Moreover, D'Lima et al. [75] found that the presence of dynamic instability and impingement in patients with larger abduction angles may lead to excessive volumetric wear rate.Fig. 10shows the contour of the wear depth distribution on the acetabular cup for abduction angles 15°, 30°, 45°, and 60° at the fifth service year while the corresponding von Mises stress distributions under the loading of gait cycle 5 are illustrated in Fig. 11. It is important to note that in the above two figures, larger cup abduction angles may cause the contact region to shift toward the edge of the acetabular cup and make the location of maximum wear depth farther from the center of cup.The alternation of the maximum values such as the wear depth, the von Mises stress, and their corresponding distances from the center of the cup is shown in Fig. 12. From the curves, we can see that the maximum von Mises stress and the maximum wear depth rise following the increment of the abduction angle [28,29]. Hirakawa et al. [5] suggested that a larger abduction angle leads to an increase in subsequent mechanical failure. The distance of the maximum wear depth varies linearly but the maximum von Mises stress varies nonlinearly. The location of the maximum stress separated with the maximum depth location might be caused by the deformity of the cup structure, while the earliest fracture may occur at the position of maximum von Mises stress.
