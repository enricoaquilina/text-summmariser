@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA) models are designed for measuring the productive efficiency of decision making units (DMUs) based merely on historical data. However, in many practical applications, such past results are not sufficient for evaluating a DMU's performance in highly volatile operating environments, such as those with highly volatile crude oil prices and currency exchange rates. That is, in such environments, a DMU's whole performance may be seriously distorted if its future performance, which is sensitive to crude oil price volatility and/or currency fluctuations, is ignored in the evaluation process. However, despite its importance, to our knowledge, there are no DEA models proposed in the literature that explicitly take future performance volatility into account. Hence, this research aims at developing a new system of DEA models that incorporate a DMU's uncertain future performance, and thus can be applied to fully measure their efficiency.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Companies in most, if not all, industries are operating in a volatile world. The pace of change in various business environments has been nothing short of remarkable. Therefore, companies can expect to experience a sustained level of volatility over the next few years. For example, crude oil prices and currency exchange rates have been exhibiting high volatility recently due to both natural and human causes, and will continue to do so. It is evident that every company, regardless of industry, is inevitably affected in different degrees by crude oil prices and/or currency exchange rates. Of particular interest in this paper are the industries that are highly sensitive to macroeconomic indices such as crude oil prices and currency exchange rates. That is, the entirety of company performance in those industries tightly depends on future volatility of the macroeconomic indices. It follows that to thoroughly evaluate such companies’ performance, the evaluator must assess not only their past and present records but also future potential. Obviously, it is very challenging to evaluate a company's performance that involves a past-present-future time span. Hence, this research aims to tackle the problem of how to fully evaluate company performance in highly volatile future environments.DEA has been well recognized as a powerful evaluation tool, and has been applied to a wide variety of practical evaluation applications. It is a non-parametric linear programming technique that measures the relative efficiency of DMUs by capturing the interaction among a common set of multiple inputs and outputs. It is noted that conventional DEA models are designed for measuring the productive efficiency of DMUs based merely on historical data. However, such past results are not sufficient for evaluating a DMU's performance in highly volatile operating environments such as those with highly volatile crude oil prices and currency exchange rates. It is evident that, in such environments, if a DMU's future performance that is sensitive to crude oil price volatility and/or currency fluctuations is ignored in the evaluation process, then its whole performance may be seriously distorted. Hence, the performance-evaluation techniques that explicitly take future volatility into account are unavoidable and indispensable in practice.However, despite its importance, to the best of our knowledge, there are no DEA models proposed in the literature that take future performance volatility into account. We believe that Chang, Tone, and Wu (2015) is the only research work so far that simultaneously takes past, present and future performance indicators into account. Their proposed DEA models are, however, most suitable for conducting performance evaluations for DMUs in which future potential, e.g., R&D expenses, plays a vital role in their competitive success. That is, those DEA models are not designed for evaluating the DMUs’ performance that is sensitive to macroeconomic indices such as crude oil prices and currency exchange rates that are mentioned above. Therefore, this research seeks to develop a new system of DEA models that incorporate the DMUs’ uncertain future performance, and thus can be applied to fully measure the efficiency of the DMUs in volatile environments. To empirically demonstrate the advantages of the proposed new DEA models over conventional DEA models that ignore future efficiency, our proposed DEA models are applied to evaluate the performance of high-tech IC design companies in Taiwan.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 depicts the generalized dynamic evaluation structures. Section 3 introduces the future performance forecasts. In Section 4, the generalized dynamic DEA models are constructed, and different types of efficiency are defined. Section 5 describes the empirical study which was conducted. Section 6 presents conclusions based on this research.Consider a past-present-future intertemporal evaluation structure that consists of (T+k) terms (1,2,…,T+k), where terms (1,…,T−1), term T and term (T+1,…,T+k), respectively, represent the past, present and future time structures. Fig. 1demonstrates such an evaluation structure. As shown in the figure, past and present terms (1,2,…,T) exhibit a typical dynamic structure; however, future terms (T+1,…,T+k) show a non-typical dynamic structure. Therefore, this past-present-future intertemporal evaluation structure is referred to as a generalized dynamic structure in this research. In addition, it is noted that this evaluation structure is an integration of three different single-term structures that correspond to termt(t=1,…,T), term T+1, and terml(l=T+2,…,T+k), respectively. Therefore, in what follows, we first introduce the three single-term evaluation structures. Then, based on these single-term structures, we construct the complete-term evaluation structure. However, to begin with, we need to define the carry-over activities between two consecutive terms that play a critical role in constructing the DEA models that can measure the efficiency that changes over time. Here, we classify the carry-overs into two types to explicitly reflect their actual characteristics: discretionary (free) and non-discretionary (fixed) carry-overs. DMUs can freely handle free carry-overs such as current assets. By contrast, DMUs cannot control fixed carry-overs such as non-current assets. Note that in the generalized dynamic structure, there are carry-overs between pairs of terms(t,t+1),t=1,…,T; however, there are no intermediate carry-overs between pairs of future terms(t,t+1),t=T+1,…,T+(k−1), due to the difficulty of forecasting the related values.First, the evaluation structure with respect to termt(t=1,…,T)is associated with input set t, output set t, incoming carry-over t, and outgoing carry-over t; it is however noted that the incoming carry-over 1 from initial term 0 is usually unknown and is thus omitted (see Tone & Tsutsui, 2010). Second, the non-typical dynamic evaluation structure with respect to future termT+1is comprised of h sub-terms denoted asT+1(l),l=1,…,h. That is, it is assumed that there are h possible states associated with future termT+1; for example, there could have h possible crude oil prices or US dollar currency exchange rates in termT+1. Each sub-termT+1(l)(l=1,…,h)is associated with a transition probability (weight) from present term T to sub-termT+1(l)denoted asplT+1, such that∑l=1hplT+1=1. How to determineplT+1,l=1,…,his detailed in the next section. In addition, each sub-termT+1(l)(l=1,…,h)is associated with input setT+1(l), output setT+1(l), and incoming carry-overT+1(l)with weightplT+1. Third, the structure associated with future termsT+2,T+3,…,T+kis slightly different from that which is associated with future termT+1. More precisely, the only difference between the two structures is that there are no incoming carry-over activities with respect to future termsT+2,T+3,…,T+kbecause of the difficulty of forecasting their corresponding values. However, two consecutive terms between future termsT+2,T+3,…,T+kare still connected with occurrence conditional probability. That is, there is a transition probability (weight) from sub-termT+g(z)(z=1,…,h)of future termT+g(g=1,…,k−1)to sub-termT+(g+1)(l)(l=1,…,h)of future termT+(g+1)that is denoted aspzlT+(g+1). How to determine these transition probabilities is also detailed in the next section. Furthermore, each sub-termT+g(l)(l=1,…,h)of future termT+g(g=2,…,k)is associated with input setT+g(l)and output setT+g(l)with weight∑z=1hpzlT+g. It is noted that the assumption here that there are also h possible states associated with future termsT+2,T+3,…,T+kis just for presentation convenience, but not a requirement.Lastly, Fig. 1 demonstrates the complete generalized dynamic evaluation structure, displaying time spanning past-present-future periods that are constructed based on the three single-term evaluation structures described above. It is evident that the DEA models building on the generalized dynamic structure shown in Fig. 1 can more accurately evaluate a DMU's performance by explicitly taking its forecasted future performance into account. However, to our knowledge, most, if not all, proposed DEA models in the literature do not deal with such a concern.Notice that the forecasted inputs (e.g., cost of sales) and outputs (e.g., net revenue) depicted in Fig. 1 are actually functions of variables (e.g., crude oil prices and currency exchange rates) that are sensitive to highly volatile operating environments. It is quite possible, and common, that different DMUs have different degrees of sensitivity to the variables. Therefore, in such circumstances, to completely evaluate the DMUs, the evaluator must take future performance volatility into account, which is exactly the major point of this research. In addition, each of these variables, e.g., currency exchange rates, may be measured in several different currencies. For example, a DMU may procure resources (input costs) from and sell products (output revenues) to different countries so that it faces different currencies and thus varying currency exchange rates. Theoretically, a variable that involves n different currencies should be treated as n different variables. However, in doing so, the numbers of inputs and outputs, and thus the size of the generalized dynamic evaluation structure shown in Fig. 1, will exponentially and dramatically increase. It follows that the differentiation power of the corresponding generalized dynamic DEA models will significantly decrease. Hence, in this instance, we use a single currency to measure the variables by converting other currencies into that single currency. For example, consider crude oil prices or currency exchange rates based on US dollars by converting other foreign currencies into US dollars.There exist a variety of forecasting methods to predict the values of the above variables (Montgomery, Johnson, & Gardiner, 1990). However, none of them can be considered to be superior to the others in every respect (see e.g., Armstrong, 2001; Ouenniche, Xu, & Tone, 2014). Nonetheless, there are some well-accepted principles, such as short-term forecasts that are generally more accurate than medium- and long-term ones; aggregate forecasts that are generally more precise than single ones; and simple methods that are preferable to complex methods because they are easier to understand and explain. It is noted that the development and the choice of forecasting techniques are themselves big research areas, which are not the focus of this research. This study utilizes the moving average method (see e.g., Montgomery et al., 1990) to estimate the future performance forecasts because the moving average method is one of the most well-known and established forecasting methods in practice (Armstrong, 2001; Sanders & Manrodt, 1994). Furthermore, this research directly applies the data from public domain resources, which generally do not provide detailed information. Under such circumstances, entropy in information theory offers a feasible way for measuring the uncertainty of the probability distributions of random variables (future inputs and outputs in this research) (see, e.g., Kapur, 1989). Kapur (1989, p. 11) states that, “We should take all given information into account and we should scrupulously avoid taking into account any information that is not given to us.” This leads to the renowned maximum-entropy principle that, “aims to give us as uniform or as broad a distribution as possible, subject to the constraints being satisfied (Kapur, 1989, p. 11).” Moreover, based on data availability, future inputs and outputs are treated as discrete random variables that take a finite number of values.The above analysis suggests that this research utilizes the maximum entropy approach to determineplT+1, the transition probability from present term T to sub-termT+1(l)of future termT+1, andpzlT+(g+1), the transition probability from sub-termT+g(z)of future termT+gto sub-termT+(g+1)(l)of future termT+(g+1), that are described in the preceding section. First, the determination ofplT+1,l=1,…,haccording to the principle of maximum entropy can be formulated as the following mathematical problem (P1):(P1)max−∑l=1hplT+1lnplT+1s.t.∑l=1hplT+1qlT+1=ET+1∑l=1hplT+1=1plT+1≥0l=1,…,hwhereqlT+1denotes the forecast of target variable q (e.g., crude oil prices or currency exchange rates) associated with sub-termT+1(l)of future termT+1, andET+1denotes the expected value of q in future termT+1.ET+1is used here to confine the values ofplT+1,l=1,…,h. It is noted that the reason for adding the expected-value constraint in problem (P1) is that, as indicated in Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2013), “When we talk about the 'forecast,' we usually mean the average value of the forecast distribution.” That is, after the forecasting process described above, the expected value,ET+1, is obtained and fixed. Hence, the expected-value constraint must be added into problem (P1). Also note that, in the absence of the expected-value constraint, the solution to mathematical problem (P1) is the uniform probability distribution. Therefore, the maximum entropy principle can be considered as an extension of Laplace's principle of insufficient reasoning (see, e.g., Fang, Rajasekera, & Tsao, 1997). Next, the problem of determiningpzlt,z,l=1,…,h(t=T+2,…,T+k)according to the principle of maximum entropy has the following mathematical form (P2):(P2)max−∑l=1h∑z=1hpzltlnpzlts.t.∑l=1hpzlt=1z=1,…,h(∑z=1hpzlt)/h=pltl=1,…,h∑l=1hpltqlt=Et(|qlt−qzt−1|−|qlt−qmt−1|)(pzlt−pmlt)≤0l,z,m=1,…,hpzlt≥0z,l=1,…,hplt≥0l=1,…,hwhereqltdenotes the forecast of target variable q (e.g., crude oil price or foreign exchange rate) associated with sub-term t(l) of future termt(t=T+2,…,T+k), and Etdenotes the expected value of q in future term t that is known from public domain resources. In addition, the fourth constraints ensure that ifqltis closer toqzt−1than toqmt−1, then the transition probabilitypzltis no less than the transition probabilitypmlt. That is, the constraints ensure that the decisions made in term t should take the information in termt−1into account. It is noted that mathematical problems (P1) and (P2) are concave programming problems with linear constraints, which can be directly solved by using commercial optimization solvers such as LINGO. We refer the reader to, e.g., Kapur (1989) and Fang et al. (1997), for the methods for solving different entropy optimization problems.In addition, letp¯lT+1,l=1,…,handp¯zlt,z,l=1,…,h,t=T+2,…,T+kdefine the solutions after solving problems (P1) and (P2), respectively. If, however, decision makers have their own subjective weight perception onp¯lT+1,l=1,…,handp¯zlt,z,l=1,…,h(t=T+2,…,T+k)denoted, respectively, byϑlT+1,l=1,…,handϕzlt,z,l=1,…,h(t=T+2,…,T+k), then they can modify the solution values by using the following formulas that are similar to the one proposed in Yoon and Hwang (1980).First, with respect top¯lT+1,l=1,…,h,wlT+1=p¯lT+1ϑlT+1∑i=1hp¯iT+1ϑiT+1,l=1,…,h.Then, with respect top¯zlt,z,l=1,…,h(t=T+2,…,T+k),wzlt=p¯zltϕzlt∑j=1hp¯zjtϕzjt,z,l=1,…,h;wlt=(∑z=1hwzlt)/h,l=1,…,h.It follows thatwltcan be used to denote the weight associated with sub-term t(l) of every future termt(t=T+1,…,T+k). It is however noted that decision makers may have different subjective weight perception on inputs and outputs. Therefore, we further separatewltintowl−tandwl+tthat correspond to inputs and outputs, respectively.This research proposes a new system of DEA models which embed the generalized dynamic structure that is described in Section 2. However, the dynamic DEA models with typical dynamic structure such as those proposed in Tone and Tsutsui (2010) can be used as building blocks to develop the generalized dynamic DEA models that incorporate DMUs’ uncertain future performance.To construct the generalized dynamic DEA models, it is assumed that there are n DMUs (j=1,…,n) over (T+k) terms (t=1,…,T+k). In each term t (t=1,…,T), DMUs have common m inputs (i=1,…,m) and s outputs (i=1,…,s). On the other hand, in each term t (t=T+1,…,T+k), DMUs have common r inputs (i=1,…,r), and/or d outputs (i=1,…,d). That is, it is important to note that depending on the considered problems, the future terms T+1,…,T+k may not simultaneously associate both inputs and outputs. Furthermore, let xijt(i=1,…,m) and yijt(i=1,…,s) represent, respectively, the input and output of DMU j in term t (t=1,…,T), anduijtl(i=1,…,r)andvijtl(i=1,…,d)represent, respectively, the input and output of DMU j in sub-term t(l) of future term t(t=T+1,…,T+k). Note and recall that both input uijtland output vijtlare functions of variables, such as crude oil prices and currency exchange rates that are measured by a common currency, e.g., the US dollar.In addition, recall that it is assumed that each future term t(t=T+1,…,T+k) is comprised of h sub-terms (possible states) t(l),l=1,…,h. Moreover, denote the free and fixed carry-overs (links), respectively, aszijtfree(i=1,…,nfree; j=1,…,n; t=1,…,T) andzijtfix(i=1,…,nfix; j=1,…,n; t=1,…,T), where nfree and nfix are the number of free and fixed links, respectively. Recall that there are no carry-over activities with respect to future terms due to the high degree of forecast difficulty.Based on the notation defined above, the production possibility set{(xit,yit,uitl,vitl,zitfree,zitfix)}with respect to the generalized dynamic DEA models is defined as follows:xit≥∑j=1nxijtλjt(i=1,…,m;t=1,…,T)yit≤∑j=1nyijtλjt(i=1,…,s;t=1,…,T)uitl≥∑j=1nuijtlδjlt(i=1,…,r;t=T+1,…,T+k;l=1,…,l)vitl≥∑j=1nvijtlδjlt(i=1,…,d;t=T+1,…,T+k;l=1,…,l)zitfreeunrestricted(i=1,…,nfree;t=1,…,T)zitfix=∑j=1nzijtfixλjt(i=1,…,nfix;t=1,…,T)∑j=1nλjt=1(t=1,…,T)∑j=1nδjlt=1(t=T+1,…,T+k;l=1,…,h)λjt≥0(j=1,…,n;t=1,…,T)δjlt≥0(j=1,…,n;l=1,…,h;t=T+1,…,T+k)In the above production possibility set,λt∈Rn(t=1,…,T)andδlt∈Rn(l=1,…,h;t=T+1,…,T+k)are the intensity vectors, and the third and fourth to last constraints correspond to the variable returns-to-scale assumption (if the constraints are omitted, then the production possibility set is associated with the assumption of constant returns to scale). Furthermore, it is noted that xijtand yijt, and uijtland vijtlon the right-hand side of the above constraints are, respectively, observed and forecasted positive data, while xit, yit, uitl, and vitlon the left-hand side of the constraints are all variables. Moreover, notice that the constraints in the production possibility set are defined separately for each term. Hence, to ensure the continuity of link flows (carry-overs) between two consecutive terms of the past (1,…,T−1), present (T) and the first future (T+1) terms, we need to include the following conditions:∑j=1nzijtfreeλjt=∑j=1nzijtfreeλjt+1(∀i=1,…,nfree;t=1,…,T−1);∑j=1nzijtfixλjt=∑j=1nzijtfixλjt+1(∀i=1,…,nfix;t=1,…,T−1);∑j=1nzijTfreeλjT=∑l=1hplT+1(∑j=1nzijTfreeδjlT+1)(∀i=1,…,nfree);∑j=1nzijTfixλjT=∑l=1hplT+1(∑j=1nzijTfixδjlT+1)(∀i=1,…,nfix).Based on the production possibility set that is constructed in the preceding subsection, this research develops the DEA models that incorporate uncertain future performance. It is emphasized that all the proposed models are non-radial slacks-based measure (SBM) models (Tone, 2001). That is, these models consider the excesses associated with inputs and/or the shortfalls associated with outputs as the main targets of the evaluation. In addition, due to that, depending on the considered problems, the future terms T+1,…,T+k may not simultaneously associate both inputs and outputs. This research considers input-oriented, output-oriented and non-oriented models, which are introduced in that sequence in the following subsections.However, for modeling convenience, we first denote DMUo(o=1,…,n) as follows:(1)xiot=∑j=1nxijtλjt+siot−(i=1,…,m;t=1,…,T)(2)yiot=∑j=1nyijtλjt−siot+(i=1,…,s;t=1,…,T)(3)ziotfree=∑j=1nzijtfreeλjt+siotfree(i=1,…,nfree;t=1,…,T)(4)ziotfix=∑j=1nzijtfixλjt(i=1,…,nfix;t=1,…,T)(5)∑j=1nzijtfreeλjt=∑j=1nzijtfreeλjt+1(∀i=1,…,nfree;t=1,…,T−1)(6)∑j=1nzijtfixλjt=∑j=1nzijtfixλjt+1(∀i=1,…,nfix;t=1,…,T−1)(7)∑j=1nλjt=1(t=1,…,T)(8)λjt≥0(∀j,t)(9)siot−≥0(∀i,t)(10)siot+≥0(∀i,t)(11)siotfree:unrestrictedinsign(∀i,t)(12)uiotl=∑j=1nuijtlδjlt+eiotl−(i=1,…,r;t=T+1,…,T+k;l=1,…,h)(13)viotl=∑j=1nvijtlδjlt−eiotl+(i=1,…,d;t=T+1,…,T+k;l=1,…,h)(14)∑j=1nzijTfreeλjT=∑l=1hplT+1(∑j=1nzijTfreeδjlT+1)(∀i=1,…,nfree)(15)∑j=1nzijTfixλjT=∑l=1hplT+1(∑j=1nzijTfixδjlT+1)(∀i=1,…,nfix)(16)∑j=1nδjlt=1(t=T+1,…,T+k;l=1,…,h)(17)δjlt≥0(∀j,l,t)(18)eiotl−≥0(∀i,l,t)(19)eiotl+≥0(∀i,l,t)The input-oriented generalized dynamic DEA model corresponding to DMUo(o= 1,…,n) can be expressed as follows:(20)θo*=min1∑t=1T+kαt[∑t=1Tαt[1−1m(∑i=1mρi−siot−xiot)]+∑t=T+1T+kαt∑l=1hwl−t[1−1r(∑i=1rμi−eiotl−uiotl)]]subject to (1)–(19).where αtis the term weight corresponding to termt(t=1,…,T+k)that is specified by the evaluator,wl−t, defined in Section 3, is the evaluator-specified future sub-term input weight corresponding to sub-termt(l)(l=1,…,h)of future termt(t=T+1,…,T+k), andρi−,μi−are the evaluator-specified past-present input weight and future input weight that correspond, respectively, to past-present inputi(i=1,…,m)and future inputi(i=1,…,r). In addition, the weights are set to satisfy the following conditions:∑l=1hwl−t=1(t=T+1,…,T+k),∑i=1mρi−=m,and∑i=1rμi−=rIt is evident that the objective function involves T+hk efficiency-related scores measured by the relative slacks of inputs, where T scores are related to the T past-present terms, and hk scores are related to the k future terms, with each consisting of h sub-terms. That is, the objective function is defined as the weighted average of T+hk efficiency-related scores measured by the relative slacks of inputs. Note that each score is unit-invariant with a value less than or equal to 1 (the latter is realized when all the corresponding slacks are zero). It follows that the objective function value is less than or equal to 1. Recall that future sub-term input weightwl−t(l=1,…,h;t=T+1,…,T+k)in objective function (20) is derived fromp¯lT+1(l=1,…,h)andp¯zlt(z,l=1,…,h;t=T+2,…,T+k), which are the solutions after solving problems (P1) and (P2) in Section 3, respectively.Let the optimal solution to the above model be,λjt*,δjlt*,siot−*,siot+*,siotfree*,eiotl−*,eiotl+*(∀i,j,t,l). It is important to note that, sincesiotfreeis unrestricted in sign (i.e., ifsiotfree>0, then the current valueziotfreeis excessive and ifsiotfree<0, thenziotfreeis deficient), slacks in the free links are not considered in the objective function of the input-oriented past-present DEA model. However, as shown in Tone and Tsutsui (2010), the slacks can be taken into account in either of the following two ways: (1) the ex post way; and (2) the binary mixed integer fractional programming approach. We refer the reader to Tone and Tsutsui (2010) for the latter approach and consider only the former method. That is, letsiotfree*−=max{0,siotfree*}andsiotfree*+=−min{0,siotfree*}.Then, we can define the input-oriented overall efficiencyθo*asθo*=1∑t=1T+kαt[∑t=1Tαt[1−1m+nfree(∑i=1mρi−siot−*xiot+∑i=1nfreesiotfree*−ziotfree)]+∑t=T+1T+kαt∑l=1hwl−t[1−1r(∑i=1rμi−eiotl−*uiotl)]].Besides, in such a generalized dynamic evaluation structure,θo*is actually the weighted average of T+hk efficiency scores that are represented byθot*,t=1,…,Tandθotl*,t=T+1,…,T+k,l=1,…,h. That is,θot*=1−1m+nfree(∑i=1mρi−siot−*xiot+∑i=1nfreesiotfree*−ziotfree),(t=1,…,T);θotl*=1−1r(∑i=1rμi−eiotl−*uiotl),(t=T+1,…,T+k,l=1,…,h).Therefore, the input-oriented overall efficiency, i.e.,θo*, can be defined as follows:θo*=1∑t=1T+kαt(∑t=1Tαtθot*+∑t=T+1T+kαt∑l=1hwl−tθotl*).Definition 1input-oriented term efficientIfθot*(t=1,…,T)=1andθotl*(t=T+1,…,T+k,l=1,…,h)=1, then DMUois referred to as input-oriented term efficient with respect to past-present termt(t=1,…,T)and sub-termt(l)(l=1,…,h)of future termt(t=T+1,…,T+k), respectively.Definition 2input-oriented overall efficientIfθo*=1, then DMUois referred to as input-oriented overall efficient.Theorem 1DMUo is input-oriented overall efficient, if and only if all T+hk terms are input-oriented term efficient, i.e.,θot*=1,t=1,…,Tandθotl*=1,t=T+1,…,T+k,l=1,…,h.ProofThe proof to Theorem 1 is straightforward (see e.g., Tone & Tsutsui, 2010), and is thus omitted here.□The output-oriented generalized dynamic DEA model corresponding to DMUo(o=1,…,n) can be expressed as follows:(21)1τo*=max1∑t=1T+kαt[∑t=1Tαt[1+1s(∑i=1sρi+siot+yiot)]+∑t=T+1T+kαt∑l=1hwl+t[1+1d(∑i=1dμi+eiotl+viotl)]]subject to (1)–(19).where αthas the same definition as that in Section 4.2.1,wl+tis the evaluator-specified future sub-term output weight, andρi+,μi+are the evaluator-specified past-present output weight and future output weight that correspond, respectively, to past-present outputi(i=1,…,s)and future outputi(i=1,…,d). In addition, the weights,wl+t,ρi+andμi+are set to satisfy the following conditions:∑l=1hwl+t=1(t=T+1,…,T+k),∑i=1sρi+=s,and∑i=1dμi+=d.The objective function is clearly defined as the weighted average of T+hk efficiency-related scores measured by the relative slacks of outputs. Each score is unit-invariant with a value greater than or equal to 1 (the latter is realized when all the corresponding slacks are zero). It follows that the objective function value is greater than or equal to 1. Recall that future sub-term output weightwl+t(l=1,…,h;t=T+1,…,T+k)in objective function (21) is derived fromp¯lT+1(l=1,…,h)andp¯zlt(z,l=1,…,h;t=T+2,…,T+k), which are the solutions after solving problems (P1) and (P2) in Section 3, respectively.Let the optimal solution to the above model be,λjt*,δjlt*,siot−*,siot+*,siotfree*,eiotl−*,eiotl+*(∀i,j,t,l), wheresiotfree*is dealt with in the same way as that mentioned in Section 4.2.1. Then, we can define the output-oriented overall efficiencyτo*asτo*=11∑t=1T+kαt[∑t=1Tαt[1+1s+nfree(∑i=1sρi+siot+*yiot+∑i=1nfreesiotfree*+ziotfree)]+∑t=T+1T+kαt∑l=1hwl+t[1+1d(∑i=1dμi+eiotl+*viotl)]]Similar to the analysis in Section 4.2.1, here,τo*is the weighted average of T+hk efficiency scores that are represented by1τot*,t=1,…,Tand1τotl*,t=T+1,…,T+k,l=1,…,h. That is,1τot*=1+1s+nfree(∑i=1sρi+siot+*yiot+∑i=1nfreesiotfree*+ziotfree),(t=1,…,T);1τotl*=1+1d(∑i=1dμi+eiotl+*viotl),(t=T+1,…,T+k,l=1,…,h).Therefore, the output-oriented overall efficiency, i.e.,τo*, can be defined as follows:τo*=11∑t=1T+kαt(∑t=1Tαt1τot*+∑t=T+1T+kαt∑l=1hwl+t1τotl*).Definition 3output-oriented term efficientIfτot*(t=1,…,T)=1andτotl*(t=T+1,…,T+k,l=1,…,h)=1, then DMUois referred to as output-oriented term efficient with respect to past-present termt(t=1,…,T)and sub-termt(l)(l=1,…,h)of future termt(t=T+1,…,T+k), respectively.Definition 4output-oriented overall efficientIfτo*=1, then DMUois referred to as output-oriented overall efficient.Theorem 2DMUo is output-oriented overall efficient, if and only if all T+hk terms are output-oriented term efficient, i.e.,τot*=1,t=1,…,Tandτotl*=1,t=T+1,…,T+k,l=1,…,h.ProofSee the proof to Theorem 1.□The non-oriented generalized dynamic DEA model corresponding to DMUo(o=1,…,n) can be expressed as follows:(22)ϖo*=min1∑t=1T+kαt[∑t=1Tαt[1−1m(∑i=1mρi−siot−xiot)]+∑t=T+1T+kαt∑l=1hwl−t[1−1r(∑i=1rμi−eiotl−uiotl)]]1∑t=1T+kαt[∑t=1Tαt[1+1s(∑i=1sρi+siot+yiot)]+∑t=T+1T+kαt∑l=1hwl+t[1+1d(∑i=1dμi+eiotl+viotl)]]subject to (1)–(19).where αt,wl−t,ρi−,μi−,wl+t,ρi+, andμi+have the same definitions as those in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.It is noted that the non-oriented generalized dynamic DEA model (i.e., (1)–(19), (22)) is a fractional (nonlinear) program. Therefore, we transform the model into a liner program by using the Charnes–Cooper transformation (see e.g., Cooper, Seiford, & Tone, 2007). The detailed transformation procedure is shown in Appendix A. Let the optimal solution to model (1)–(19), (22) be,λjt*,δjlt*,siot−*,siot+*,siotfree*,eiotl−*,eiotl+*(∀i,j,t,l), wheresiotfree*is dealt with in the same way as that mentioned in Section 4.2.1. Then, we can define the non-oriented predicted overall efficiencyϖo*asϖo*=∑t=1Tαt[1−1m+nfree(∑i=1mρi−siot−*xiot+∑i=1nfreesiotfree*−ziotfree)]+∑t=T+1T+kαt∑l=1hwl−t[1−1r(∑i=1rμi−eiotl−*uiotl)]∑t=1Tαt[1+1s+nfree(∑i=1sρi+siot+*yiot+∑i=1nfreesiotfree*+ziotfree)]+∑t=T+1T+kαt∑l=1hwl+t[1+1d(∑i=1dμi+eiotl+*viotl)].In addition, we define the non-oriented term efficiency asϖot*=1−1m+nfree(∑i=1mρi−siot−*xiot+∑i=1nfreesiotfree*−ziotfree)1+1s+nfree(∑i=1sρi+siot+*yiot+∑i=1nfreesiotfree*+ziotfree),with respect to past-present termt(t=1,…,T);ϖotl*=1−1r(∑i=1rμi−eiotl−*uiotl)1+1d(∑i=1dμi+eiotl+*viotl),with respect to sub-termt(l)(l=1,…,h)of future termt(t=T+1,…,T+k).Definition 5non-oriented term efficientIfϖot*=1(t=1,…,T)andϖotl*=1(t=T+1,…,T+k,l=1,…,h), then DMUois referred to as non-oriented term efficient with respect to past-present termt(t=1,…,T)and sub-termt(l)(l=1,…,h)of future termt(t=T+1,…,T+k), respectively.Definition 6non-oriented overall efficientIfϖo*=1, then DMUois referred to as non-oriented overall efficient.Theorem 3DMUo is non-oriented overall efficient, if and only if all T+hk terms are non-oriented term efficient, i.e.,ϖot*=1,t=1,…,Tandϖotl*=1,t=T+1,…,T+k,l=1,…,h.ProofSee the proof to Theorem 1.□The proposed generalized dynamic DEA models are new to the DEA literature. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to analyze and evaluate this new system of DEA models. To begin with, we use a flow chart shown in Fig. 2to summarize the whole procedure introduced in the previous sections for conducting the empirical study; that is, (1) choosing inputs (e.g., cost of sales), outputs (e.g., net revenue), and carry-overs (e.g., current assets and non-current assets), (2) identifying affecting macroeconomic index (e.g., currency exchange rate), (3) using a forecasting method (e.g., moving average method) to estimate the values of the macroeconomic index, (4) specifying the states of nature of the macroeconomic index, and computing their corresponding transition probabilities by using, e.g., the maximum entropy approach, (5) computing the forecasts of inputs and outputs from the forecasts of the macroeconomic index (recalling that the forecasted inputs (e.g., cost of sales) and outputs (e.g., net revenue) are functions of the macroeconomic index (e.g., currency exchange rate)), (6) specifying input, output and term weights, (7) solving the generalized dynamic DEA models for each DMU, and (8) analyzing efficiency scores and providing managerial guidelines.The empirical study is conducted based on actual data concerning high-tech IC design companies in Taiwan. It is well known that the IC design industry is extremely competitive. An IC design company usually procures raw materials from a few different countries, seeking to lower its operational costs. And, at the same time, seeks to sell its products to as many countries as possible to increase profits. Hence, an IC design company's operations performance is very sensitive to today's highly volatile international currency exchange rates. To conduct this empirical study, we extract the empirical data, comprising 40 IC design companies, from the Taiwan Economic Journal (TEJ) database, utilizing only the latest periods, year 2010 to year 2014 (i.e.,T=5) due to concerns over the ineffectiveness of prior data. That is, short-term forecasts are generally more accurate than medium- and long-term ones under highly volatile operating environments.To justify the efficacy of the proposed new DEA models, this study uses the cross-validation technique to benchmark their performance against realized outcomes. That is, we separate the 2010–2014 data into training and testing sets in which the 2010–2013 data are used for training, and the 2014 data are used for testing. Then, we apply the moving average method to predict year 2014 forecasts (i.e., considering single future term, and thusk=1) based on the TEJ data from years 2010 to 2013. That is, here, 2010–2012 (term 1–term 3) are past terms, 2013 (term 4) is the present term, and 2014 (term 5) represents future terms. In addition, to develop benchmarks, this research uses the SBM DEA models proposed in Tone (2001) and the dynamic SBM DEA models proposed in Tone and Tsutsui (2010) to measure the productive efficiency of the 40 IC design companies based on known historical data. These benchmarks are detailed below.In the following, we first explain the selected inputs, outputs, carry-overs and future performance indicators for the illustrated IC design firms, and then show and analyze the empirical results.This study considers cost of sales as the single input indicator associated with past, present and future terms; that is,m=r=1.The cost of sales normally includes materials, labor, and allocated overheads, and thus contributes directly to the revenue of a firm. More precisely, the cost of sales measures the cost of goods or services supplied in a particular period. On the other hand, this research considers net revenue as the single output indicator associated with past, present and future terms; that is,s=d=1. The net revenue is defined by the International Accounting Standards (IAS 18) as the gross inflow of economic benefits during the period arising in the course of the ordinary activities of an entity when those inflows result in increases in equity, other than increases relating to contributions from equity participants. Note that the net revenue primarily arises from the sale of goods or the performance of services. The realized input and output data with respect to past (years 2010–2012), present (year 2013) and future (year 2014) terms are shown in Tables 1–5, and comprise 40 companies; the unit of currency used in these tables is the New Taiwan Dollar (NT$). In addition, to maintain confidentiality for using their data in this research, the names of the companies have been replaced by Arabic numerals. It is noted that the realized 2014 “future” data in Table 5 are used as a test data set, and recall that the 2014 forecasts are obtained by using the moving average method, which is discussed in more detail below.Furthermore, this research treats a firm's total assets as carry-over activities that connect two consecutive terms. Total assets are, here, further classified into free carry-over and fixed carry-over due to that assets are economic resources owned by a firm that are probably used to produce future economic benefits. More precisely, free carry-over (current assets) denotes the assets that a firm expects to convert to cash or use up within one year (or one operating cycle, whichever is longer). Current assets here may be cash and cash equivalents, receivables, inventories and short-term investments. In contrast, fixed carry-over (non-current assets) denotes the assets that are not easily converted into cash or used up within one year (or one operating cycle, whichever is longer). That is, non-current assets here may be property, plant and equipment, long-term investments and intangible assets. Note that managers usually have greater discretion to handle the current assets, but have less discretion to dispose of the non-current assets, which are thus treated as fixed carry-overs. Note also that each of the past and present terms is associated with a free and a fixed carry-over; that is,nfree=nfix=1.The free and fixed carry-overs with respect to past (years 2010–2012), present (year 2013) and future (year 2014) terms are also shown in Tables 1–5.Moreover, it is noted that the data in the TEJ database are actually aggregate data. That is, the data do not show the IC design companies’ detailed sources and corresponding quantities of costs, and detailed outlets and corresponding quantities of sales. In addition, the cost of sales and net revenue are all transformed into the same currency of the New Taiwan Dollar (NT$). We, therefore, can only use the aggregate data by applying the moving average method to predict 2014 cost of sales and 2014 net revenue. Nonetheless, aggregate forecasts are generally more precise than single ones. Besides, we adapt the so-called three-sigma rule of thumb to take future uncertainty into account because it is well known that nearly all values are taken to lie within three standard deviations of the mean. That is, it is assumed here that each future term is associated with three inputs corresponding to the cost of sales, and three outputs corresponding to the net revenue (i.e.,h=3). The three inputs (outputs) are defined as the expected value, minimum, and maximum of the cost of sales (the net revenue) of the future term. The minimum and maximum are defined, respectively, asmax{μ−3σ,ς}andmin{μ+3σ,ξ}, where μ, σ, ς and ξ denote the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum of the corresponding raw (i.e., years 2010–2013) data, respectively. Note that μ also denotesET+1(=E5,here)in problem (P1), which is used to derive the transition probabilitypT+1(=p5,here)according to the principle of maximum entropy. The resulting forecasted inputs and outputs with respect to future (year 2014) term are shown in Table 6.Finally, the term weightsαt,t=1,…,5are set as follows:α1=0.7,α2=0.8,α3=0.9,α4=1,α5=0.9; that is, it is assumed that the importance of the information decreases over time. Besides, we set past-present input weightρ1−=1, future input weightμ1−=1, past-present output weightρ1+=1, and future output weightμ1+=1. Lastly, based on the data in Table 6, we estimate future sub-term input weight, future sub-term output weight, and transition probability as follows: First, respectively solve the mathematical problem (P1) 40 times with respect to the forested inputs and forecasted outputs to obtain 40 possible future sub-term input weights and 40 possible future sub-term output weights, with each corresponding to a DMU. Then, future sub-term input weightswi−5,i=1,2,3, and future sub-term output weightswi+5,i=1,2,3are set to be the averages of the 40 possible future sub-term input weights, and 40 possible future sub-term output weights, respectively. That is,w1−5=0.358734,w2−5=0.339835,w3−5=0.301431, andw1+5=0.37963,w2+5=0.341791,w3+5=0.278579correspond to forested inputs and forecasted outputs, respectively. The transition probabilitiespi5(i=1,2,3)are then obtained by taking the average ofwi−5(i=1,2,3)andwi+5(i=1,2,3); that is,p15=0.369182,p25=0.340813,p35=0.290005.This section mainly analyzes two types of empirical results. First, we contrast past-present efficiency scores with past-present-future (overall) ones. Second, we benchmark the outcomes obtained from the proposed generalized dynamic DEA models with the realized (true) ones to justify the efficacy of these new proposed DEA models.In this section, we compare two sets of efficiency scores of the 40 IC design companies (i.e., overall and past-present efficiency scores) obtained by, respectively, solving the generalized dynamic DEA models, and the generalized dynamic DEA models, but ignoring the future terms, which is equivalent to the dynamic SBM DEA models proposed by Tone and Tsutsui (2010). The resulting term (past, present and future), past-present, and overall efficiency scores corresponding to input-, output- and non-oriented DEA models are shown in Tables 7–9, respectively. These three tables clearly show that the same 12 out of the 40 DMUs are input-, output- and non-oriented overall efficient. Note that according to Theorems 1–3, a DMU is (input-, output- or non-oriented) overall efficient if and only if the DMU's whole terms are (input-, output- or non-oriented) term efficient. Besides, Fig. 3graphically demonstrates the input-, output- and non-oriented overall efficiency scores with respect to the 40 DMUs. It turns out that DMU 24 has the greatest difference of 0.409451 among the three scores of 0.723425 (input-oriented), 0.360383 (output-oriented) and 0.313974 (non-oriented).Moreover, Tables 7–9 also show that 15, 16, and 15 out of the 40 DMUs are input-, output- and non-oriented past-present efficient, respectively. Fig. 4graphically demonstrates the input-, output- and non-oriented past-present efficiency scores with respect to the 40 DMUs. These results indicate that three (DMUs 4, 17, and 19), four (DMUs 4, 13, 17 and 19) and three (DMUs 4, 17, and 19) DMUs, respectively, corresponding to input-, output- and non-oriented DEA models, which are efficient based on past-present performance, are turned into inefficient DMUs once future performance is considered in the performance evaluation. By contrast, the results also show that DMUs 16, 34, and 36 are inefficient based on their past-present performance, but are all efficient DMUs according to their future performance. Such a fact evidently signals the importance of taking the future performance into account when evaluating a DMU's overall performance. Fig. 5graphically shows the difference between past-present and overall efficiency scores with respect to the 40 DMUs. The greatest (average) difference between the two scores are 0.105966 (0.02724), 0.240765 (0.019351) and 0.25783 (0.025118) corresponding to the input-, output- and non-oriented DEA modes, respectively. DMU 19 turns out to be the one who possesses the greatest difference between the two scores in all of the three DEA models. Here, it is important to note that, as shown in Tables 7–9, there is no specific (positive or negative) relationship between past-present and overall performances. That is, the empirical results presented in Tables 7–9 show that if future performance indicators are omitted when conducting a performance evaluation, then the DMUs’ performance may either be overestimated or underestimated.This research uses the SBM DEA models proposed in Tone (2001) and the dynamic SBM DEA models proposed in Tone and Tsutsui (2010) to develop benchmarks. To be more specific, the SBM DEA models are used to measure the present (i.e., year 2013) efficiency. On the other hand, the dynamic SBM DEA models are used to measure both the past-present (i.e., years 2010–2013) efficiency, and the realized overall (i.e., years 2010–2014) efficiency. In contrast, the proposed generalized dynamic DEA models are used to measure the (predicted) overall (i.e., years 2010–2014) efficiency. The resulting realized overall, present, past-present and (predicted) overall efficiency scores corresponding to input-, output- and non-oriented DEA models are shown in Tables 10–12, respectively. Tables 10–12 clearly show that both the past-present and the (predicted) overall performance significantly outperform the present one. Therefore, in what follows, we focus more on analyzing the empirical results obtained from the DEA models that provide the past-present and the (predicted) overall efficiency scores.Table 10 shows that in the input-oriented case; 13, 3, 15 and 12 out of the 40 DMUs are realized overall, present, past-present, and (predicted) overall efficient, respectively. It turns out that DMUs 4 and 19 are wrongly considered as efficient DMUs based on their past-present performance. By contrast, DMU 17 is wrongly considered as an inefficient DMU according to its (predicted) overall efficiency score. The absolute average (maximum) deviation between the realized overall efficiency scores and the present, past-present, and (predicted) overall efficiency scores are 0.26 (0.8134), 0.0649 (0.3609) and 0.0538 (0.274), respectively. DMU 17 possesses the maximum deviation with respect to the input-oriented case, and DMU 29 possesses the maximum deviation with respect to both output- and non-oriented cases.Furthermore, Table 11shows that in the output-oriented case; 13, 3, 16 and 12 out of the 40 DMUs are realized overall, present, past-present, and predicted overall efficient, respectively. It is found that DMUs 4, 13 and 19 are wrongly considered as efficient DMUs based on their past-present performance. By contrast, DMU 17 is wrongly considered as an inefficient DMU according to its (predicted) overall efficiency score. The absolute average (maximum) deviation between the realized overall efficiency scores and the present, past-present, and (predicted) overall efficiency scores are 0.2448 (0.6927), 0.0595 (0.4998) and 0.0568 (0.4946), respectively. DMU 16 possesses the maximum deviation with respect to the input-oriented case. In addition, DMU 24 possesses the maximum deviation with respect to both output- and non-oriented cases.Moreover, Table 12shows that in the non-oriented case; 13, 3, 15 and 12 out of the 40 DMUs are realized overall, present, past-present, and (predicted) overall efficient, respectively. Similar to the input-oriented case, DMUs 4 and 19 are wrongly considered as efficient DMUs based on their past-present performance, and DMU 17 is wrongly considered as an inefficient DMU according to its (predicted) overall efficiency score. The absolute average (maximum) deviation between the realized overall efficiency scores and present, past-present, and (predicted) overall efficiency scores are 0.2505 (0.8147), 0.0645 (0.5074) and 0.0578 (0.5042), respectively. DMU 17 possesses the maximum deviation with respect to the input-oriented case, but DMU 24 possesses the maximum deviation with respect to both output- and non-oriented cases. Fig. 6graphically demonstrates the absolute average and the absolute maximum deviations of the present, past-present and (predicted) overall efficiency scores from the corresponding realized overall ones with respect to the input-, output- and non-oriented cases.Lastly, we apply ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to measure how well the forecasts of the 2014 input (cost of sales) and output (net revenue), obtained by using the moving average method, explain the corresponding realized 2014 ones. The resulting R-squared (coefficient of determination) values on the mean, minimum, and maximum forecasted cost of sales and net revenue data range from 0.8876 (min net revenue) to 0.9862 (max cost of sales). That is, the R-squared values suggest a good fit of the OLS lines. In addition, the results of the t-test show that the null hypothesis of forecasted outcomes being indifferent from the realized ones cannot be rejected. That is, the moving average method performs quite well on the considered empirical example that concerns the high-tech IC design companies in Taiwan.In summary, taking the realized overall efficiency scores, obtained based on 2010–2014 realized data, as benchmarks, our proposed generalized dynamic DEA models (based on both 2010–2013 past-present data and predicted 2014 data) outperform the dynamic SBM DEA models (based on 2010–2013 past-present data) proposed by Tone and Tsutsui (2010), and significantly outperform the SBM DEA models (based on only 2013 present data) proposed by Tone (2001). That is, by contrast to realized 2014 outcomes, the empirical results clearly justify the efficacy of our proposed generalized dynamic DEA models.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This study proposes a new system of generalized dynamic DEA models that simultaneously and explicitly take DMUs’ past, present and future actions into account to evaluate the DMUs’ overall performance. The user can embed any forecasting technique into the models to predict future values of considered inputs and outputs. We note that the accuracy of the forecasts has an impact on the performance of the generalized dynamic DEA models. However, we re-emphasize that this research does not address the development nor the choice of forecasting techniques, which are themselves big research areas. To date, there are very limited DEA studies in the literature that consider a DMU's future performance. Actually, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to attempt developing DEA models for evaluating a DMU's future performance in highly volatile operating environments, with, for example, highly volatile crude oil prices and/or currency exchange rates. In addition, it is worth mentioning that this study applies the maximum entropy approach to deal with uncertain future circumstances. We believe that entropy theory can play an import role in developing the past-present-future intertemporal DEA models.In this research, the proposed generalized dynamic DEA models are applied to the IC design industry. The companies therein procure raw materials from and sell products to multiple countries, and are thus faced with highly dynamic currency exchange rates, which makes the industry a typical application of the proposed new DEA models. Therefore, this study conducts an empirical study based on the real data concerning high-tech IC design companies in Taiwan. The empirical results verify the importance of taking the future performance into account when evaluating a DMU's overall performance. In addition, the empirical results also justify the efficacy of the generalized dynamic DEA models by using the cross-validation technique. That is, our proposed new DEA models outperform the well-known (dynamic) SBM DEA models in terms of both average and maximum deviations from the realized overall efficiency scores.Finally, we would like to emphasize that due to data availability, we cannot estimate the cost of sales (input) and net revenue (output) from forecasted currency exchange rates (macroeconomic index). Recall that the forecasted inputs and outputs should be functions of foreign exchange rates. Therefore, we have no choice but to apply the moving average method to directly forecast future inputs and outputs from historical data. That is, the forecasts cannot fully reflect the highly volatile operating environments. We believe that detailed data, if available, can further reveal the value of the proposed new past-present-future intertemporal DEA models.This appendix details the procedure for transforming the fractional (nonlinear) non-oriented generalized dynamic DEA model (i.e., (1)–(19), (22)) into a liner program by using the Charnes–Cooper transformation. First, we introduce a positive variable g in such a way thatg(∑t=1Tαt[1+1s(∑i=1sρi+siot+yiot)]+∑t=T+1T+kαt∑l=1hwl+t[1+1d(∑i=1dμi+eiotl+viotl)])=1.Then, we setgsiot+=s^iot+,gsiot−=s^iot−,gsiotfree=s^iotfree,geiotl+=e^iotl+,geiotl−=e^iotl−,gλjt=λ^jtandgδjlt=δ^jlt. It follows that model (1)–(19), (22) can be replaced by the following equivalent(A.1)ϖo*=min1∑t=1T+kαt[∑t=1Tαt[g−1m(∑i=1mρi−s^iot−xiot)]+∑t=T+1T+kαt∑l=1hwl−t[g−1r(∑i=1rμi−e^iotl−uiotl)]]subject to(A.2)1∑t=1T+kαt[∑t=1Tαt[g+1s(∑i=1sρi+s^iot+yiot)]+∑t=T+1T+kαt∑l=1hwl+t[g+1d(∑i=1dμi+e^iotl+viotl)]]=1(A.3)gxiot=∑j=1nxijtλ^jt+s^iot−(i=1,…,m;t=1,…,T)(A.4)gyiot=∑j=1nyijtλ^jt−s^iot+(i=1,…,s;t=1,…,T)(A.5)gziotfree=∑j=1nzijtfreeλ^jt+s^iotfree(i=1,…,nfree;t=1,…,T)(A.6)gziotfix=∑j=1nzijtfixλ^jt(i=1,…,nfix;t=1,…,T)(A.7)∑j=1nzijtfreeλ^jt=∑j=1nzijtfreeλ^jt+1(∀i=1,…,n;t=1,…,T−1)(A.8)∑j=1nzijtfixλ^jt=∑j=1nzijtfixλ^jt+1(∀i=1,…,n;t=1,…,T−1)(A.9)∑j=1nλ^jt=g(t=1,…,T)(A.10)λ^jt≥0(∀j,t)(A.11)s^iot−≥0(∀i,t)(A.12)s^iot+≥0(∀i,t)(A.13)s^iotfree:unrestrictedinsign(∀i,t)(A.14)guiotl=∑j=1nuijtlλ^jlt+e^iotl−(i=1,…,r;t=T+1,…,T+k;l=1,…,h)(A.15)gviotl=∑j=1nvijtlλ^jlt−e^iotl+(i=1,…,d;t=T+1,…,T+k;l=1,…,h)(A.16)∑j=1nzijTfreeλ^jT=∑l=1hplT+1(∑j=1nzijTfreeδ^jlT+1)(∀i=1,…,n)(A.17)∑j=1nzijTfixλ^jT=∑l=1hplT+1(∑j=1nzijTfixδ^jlT+1)(∀i=1,…,n)(A.18)∑j=1nδ^jlt=g(t=T+1,…,T+k;l=1,…,h)(A.19)δ^jlt≥0(∀j,l,t)(A.20)e^iotl−≥0(∀i,l,t)(A.21)e^iotl+≥0(∀i,l,t)(A.22)g>0Let the optimal solution to model (A.1)–(A.22) beλ^jt*,δ^jlt*,s^iot−*,s^iot+*,s^iotfree*,e^iotl−*,e^iotl+*,g*(∀i,j,t,l). We then have the optimal solution to model (1)–(19), (22) defined byλjt*=λ^jt*g*,δjlt*=δ^jlt*g*,siot−*=s^iot−*g*,siot+*=s^iot+*g*,siotfree*=s^iotfree*g*,eiotl−*=e^iotl−*g*,eiotl+*=e^iotl+*g*(∀i,j,t,l), wheresiotfree*is dealt with in the same way as that mentioned in Section 4.2.1.
