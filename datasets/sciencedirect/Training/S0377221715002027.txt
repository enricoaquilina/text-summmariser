@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We develop a model for optimal location of retail stores on a network. The objective is to maximize the total profit of the network subject to a minimum ROI (or ROI threshold) required at each store. Our model determines the location and number of stores, allocation of demands to the stores, and total investment. We formulate a store’s profit as a jointly concave function in demand and investment, and show that the corresponding ROI function is unimodal. We demonstrate an application of our model to location of retail stores operating as an M/M/1/K queue and show the joint concavity of a store’s profit. To this end, we prove the joint concavity of the throughput of an M/M/1/K queue. Parametric analysis is performed on an illustrative example for managerial implications. We introduce an upper bound of an optimal value of the problem and develop three heuristic algorithms based on the structural properties of the profit and ROI functions. Computational results are promising.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
One of the widely used objectives for network design is profit maximization. This approach can lead to higher investment (for example, locating more stores) than a return-on-investment (ROI) criterion, where ROI is the profit of an investment divided by the cost of the investment. Starbucks’ failure in 2008 invokes the motivation to consider an ROI criterion in addition to profit.“Starbucks nearly tripled the number of stores worldwide, from 5886 in 2002 to 15,011 in 2007. But in the Great Recession of 2008, it was hurt by rising costs, the cannibalization effects of years of overexpansion, and stiff competition from McDonald’s and Dunkin Donuts. By the end of 2008, Starbucks stock, once seemingly invincible, had declined by over 50 percent. 1000 employees were laid off and 600 underperforming locations were closed in the United States.” (Excerpted from the New York Times, May 25, 2010) Greer (2010) illustrated the up-and-downs of the number of stores including the plan of adding 500 new stores in 2010. While the stores closed in 2008 were company-owned, the growth in 2010 is based on franchising requiring no upfront investment. Starbucks just collected loyalty streams paid by the stores.This research was motivated by communications with one of our partners in automobile industry, whose details are omitted per request. The automobile manufacturer considers ROI in location decisions in a sequential manner. Finance first brings a ROI threshold because ROI evaluates the efficiency of an investment from an investor’s perspective. While investment decisions are internally made, ROI-incorporated location decisions can be aligned with some metrics interesting to external stakeholders. Examples include financial ratios such as return on equity and return on asset. The ROI threshold is translated into a minimum demand per site, which is then used for an estimate on the number of dealerships to be located. Based on population data, the whole geographical regions are partitioned in a way that the minimum demand requirement would be satisfied in each region. Then, a 1-median problem is solved for a location within each region since customers are sensitive to distance. When the minimum demand requirement is over- or under-achieved in some regions, the whole regions are partitioned with a smaller or larger number of dealerships.The partner’s sequential approach to location decisions is a simple heuristic which is not even close to optimal. Thus, we develop an analytical model simultaneously determining the decision variables: (i) the number and location of stores, (ii) the allocation of demands to the stores, and (iii) investments at the stores. The objective is to maximize the profit of a retail network subject to a ROI threshold required at each store. The main purpose of this formulation is to deliver useful insights by addressing the impact of a financial requirement such as ROI threshold on the profit.From a systems perspective, the interface between business functions is critical to a firm’s success. However, in the literature, not much attention has been paid to the link between operations and finance via ROI criteria. Myung, Kim, and Tcha (1997) considered a bi-objective model for uncapacitated facility location where one objective is to maximize the net profit and the other to maximize the profitability (ROI) of the investment. Brimberg and ReVelle (2000) also proposed a bi-criterion model which examines the tradeoff between the total and investment costs. Brimberg, Hansen, Laporte, Mladenovic, and Urosevic (2008) examined the objective of maximizing ROI, but imposed a minimum acceptable level on market share. They showed that an optimal solution without market share constraints is given by a single open facility, but one-facility location is rare in a retail network. These models are intended for the location of manufacturing plants and determine assignment of plants to demand nodes. In a retail environment, however, the traffic to a store is determined rather by customer preference, for example, distance sensitivity. Such customer choices are explicitly incorporated as “closest assignment” constraints in our model.Our analysis includes an application of our model to location of retail stores operating as an M/M/1/K queue where the stochastic nature of arrival and service processes in retail operations is explicitly treated. Previous research in similar settings can be found in Berman, Krass, and Wang (2006) and Berman, Huang, Kim, and Menezes (2007) from which our model extends using ROI criteria. General problems of finding optimal facility location and resource allocation in a stochastic environment belong to the class of “Location Problems with Stochastic Demands and Congestion” (Berman and Krass, 2002, chap. 11). Snyder (2006) also provided a survey of location models with uncertainty.We summarize key contributions. First, a more general modeling structure is introduced. In the previous location models with ROI criteria, profit or cost is formulated as a linear function and ROI as a linear fractional function. We generalize profit as a nonlinear function and ROI as a nonlinear fractional function. The resulting formulation inherits the complexity of classical location problems and the nonlinearity of profit and ROI functions adds more challenges. In particular, the profit function in our model is jointly concave in demand and investment, and can be applied to many practical settings where the marginal benefit of an increasing demand or investment decreases. Given these assumptions, we show the corresponding ROI function is unimodal. Second, in our application to location of retail stores operating as an M/M/1/K queue, we show the “queueing-based” profit function is also joint concave. To this end, we prove the joint concavity of the throughput of an M/M/1/K queue. This result is not available in the queueing literature to the best of our knowledge. Third, we introduce an upper bound of an optimal value of the problem and develop three heuristic algorithms based on the structural properties of the profit and ROI functions. While our framework was motivated by retail networks, these results can be applied in other potential research in network design. The first two contributions have implications for various other areas in operational research.Our framework does not explicitly incorporate competition between retail chains. Direct applications include monopolistic chains with low competition. When high competition exists, the effect can implicitly be captured by estimating parameters with cautions. For example, market share can be used instead of total demand at any demand point. Also customers’ distance sensitivity can be adjusted to a high value (page 1016 in Berman et al., 2007).The rest of the paper is planned as follows. In Section 2, we present the problem framework and assumptions. We also formulate the profit and ROI functions of a store, and show their structural properties. In Section 3, we formulate the problem and decompose it into stores’ subproblems. We also show some structural properties of a subproblem. In Section 4, we apply our model to location of retail stores operating an M/M/1/K queue. An example of the problem is illustrated in Section 5. Section 6 highlights some observations from parametric analysis using the example in Section 5. In Section 7, we introduce an upper bound of an optimal value of the problem and develop three heuristic algorithms. Section 8 includes numerical results from a computational experiment with random graphs. The conclusion with suggested future research follows in Section 9.A chain has retail stores located within the area represented by a discrete undirected network G = (N, L), where N is the node set with |N| = n and L is the link set. Customers are concentrated at the nodes and demands originate from node i at the rate of wiper unit time. The shortest distance between nodes i and j is denoted to be dij. Customers from a node patronize the closest store. Customers’ choice based on distance has been used in the location literature (Berman et al., 2006; Gerrard and Church, 1996). As illustrated in our communications with an automobile manufacturer in the previous section, businesses use distance as one of the key contributing factors in customers’ preference. While this assumption is still realistic, different or more refined versions are possible. For example, customers rank facilities by travel and waiting times (Marianov, Rios, & Icaza, 2008). Given the distance-based customers’ choice, for a given set X⊂N of store locations, a demand node can be “assigned” to the closest node with a located store. The set of nodes assigned to a store at node j (or “store j”) is denoted to be Nj. Demands from a node, even though assigned to the closest store, might still be “lost” due to the following two sources (Berman et al., 2006):1.Inconvenience. Customers from a node (i) are “sensitive” to distance and are lost when the store (j) they patronize is not close enough. The function ϕ(dij) detailed below maps the likelihood of customers from node i travelling to store j.Incapacity. Customers from node i are sensitive to congestion at store j (and also to service delays, overall appearance, layout, etc). Even though a customer from node i travels to store j, upon arrival, she might not join it due to congestion. The capacity of a store is determined by the level of investment.Given that node i is assigned to store j, let the fraction of customers from node i travelling to store j be ϕ(dij) ≥ 0, where the “coverage decay function” ϕ(d) is non-increasing. For numerical examples and computational experiments in this paper, we use a piecewise linear convex function, ϕ(d) = max {1 − d/(θdmax ), 0} (Berman et al., 2007), where dmax  is the largest shortest distance of G and θ > 0 is a constant representing customers’ distance sensitivity. For example, a larger value of θ can be used under higher competition as noted in the previous section. See Berman, Krass, and Drezner (2003) for more examples of ϕ(d). However, a choice of ϕ(d) does not affect the results in the remainder of this paper. From the definition of ϕ(d), we define below the unit-time demand of store jλj=∑i∈Njwiϕ(dij)which represents the average number of customers arriving at store j per unit time.The decision maker determines the set X of store locations and investment (or variable investment cost) Ij≥ 0 of a store at node j. Note that the number of stores (m = |X|) is not pre-specified. There is also a fixed setup cost S ≥ 0 for locating a store. The objective is to maximize the total profit of all stores located on the network subject to a pre-specified ROI threshold α required at each store. The full formulation of this problem is presented in the next section. We first develop the profit and ROI functions of a store, and investigate their structural properties in this section.Suppose a store is located at some node with some λ and I (dropping the index “j”). We assume that the “throughput” or unit-time sales of the store, T(λ, I), is a non-decreasing and jointly concave function of λ and I, with the boundary conditions T(λ, 0) = 0 and T(0, I) = 0. Examples include the Cobb–Douglas function T(λ, I) = AλβIγ, where 0 ≤ β ≤ 1, 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1, and β + γ ≤ 1. Let p and c be the average expense of one customer and the average cost associated with the sales, respectively. Then, the unit-time profit is (p − c)T(λ, I) and the profit of the store is(1)f(λ,I)=(p−c)T(λ,I)−I−Swhich is also jointly concave in λ and I. Note that the investment I and setup cost S are incurred for one time, but the profit (p − c)T(λ, I) is realized per unit time, for example, per year. If the store operates for y years, the present value of y cash flows of (p − c)T(λ, I) is A(p − c)T(λ, I), where A = [1 − (1 + r)−y]/r is the annuity factor for a rate of r. Without loss of generality, we let A = 1 in this paper. The store’s ROI is the profit divided by the total cost as(2)gr(λ,I)=(p−c)T(λ,I)−I−ScT(λ,I)+I+Swhich is a “real” ROI compared to (3). However, it is difficult to analyze gr(λ, I) which is a ratio of two concave functions. We thus use a different ratio below to measure ROI,(3)g(λ,I)=(p−c)T(λ,I)−I−SI+S.We use g(λ, I) instead of gr(λ, I) based on the following relationship between the two:Proposition 1For each value of gr(λ, I), there exists a unique corresponding value of g(λ, I).We show one-on-one correspondence between values of gr(λ, I) and g(λ, I).(p−c)T(λ,I)−I−ScT(λ,I)+I+S=βimpliespc+I+ST(λ,I)=1+β.Hence, if β > 0, p − c − cβ > 0.(p−c)T(λ,I)−I−SI+S=γimpliesI+ST(λ,I)=p−c1+γ.After some algebra, we haveγ=pβp−c−cβ.□Let α be an ROI threshold required for opening a store. Then, the minimum ROI requirement to the store can be written asg(λ,I)=(p−c)T(λ,I)−I−SI+S≥αor(4)h(λ,I)=(p−c)T(λ,I)−I−S−α(I+S)≥0.Obviously, h(λ, I) is also jointly concave in λ and I.Some structural results of the ROI function g(λ, I) follow in the remainder of this section.Lemma 1If g(x) is twice differentiable and if the conditiong′(x)=0⇒g′′(x)≤0holds, then g(x) is unimodal (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004).The pseudo-concavity of g(x) also is noted in Mangasarian, 1994, page 148, without proof.Theorem 1For a fixed λ,g(I)=(p−c)T(λ,I)−I−SI+Sis a unimodal function of I.We havedgdI=(p−c)[dT/dII+S−T(I+S)2]andd2gdI2=(p−c)[d2T/dI2I+S−2(dT/dI(I+S)2−T(I+S)3)].Then, the condition of Lemma 1 holds.□Based on Lemma 2 below, we show Theorem 2 which is stronger than Theorem 1.Lemma 2If g(x) is twice differentiable and if g(x) satisfiesyT▽g(x)=0⇒yT▽2g(x)y≤0for all x ∈ dom(g) and all y ∈ Rn, then g(x) is unimodal (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004).g(λ,I)=(p−c)T(λ,I)−I−SI+Sis a unimodal function of (λ, I).We have▽g(λ,I)=(p−c)[∂T∂λ1(I+S)∂T∂I1(I+S)−T(I+S)2]and▽2g(λ,I)=(p−c)[∂2T∂λ21(I+S)∂2T∂λ∂I1(I+S)−∂T∂λ1(I+S)2∂2T∂λ∂I1(I+S)−∂T∂λ1(I+S)2∂2T∂I21(I+S)−∂T∂I2(I+S)2+2T(I+S)3].Given any (λ′, I′) such that (λ′, I′)▽g = 0, after some simple algebra, we have(λ′,I′)▽2g(x)(λ′,I′)T=p−cI+S(λ′,I′)[∂2T/∂λ2∂2T/∂λ∂I∂2T/∂λ∂I∂2T/∂I2](λ′,I′)T,which is non-positive from Lemma 2.□Given the framework in the previous section, we formalize our model by defining the following three decision variables:yj= 1 if a store is located at node j;  0 otherwise,xij= 1 if node i is assigned to the store at node j;  0 otherwise,Ij= investment of a store at node j.The formulation below maximizes the total profit of a network without ROI constraints.(5)(P1)max∑j=1n[(p−c)T(∑i=1nwiϕ(dij)xij,Ij)−Ij−Syj]s.t.∑j=1nxij=1i=1,…,n(6)xij≤yji,j=1,…,n(7)∑k=1nxikdik+(M−dij)yj≤Mi,j=1,…,n(8)xij,yj∈{0,1}j=1,…,n(9)Ij≥0j=1,…,n.If Ij= 0, then(p−c)T(∑i=1nwiϕ(dij)xij,Ij)=0. Thus yjmust be zero as well. On the other hand, if yj= 0, then xij= 0 for all i, due to constraints (6) which mean(p−c)T(∑i=1nwiϕ(dij)xij,Ij)=0. Thus Ij= 0. Either yjor Ijbeing zero implies that the other is also zero. Constraints (5) state that each node is assigned to one store. Constraints (6) ensure that node i cannot be assigned to node j unless there is a store located at node j. Constraints (7) guarantee that each node is assigned to the closest store, where M ≥ dmax. In case of a tie, (P1) will assign a node to a store with less demand load since the objective function is nondecreasing concave in demand. The validation of constraints (7) can be found in Berman et al. (2006). Other forms of “closest assignment” constraints are available in Gerrard and Church (1996). Close assignment is a realistic assumption in a retail environment, but these constraints do not limit the applicability of our model to other settings since other types of constraints can be used instead.After ROI constraints (h(λj, Ij) ≥ 0 as in (4)) are introduced, (P1) turns into(10)(P2)max∑j=1n[(p−c)T(∑i=1nwiϕ(dij)xij,Ij)−Ij−Syj]s.t.(p−c)T(∑i=1nwiϕ(dij)xij,Ij)−Ij−Syj−α(Ij+Syj)≥0j=1,…,n(5),(6),(7),(8),(9).Let z*(P) be the optimal objective function value of a problem (P). Obviously, z*(P1) ≥ z*(P2) for any α. Since (P2) is challenging, we focus on a subproblem regarding to a store. Given a fixed set of m store locations, unit-time demands (λj=∑i=1nwiϕ(dij)xij,j = 1, …, m) are also fixed. Then, (P1) can be decomposed into m separate subproblems as(Pj1)maxIj≥0f(Ij)=(p−c)T(λj,Ij)−Ij−S.Similarly, (P2) can be decomposed as(Pj2)maxIj≥0f(Ij)=(p−c)T(λj,Ij)−Ij−Ss.t.h(Ij)=(p−c)T(λj,Ij)−Ij−S−α(Ij+S)≥0.Since both f(I) and h(I) are concave,(Pj2)is a concave programming problem. Consider also a problem of maximizing the ROI of store j formulated as(Pj0)maxIj≥0g(Ij)=(p−c)T(λj,Ij)−Ij−SIj+S.The objective function of(Pj0)is unimodal by Theorem 1 or 2. We use the three formulations to characterizeIj2below.Proposition 2Suppose thatz*(Pj1)>0,and thatIj0,Ij2,andIj1solve(Pj0),(Pj2),and(Pj1),respectively. Then, there existαandα¯such that(i)Ij0≤Ij2=Ij1for α ≤α,Ij0≤Ij2<Ij1forα∈(α̲,α¯],(Pj2)is infeasible forα>α¯.Supposez*(Pj1)≤0. Then, by setting Ij= 0, we can always set the profit to zero. Sincef(Ij0)=(p−c)T(λj,Ij0)−Ij0−S≤(p−c)T(λj,Ij1)−Ij1−S=f(Ij1),Ij0≤Ij1. Letα̲=g(Ij1)=(p−c)T(λj,Ij1)−Ij1−SIj1+Sandα¯=g(Ij0)=(p−c)T(λj,Ij0)−Ij0−SIj0+S.Then,α̲=g(Ij1)≤g(Ij0)=α¯.For α ≤α,Ij1solves(Pj2)as well because the ROI constraint in(Pj2)is non-binding. Forα∈(α̲,α¯],the ROI constraint of(Pj2)is binding, i.e.,g(Ij2)=(p−c)T(λj,Ij2)−Ij2−SIj2+S=α. It follows thatIj0≤Ij2<Ij1. Forα>α¯,(Pj2)is infeasible.□By preprocessingαandα¯,we are able to findIj2more efficiently in our solution procedures for numerical examples and computational experiments. In particular, we use the False Position method (Burden & Faires, 2001) in search ofIj2sinceh(Ij0)andh(Ij1)have opposite signs whenα∈[α̲,α¯]. In Fig. 1are examples of the three functions f(I), g(I), and h(I) wheref(I)=(p−c)T(λ,I)−I−S,g(I)=(p−c)T(λ,I)−I−SI+S,h(I)=(p−c)T(λ,I)−I−S−α(I+S).If the ROI function g(I) is concave, the property ofz*(Pj2)below is obvious. We note that this property still holds when g(I) is pseudo-concave.Property 1For a fixed λj,z*(Pj2)is non-increasing in α.Since the objective function g(Ij) of(Pj0)is pseudo-concave in Ij, the “upper level set”Ij(α)={Ij≥0|g(Ij)=(p−c)T(λj,Ij)−Ij−SIj+S≥α}is convex for any α (Avriel, 1976). For distinct ROI thresholds, α′ and α′′ such that α′ < α′′, Ij(α′)⊃Ij(α′′), where Ij(α′) and Ij(α′′) are the feasible sets of(Pj2)for α′ and α′′, respectively. Thus,z*(Pj2)for α′ is at least that for α′′.□As online shopping threatens to continue siphoning off sales in brick-and-mortar stores, customers’ perception and experience on retail services have become increasingly important. Retail customers are generally sensitive to waiting and research in retailing indeed found empirical evidences on how quickly shoppers become impatient. Retail customers often rate waiting as the single biggest complaint, and consider it as a critical determinant on where to shop (Doyle, 2003). The duration of the waiting time at checkout is one of the key service attributes on which retailers compete with one another (Casey, 2004). Research released by Barclays and Barclaycard (2010) reveals that two fifths of British shoppers refuse to queue for longer than two minutes and two thirds of them regularly abandon purchases. These observations motivated application of our model to location of retail stores operating as a queue.An M/M/1/K queue is admittedly a “stylized” setting where not all detailed operations in a retail store can be incorporated. Still, this framework allows to address stochastic nature of retail operations and loss of demands due to congestion. We note that some of our assumptions are found also in Berman et al. (2006) and Berman et al. (2007). In both papers, a facility operates as an M/M/1/K queue and customers patronize the closest facility. Berman et al. (2007) illustrated retail applications of their location model.Assuming retail stores operates as an M/M/1/K queue, we derive a queueing-based profit function and show that it is non-increasing and jointly concave in λ and I. Let λ and μ be the demand rate and service rate of an M/M/1/K queue, respectively. Then, the loss probability (or blocking fraction) can be shown as (Gross & Harris, 1985)B(λ,μ,K)={(λ/μ)K(1−λ/μ)1−(λ/μ)K+1ifλ≠μ,λ≠0,μ≠0,1K+1ifλ=μ≠0,0ifλ=0,μ≠0,1ifμ=0.B(λ, μ, K) is convex in μ (Nagarajan & Towsley, 1992). The throughput is given as(11)T(λ,μ)=λ[1−B(λ,μ,K)]=λ[1−(λ/μ)K(1−λ/μ)1−(λ/μ)K+1].Then, the profit of a store in (1) can be re-formulated as f(λ, μ) = (p − c)T(λ, μ) − I(μ) − S, where the investment I(μ) is differentiable, increasing, and convex in μ (Christ & Avi-Itzhak, 2002).In the remainder of this section, we show structural properties of the throughput of an M/M/1/K queue as a function of demand λ and service rate μ(I), where μ(I) is again a function of I. This is, in fact, the main complication in application of our model to a queueing setting.Proposition 3T(λ, μ(I)) defined by(11)is an increasing function of λ.To show ∂T/∂λ > 0, we have∂T∂λ=μ2K+2−(K+1)μK+2λK+KμK+1λK+1(μK+1−λK+1)2=μK+1KλK+1−KμλK−μλK+μK+1(μK+1−λK+1)2.The numerator of the above fraction can be rewritten asKλK(λ−μ)−μ(λ−μ)(λK−1+λK−2μ+λK−3μ2+⋯+μK−1)=(λ−μ)(KλK−λK−1μ−λK−2μ2−⋯−μK)=(λ−μ)[(λK−λK−1μ)+(λK−λK−2μ2)+⋯+(λK−μK)]=(λ−μ)[λK−1(λ−μ)+λK−2(λ2−μ2)+⋯+(λK−μK)].Since λi− μi= (λ − μ)(λi − 1 + λi − 2μ + ⋅⋅⋅ + μi − 1) for any positive integer i, the above expression can be written as (λ − μ)2 multiplied by a positive component. Therefore, ∂T/∂λ > 0.□If a real function f is increasing and convex on an open interval, then the inverse function f−1is increasing and concave (Binmore, 1977).Assume that I(μ) is twice-differentiable. If I(μ) is an increasing convex function of μ, and I′ ≠ 0, then T(λ, μ(I)) defined by(11)is an increasing concave function of I.The loss probability can be written as11(λ/μ)K+1(λ/μ)K−1+⋯+1which obviously decreases in μ. Thus, the throughput increases in μ, i.e., ∂T/∂μ > 0. From Theorem 3, we have dμ/dI > 0 and∂T∂I=∂T∂μdμdI>0.Since B(λ, μ, K) is convex in μ, T(λ, μ) is concave in μ. Therefore,∂2T∂I2=∂2T∂μ2(dμdI)2+∂T∂μd2μdI2≤0whered2μdI2≤0is immediate from Theorem 3.□Based on Proposition 5 below, we show Theorem 4 which is stronger than Proposition 4.Proposition 5T(λ, μ) defined by(11)is jointly concave in λ and μ (Nagarajan & Towsley, 1992).Assume that I(μ) is twice-differentiable. If I(μ) is an increasing convex function of μ, and I′ ≠ 0, then T(λ, μ(I)) defined by(11)is jointly concave in λ and I.In order to show that T(λ, μ(I)) is jointly concave in λ and I, it is necessary to show that the Hessian is negative semi-definite. The Hessian isH=[∂2T∂λ2∂2T∂λ∂μdμdI∂2T∂λ∂μdμdI∂2T∂μ2(dμdI)2+∂T∂μd2μdI2].Since T(λ, μ) is jointly concave in λ and μ, the following matrix is negative semi-definite:[∂2T∂λ2∂2T∂λ∂μ∂2T∂λ∂μ∂2T∂μ2].Since∂2T∂λ2≤0and∂T∂μd2μdI2≤0,H is negative semi-definite as well.□We introduce an illustrative example which is again used later for parametric analysis. Let us consider the simple network in Fig. 2where the length of links are the numbers next to the links and the demand weights of nodes are the numbers next to the nodes.Suppose that θ = 1, p = 1, c = 0, K = 2, S = 0.02, α = 0.1, and I(μ) = 9μ2. Quadratic investment functions have been used in the literature (See Bitran and Tirupati, 1989). Given a fixed set of m store locations, the profit function of a store with arrival rate λ is thenf(I)={(1)(λ)[1−9(λ/I)2(1−3λ/I)1−27(λ/I)3]−I−0.02ifI≠0,0otherwise.We first demonstrate a hierarchical solution approach (similar to the one discussed in the Introduction) which results in a substantial decrease in the total profit of this network. Due to the concavity of f(I), we use the Golden Section method (Bertsekas, 1999) to find an optimal investment of a store for any given arrival rate. After complete enumeration, an optimal solution for (P1) with z*(P1) = 0.0205 is to locate 5 stores at nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 with arrival rates 0.15, 0.167, 0.1, 0.4, and 0.15 (with a total of 0.967), respectively. Consider the third store located at node 4 with an arrival rate of 0.1. Since the objective function of(Pj0)(or g(I)) is unimodal by Theorem 1 or 2, we again use the Golden Section method to solve(Pj0)with λj= 0.1 and findz*(Pj0)=0.0436. This means the largest possible ROI with λj= 0.1 is 0.0436 ( < 10 percent) and it is better off to close this store. After closing the store at node 4, the arrival rates at the rest 4 stores are 0.15, 0.167, 0.45, and 0.15 (with a total of 0.9167), respectively. Solve(Pj2)for each store. Then, the resulting solution is not optimal for (P2) with an objective value of 0.0192 which corresponds to a decrease of total profit over 6 percent.By complete enumeration, however, we find that an optimal solution for (P2) with z*(P2) = 0.0203 is to locate 4 stores at nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6 with arrival rates 0.233, 0.15, 0.4, and 0.15 (with a total of 0.9333), respectively. The optimal value of z*(P2) = 0.0203 corresponds to about 1 percent decrease in the total profit which is substantially larger than that from the hierarchical approach. In this case, the optimal solution for (P2) has the same cardinality of that of (P1), but one element differs from one solution to the other.We note that more demands to stores do not necessarily mean a larger throughput leading to a larger total profit. If we locate 4 stores at nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6, the arrival rates are 0.233, 0.1, 0.4, 0.217 (with a total of 0.95), respectively. However, the objective value of (P2) is 0.018. (P2) would not only increase demands, but also balance them among the stores based on congestion. For example, when the investment function I(μ) is linear, i.e., I(μ) = bμ + e, all open stores must have the same utilization λ/μ if the ROI constraints (10) are non-binding. This can be seen from the first-order condition on μ of the profit function f(I(μ))(p−c)K(λ/μ)K+1−(K+1)(λ/μ)K+2+(λ/μ)2K+2[1−(λ/μ)K+1]2=b.We proceed with parametric analysis using the same example. Each curve is drawn from a combination of (S, K), where S is the fixed setup cost and K is often referred to as “maximum queue length” over which an arriving customer cannot join the queue. However, in this paper, it is not only the physical size of a store. Interpreted practically, it is a proxy for the degree of customers’ “willingness” to join a store or “patience” on waiting. For a larger K, a customer is more willing to join and wait in the queue. This interpretation allows us to investigate the impact of different degrees of patience (even though they are discretized as K), on the total profit of a network. First, Fig. 3plots optimal total profit (z*(P2)) over ROI threshold (α).Some observations are summarized. First, a larger K (representing more patient customers) yields a larger z*(P2). Second, z*(P2) is non-increasing in α. This observation can be interpreted from Proposition 2 and Property 1. Suppose all ROI constraints in (P2) are non-binding for α ≤α. Then, z*(P2) remains the same. For α >α, some ROI constraints start to be binding and thus z*(P2) decreases.Curves of z*(P2) are neither concave nor convex in α. One of the reasons is that optimal solutions for different α values locate different numbers of stores. The curves still appear “concave-like” overall in the sense that they get more “elastic” as α increases. For example, the curve of (S = 0.25, K = 1) shows that, as α increases from 0.35 to 0.40, z*(P2) decreases by 25 percent. However, as α increases from 0.40 to 0.45, z*(P2) decreases by 100 percent.Fig. 4represents a retail chain with a lower ROI in contrast to Fig. 3. The results are similar and parameters are the same as in the previous case except for p = 3 and c = 2. Since p − c = 1 is the same and the numerator (or profit) of the ROI function in (2) remains the same. However, c = 1 increases to c = 2, ROI decreases for any α. Hence, as α increases, it approaches toα¯faster because the corresponding feasible set of (P2) approaches faster to an empty set. Thus, z*(P2) drops steeper than in Fig. 3.From Figs. 3 and 4 above, we observe that, as α increases, z*(P2) deceases steeper. When an already-high α is required to increase further, z*(P2) tends to decrease significantly even for a slight increase of α. This observation is the case for other metrics such as the optimal number of stores as shown below in Fig. 5. The same parameters in Fig. 4 are used except for S = 0.25.It is interesting to interpret Fig. 6below along with Fig. 5.Fig. 6 plots average utilization over α. The same parameters in Fig. 4 are used except for S = 0.25. We define the average utilization of a network as total arrival rate divided by total service rate of all open stores. In order to increase the total profit, the retail chain manager would attempt to reduce lost demand. She can reasonably expand investment by adding capacity (increasing service rates) of some open stores or locating more stores. It is plausible that more investment would decrease average utilization. However, this is not the case in Fig. 6 over the range of α where some ROI constraints are binding. Observe that average utilization is higher for a smaller K. When customers are impatient, the retail chain loses more demand. In this case, it might be more profitable to reduce investment/stores. When an ROI constraint is binding, the ROI threshold (α) would further limit investment. This could lead to a significant decrease in total service rate and also an unusually high average utilization, which occurs in parallel with fewer stores as shown in Fig. 5. Essentially, this observation results from the “conservativeness” of ROI criteria. When a high ROI threshold (α) is required, she would forego a substantial amount of total profit by reducing investment (decapacitating or closing stores) at the expense of lost demand. She should note, however, that reduced investment due to financial requirements can lead to a significantly high average utilization which directly affects service level measures such as waiting time.In this section, we introduce an upper bound of z*(P2) and develop three heuristic algorithms to solve (P2). We note that application of these heuristics extends to a general class of jointly concave profit functions, but not limited to queueing-based profit functions in the previous section.Given a fixed set of m store locations, the following linear integer programming formulation returns a maximal total demand per unit time:(12)(MP)maxλ¯m=∑i=1n∑j=1nwiϕ(dij)xijs.t.∑j=1nxij=1i=1,…,n(13)xij≤yji,j=1,…,n(14)∑j=1nyj=m(15)xij,yj∈{0,1}i,j=1,…,n.By the definition of ϕ(dij), the maximal total demand isλ¯m=∑wi−(∑i∑jwidijxij)/(θdmax). This formulation corresponds to the classical median problem (Hakimi, 1964) and we can use an efficient heuristic to solve (MP), e.g., a Lagrangian Relaxation heuristic with subgradient method.Proposition 6There exists an integer m such thatm[(p−c)T(λ¯mm,I*)−I*−S]is an upper bound of z*(P1) ≥ z*(P2), where I* ≥ 0 is a maximizer of(p−c)T(λ¯mm,I)−I−S.Suppose that an optimal solution for (P1) is to open m stores withλ1′andI1′,…,λm′andIm′,respectively, which is a feasible solution for the following problem:maxλ1,…,λm,I1,…,Im∑j=1m[(p−c)T(λj,Ij)−Ij−S]s.t.λ1+⋯+λm≤λ¯m.Introducing a Lagrange multiplier ν, we find λ1, …, λm, I1, …, Im, and ν by solving the unconstrained problemmaxλ1,…,λm,I1,…,Im,ν∑j=1m[(p−c)T(λj,Ij)−Ij−S]−ν[λ1+⋯+λm−λ¯m].Since the objective function is jointly concave in λ1, …, λm, I1, …, Im, the necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality are(p−c)∂T(λj,Ij)∂λj−ν=0j=1,…,m,(p−c)∂T(λj,Ij)∂Ij−1=0j=1,…,m,λ1+⋯+λm−λ¯m=0.It is obvious thatλ1=⋯=λm=λ¯m/min an optimal solution, which completes the proof.□We discuss how to find an upper bound ofλ¯min the Maximal Total Demand heuristic of the next subsection. We can also use a binary search to find a minimal demandλof a store such that h(λ, I) = (p − c)T(λ, I) − I − S − α(I + S) ≥ 0 for a given α, since h(λ, I) is jointly concave in λ and I. Thus, the maximal number of stores to be located is not more than min {n, ⌊ ∑wi/λ⌋} and, due to customer’ distance sensitivity, fewer stores are located.All of the heuristics use procedure local_search including drop/add/interchange procedures detailed below (See Brimberg et al., 2008 for the description and other references). The procedure local_search starts with a set Y of store locations. Let z(P) be an objective function value of a problem (P), which is not necessarily an optimal value of z*(P).Procedure local_search(Y):Step 1:Fix Y and calculate z(P2).(Drop) For each open store yj∈ Y, calculate z(P2) using the solution Y∖{yj}.(Add) For each closed storeyk∉Y,calculate z(P2) using the solution Y∪{yk}.(Interchange) For each pair (yj, yk), where yj∈ Y andyk∉Y,calculate z(P2) using the solution (Y∖{yj})∪{yk}.Choose the solution Y* that yields the largest z(P2) in Steps 2, 3, and 4.If there is no improvement in a full cycle of Steps 1–5, stop; Otherwise, set Y = Y* and go to Step 1.It is not required that the starting and generated solutions in Steps 2–4 have to be feasible. If the unit-time demand of an open store, say yj, in Y is less thanλ, we mark Y as infeasible, instead of evaluating Y∖{yj}.The Greedy heuristic attempts to choose potential locations that are the “best” at each iteration. This algorithm starts with an empty solution set Y and keeps adding one store to Y until there is no more improvement. At each iteration, it chooses the store whose addition yields the most increase in z(P2). The Greedy heuristic calls procedure local_search at the end.Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) is a meta-heuristic for solving combinatorial problems (Mladenovic & Hansen, 1997). It changes neighborhoods systematically within a local search algorithm. First, we define the number of different elements in Y1 and Y2 asρ(Y1,Y2)=max{|Y1∖Y2|,|Y2∖Y1|}.For example, if Y1 = {1, 2} and Y2 = {1, 2, 3}, then ρ(Y1, Y2) = max {0, 1} = 1. For every k = 1, 2, …, we define the k th neighborhood of Y asNk(Y)={Y′:ρ(Y,Y′)=k}.Note that the neighborhood used before in the local search procedure corresponds toN1(Y)in the current procedure. Comparing to local search heuristics, which are usually “1-opt” procedures, VNS does not stop at theN1(Y). Suppose Y is the current solution, VNS chooses a solution, say Y′, fromN1(Y)randomly and runs a local search (e.g. procedure local_search) inN1(Y′). If there is no improvement, VNS looks for another starting solution fromN2(Y)randomly and runs a new local search and so on. When a better solution is identified, VNS sets it as the new current solution and a new iteration starts until some stopping condition is met. In this paper, we terminate the algorithm when the maximum number of iterations is reached. It is possible that there is no improvement after we run a local search for the randomly pickedY′∈Nkmax(Y),where kmax  is the maximum neighborhood size. In this case, we choose a random solution fromN1(Y)and start a new iteration again. Given a solution Y, there are at most |Y| drop moves, at most min {n, ⌊ ∑wi/λ⌋} − |Y| add moves, and at most min {min {n, ⌊ ∑wi/λ⌋} − |Y|, |Y|} interchange moves. Thus, we setkmax=max{min{n,⌊∑wi/λ̲⌋}−|Y|,|Y|}. The VNS procedure is stated as below.Procedure VNS:Step 1:Find an initial solution Y. Set the current best solution Y⋆ = Y and k = 1.Choose a solution Y′ randomly fromNk(Y☆).Call procedure local_search to apply a local search based on Y′.If the iteration limit is reached, stop. If k < kmax  and the returned solution of Step 3, Y′′, is not better than Y⋆, set k = (k + 1) and go back to Step 2. If k = kmax  and the returned solution of Step 3, Y′′, is not better than Y⋆, set k = 1 and go back to Step 2. Otherwise, set Y⋆ = Y′′ and k = 1 and go back to Step 2.By solving the median problem (MP), we can obtain a maximal total demand of m stores. In particular, we use the Lagrangian Relaxation heuristic (See Daskin, 1995, for more details) to find an upper bound ofλ¯min (MP), which is used to calculate an upper bound of z*(P1) in Proposition 6. Delivering tight bounds most of the time (less than 0.15 percent, see Daskin, 1995), the Lagrangian Relaxation heuristic with subgradient method is one of the most computationally attractive heuristics for a median problem. We state the Maximal Total Demand (MTD) heuristic below.Procedure MTD:Step 1:Set m = 0.Set m = m + 1. If m > min {n, ⌊ ∑wi/λ⌋} (the maximal number of stores), stop.Solve the m-median problem using the Lagrange Relaxation heuristic to obtain a solution, Y, and an upper bound.Update the upper bound if necessary.Call procedurelocal_search to apply a local search based on Y.Update the best solution if necessary and go to Step 2.In order to test the heuristic algorithms, a computational experiment was conducted on an extensive set of instances of (P2). All runs were performed on a PC equipped with 2.33 gigahertz processor and 4G RAM. The procedures were coded in ANSI C. The problem data were generated randomly as follows: (i) The Cartesian coordinates of the nodes were generated uniformly over the interval (0, 100). (ii) Then nodes were connected randomly until a tree was formed. (iii) Finally, a random number of links (a random integer between 0 and n(n − 1)/2 − (n − 1), where n = |N|) were added to the generated tree. All demand weights were generated randomly over the interval (0,1), and then standardized to make the total demand equal to 200. The length of each link was calculated using the Euclidean distance formula.We chose the constant θ in function ϕ(dij) from {0.5, 1}; the real ROI (β in Proposition 1) from set {0, 0.1, 0.125, 0.15$, $0.175, 0.20, 0.225, 0.25, 0.275, 0.3}; average cost c ∈ {1, 2} with average expense p = c + 1; maximum queue length K ∈ {1, 3}; setup cost S ∈ {1, 3}. In this experiment, we set the investment as I(μ) = bμ, where b ∈ {0.25, 0.5}. In total, there were 320 combinations. For each case, we executed the Greedy and MTD heuristics first. Then, we executed the VNS heuristic based on each of the solutions returned by these two heuristics. The VNS heuristic, involving more iterations, took much longer time than the other two heuristics.In order to measure the performance of the heuristics, we defineGap=Upperbound−z(P2)returnedbyaheuristicz(P2)returnedbyaheuristic×100percent.Among the 320 cases on 30-node random graphs, 186 cases were feasible (see Table 1). Among the 320 cases on 50-node random graphs, 190 cases were feasible. These feasible cases are summarized further (see Table 2).Computational results are similar for 30-node and 50-node graphs and the proposed heuristics appear insensitive to the size of a network. Average gaps are not large ranging from 6.28 to 11.73 percent and about two thirds (from 58.47 to 72.11 percent) of the cases guarantee a gap of at most 5 percent. Since the gaps represent the difference between an upper bound and z(P2) returned by a heuristic, the difference between z*(P2) and z(P2) must be even smaller. We observe that the MTD heuristic does not outperform consistently the Greedy heuristic. Although the Greedy heuristic performs better overall, the MTD heuristic is still an essential part of this experiment since it returns an upper bound of z*(P2).
