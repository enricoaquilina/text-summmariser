@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In this paper, we present a dynamic optimal control model of process–product innovation with learning by doing, and extend the model of Chenavaz (2012) to an even more general model in which the firm's cost functions of product and process innovation depend on both the innovation investments and the knowledge accumulations of product and process innovation; furthermore, in our paper, the product price, the investments of product and process innovation are decision variables; the product quality, production cost, the change rates of knowledge accumulations of product and process innovation are state variables. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the relationships between these variables, and investigate the model's optimal conditions and characteristics. Further, we solve the model with some numerical examples, and sensitivity analysis is conducted to study the effect of changing the parameters and coefficients on the objective function value.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In this paper, we develop a dynamic optimal control model of process–product innovation with learning by doing. Our study is the intersection between two streams of research: The first of these streams originates in the studies of product and process innovation (e.g., Chenavaz, 2012; Lambertini & Mantovani, 2009; Mantovani, 2006); the second of these streams originates in the studies of learning by doing (e.g., Argotte & Epple, 1990; Arrow, 1962; Thompson, 2010).Over the past few decades, globalization and the rise of new technologies have challenged firms' abilities in developing innovation strategies to face increasing market competition. Innovation has become a fundamental source of firm survival and growth. The literatures on innovation distinguish between product innovation and process innovation. Product innovation is the implementation/commercialization of a product or service with improved performance characteristics that delivers objectively new or improved services to the user. Product and/or service innovation entails activities such as design, research and development, acquisition of patents, technology licenses, trademarks, and tooling-up and industrial engineering. Process innovation is the implementation of new or significantly improved production or delivery methods. It may involve investment in new technology embodied in machinery and equipment, new software for supply-chain management, new software for designing products and training of staff to offer new services to customers. Many firms, especially in technological fields, simultaneously improve product quality by product innovation, and reduce production cost by process innovation.Many authors have discussed the problems of innovation such as Kamien (1992), Lambertini and Mantovani (2009), Pine, Victor, and Boyton (1993), Athey and Schmutzler (1995), Klepper (1996), Reinhard (1990), Saha (2007), Utterback (1975), etc. Utterback (1975) reported results from empirical tests of relationships between the pattern of innovation within a firm and certain of the firm's characteristics. Reinhard (1990) assessed the overall contribution of product innovation to competitive advantage, analyzed the conditions under which such a contribution is likely, and discussed how this likelihood can be increased through company action. Kamien (1992) analyzed licensing of a cost reducing innovation to an oligopolistic industry. Pine et al. (1993) stated that more and more firms structure their organization so as to be able to carry out both process and product innovation simultaneously. Athey and Schmutzler (1995) studied two dimensions of innovation: demand-enhancing (product) and cost-reducing (process). These two types of innovation are complementary in terms of increasing the firm's net revenue in the short run. Klepper (1996) presented a model emphasizing differences infirm innovative capabilities and the importance of firm size in appropriating the returns from innovation is developed to explain the regularities. The model also explained regularities regarding the relationship within industries between firm size and firm innovative effort, innovative productivity, cost, and profitability. It predicted that over time firms devote more effort to process innovation but the number of firms and the rate and diversity of product innovation eventually wither. Fouad and Tapiero (1998) determined the optimal path of products enhancement innovation, i.e., of adding new functions (increasing flexibility) or substracting existing functions (increasing specialization) to existing products. Huisman and Kort (2003) determined the optimal timing of technology investment of a single firm in a duopoly framework. Based on the agent-based model, Ma and Nakamori (2005) developed a platform by using object-oriented programming to simulate the technological innovation process under different situations. Mantovani (2006) studied complementarity between market-enhancing product innovation and cost-reducing process innovation in a monopoly setting. Saha (2007) considered product and process R&D from the perspective of consumer preferences. The author found that the value of a process innovation depends only on the quantity sold while that of a product innovation depends also on how much buyers are willing to pay for it and hence also on who buys the product. Lara and Divakaran (2009) developed a decision model of a firm's optimal strategy for investment in security process innovations when confronted with a sequence of malicious attacks. Avagyan, Esteban-Bravo, and Vidal-Sanz (2014) presented a differential game to study how companies can simultaneously license their innovations to other firms when launching a new product. The authors considered the role of licensing to speed up the product diffusion, and fund evidence that licensing can be a potentially profitable strategy. As to the dynamic product and process innovation research, in recent works, Lambertini and Mantovani (2009) modeled the optimal behavior of a multiproduct monopolist investing both in process and in product innovation in a dynamic setting. Chenavaz (2012) developed a product–process innovation model where the problem is to determine an optimal product price, the product and process innovation investment facing a time-varying but under endogeny demand conditions. Furthermore, the author extended Chenavaz's (2011) model to different classes of demand functions and to general innovation functions.In this paper, taking advantage of the analytical framework which is offered by Chenavaz (2012), we present a dynamic optimal control model of process–product innovation with learning by doing. Since much of our analysis concerns firm's learning by doing, the next of this paper surveys the literature on “learning by doing”. Learning by doing is the result of the accumulation of knowledge generated by experience in the production process. The success of this accumulation depends critically on five factors: firstly, the type of work organization employed in production, especially the capacity of management to motivate production workers to provide feedback; secondly, establishing communication between producers and users; thirdly, it depends on the willingness of management to act on this information; fourthly, the competitive strategy of the producing firm and specifically the extent to which it competes on quality, customization to client need, design and achieving cost reductions through innovation and capital investment; finally, it depends on a wide distribution of technical competence within the producing firm's workforce and across the users of its goods and services. Learning by doing has occupied a central place within economics ever since Arrow (1962) used the concept as a workhorse in his theory of endogenous growth. Arrow (1962) conceptualized learning by doing within the actual activity of production, with cumulative gross investment as the catalyst for experience. Nearly two decades later, the role of experience in shaping and driving productivity growth was central in Lucas' (1988) explanations of increasing returns to human capital. Indeed, Lucas (1988) argued “on-the-job-training or learning by doing appear to be at least as important as schooling in the formation of human capital”. Yang and Borland (1991) furthered this line of thought by theoretically linking the division of labor and learning by doing, highlighting an important source of comparative advantage. Empirical studies have confirmed the importance of learning by doing in practice. Scholars have frequently observed that improvements in the efficiency with which outputs are produced from existing technologies and inputs are an important source of total factor productivity growth. Thompson (2010) reviewed the theoretical and empirical literature on learning by doing. The theoretical literature on innovation and technical change has also confirmed the role of learning derived from experience as a key driver in knowledge accumulation leading to innovation. Nelson and Winter (1982) stressed the importance of learning by doing and learning to learn effects in innovation. From the perspective of the dynamic capabilities approach, Teece, Pisano, and Shuen (1997), Zollo and Winter (2002) pointed out the accumulation of experience as one of the learning mechanisms and built the operating routines. Alvarez and Cerda (2003) presented the analytical solution for a class of discrete time T-period learning by doing problems. Linton and Walsh (2004) considered the learning curve literature and integrate it with the literature on technological trajectories and innovation to develop a theory for modeling the learning curve for emerging process technologies. Edward and Zabojnik (2005) showed that after an initial period of learning-by-doing, the new technology makes the goods more attractive to consumers. Anticipating a better product, consumers delay their current purchases which lowers today's profits, but increases future profits since the monopolist can charge a higher price for the high-quality good. For empirical purposes, Chryssolouris, Mavrikios, Fragos, Karabatsou, and Pistiolis (2002) investigated a novel virtual experimentation approach to planning and training for manufacturing processes. Pruett and Thomas (2008) used data on the innovation and production histories of 294 product platforms to explore experience-based learning. A noted feature of the authors' paper is to extend learning curve concepts from their traditional domain – the production process – into the product innovation process to build and test a richer, quantitative model of learning. It is clear that there is a very real and urgent need for training people for the factories of the future. There have been a number of European initiatives such as ‘Manufuture’ and the contrasting situation with the US and Japan has been nicely summarized by Mavrikios, Papakostas, Mourtzis, and Chryssolouris (2013). Furthermore, O'Sullivan, Rolstadås, and Filos (2011) provided a number of suggestions for strategic change to research and education in manufacturing in the future. Levitt, List, and Syverson (2012) used detailed data from an assembly plant of a major auto producer to investigate the learning by doing process. The authors focused on the acquisition, aggregation, transmission, and embodiment of the knowledge stock built through learning. They found that most of the substantial learning by doing knowledge at the plant was not retained by the plant's workers, even though they were an important conduit for knowledge acquisition. Hatch and Mowery (1998) analyzed the relationship between process innovation and learning by doing in the semiconductor industry where improvements in manufacturing yield are a catalyst for dynamic cost reductions.The main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we extend the model of Chenavaz (2012) to an even more general model in which learning by doing is taken into account. In Chenavaz's (2012) model, the firm's cost functions of product and process innovation only depend on the instantaneous investments. In this paper, the firm's cost functions of product and process innovation depend on both the instantaneous investments and the knowledge accumulations of the product and process innovation. This assumption relies on the simple analogy that patent protection generally applies to knowledge accumulations (R&D accumulations) outcomes rather than instantaneous efforts. A similar interpretation is found in Cellini and Lambertini's (2009) work, where a firm's R&D investments seek to accumulate cost reductions. Second, in our paper, the product price, product and process innovation investments are the decision variables; the product quality, production cost, the change rates of knowledge accumulations of product and process innovation are state variables. An important difference of our paper is that we focus on the problems of the firm's knowledge accumulation affects product and process innovation. In this regard, product and process innovation are accumulations-dependent rather than investments-dependent.This paper focuses on a monopolistic market. This assumption characterizes a firm after a new product release or a firm whose innovation is protected by a patent. The firm prices a product dynamically and invests in both product and process innovation. Compared to the literature examining innovation issues simultaneously (Adner & Levinthal, 2001; Bayus, 1995; Teng & Thompson, 1996), this paper models quality and cost as results of explicit innovation policies. In contrast to papers based on numerical simulations (Adner & Levinthal, 2001; Bayus, 1995; Saha, 2007), this paper provides analytical results of both product and process innovation under learning by doing. It derives optimal price, product and process innovation policies and shows the interactions between these policies.Since our analysis concerns firm's product and process innovation under learning by doing, there are good reasons to believe that the product and process innovation is even more important to competitive performance in semiconductors than other industries such as automobiles. Semiconductor manufacturing processes are among the most complex production processes in industry. The fabrication of an integrated circuit with feature sizes and line widths of less than 0.25 micrometers requires more than one hundred steps (patterning, coating, baking, etching, cleaning, etc.). The development of many of these steps is based on art and know-how rather than science; they are not well understood or easily replicated on different equipment or in different facilities; and they impose demanding requirements for a particle-free manufacturing environment. Product innovation in semiconductors depends on process innovation to a greater extent than is true of many other industries, since semiconductor product innovations frequently require major changes in manufacturing processes. Moreover, imperfect scientific understanding of semiconductor manufacturing means that changes in process technologies demand a great deal of experimentationThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: following this introduction, the basic model of the dynamic optimal control of process–product innovation with learning by doing is introduced in Section 2. Also, the optimal conditions and some characteristics are discussed in Section 3. The results are discussed with some illustrative examples, and a sensitivity analysis is conducted to study the effect of changing the parameters and coefficients on the objective function value in Section 4. Conclusions are given in the last section.To state the model, we define the following parameters and variables:Variablesk(t)the instantaneous investment in the product innovation at time tthe cumulative product quality at time tthe instantaneous investment in the process innovation at time tthe cumulative cost of production at time tthe instantaneous cost of investing in product innovation at time tthe instantaneous cost of investing in process innovation at time tthe current demand function at time tthe product price at time tthe product quality at time tthe knowledge accumulations of product innovation from time 0 to tthe knowledge accumulations of process innovation from time 0 to tthe fixed cost that firm carries out product innovation activitiesthe fixed cost that firm carries out process innovation activitiesthe dynamic adjoint variables,i=1,2,3,4the instantaneous net profit rate at time tthe depreciation rate due to ageing of technology, δ ∈ [0, 1]the depreciation rate, σ ∈ [0, 1]the constant parameter, α > 0the constant parameter, β > 0the constant parameter, a > 0the constant parameter, a1 > 0the constant parameter, a2 > 0the constant discount rate, r ≥ 0the length of the planning horizonthe initial level of the knowledge accumulations of process innovation,A1(0)=A10>0the initial level of the knowledge accumulations of product innovation,A2(0)=A20>0the initial level of the product quality,q(0)=q0>0the initial level of the production cost,c(0)=c0>0the positive constantthe positive constantthe learning rate of product innovation, b1 > 0the learning rate of process innovation, b2 > 0In this paper, we consider an optimal control problem over continuous timet ∈ [0, T], where at any instant a monopolist firm chooses the price and the innovation investments of product and process innovation. Instantaneous investment in the product innovation can improve the cumulative product quality, while instantaneous investment in the process innovation can reduce the cumulative cost of production (Chenavaz, 2012). The differential equations which describe the time evolution of the product quality and production costs are given, respectively, by the following form:(1)q˙(t)=k(t)−δq(t)(2)c˙(t)=−h(t)+σc(t)where investing in product quality implies increasing returns to innovative activity, and investing in production cost implies decreasing returns to innovative activity. Further, the firm's investments in product innovation and process innovation involve quadratic instantaneous cost functions measured by, respectively, the following form:(3)C(k(t))=αk2(t)(4)C(h(t))=βh2(t)Assuming that firm produces a single item. There is no stock, all the demand is satisfied, and all the production is sold. Consumers vary in their willingness to pay and their concern for product quality. The current demand function D(t) depends jointly on the product price p(t) and the product quality q(t) at time t, which has the following form:(5)D(t)=f(p(t),q(t))=a−a1p(t)+a2q(t)Thus, following Chenavaz (2012), the model of product–process innovation is given by the following form:maxp,k,hπ=∫0Te−rt[(p(t)−c(t))(a−a1p(t)+a2q(t))−αk2(t)−βh2(t)]dtS.t{q˙(t)=k(t)−δq(t)c˙(t)=−h(t)+σc(t)(P1)In the model (P1), the control variables are the product price p(t), the product innovation investment k(t) and the process innovation investment h(t); the state variables are the product quality q(t) and the production cost c(t).One important source of technological progress is learning by doing (Arrow, 1962), the process through which cost declines as firms gain experience utilizing a technology. For empirical purposes, this relationship is often characterized by a learning curve or progress ratio in which each doubling of experience leads to a fixed percentage reduction in unit costs (Argotte & Epple, 1990).We can measure the knowledge accumulations of product innovation A1(t) and process innovation A2(t) from time 0 to t by the following forms (Thompson, 2010), respectively,(6)A1(t)=A10+μ∫0tk(s)ds(7)A2(t)=A20+ξ∫0th(s)ds.This assumption is consistent with empirical studies of learning by doing, in which experience is generally measured as cumulative production (Argotte & Epple, 1990).From expressions (6) and (7), one obtains:(8)A˙1(t)=μk(t)(9)A˙2(t)=ξh(t)From expressions (8) and (9), we see that the change rate of knowledge accumulation in product innovation A1(t) and process innovation A2(t) is the instantaneous investments of innovation multiplied by the coefficient.In Chenavaz's (2012) model, the firm's cost functions of product and process innovation only depend on the instantaneous investments. Unlike the cost functions of product and process innovation in Chenavaz's (2012) model, in this paper, we assume that firm's cost functions of product and process innovation and depend on both the instantaneous investments of innovation and the knowledge accumulations of the product and process innovation, that is, respectively:(10)C(k(t),A1(t))=αk2(t)−b1(A1(t)−A10)(11)C(h(t),A2(t))=βh2(t)−b2(A2(t)−A20)where innovation costs C(k(t), A1(t)) and C(h(t), A2(t)) have the following properties: (i) C(k(t), A1(t)) and C(h(t), A2(t)) are twice differentiable; (ii) C(k(t), A1(t)) and C(h(t), A2(t)) are increasing in k(t)and h(t); decreasing inAi(t),i=1,2; (iii) C(k(t), A1(t)) and C(h(t), A2(t)) are convex in (k(t), A1(t)) and (h(t), A2(t)); (iv)C(0,Ai(t))=0,i=1,2. Innovation costs are increasing and convex in innovation and decreasing and convex in knowledge accumulation. Learning reduces innovation costs at a decreasing rate and the gains from knowledge accumulation are higher when knowledge accumulation is low.Keeping the same notation as in the model(P1), combining the model (P1)and dynamic Eq. (8), (9) and expressions (10), (11), the process and product innovation model with learning by doing can be expressed as follows:maxp,k,hΠ=∫0Te−rt{[p(t)−c(t)][a−a1p(t)+a2q(t)]−C(k(t),A1(t))−C(h(t),A2(t))}dtS.t{q˙(t)=k(t)−δq(t)c˙(t)=−h(t)+σc(t)A˙1(t)=μk(t)A˙2(t)=ξh(t)(P2)In the model (P2), the control variables are the product price p(t), the product innovation investment k(t) and the process innovation investment h(t); the state variables are the product quality q(t), the production cost c(t), the change rate of knowledge accumulations of product innovation A1(t) and process innovation A2(t). Here we assume that all the functional forms in the model (P2) are non-negative continuous and differentiable on [0, T].Let H denote the Hamiltonian function for the optimal control problem (P2), and λ1, λ2, λ3 and λ4 be the dynamic adjoint variables associated with their respective states equationq˙(t),c˙(t),A˙1(t)andA˙2(t), respectively, then the current value Hamiltonian function is:(12)H=[p(t)−c(t)][a−a1p(t)+a2q(t)]−αk(t)2+b1(A1(t)−A10)−βh(t)2+b2(A2(t)−A20)+λ1(t)(k(t)−δq(t))+λ2(t)(σc(t)−h(t))+λ3(t)μk(t)+λ4(t)ξh(t).The first-order conditions for the maximization of the Hamiltonian H:(13)∂H∂p(t)=a+a1[c(t)−2p(t)]+a2q(t)=0(14)∂H∂k(t)=λ1(t)+μλ3(t)−2αk(t)=0(15)∂H∂h(t)=−λ2(t)+ξλ4(t)−2βh(t)=0.Sinceα, β and a1 are positive parameters, for the sufficient optimality conditions for optimal control problem (12) the following inequalities always hold:∂2H∂p(t)2=−2a1<0,∂2H∂k(t)2=−2α<0,∂2H∂h(t)2=−2β<0,∂2H∂p(t)2∂2H∂k(t)2−(∂2H∂p(t)∂k(t))2=4αa1>0,∂2H∂p(t)2∂2H∂h(t)2−(∂2H∂p(t)∂h(t))2=4βa1>0,∂2H∂h(t)2∂2H∂k(t)2−(∂2H∂h(t)∂k(t))2=4αβ>0.Differentiating H with respect to q(t),c(t),A1(t) and A2(t), respectively, we get(16)∂H∂q(t)=−δλ1(t)+a2[p(t)−c(t)](17)∂H∂c(t)=σλ2(t)−a+a1p(t)−a2q(t)(18)∂H∂A1(t)=b1(19)∂H∂A2(t)=b2.The adjoint variables λi(t),i=1,2,3,4, satisfy the following differential equations:(20)λ˙1(t)=rλ1(t)−∂H∂q(t)=(r+δ)λ1(t)−a2[p(t)−c(t)](21)λ˙2(t)=rλ2(t)−∂H∂c(t)=(r−σ)λ2(t)+a−a1p(t)+a2q(t)(22)λ˙3(t)=rλ3(t)−∂H∂A1(t)=rλ3(t)−b1(23)λ˙4(t)=rλ4(t)−∂H∂A2(t)=rλ4(t)−b2.The boundary conditions of the differential Eqs. (20)–(23) are(24)λi(T)=0,i=1,2,3,4.The adjoint variables λi(t),i=1,2,3,4, are, respectively, the shadow prices associated with the quality q(t), unit cost c(t), the knowledge accumulations of product innovation A1(t) and process innovation A2(t) at time t. Thus, the Hamiltonian (12) can be interpreted as the dynamic profit rate which consists of five terms: (i) the instantaneous net profit rateπ(t)=[p(t)−c(t)][a−a1p(t)+a2q(t)]−C(k(t),A1(t))−C(h(t),A2(t)); (ii) the valueλ1(t)q˙(t)=λ1(t)(k(t)−δq(t))of the new product quality created by product innovation at rate k(t); (iii) the valueλ2(t)c˙(t)=λ2(t)(σc(t)−h(t))of the new unit cost created by process innovation at rate h(t); (iv) the valueλ3(t)A˙1(t)=λ3(t)μk(t)of the new knowledge accumulations of product quality created by learning by doing in product innovation at rate μk(t); and (v) the valueλ4(t)A˙2(t)=λ4(t)ξh(t)of the new knowledge accumulations of product unit cost created by learning by doing in process innovation at rate ξh(t).Furthermore, Eqs. (20) and (21) state that the marginal opportunity costs(r+δ)λ1(t)dtof investment in product innovation and(r−σ)λ2(t)dtof investment in process innovation should, respectively, equal the sum of the product quality marginal profit∂π(t)∂q(t)=a2[p(t)−c(t)]from increased quality and the capital gaindλ1(t)=λ˙1(t)dtand the sum of the unit cost marginal profit∂π(t)∂c(t)=−a+a1p(t)−a2q(t)from decreased unit cost and the capital gaindλ2(t)=λ˙2(t)dt. The Eqs. (22) and (23) state that the marginal opportunity costs rλ3(t)dt of the learning by doing in product innovation and rλ4(t)dt of learning by doing in process innovation should, respectively equal the sum of the marginal profit∂π(t)∂A1(t)=b1from increased knowledge accumulation in product innovation and the capital gaindλ3(t)=λ˙3(t)dtand the sum of the marginal profit∂π(t)∂A2(t)=b2from increased knowledge accumulation in process innovation and the capital gaindλ4(t)=λ˙4(t)dt.Solving the differential Eqs. (22) and (23), one yields(25)λ3(t)=(1−er(t−T))b1r(26)λ4(t)=(1−er(t−T))b2rSolvingEqs. (12)–(14), we have(27)p(t)=a+a1c(t)+a2q(t)2a1(28)k(t)=λ1(t)+μλ3(t)2α(29)h(t)=ξλ4(t)−λ2(t)2β.Substituting expressions (25), and (26) into (28) and (29), respectively, one gets(30)λ1(t)=2αk(t)−μb1r(1−er(t−T))(31)λ2(t)=−2βh(t)+ξb2r(1−er(t−T)).Substituting expressions (27), (30) and (31) into (20) and (21), we have(32)λ˙1(t)=(r+δ)[2αk(t)−μb1r(1−er(t−T))]+a22c(t)−a222a1q(t)−aa22a1(33)λ˙2(t)=(r−σ)[−2βh(t)+ξb2r(1−er(t−T))]−a12c(t)+a22q(t)+a2Differentiating Eqs. (30) and (31) totally with respect to time t, respectively, gives(34)λ˙1(t)=2αk˙(t)+μb1er(t−T)(35)λ˙2(t)=−2βh˙(t)−ξb2er(t−T)Using state Eqs. (1) and (2), together with Eqs. (32)–(35), we can get the following dynamic system of linear differential equations:(36){k˙(t)=4αa1(r+δ)k(t)+a1a2c(t)−a22q(t)−aa2−2μa1b1[1+δ(1−er(t−T))/r]4αa1h˙(t)=−a+4β(r−σ)h(t)+a1c(t)−a2q(t)−2ξb2[1−σ(1−er(t−T))/r]4βq˙(t)=k(t)−δq(t)c˙(t)=−h(t)+σc(t)The differential equations system (36) is of four differential equations which is used to study the time evolution of the product innovation investment k(t), the process innovation investment h(t), the product quality q(t) and the production cost c(t). Very often it is almost impossible to find explicitly or implicitly the solutions of a system involving N( ≥ 4) variables (especially nonlinear ones), the characteristic equation is of degree N and must often be solved numerically. Except in some particular cases, such an equation has N distinct roots that can be real or complex. These values are the eigenvalues of the N × N Jacobian matrix. The general rule is that the steady state is stable if there is no eigenvalue with a positive real part. It is sufficient that one eigenvalue is positive for the steady state to be unstable. It appears from the system (36) that the analytical solution of the system is difficult to derive and therefore we solve it numerically. In fact, the qualitative approach as well as numerical one is important since they allow us to make conclusions regardless whether we know or not the solutions.Next section, we display the numerical solutions of the differential equations system (36). Here, we first investigate the characteristics of the differential dynamic system (36).The differential dynamic system (36) describes the change rate of product and process innovation controls under learning by doing. From the system (36) we see that the dynamic controls of product and process innovationsk˙(t)andh˙(t)include time-dependent terms−μa1b1[r+δ−δer(t−T)]2rαand−ξb2[r−σ+σer(t−T))]2rβ, which means that the dynamic controls of product and process innovations under learning by doing are time-dependent.Now, we investigate the characteristics of the differential dynamic system (36). Using the time elimination method, we can assess whether the two investments of the firm's product and process innovations portfolio are complements or substitutes at any time t. Letdk(t)dh(t)=dk(t)/dtdh(t)/dt=k˙(t)h˙(t). This obtainsdk(t)dh(t)=βαa14αa1(r+δ)k(t)+a1a2c(t)−a22q(t)−aa2−2μa1b1[1+δ(1−er(t−T))/r]−a+4β(r−σ)h(t)+a1c(t)−a2q(t)−2ξb2[1−σ(1−er(t−T))/r]whose sign is positive ifk˙(t)andh˙(t)have the same sign, and negative otherwise.Proposition 1At any time t ∈ [0, T], substitutability (resp., complementarily) between process and product innovation if and only ifk˙(t)andh˙(t)have the opposite (resp., same) sign.Proposition 2At anyt ∈ [0, T], the instantaneous change rate in product (resp., process) innovation,k˙(t)(resp.,h˙(t)), is decreasing in the investment for process (resp., product) innovation.ProofThe reaction of the instantaneous investment rate in product investment to a change in process investment is∂k˙(t)∂h(t)=∂k˙(t)∂c(t)∂c(t)∂h(t)Using Eq. (2), one obtains:∂c(t)∂h(t)=∂∫0tc˙(s)ds∂h(t)=−t<0From (36), one gets∂k˙(t)∂c(t)=a24α>0, so we have∂k˙(t)∂h(t)<0.Likewise, we can write:∂h˙(t)∂k(t)=∂h˙(t)∂q(t)∂q(t)∂k(t)Using Eq. (1), one obtains:∂q(t)∂k(t)=∂∫0tq˙(s)ds∂k(t)=t>0From (36), one gets∂h˙(t)∂q(t)=−a24β<0, so we have∂h˙(t)∂k(t)<0. Finishing the proof.Let us identify the optimal level of the steady-state by the superscript “s”. By definition, the steady state conditionsq˙(t)=c˙(t)=k˙(t)=h˙(t)=λ˙3(t)=λ˙4(t)=0. Then from Eq. (22), (23) and system (36), we have(37)ks(t)=δ2(r+δ)μa1b1[4β(r−σ)σ+a1]+(r−σ)a2(2arβσ−ξa1b2)rαδ(r+δ)a1[4β(r−σ)σ+a1]+rβσ(σ−r)a22(38)hs(t)=σ2ξ(σ−r)a22b2+(r+δ)a1[μa2b1+2αδ(ar+2ξ(r−σ)b2)]rαδ(r+δ)a1[4β(r−σ)σ+a1]+rβσ(σ−r)a22(39)qs(t)=ks(t)δ(40)cs(t)=hs(t)σ(41)λ3s(t)=b1r(42)λ4s(t)=b2r.From expressions (41) and (42), we find that the steady-state's shadow prices of knowledge accumulations of product and process innovations are increasing with the learning rates b1 and b2. Next, we investigate the effect of the learning rates on the firm's process or product innovation investment.Proposition 3(i) If r ≥ σ anda1≥a224αδ(r+δ), then ks(t) and hs(t) both increase with increasing in the learning rates of product innovation b1and the process innovationb2, respectively. (ii) If r < σ anda1<a224αδ(r+δ), then hs(t) increases with increasing in the learning rates of the product innovation b1and process innovationb2, and ks(t) decreases with increasing in the learning rate of the process innovationb2. Further, whena1>4β(σ−r)σ, ks(t) increases with increasing in the learning rate of the product innovationb1; whena1≤4β(σ−r)σ, ks(t) decreases in the learning rate of the product innovation b1.ProofDifferentiating expressions (37) and (38) with respect to b1 and b2, respectively, one obtains:(43)∂ks(t)∂b1=δ(r+δ)a1[4β(r−σ)σ+a1]2r{αδ(r+δ)a12+β(r−σ)σ[4αδ(r+δ)a1−a22]}(44)∂ks(t)∂b2=−δ(r−σ)a1a22r{αδ(r+δ)a12+β(r−σ)σ[4αδ(r+δ)a1−a22]}(45)∂hs(t)∂b1=(r+δ)σa1a22r{αδ(r+δ)a12+β(r−σ)σ[4αδ(r+δ)a1−a22]}(46)∂hs(t)∂b2=(r−σ)σ[4αδ(r+δ)a1−a22]2r{αδ(r+δ)a12+β(r−σ)σ[4αδ(r+δ)a1−a22]}From expressions (43)–(46), we can get: (i) if r ≥ σ anda1≥a224αδ(r+δ), then∂ks(t)∂b1≥0,∂ks(t)∂b2≥0,∂hs(t)∂b1≥0,∂hs(t)∂b2≥0; (ii) if r < σ anda1<a224αδ(r+δ), then∂hs(t)∂b1≥0,∂hs(t)∂b2≥0∂ks(t)∂b2≤0, and whena1≤4β(σ−r)σ, we have∂ks(t)∂b1≤0; whena1>4β(σ−r)σ, we have∂ks(t)∂b1≥0. Finishing the proof.Numerically solving an ordinary differential equation system means computing a sequence of points which are, we hope, close to the graph of the real solution. The numerical solution algorithm is based on numerical integration of the system using the Runge–Kutta method. In numerical analysis, the Runge–Kutta methods are an important family of implicit and explicit iterative methods for the approximation of solutions of ordinary differential equations. Our aim in this subsection is to study the numerical solution of the differential equations system (36) to determine an optimal control strategy and its time evolution is discussed. The parameters of system (36) which are used in the numerical solution are presented in Table 1.The differential equations system (36) for the parameters presented in Table 1 is:(47){k˙(t)=−4.01+0.1719c(t)+0.18k(t)−0.135q(t)−0.0469λ3(t)h˙(t)=−6.193+0.233c(t)−0.04h(t)−0.183q(t)+0.064λ4(t)q˙(t)=k(t)−0.1q(t)c˙(t)=−h(t)+0.12c(t)Solvingdifferential Eq. (47), and identifying the optimal innovation investments and optimal trajectory of the stocks quality and unit cost by the superscript “*”, then we havek*(t)≈1.1−0.65t+0.27t2+0.0252t3−0.0073t4−0.00054t5+0.00008t6+5.553×10−6t7−4.658×10−7t8−3.18×10−8t9+1.6×10−9t10+1.154×10−10t11−3.5886×10−12t12h*(t)≈0.648t+0.3436t2+0.0057t3−0.0116t4−0.00028t5+0.00013t6+3.927×10−6t7−8.22×10−7t8−2.688×10−8t9+3.061×10−9t10+1.099×10−10t11−7.589×10−12t12q*(t)≈10+0.103t−0.329t2+0.1t3+0.004t4−0.002t5−6.3935×10−5t6+1.255×10−6t7+5.372×10−7t8−5.773×10−8t9−2.603×10−9t10+1.694×10−10t11+8.2062×10−12t12c*(t)≈30.+3.61t−0.1075t2−0.1188t3−0.005t4+0.0022t5+0.00009t6−0.000018t7−7.554×10−7t8+8.122×10−8t9+3.662×10−9t10−2.3832×10−10t11−1.1545×10−11t12p*(t)≈27.85+0.734t−0.063t2−0.011t3−0.002t4+0.0002t5+0.000028t6−0.0000017t7−2.01×10−7t8+6.924×10−8t9+8.661×10−9t10−1.6531×10−10t11−2.4904×10−11t12.The above numerical solutions are illustrated in Figs. 1–4, respectively.Fig. 1 depicts the graph of the firm's optimal product innovation level k*(t). Fig. 2 demonstrates the trajectory of the optimal process innovation level h*(t). From Fig. 3it can be concluded that product quality q(t) starts from initial value and then increase as time increases. Fig. 4displays that the unit cost c(t) starts from initial value and then increase as time increases. Fig. 5displays that the price p(t) starts from initial value and then increase as time decreases.This subsection is to assess the sensitivity of the model (P2) by studying the effect of the change of system parameters values on objective function value. In order to evaluate the impact of parameter change on the prediction results of the model, and determine which parameters are the key ones of the model(P2), the parameter sensitivity analysis is the one of the most effective methods, and it can provide guidance for calibrating model parameters and effectively avoiding the blindness to adjust model parameters. Table 2 summarizes the results of the effect of changing the parameters on the objective function value.From Table 2, it can be concluded that the objective function valueΠ is most sensitive to the change of the parametera1, and least sensitive to the change of the parameterα.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
There are many sources of the firm's competitive advantage: having the best-made product on the market, delivering superior customer service, accelerating down the experience curve and achieving lower costs faster than your rivals, being in a more convenient geographic location, proprietary technology, features and styling with more buyer appeal, an organizational structure that fosters the ability to steep the S-curve (learning rate and process/product development), process innovation that dramatically increases the effectiveness and efficiencies of a process, product innovation that full fills the wants and needs of the customer at a higher level than the old product, a well-known brand name and reputation, and providing buyers more value for their money (a combination of good quality, good service, and acceptable price) are but a few. To succeed in building a competitive advantage a firm must provide buyers with what they perceive as superior value. This means a good product at a lower price or a better product that is worth a higher price.Product and product innovation has been subject to a lot of research in the economics literature. In this paper, we approach this issue from a different point of view than most other papers. We introduce learning by doing into dynamic control model of process–product innovation, which we believe adds more realism to the analysis. Learning by doing and using are the principal drivers of incremental innovation. In almost all fields of production of goods and services, the repetition of production tasks leads to a gradual improvement in the efficiency of production processes and product/service design and performance. The importance of such ‘learning by doing’ processes has long been recognized, as has the central place of direct production workers in innovation as sources of work-based learning (Landes, 1972). Furthermore, the learning curve is the product of deliberate activities intended to improve product quality and reduce production cost, rather than the incidental byproduct of production volume. Since some of the knowledge acquired through learning by doing during new process–product development is specific to the production environment where the process–product is developed, some knowledge is effectively lost when a new process–product is transferred to manufacturing (Hatch & Mowery, 1998).Comparing with the model of Chenavaz (2012), our model significant feature is the firm's cost functions of product and process innovation depend on both the instantaneous innovation investments and the knowledge accumulations of product and process innovation. Furthermore, in our paper, an important difference of our paper is that we focus on the effects of the firm's knowledge accumulation on the product and process innovation investment. In contrast to papers based on numerical simulations (Adner & Levinthal, 2001; Bayus, 1995; Saha, 2007), this paper provides theoretical analytical framework and results. Given the analytical nature of the analysis on three decision variables (the product price, product and process innovation investments), the results are more robust than those obtained using numerical simulations (Adner & Levinthal, 2001; Levitt et al., 2012; Saha, 2007) or those relating to two decision variables (Lambertini & Mantovani, 2009; Levitt et al., 2013; Saha, 2007). Moreover, modelling quality as a state variable is also more realistic than modelling quality as a decision variable (Teng & Thompson, 1996). Derived from analytical results, we have:(i)the dynamic controls of product and process innovations under learning by doing are time-dependent, and the instantaneous change rate in product (resp., process) innovationk˙(t)(resp.,h˙(t)), decreases in the investment for process (resp., product) innovation;the steady-state's shadow prices of knowledge accumulations of product and process innovation are increasing with the learning rates of product and process innovation b1 and b2, respectively;the learning rates of product and process innovation b1 and b2 affect the firm's process or product innovation investment, respectively;the product quality q(t) starts from initial value and then increase as time increases, the unit cost c(t) starts from initial value and then increase as time increases; the objective function value Π is most sensitive to the change of the parameter a1, and least sensitive to the change of the parameter α.Consistent with the literature on technological change, product innovation relative to process innovation is more important at the beginning than at the end of the product life cycle. Process innovation increases over the life cycle of the product. Furthermore, the cost of production decreases, followed by a subsequent decrease in the price. This scheme appears in many technological industries such as automobile, airplane, or electronic semi-conductors (Bayus, 1995; Lambertini & Mantovani, 2009). This paper jointly explains the stylized facts from the empirical literature: the relative increase in process innovation and decrease in product innovation as well as the decrease in the price of technological goods (Adner & Levinthal, 2001).As an important topic for future research, our process–product innovation model with learning by doing can be extended to account for R&D investment spillovers.
