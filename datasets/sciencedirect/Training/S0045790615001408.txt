@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The paper deals with the level control of a Modified Quadruple Tank Process (MQTP). In that, the interaction is introduced between the bottom two tanks which causes an additional non-linear dynamical component of the conventional Quadruple Tank Process (QTP). Since the process has an inbuilt and imposed uncertainties, a robust Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) is initially designed to drive the system to the desired operating point via the sliding surface. Further, the conventional sliding surface is altered with fractional order dynamics. It makes a Fractional-Order SMC (FrSMC) and is proposed for both finite time convergence and counteract to the uncertainties present in the system. The undesirable chattering effect is reduced by introducing a novel exponential Multi-Level Switching (MLS) technique in order to protect control valve. Simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed Multi-Level Switching FrSMC (MFrSMC) in terms of fast convergence with high robustness when compared to conventional SMC.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Many industrial processes that have currently been implemented are multivariable processes, that is, multiple outcomes of a single process. Thus, multivariable control is always a complex platform to implement. The controlling methodology of such a complex process becomes a tedious task. As a result, a complex, nonlinear and multivariable MQTP, which is an advanced version of its prequel benchmark process known as a Quadruple Tank Process (QTP), with parametrical outages or variations, is used for analysis and control. Under the above-mentioned conditions in a complex process, a robust controller can be implemented; for example, a robust and nonlinear Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) can be used. Recent studies that have focused on overcoming the defects of the SMC in terms of improved robustness, a faster convergence rate and a reduced chattering effect in the control output have been carried out based on researchers’ interests. Regarding the finite time convergence or fast response of a controller, forcing the process to the desired track has resulted in the advancement of the composite controller of Fractional-Order SMC (FrSMC), which combines the properties of fractional dynamics and SMC.The performance of each controller is compared with that of a standard and classic Proportional and Integral (PI) controller because of its ease of implementation in an industrial environment and the flexibility provided by the PI controller in coordinating the process. Controller tuning strategies for the PI controller have been proposed and explained in detail in various studies [1]. Process modelling and the analysis of the controller’s dynamical conditions, along with theoretical and practical explanations, were presented in [2]. A complex and challenging multivariable QTP was proposed and enumerated with a PI controller for various working configurations, such as Minimum Phase (MP) and Non Minimum Phase (NMP) conditions [3]. To understand the basics of SMC in a simple manner, the author discussed the application and design of SMC for various mechanical or electromechanical systems by providing numerical examples [4]. Initially, SMC was designed for a basic entity known as a coupled tank system with a Single Input and Single Output (SISO) [5]. After the design and implementation of the conventional controllers for the benchmark QTP, which is operated in NMP mode, an advanced robust control strategy named SMC was applied [6]. Recent efforts to reduce the complexity and improve the standards of research on control have achieved slight improvements. Through such efforts, the QTP was modified during the interactions between the bottom two tanks; as a result, the size and complexity of the system increased due to the presence of an additional zero, thereby causing the system to become more oscillatory. This proposed concept is named MQTP, for which various configurations and corresponding transfer functions have been derived [7]. An extension of the modelling of MQTP, involving an inverted decoupling along with the implementation of a PI controller, has been designed and simulated in NMP mode [8]. Furthermore, the fundamentals of the corresponding fractional calculus have been identified and studied with respect to a large number of applications [9]. Fractional-order dynamics combined with SMC in two different networks of sliding surfaces, such asPDαandPIμDα, have been compared with conventional linear sliding surface networks, such as PD and PID, for a nonlinear coupled tank process [10]. To improve the convergence rate with a robust property, a Fractional-Order Proportional Derivative (FOPD) sliding surface SMC has been designed and applied to an Antilock Braking System (ABS) under multiple benchmark road conditions [11]. To enable a faster rate of convergence towards the desired trajectory, a novel fractional terminal sliding mode approach was obtained from the Lyapunov stability criterion; in addition, to compensate for the singularity conditions, a nonsingular fractional fast terminal SMC was obtained and applied to a numerical example [12,13]. The design of adaptive and robust fractional fuzzy SMC was applied to a multivariable nonlinear system (in which an adaptive law updated the controller with respect to changes in the parameters of the system in the fractional-order condition), which was compared with the conventional form of the adapting law to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methodology [14]. A fractional SISO system for which a stable SMC was designed using two different stability criteria and two fractional chaotic systems were synchronized; this approach is known as pseudo-state SMC synchronization and was highlighted using an example [15]. For a fractional chaotic system, FrSMC is used for the control system. However, to highlight the importance of the proposed method, a nominal system that is used to control both terminologies was elucidated using numerical examples [16]. SMC applied with fractional-order dynamics led to aPDαsliding surface that was then applied to a mechanical system. To reduce the undesirable chattering phenomena, an intelligent fuzzy function was used instead of a discontinuous signum function. To further improve the fuzzy performance, an optimization tool (genetic algorithm) has been implemented [17]. Novel fractional-order dynamics combined with a conventional SMC to produce a novel three-dimensional autonomous Liu system was implemented on commensurate and incommensurate systems. Finally, fuzzy methodology was used to reduce the chattering phenomena in the proposed controller [18]. Along with the study of different types of parametric models using different numerical examples, fractional-order parametric models have been used to achieve higher accuracy in all cases of operation, and estimations of the parameters have been used to implement certain control strategies [19]. The application of FrSMC for an incommensurable plant represents a novel implementation, as explained via numerical example [20]. A detailed analogy involving the development of a FrSMC-based extremum seeking controller for a nonlinear system with optimization has been discussed; this controller was mainly developed for its fast tracking performance and the improvement achieved in control accuracy [21]. To utilize both fractional-order systems and the Lyapunov stability theorem for a class of nonlinear systems, a conventional Lyapunov function was replaced with a fractional-order function to improve the stability criteria in a previous study; this improvement was verified by numerical simulations [22]. A fractional-order sliding surface was used to compensate for the mismatch, based on the back stepping concept. This proposed concept was supported by abundant numerical examples [23]. In another study, a sliding surface was formed using the fractional integral formula, and a special feedback law was used to form the control algorithm for a nonlinear differential inclusion system such that all states were forced to converge towards the surface and reach the desired equilibrium point [24]. The main objectives of the present work are: (i) design of FrSMC and SMC to control the level of bottom two tanks of MQTP, (ii) a novel MLS technique is introduced in order to reduce the chattering in control signal, and (iii) comparison of above said controllers in terms of fast convergence, better tracking and robustness.This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, a description of the dynamic model of the MQTP and an analysis of the system are presented. The basics of fractional calculus, the design of the SMC and FrSMC, and the concept of a novel MLS are developed in Section 3. In Section 4, the simulation results are presented, and the performances of the proposed controller are analysed to demonstrate the controller’s efficacy. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section 5.The laboratory MQTP is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The purpose of this plant is to control the level of the two lower tanks. The plant’s inputs are the voltage signals applied to the pumps. Fig. 2depicts the experimental setup of the MQTP consisting of four interconnected tanks with a common water source. Pump 1 discharges water to tank 1 and tank 4 simultaneously; the flows are indicated by rotameters 1 and 4, respectively. Similarly, pump 2 discharges water to tank 2 and tank 3, and the flows are indicated by rotameters 2 and 3, respectively. The split of the flow from pump 1 and pump 2 can be varied by manually adjusting the valves in tank 1 and tank 2. Tanks 1 and 2 also receive water by gravity flow from tank 3 and tank 4, respectively. The split valves in the rotameters can be manually adjusted to substantially alter the characteristics of the system. The interacting tank system is so named due to the direct coupling between the lower tanks. The strength of the coupling is controlled by means of a manual valve, which results in considerable variations in the process characteristics.A nonlinear process model is developed based on mass balance and Bernoulli’s law,(1)dh1(t)dt=-β1a1A12gh1(t)+β3a3A12gh3(t)-β12a12A1sgn(h1(t)-h2(t))2g|h1(t)-h2(t)|+γ1Kp1A1V1(t)dh2(t)dt=-β2a2A22gh2(t)+β4a4A22gh4(t)+β12a12A2sgn(h1(t)-h2(t))2g|h1(t)-h2(t)|+γ2Kp2A2V2(t)dh3(t)dt=-β3a3A32gh3(t)+(1-γ2)Kp2A3V2(t)dh4(t)dt=-β4a4A42gh4(t)+(1-γ1)Kp1A4V1(t)whereAi– Cross-section of the tank (cm2).ai– Cross-section of the outlet hole (cm2).hi– Water level in the tank (cm).βi– Outlet valve ratio; i=1 to 4.γj– Fraction of water flow from pump j.vj– Voltage input of pumps 1 and 2 (volts); j=1, 2.g – Acceleration due to gravity (cm/s2).β12– Connected valve ratio.When the sum of the flow ratios lies in the range of 1< (γ1+γ2)⩽2, the system operates in MP mode (see Table 1).Fractional calculus has a 300-year mathematical history. Over the past three centuries, this subject was the exclusive domain of mathematicians; only in the past few years has fractional calculus been implemented in several (applied) fields of engineering science and economics. Perhaps fractional calculus will become the calculus of the 21st century. The fractional-order differentiator can be denoted by a general fundamental operator as a generalization of the differential and integral operators and is defined as follows:(2)Dtα=dαdtαRα>01Rα=0∫atdt-αRα<0where α is the fractional order, which can be a complex number; the constant a is related to the initial conditions. The three definitions used for the general fractional differential and integral are the Grunwald–Letnikov (GL) definition presented in (3) and the Riemann–Liouville (RL) and Caputo definitions. Two commonly used definitions exist for the general fractional differentiation and integration, i.e., the Grunwald–Letnikov (GL) and the Riemann–Liouville (RL) definitions, respectively.(3)Dtαft=limh→01hα∑j=0n-1jαjf(t-jh)Forn-1<α<n, the initial conditions for the fractional-order differential equations with Caputo’s derivatives are of the same form as those for the integer-order differential equations.To obtain the control law in SMC, the actual systems must be converted to the standard or canonical form of the equations. Thus, for conversion purposes, the error variables are taken as phase variables, which are defined as follows, with certain assumptions made to facilitate attaining the proper control law.Assumptions1.The two bottom tanks are operated under standard or constant voltages such that the derivative of the control action is not needed. With this assumption, alterations are made to the actual dynamics of the system, and the relative degree of the system becomes 2.The level of liquid in tank 1 is always greater than that in tank 2 (h1>h2). This assumption is made to avoid the signum or the switching function in the equations so that the derivative of the equations can be easily obtained.Based on the above-mentioned assumptions, the rewritten equations become(4)ḣ1=-K11h1+K31h3-K12h1-h2+γ1kp1AV10;ḣ2=-K22h2+K42h4+K12h1-h2+γ2kp2AV20ḣ3=-K33h3+(1-γ2)kp2AV2;ḣ4=-K44h4+(1-γ1)kp1AV1whereKij=βijaA2g;Vi0– Constant input voltage;j– Index of the tank, for which the dynamics are explained; andi– Index of the tank written with respect to the jth tank.The following equations are derived based on the assumptions and equations described above, which leads to the standard form of the equation.x1=h1-href1;x3=h2-href2wherex1,x3– Error generated in the system or the assumed state variable;h1,h2– Actual height of tanks 1, 2; andhref1,href2– Reference heights of tanks 1, 2.Thus, to obtain the phase variable format or simply a standard form of the equations, the following procedure is used. The phase variable format is given by Eqs. (5) and (6).(5)ẋ1=ḣ1=x2ẋ2=h¨1=-K112h1+K122h1-h2x2+K122h1-h2x4-K31K332+K31kp2(1-γ2)2h3AV2(6)ẋ3=ḣ2=x4ẋ4=h¨2=-K222h2+K122h1-h2x4+K122h1-h2x2-K42K442+K42kp1(1-γ1)2h4AV1Generally, sliding mode control is used to monitor the desired trajectory or any functional or input parameter changes, within known bounds. According to the Hurtzwiz stability criterion, a sliding surface is constructed as follows:(7)S1=x2+m1x1wherem1>0is a positive constant. The constant determines the slope of the sliding surface. Upon checking the stability of the sliding surface itself, the positive definite Lyapunov can be obtained as follows:(8)Vn2S1=12S12>0Differentiating equation Eq. (8) leads to a derivative Lyapunov function:(9)V̇n2(S1)=S1Ṡ1<0whereṠ1=ẋ2+m1x2substituting Eq. (5) into the above equation results in the following:(10)Ṡ1=m1x2-K112h1-K122h1-h2x2+K122h1-h2x4-K31K332+K31kp2(1-γ2)2h3AV2As a result, by substituting Eq. (10) into Eq. (9), Eq. (11) becomes(11)V̇n2(S1)=S1m1-K112h1-K122h1-h2x2+K122h1-h2x4-K31K332+K31kp2(1-γ2)2h3AV2<0To ensure thatV̇n2(S1)<0, the control law must be(12)V2=-K31kp2(1-γ2)2h3A-1m1-K112h1-K122h1-h2x2+K122h1-h2x4-K31K332+α2∗sgn(S2)whereα⩾(F+η);F>f̂-ff̂– Estimated function;f– Actual function.Control lawV1is derived in a similar manner.S2=x4+m2x3is derived as follows(13)V1=-K42kp1(1-γ1)2h4A-1m2-K222h2-K122h1-h2x4+K122h1-h2x2-K42K442+α1∗sgn(S1)Thus, by using the above-described control law, the Lyapunov function becomesV̇n2(S1)<0.The FrSMC is obtained from the Fractional-Order Sliding Surface and is given by Eq. (14):(14)S=m1x1+Dαx1Rearranging Eq. (14) yields(15)S1=m1x1+DαD-1ẋ1;S1=m1x1+D(α-1)x2Upon differentiating Eq. (15), we have(16)Ṡ1=m1x2+D(α-1)ẋ2For simplicity, Eq. (16) is rearranged into the following form(17)Ṡ1=0=D(1-α)m1x2+ẋ2By considering the following Lyapunov function(18)VS1=12S12>0differentiating Eq. (18) yields(19)V̇(S1)=S1∗Ṡ1=S1(D(1-α)m1x2+ẋ2)=S1D(1-α)m1x2+K112h1+K122h1-h2x2+K122h1-h2x4-K31K332+K31kp2(1-γ2)2h3AV2⩽0Using fractional-order dynamics to ensure that Eq. (19) is negative definite, The sliding control law is as follows:(20)V2=-K13kp21-γ22h3A-1D1-αm1-K112h1-K122h1-h2x2+K122h1-h2x4-K13K332+α2∗sgnS1Control lawV1is derived in a similar way fromS2=m2x3+DαD-1ẋ3:(21)V1=-K24kp1(1-γ1)2h4A-1D(1-α)m2-K222h2-K122h1-h2x4+K122h1-h2x2-K24K442+α1∗sgn(S2)The finite response or convergence can be defined using FrSMC, which is not possible for a conventional SMC, by setting Eq. (14) equal to zero and then rearranging and integrating it to produce the following equation:(22)∫t0tfdtα=-1m1∫x1(0)x1(t)x1-1dαx1Becausex1t=0, the final steady-state error must be zero, and upon integrating Eq. (22), the finite time of convergence is obtained as follows:(23)t=αα-1m11/αx1(0)+(α-1)αsecA novel MLS algorithm is presented to address the serious issue of chattering in SMC. For MLS, different operating conditions of the system are studied and classified into three different operating regimes with different error of occurrence conditions. The variables used are the following: different operating regions (LS – Lower level operating region, MS – Middle Level Operating Region, and HS – Higher Level Operating Region), different error occurring regions (ZR – Around Zero Error Condition, MR – Medium Error Occurrence Condition, and HR – High Error Occurrence Condition), and different switching levels (L – Low level switching, M – Medium level switching, and H – High level switching).The Exponential MLS variable gain isg0=Variablelevelswitchinglevelupper-lowerlimits/fulllevelswitchingupper-lowerlimitsThe logical combination of switching is presented in Table 2, and the various ranges for the operating regions with an MLS gain is presented in Table 3. The chattering is reduced and smoothed by the MLS component. The smooth transition of switching is given byGFs=1g0s+1. Then, thesgn(S)term is replaced by the ML variable gain combined with the smoothness term, which is given byL-1GFs∗∣S∣=L-11g0s+1∗∣S∣=∣S∣g0e-tg0. The control law containing the MLS gain component for Tank 2 is given by Eq. (24).(24)V2=-K13kp21-γ22h3A-1D1-αm1-K112h1-K122h1-h2x2+K122h1-h2x4-K13K332+α2∗S1g0e-tg0Similarly, the control law containing the MLS gain component for Tank 1 is given by Eq. (25).(25)V1=-K24kp1(1-γ1)2h4A-1D1-αm2-K222h2-K122h1-h2x4+K122h1-h2x2-K24K442+α1∗S2g0e-tg0Thus, the combination of a smoothing filter and the MLS gain collectively reduces the excess control effort and sudden switching transients in the final control element, respectively. The modulus of the sliding surface∣S∣is considered to satisfy the Lyapunov criterion such that the obtained control law with the proposed methodology does not affect the stability of the system. Consider a Lyapunov function and its first derivative, as in Eqs. (18) and (19). Upon proper substitution, the first derivative of the Lyapunov function is obtained as indicated in Eq. (19), and then, the control law obtained in Eq. (24) for Tank 1 is substituted into Eq. (19); finally, Eq. (26) is obtained, which is clearly a negative definite function. This result is adequate for solving the stability problem. Thus, MLS does not alter the system stability region of the operation. Because the conditiong0>0is always valid, the exponential function also becomes positive. Thus, the function is always negative as long as the conditions outlined above are not violated.(26)V̇(S1)=S1∗Ṡ1=-S1α2∗|S1|g0e-tg0<0The simulation results of MSMC and MFrSMC are discussed and compared for servo, regulatory and robustness responses in the following sections.To test the ability of the proposed MFrSMC, multiple step changes in the process variables are given (initially, 26.32% of the positive step change at 600s and 52.64% of the negative step change at 1200s). The MFrSMC is observed to display better tracking performance with a faster settling time (albeit with some overshoot) and to reduce the undesirable chattering effect in the control signal. However, MSMC shows some steady-state error. The corresponding variations in the process variables and manipulated variables with SMC with and without MLS and MFrSMC are illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4. The theoretical response times or convergence times, according to Eq. 23, are 64.23s and 58.97s for Tanks 1 and 2, respectively.The simulation showed response times of 98s and 97s for Tanks 1 and 2, respectively. The results indicate that the practical and the mathematical finite time convergence times are in good agreement.Figs. 5 and 6depict the performance of the two controllers with respect to disturbance rejection. After reaching a steady state, a sudden disturbance d1 (drain 11.11% of water in tank 1) is introduced at 250s, and d2 (22.22% increase in the flow rate of Tank 1) is introduced at 500s.Based on the response, the proposed controller is inferred to reject the disturbance quickly and with less chattering of the control signals. The same amount of disturbance is also observed in Tank 2.Simulation studies are performed to demonstrate the robust performance of the controllers presented. The robust control action of the controller is tested by varying any of the dynamic parameters of the system. In the case of the MQTP, the interaction valve of the bottom tanks (1, 2) is physically changed from its nominal condition. To test the operational quality afforded by the proposed method, the interaction valve is varied by adjusting the valve at various instances in both the positive and negative direction with both a gradual and an instantaneous pattern, as pictorially represented in Fig. 7(c).Based on the simulated results, MFrSMC effectively handles the change in the system parameter in the MQTP interaction valve and maintains a constant robust performance compared to the conventional MSMC, as illustrated in Figs. 7(a) and (b).Table 4summarizes the performance of different controllers. The effectiveness of the proposed MFrSMC is compared with that of the MSMC in terms of quality indices, such as the settling time and the peak overshoot, and error indices, such as ISE, IAE and ITAE, for the h1 loop and h2 loop for set point tracking and disturbance rejection. The proposed method shows lower error indices than the other methods considered, as well as a considerable overshoot. However, the settling time is reduced for the MFrSMC.
