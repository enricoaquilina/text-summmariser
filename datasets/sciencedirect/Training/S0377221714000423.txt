@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A reliability system subject to shocks producing damage and failure is considered. The source of shocks producing failures is governed by a Markovian arrival process. All the shocks produce deterioration and some of them failures, which can be repairable or non-repairable. Repair times are governed by a phase-type distribution. The number of deteriorating shocks that the system can stand is fixed. After a fatal failure the system is replaced by another identical one. For this model the availability, the reliability, and the rate of occurrence of the different types of failures are calculated. It is shown that this model extends other previously published in the literature.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Engineering systems sometimes are considered as unit ones when the interest is focused in the behavior of the system as a whole. In many cases the systems operate under environmental conditions producing shocks that cause damage and eventually the failure of them. These conditions can generate different types of shocks (vibrations, heat, strength) that usually cause deterioration to the system. Several probabilistic models can be applied to govern the different systems under shocks, such as the competitive risk model when the different shocks can be considered independent. In general, the independence among the interarrival time of the shocks is usually assumed.We study a system under different types of shocks causing deterioration and eventually the failure. It will be assumed that all the shocks arise from a source and they can be of different types. The shocks can cause repairable or non-repairable damages, these last are fatal ones. There are shocks causing only a mild deterioration in the system in such a way that it continues operational without repair, but the number of these is limited and after a certain fixed number of them the system is replaced. After a non-repairable failure the system is also replaced. Repair is as good as new. This system is studied following the matrix-analytic methods.The study of shock and wear models initiated with (Esary, Marshall, & Proschan, 1973), in it the arrival of shocks followed a Poisson process. From then many papers have been written related to shock models (see Finkelstein, 2007, 2008; Tang, 2006, and references in them). The first version of this paper under matrix-analytic methods and incorporating an explicit expression of the reliability function of the system under shocks is due to Neuts and Bhattacharjee (1981). The matrix-analytic methods have proved to be useful in the study of reliability systems incorporating several types of failure and repair with a unified treatment from the methodological point of view. Neuts (1979) introduced the Markovian arrival processes as an arrival model of events to the positive real half line. These have the property of having dependent interarrival times, extend previous models and allow to consider more general models in the study of reliability systems under shocks. Neuts (1981) studied the phase-type distributions, these are being a versatile model for the study of reliability systems under general operational and repair random times since they are dense in the family of the continuous distribution functions defined on the positive half real line. In Asmussen (2000) a survey about phase-type distributions and Markovian arrival processes is performed showing applied aspects of them and indicating how to fit them to datasets. Other papers that have applied phase-type distributions to shocks and wear models are references (Frostig & Kenzin, 2009; Montoro-Cazorla, Pérez-Ocón, & Segovia, 2009). Papers considering phase-type distributions as a model for the occurrence of a wear failure and repair times, and Markovian arrival processes as a model for the arrival of shocks causing failure, each one independent from the other, are references (Montoro-Cazorla & Pérez-Ocón, 2006a, 2006b, 2011, 2012a, 2012b; Montoro-Cazorla, Pérez-Ocón, & Segovia, 2009; Pérez-Ocón & Segovia, 2009).In the present paper there are several contributions to the study of reliability systems. (1) A single source for the failures is considered, governed by a Markovian arrival process. This structure allows us to include all the events associated to the different types of shock by introducing six parametric matrices in the Markovian arrival process, each one representing the rate of occurrence of the different types of shock. The behavior of the system is governed by a multidimensional Markov process. (2) Two types of failure are considered. This allows us to model the arrival of shocks to a system composed by two well-differentiated parts, as mechanical and electrical ones. (3) Every type of shock causes different damage in the system: minor, reparable, and fatal damage. (4) Policy K of replacement is included in the maintenance of the system and the performance measures are calculated in terms of K. (5) The performance measures calculated are: the availability, the reliability, and the rates of occurrence of the different shocks in transient and stationary regime. (6) A comparison among these measures for different values of K is performed to determine the system with optimal availability and rate of occurrence of failures. The expressions of these measures are given in algorithmic form to be computationally implemented and so to be applied in practical applications. The versatility of the Markovian arrival process to be a model for a very complex system and its algorithmic advantages are shown throughout the paper.The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the multidimensional Markov model is constructed. In Section 3 the performance measures are calculated in transient regime. In Section 4 the stationary study of the system is performed. In Section 5 several special cases studied in the literature are included as particular and related ones to the present system. In Section 6 a numerical application is performed. Conclusions are included at the end of the paper.The phase-type distributions, the Markovian arrival process, and the operations of Kronecker play an important role in the present paper. They are the basic elements in the application of the matrix-analytic methods. We define them formally for a better comprehension of the paper. For more details see (Bellman, 1997; Graham, 1981; Neuts, 1981).Definition 1The distribution functionH(·)defined on[0,∞[is a continuous phase-type distribution (PH-distribution) if it is given byH(x)=1-αexp(Sx)e,x⩾0.It is associated to a finite Markov process with one absorbent state. The initial vector of the process isα. Matrix S is the submatrix of the generator of the process restricted to the transient states. Vector e is a column vector of 1s of appropriate order. The absorption vector is denoted byS0and it satisfiesSe+S0=0. The order of the vectors and matrices involved are the same and it is the order of the distribution. It is said that the distribution has representation(α,S)and it is writtenPH(α,S).A similar definition applicable to a Markov chain of discrete parameter is valid for defining discrete phase-type distributions.Definition 2Let D be an irreducible infinitesimal generator of a Markov process. Let a sequence of matricesDk,k⩾1, be non-negative and the matrixD0with non-negative off-diagonal entries. The diagonal entries ofD0are strictly negative and it is non-singular. It is satisfiedD=D0+∑k⩾1Dk.All the matrices are square and have the same order. Associated to this Markov process there is renewal Markov process performing an arrival process to real line operating as follows. MatrixD0governs the interarrival times and matrixDkgoverns the arrival of typek,k⩾1. This is the Markovian arrival process (MAP) associated to the initial Markov process. The order of the MAP is the order of the involved matrices.Definition 3If Aand B are rectangular matrices of ordersm1×m2andn1×n2, respectively, their Kronecker productA⊗Bis the matrix of orderm1n1×m2n2, written in compact form as(aijB).The Kronecker sum of the square matrices C and D of orders p and q, respectively, is defined byC⊕D=C⊗Iq+Ip⊗D, whereIkdenotes the identity matrix of order k.Let a system be subject to shocks produced by a unique source. Two types of shocks are distinguished. Each one of these produce several types of failures depending on the damage produced in the system. The occurrence of all these types of failures is governed by an MAP that will be defined below. The behavior of the system is governed by the following assumptions.Assumption 1The occurrence of the shocks is governed by an MAP.Two types of shocks are distinguished, denoted by type I and type II, producing deterioration, failure, and replacement.Fatal shocks cause non-repairable failures and consequently the replacement of the system.Repair is as good as new, and the time wasted in it follows aPH(β,S)distribution of order n.All the shocks produce deterioration and some of them are neither repairable nor fatal, so the system continues working after receiving them. It will be assumed that the system can stand exactly K deteriorating shocks. The system is replaced to the arrival of the(K+1)th deteriorating shock,K>1.The replacement times are instantaneous.So, there are really six types of distinguishable shocks depending on their effect upon the system. These effects are failures that can be repairable, fatal, and causing deterioration, and everyone of these can belong to one of the types I and II. A model grouping all these types is necessarily complex. The matrix-analytic methods allow us to consider a model involving all these types of shocks and including interdependence between their occurrence times.The MAP governing the arrival of shocks is assumed to have initial vector d and order m. It can be expressed asMAP(d,D0,D1(1),D1(2),D2,D3(1),D3(2),D4).We interpret the parameter matrices of the MAP.For shocks producing failures of type I matrixD1(1)collects the rates of occurrence of the deteriorating shocks; matrixD1(2)the rates of occurrence of repairable failures; and matrixD2the rates of occurrence of fatal failures.For shocks producing type II failures matrixD3(1)collects the rates of occurrence of the deteriorating shocks; matrixD3(2)the rates of occurrence of the repairable failures; and matrixD4the rates of occurrence of the fatal failures.MatrixD0collects the rates of virtual transitions among the exponential phases when no failure arrives. It governs the MAP between shocks. The rest of matrices are grouped in terms of the type of failure. They are formed by the rates of arrival of the different types of shock that can occur when the MAP occupies any of the virtual exponential phases.As a consequence of these previous interpretations, we introduce matrixD1=D1(1)+D1(2)for collecting the rates of arrival of non-fatal failures of type I, and matrixD3=D3(1)+D3(2)for collecting the rates of arrival of non-fatal failures of type II.We define the macro-states associated to this matrix structure that will represent the different physical situations that the system can occupy.Macro-states are formed by vectors whose components are the number of deteriorating shocks undergone by the system, the phases of the MAP, and the phases of the repair. This order will be preserved. We define the macro-states.If the system is new, it occupies macro-estate0={j},j=1,2,…,mare the phases of the MAP. It is a vector of order m.If the system has undergone i deteriorating shocks, it occupies macro-statei={(i,j)},i=1,2,…,K;j=1,2,…,mare the phases of the MAP. It is a vector of order m.If the system is in repair and it has not undergone any deteriorating shock, it occupies macro-state0R={(j,k)},j=1,2,…,mare the phases of the MAP,k=1,2,…,nare the phases of repair. It is a vector of order mn.If the system is in repair after undergoing i deteriorating shocks, it occupies macro-stateiR={(i,j,k)},i=1,2,…,K,j=1,2,…,mare the phases of the MAP andk=1,2,…,nare the phases of repair. It is a vector of order mn.For simplifying, in the construction of the generator we group the macro-states in four classes:0,1¯={1,2,…,K},0R,1¯R={1R,2R,…,KR}.Set1¯collects the macro-states in which the system has undergone any deteriorating shock. Similarly,1¯Rcollects the macro-states indicating the repair when the system has undergone any deteriorating shock. The operational macro-states are0,1¯.The number of deteriorating shocks is a counter indicating the deteriorating level of the system. It is represented by the discrete PH-distribution whose representation isPH(γ,L), being:γ=(1,0,…,0)1×K,L=010⋯0001⋯0⋮⋮⋮⋱00000100000K×K.The Markov process governing the system is a multidimensional stochastic process{X(t),t⩾0}with state space formed by the macro-states{0,1¯,0R,1¯R}above defined. The generator takes the following expression:(2.1)Q(K)=Q00(K)Q01¯(K)Q00R(K)0Q1¯0(K)Q1¯1¯(K)0Q1¯1¯R(K)Q0R0(K)0Q0R0R(K)00Q1¯R1¯(K)0Q1¯R1¯R(K).We explain how the blocks are constructed.BlockQ00(K)describes one of these situations: (1) the system operates and it has not undergone any deteriorating shock, governed byD0or (2)the system undergoes a shock producing a fatal failure occupying the MAP any phase and then the MAP reinitiates, governed by(D2+D4)ed. The order ism×mand the expression is:Q00(K)=D0+(D2+D4)ed.BlockQ01¯(K)indicates the occurrence of a deteriorating shock when the system is new, governed byD1(1)+D3(1). The blocks corresponding to the casesi=2,…,Kare null. The expression is:Q01¯(K)=D1(1)+D3(1)0⋯0m×Km.BlockQ00R(K)indicates the occurrence of a repairable failure when the system is new, governed byD1(2)+D3(2), and the repair initiates, governed byβ. The expression is:Q00R(K)=D1(2)+D3(2))⊗βm×mn.BlockQ1¯0(K)indicates the occurrence of a fatal failure and the system reinitiates. This can occur in two ways: (1) when the system has undergone1,2,…,K-1deteriorating shocks, governed by(D2+D4)edand (2) when the system has undergone exactly K shocks; then, any shock causes the replacement of the system, and this case is governed by(D2+D4)ed+(D1(1)+D3(1))ed. The expression is:Q1¯0(K)=(D2+D4)ed(D2+D4)ed⋮(D2+D4)ed(D2+D4)ed+(D1(1)+D3(1))edKm×m.BlockQ1¯1¯(K)indicates that the system occupies any of the macro-statesi=1,2,…,K. It can occur that there is no change, governed byD0, or the arrival of a deteriorating shock when the system occupies macro-statei=1,2,…,K-1. The expression is:Q1¯1¯(K)=D0D1(1)+D3(1)D0⋱⋱D1(1)+D3(1)D0Km×Km.BlockQ1¯1¯R(K)indicates that the system occupies set1¯, a shock producing a repairable failure governed byD1(2)+D3(2)arrives, and the repair is initiated, governed byβ. This can occur from any of the macro-states of1¯. The expression is:Q1¯1¯R(K)=(D1(2)+D3(2))⊗β000⋱⋱⋮⋱0000(D1(2)+D3(2))⊗βKm×Kmn.BlockQ0R0(K)indicates that a repair is completed when the system has not received any deteriorating shock. The MAP does not change. The order of this block ismn×m, and it isQ0R0(K)=I⊗S0.BlockQ0R0R(K)indicates that the system is in repair, the MAP does not change. The order of this block ismn×mn, and it isQ0R0R(K)=I⊗S.BlockQ1¯R1¯(K)indicates that a repair is completed when the system has received any deteriorating shock. The MAP does not change. The system can occupy any of the macro-states in1¯R. The block takes the expression:Q1¯R1¯(K)=I⊗S0I⊗S0⋱I⊗S0Kmn×Km.BlockQ1¯R1¯R(K)indicates that the system is in repair, occupying any of the macro-statesiR,i=1,2,…,K. The expression isQ1¯R1¯R(K)=I⊗SI⊗S⋱I⊗SKmn×Kmn.Associated to the Markov process{X(t),t⩾0}with generator (2.1) are the transition probability functions among the macro-states:Pi,j(t)=P{X(t)=j|X(0)=i},i,j∈{0,1¯,0R,1¯R}.DenotingP(t)=(Pi,j(t)),i,j=0,1¯,0R,1¯Rthe matrix form of the forward Kolmogorov differential equations isP′(t)=P(t)Qunder the initial conditionP(0)=I. It is well-known that the solution of this equation isP(t)=exp(Qt), and this can be solved by using computational programs.The reliability measures of the system are calculated in terms of the transition probability functions inP(t). The performance measures we calculate are the availability, the reliability, the rate of occurrences of the different types of shocks and replacements. It will be assumed that initially the system occupies macro-state 0. The MAP initiates according to initial vector d.Availability at time t is the probability that the system will be operational at time t. The operational macro-states are0,1¯, then the probability that the system will occupy an operational macro-state at time t under the initial conditions is given byAK(t)=d[P00(t)e+P01¯(t)e].The reliability of the system at time t is the probability of being operational continuously fromt=0up to time t. So, during this time the system cannot be repaired. The transition probability functionsP(t)express the transition among macro-states during a time t, with no information about the intermediate macro-states visited during this time. These probabilities do not allow to calculate the reliability. We must calculate the transition probability functions among operational macro-states during a time t for those trajectories of the Markov processX(t)not visiting any non-operational macro-state0R,1¯R. The calculation of these probabilities is done by considering that the set of macro-states{0R,1¯R}is a taboo set. From the general theory of Markov processes, for calculating these probabilities the trajectories of the system visiting any macro-state taboo are eliminated and consequently the taboo set of macro-states is not considered in the original generator (2.1). The resultant sub-matrix after this operation is denoted byV=Q00Q01¯Q1¯0Q1¯1¯.The taboo transition probability functions of operational macro-states are denoted byWi,j(t)=P{X(t)=j,X(s)∉{0R,1¯R},0⩽s⩽t|X(0)=i},i,j∈{0,1¯}.These are the transition probability functions from macro-state i to macro-state j without visiting repair during period t. They are collected in a matrixW(t)=(Wij(t))and solving the forward Kolmogorov equations restricted to macro-states0,1¯, it is calculatedW(t)=exp(Vt)under the initial conditionW(0)=I.The reliability of the system at time t is given by(3.1)RK(t)=d[W00(t)e+W01¯(t)e].The rate of occurrence of shocks is the mean number of shocks per unit time. We calculate these mean number for the different shocks considered: deteriorating shocks, shocks causing repair, and fatal shocks. The shocks occur when the system occupies any of the operational macro-states 0 or1¯.We consider the case of deteriorating shocks. The system will occupy macro-states0,1¯at time t with probabilitiesP00(t),P01¯(t), respectively. The rate of occurrence of this type of shocks is governed by the matricesD1(1),D3(1). Then the mean number of deteriorating shocks per unit time at time t is(3.2)νK1(t)=dP00(t)[D1(1)+D3(1)]e+dP01¯(t)[L⊗(D1(1)+D3(1))]e.We consider now the rate of the shocks causing repair or, in other words, the mean number of repairs per unit time. Reasoning as in the previous type of shocks, the mean number of repairs per unit time at time t is(3.3)νK2(t)=dP00(t)[(D1(2)+D3(2))]e+dP01¯(t)[L⊗(D1(2)+D3(2))]e.The total mean number of non-fatal shocks per unit time at time t isνK(t)=νK1(t)+νK2(t).The rate of occurrence of replacements is constructed in a similar way. If the system occupies macro-state 0, the arrival of a fatal failure, governed by matricesD2,D4causes the replacement. If the system occupies macro-state1¯, a replacement is caused by the occurrence of a fatal failure. If the system occupies macro-state K any shock produces a replacement. The mean number of replacements per unit time at time t is(3.4)rK(t)=dP00(t)[(D2+D4)]e+dP01¯(t)[L⊗(D2+D4)]e+[e⊗(D-D0)]e.The stationary study of the system is based in the stationary probability vectorπthat we define now. Associated to the state-space of macro-states we define the stationary probability vector of the system asπ(K)=[π0(K),π1(K),…,πK(K),π0R(K),…,πKR(K)],whereπi(K)denotes the probability of occupancy macro-statei,i=0,1,…,K; andπiR(K)denotes the occupancy probabilities of macro-stateiR,i=0,1,…K, all of them at any time. Everyπi(K)is a vector formed by the probabilities of occupancy of the exponential phases of macro-state i and it is of order m. Similarly, vectorπiR(K)is formed by the phases of macro-stateiRand it is of order mn.This vector is the solution of the matrix equationπ(K)Q(K)=0under the normalization conditionπ(K)e=1. From the first matrix equation we have the matrix algebraic system:π0(K)[D0+(D2+D4)e]+∑i=1K-1πi(K)(D2+D4)e+πK(K)[(D2+D4)ed+(D1+D3)ed]+π0R(K)(I⊗S0)=0,πi-1(K)(D1(1)+D3(1))+πi(K)D0+πiR(K)(I⊗S0)=0,i=1,…,K,πi(K)[(D1(2)+D3(2))⊗β]+πiR(K)(I⊗S)=0,i=0,…,K.From the last equation, it is possible to obtain a recurrent solution:πiR(K)=πi(K)G,i=0,…,K,beingG=-[(D1(2)+D3(2))⊗β][I⊗S]-1.ReplacingπiR(K)in the second equation above, we obtain:πi(K)=πi-1(K)R,i=0,…,K,beingR=-[D1(1)+D3(1)+G(I⊗S0)]D0-1.The final recurrence expression for the stationary probability vector in terms ofπ0is:πi(K)=π0(K)Ri,i=0,…,K,πiR(K)=π0(K)RiG,i=0,…,K.The normalization conditionπ(K)e=1allows to calculateπ0(K)as solution of the system:π0(K)D0+∑i=0KRi(D2+D4)ed+RK(D1(1)+D3(1))ed]=0,π0(K)∑i=0KRi(I+G)e=1.The calculation of this vector must be done step by step. The data are the vectorsd,βand the matricesD0,D1(1),D1(2),D2,D3(1),D3(2),D. From these, the successive matrices must be calculated:G,R,Ri,i=0,1,…,K, according to the previous expressions. The stationary performance measures are calculated from vectorπ(K). They are calculated in the next section.We calculate the same performance measures obtained in transient regime. The reasoning for calculating them is the one followed in Section 3 for the corresponding performance measures. On the other hand, taking limits whent→∞in the transient expressions the stationary performance measures are directly obtained.The availability is the probability of occupying any operational macro-state:A(K)=π0(K)+π1(K)+⋯+πK(K).The mean number of deteriorating shocks per unit time is:ν1(K)=∑i=0K-1πi(K)[D1(1)+D3(1)]e=π0(K)∑i=0K-1Ri[D1(1)+D3(1)]e.The mean number of repairs per unit time:ν2(K)=πi(K)[D1(2)+D3(2)]e=π0(K)∑i=0KRi[D1(2)+D3(2)]e.The total mean number of non-fatal shocks per unit time isν(K)=ν1(K)+ν2(K).The mean number of replacements per unit time is:r(K)=∑i=0Kπi(K)(D2+D4)e+πK(K)[D1(1)+D3(1)]e=π0(K)∑i=0KRi(D2+D4)+RK[D1(1)+D3(1)]e.We consider two special cases of the general model. The first one is the initial shock and wear model in Esary et al. (1973) under the matrix-analytic methodology. The second one considers the wear following a phase-type distribution and it has been published in Montoro-Cazorla and Pérez-Ocón (2006a) under some different assumptions. We present them here showing that the MAP allows us to extend previous works incorporating dependence among the interarrival times of the shocks.Let the system in Section 2 be assuming that there is no repair. This is different to the initial shock and wear model (Esary et al., 1973) in several ways: (1) the Poisson arrival of shocks is replaced by an MAP simpler than the one in (2.1); (2) two types of failure I and II are considered, while in the initial paper only one type was taken into account;and (3) there is a limited number K of deteriorating shocks, while in the initial paper it was not. In both systems there is no repair, there are only deteriorating and fatal shocks, we haveD1(2)=D3(2)=0.The set of macro-states is{0,1¯}with1¯={1,2,…,K}.The expression of the MAP isMAP(d,D0,D1(1),D2,D3(1),D4).The corresponding generator governing the system isQ(K)=Q00(K)Q01¯(K)Q1¯0(K)Q1¯1¯(K).All the following elements have been calculated in Section 3.Note that matrixQ(K)is the one defined when taboo macro-states were introduced and that was denoted by V. Then, in this model we can use the transition probability matrixW(t)=exp(Vt)governing the system.The evolution of the system can be described by a renewal process with distribution function given byFK(t)=1-RK(t), beingRK(t)given in (3.1).The rate of occurrence of non-fatal shocks is similar to the one previously calculated in (3.2) replacing the transition probability functions:ν(t)=dW00(t)[D1(1)+D3(1)]e+dW01¯(t)[L⊗(D1(1)+D3(1))]e.The rate of occurrence of replacements is similar to expression (3.4), but now matrix D is simpler than the one used in Section 2 since there is no repair,D=D0+D1(1)+D2+D3(1)+D4and transition probability functions are given by matrixW(t). We haverK(t)=dW00(t)[(D2+D4)]e++dW01¯(t)[L⊗(D2+D4)]e+[e⊗(D-D0)]e.In stationary regime, the intermediate matrix for calculating the stationary probability vector isG=0, and consequentlyR=-[D1(1)+D3(1)]D0-1.The performance measures in stationary regime can be directly calculated.If there is only one type of failure, for example type I, thenD3(1)=0, and the only difference with the system in Esary et al. (1973) is the arrival model.This particular model has been published in Montoro-Cazorla and Pérez-Ocón (2006a). In it, the wear were governed by a phase-type distribution and the arrival of failures (shocks) were governed by an MAP. Their occurrence were independent. Wear failures arrived following aPH(α,T)-distribution. The shocks arrived following aMAP(f,F0,F1,F2), whereF1andF2are the parameter matrices indicating the rate of occurrence of repairable and non-repairable failures, respectively.This previous paper can be interpreted as a special case of the present one introducing an MAP governing all the failures (shocks and wear). In this new model there is dependence among the interarrival times of internal and external failures. We interpret the wear and the external failures (shocks) in the previous paper as type I and type II failures in this new model, respectively. Preserving the notation of the previous paper under the new model, the MAP governing the arrival of shocks has the parameter matrices:d=α⊗f,D0=T⊕F0,D1=D1(1)=0,D2=T0α⊗I,D3=D3(1)=I⊗F1,D3(2)=0,D4=eα⊗F2.Under this MAP the paper (Montoro-Cazorla & Pérez-Ocón, 2006a) can be studied in a more ample way.The stationary regime is simplified, and as in the previous section,G=0andR=-(I⊗F1)(T⊕F0)-1. From here it is possible to study the stationary behavior of the system.We illustrate the calculations throughout the paper by means of a numerical application in stationary regime. The system we have studied depends on the value K and so all the performance measures. We present a system below and perform a comparison for the different performance measures in terms of the parameter K. Let a system be as the one defined in Section 2 subject to shocks arriving following an MAP whose parameter matrices are the following:d=(1,0),D0=-10.740.25-0.85,D1(1)=0.13000.15,D1(2)=0.02000.10,D2=0.01000.10,D3(1)=0.075000.10,D3(2)=0.015000.05,D4=0.01000.10.The representation of the PH-distribution of the repair time is the following:β=(1,0),S=-0.91550.45390.4539-0.9155.It will be assumed that the number of deteriorating shocks that the system can stand is K.We calculate numerically the following performance measures for different values of K: availabilityA(K); rate of occurrence of deteriorating shocksν1(K); rate of occurrence of repairsν2(K);rate of occurrence of replacementsr(K); and mean time between consecutive replacementsμ(K). All these measures are calculated in Table 1for some values of K using computational calculations.It is observed that fromK=7on all the performance measures reach a limit value and become constant independently of K. In Fig. 1the rate of occurrence of shocks and replacements are represented graphically.The availability decreases forK=1toK=7, and then it becomes constant. This is a consequence that there are more repairs when K increases and the proportion of time that the system is operational decreases. However, this occur only up to valueK=7. From it, the availability is constant.The rate of occurrence of deteriorating shocks increases with K untilK=7and it is almost constant for greater values of K. The rate of occurrence of failures causing repair increases with K untilK=6, and it is constant from then on. It is observed that the values of the rate of occurrences of these shocks are significantly different, as it is shown in Fig. 1. This means that the source of shocks produces more failures needing repair than deteriorating ones.The rate of replacement decreases with K up toK=6and it is constant from then on, with values near to zero (see Fig. 1). For little values of K the system has a greater trend to the replacement than for values of K greater than six. We recall that the replacements are provoked by fatal failures or the accumulation of deteriorating shocks, then it seems that for valuesK>6the rate of replacements is not affected, depending mainly on the arrival of non-reparable shocks (see Fig. 2).In resume, the performance measures vary for little values of K but all of them are constant fromK=7on. It seems that the system does not change in their benefits when the number of deteriorating shocks is seven or more, as if there were stationary also in the number of deteriorating shocks and that this is reached forK=7.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
We have considered a system under different types of shocks governed by an MAP, a stochastic model whose interarrival times are dependent. Two types of shocks have been studied, and for them three different types of shocks have been included, depending on their effect on the system. This model can be applied straightaway to systems composed by two well-differenced elements, such as devices composed by mechanical and electrical parts. But many other systems composed by more than two parts and subject to more types of shock could be considered under the structure of an MAP in order to show the influence of the environmental conditions on the behavior of the system. The study of these systems would be similar to the present one introducing more parameter matrices representing the rate of occurrence of damages onto the corresponding elements in the MAP, and consequently more complicated calculations. The replacement policy K introduces the effect of certain type of detected shocks whose accumulation produces damage to the system. In the numerical example is presented a study of how the effect of the number of deteriorating shocks K can be used for designing and control of reliability systems by using simulation.
