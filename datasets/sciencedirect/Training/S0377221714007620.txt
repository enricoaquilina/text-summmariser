@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In a bankruptcy situation individuals are not equally affected since each one has its own specific characteristics. These aspects cannot be ignored and may justify an allocation bias in favor of or against some individuals. This paper develops a theory of differentiation in claims problems that considers not only the vector of claims, but also some justified differentiating criteria based on other characteristics (wealth, net-income, GDP, etc.). Accordingly, we propose some progressive transfers from richer to poorer claimants with the purpose of distributing the damage as evenly as possible. Finally, we characterize our solution by means of the Lorenz criterion. Endogenous convex combinations between solutions are also considered.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The formal analysis of bankruptcy problems, where agents’ claims exceed the available resources (the endowment) was originated by O’Neill (1982) under the name of claims problems (see Thomson (2003); 2013) for a survey). The subsequent literature has suggested multiple mathematical representations of these problems taking only into account the vector of claims and the endowment. Actually, in many situations not only claims, but also individual rights, references, or other objective entitlements, play an important role in the rationing process. In this sense, bankruptcy procedures need to serve various purposes. They must contribute to achieve efficient ex-ante allocations, e.g., the adequate incentives to acquire information on the riskiness of investments. Furthermore, typically, we expect some justice, or “fairness” properties from the procedures, concerning the ex-post allocation, e.g., whose claims will be served and to which amount. Our paper focuses on the latter aspect. In the Final remarks section we will comment briefly on the implications of our solution on the first aspect.In the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund a great number of variables to differentiate among claimants (the families) were used.11See the “Final Report of the Special Master for the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001”.In addition to estimate how much income each victim would have earned in a full lifetime, they also considered age, number of dependants and consumption habits, among others. Note that, although the individual claim is the legal right to be compensated, these examples have in common that the claimants payment is based on other characteristics different from the individuals claim on the available resources.Another intuitive differentiation criteria is the aggregate wealth outside a bankrupted institution. When a bank goes bankrupt, some families are dragged into delicate situations of insolvency while others are able to remain financially stable. The final status of each depository depends on the individual’s exposition to the bankruptcy and the wealth outside it. Considerations of this kind cannot be ignored and may justify an allocation bias in favor of some individuals. Another example is the Madoff case, in which the Santander Bank differentiated among its affected clients: not honoring the institutional investors, but honoring the private investors, which may be regarded as “fair” in the sense of more equitable outcome. Specifically, their private-banking investors were partially reimbursed, but not their institutional investors. In this case the relevant characteristic is the identity of the claimants, being private or institutional. The ad hoc argument was that the former investors were not sufficiently informed.22De Cordoba, J. and Catan, T. (2009) “A Spanish Bank’s Madoff Redress, In a First in Scandal, Banco Santander Offers $1.82 Billion to Clients,” The Wall Street Journal, 28 January 2009 [on-line].Similarly, Argentina in 2014 was declared in “selective default” by Standard & Poor’s and in “restricted default” by Fitch, meaning that some bondholders were receiving payment while others were not (hedge and some mutual funds).33In this case, information on the creditworthiness of the country, and its history of state default, may have been ignored by uninformed investors, who may implicitly have relied on mechanisms guaranteeing their claims. On the other hand, preferring uninformed “small” investors undermines their incentive to acquire information, which in turn leads to inefficient ex ante allocation of funds.Bankruptcy laws consider the claimants identity to establish a priority rule. Specifically, bankruptcy codes normally list all claims that should be treated identically in various categories and assigns to them lexicographic priorities (Kamiski, 2006). Typically, the claimants are ordered from the highest to the lowest priority as follows: workers, public administration, financial institutions, suppliers and finally shareholders. It cannot pay anything to a lower priority class if superior classes are not paid in full. Another typical situation that justify the use of differentiation criteria is business sectors, as the textile or automotive industry, where some suppliers depend only on one customer. In the case of bankruptcy such a supplier will be hit harder than others with more diversified customers.44We are grateful to an anonymous reviewer for suggesting us several illustrative examples.Pulido et al. (2002); 2008) analyze, under the name of bankruptcy problems with references, the real-life case of allocating a given amount of money among the various degree courses that are offered at a (public) Spanish university. The (verifiable) monetary needs of each course constitute their claims. Additionally, there exist reference values for each course, which are independently set by the government below the claims.Other relevant practical cases also involving more complex rationing situations could be protocols for the reduction of pollution, water distribution in drought periods, or even some resource allocation procedures in the public health care sector, in which past consumption could be considered as an entitlement, and current needs as a claim (see, for instance, Hougaard et al., 2012; Moreno-Ternero and Roemer, 2012).The present manuscript offers important technical tools for the practitioners in a broad class of claims problems to reduce effects of bankruptcy. As an enrichment to the original model, we develop a theory of differentiation in claims problems that considers the vector of claims, the final endowment but also individual characteristics (to be sufficiently general) that are relevant and specific to the situation in hands. Specifically, the starting point is a bankruptcy situation with an exogenous status quoallocation. Given this initial allocation, we add a differentiating criteria and define as net-receivers those agents with a negative personal-value after bankruptcy, and as net-contributorsotherwise.Constrained by a set of axioms (to be discussed below), we pursue an equity allocation that reduces the after bankruptcy deficit of the net-receivers households. In this sense, because we assume no third party intervention (government or investors), any differentiation in favor of the “in deficit” households must be financed by the “in surplus” households, through transfers.In a second step, we bound the maximum effort that can be demanded to the net-contributors and the maximum benefit that can be provided to the net-receivers. These transfer bounds are the result of a set of axioms that, from our point of view, form the basis of any equity-related allocation. In short, in the final allocation, no net-receiver can become better off than before the bankruptcy or enter into a positive position. Otherwise, we would be moving away from the social objective of the reallocation. On the other hand, we must guarantee that no net-contributor ends up in a negative position and, in addition, that her value outside of the bankruptcy (e.g., assets) cannot be transferred. Moreover, the transfers must not change the existing value hierarchy.In a third step, we propose the differentiated solution. We show that it satisfies some of the most important properties discussed in the bankruptcy literature and Lorenz dominates any other solution that satisfies thesetransfer bounds. Moreover, by the duality property, our solution is the most equitable redistribution of losses in Lorenz sense that satisfies the suggested set of axioms.Finally, following Thomson and Yeh (2006); 2008) and Giménez-Gómez and Peris (2014a); 2014b), we discuss alternative allocations that balance the net-receivers and net-contributors opposed interests.55The population of net-contributors wants to block any departure from the status quo, i.e., they prefer a solution without differentiated transfers. On the other hand, the population of net-receivers argues in favor of differentiated transfers.In particular, we propose an endogenous convex combination between the initial status quo allocation and the value differentiated solution. We conclude the paper by discussing some practical issues, such as homogeneity of flows, inter-temporal adjustments, consumption accountability and ex-ante behavior.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and defines the net-receivers and the net-contributors. Section 3 defines the bounds on transfers through some axioms. Sections 4 and 5, respectively, present our solution and characterize it. Finally, Sections 6 and 7 discuss extensions and practical issues.We consider a society with n agents, i ∈ N, with N = {1, …, n}. Each agent has a net-valuevi∈Routside and not necessarily connected with the bankruptcy. This is the monetary translation of some observable characteristics intrinsic to each individual.66The list of differentiating variables is large, e.g., the depositor’s income, wealth, number of children, age, the average amount invested in the bank during the last year (bank fidelity), the number of years or the risk of the asset under claim, GDP, or any other relevant characteristic, as well as combinations of these variables. However, in order to get a better intuition, the reader can think of vias the aggregate wealth outside the bankrupted institution.Besides this value, each agent has net-assets on the bankrupted institution,si∈R+. Hence, each agent is identified by an initial value,IVi∈R,given by IVi= vi+ si.77This measure aggregates each agent’s total position before the bankruptcy. In spite of the additive form presented, the reader can consider more complex ways of obtaining an initial value, and the subsequent measures, i.e., personal-value, final-value, etc.After the bankruptcy, only a partE∈R+,of the aggregate claim, ∑i ∈ Nsi, is available, i.e., E ≤ ∑i ∈ Nsi. Consequently, each bankruptcy problem is represented by the pair (E, s), and the set of all problems is represented byB(O’Neill, 1982). A solutionis a single valued functionφ:B→R+nsuch that, for each i ∈ N, 0 ≤ φi(E, s) ≤ si(non-negativity and claim-boundedness), and ∑i ∈ Nφi(E, s) = E (efficiency). Hereinafter,s∈R+ndenotes the vector of agents’ net-assets, i.e., s = (s1, s2, …, sn). Similarly,φ∈R+ndenotes the vector of agents’ awards, i.e., φ(E, s) = (φ1(E, s), φ2(E, s), …, φn(E, s)).The claimants are split into two groups based on their personal value after bankruptcy, which is composed of the net-value outside the bankrupted institution viand the exogenous given status quo allocation φi(E, s).88For example, when an individual places a deposit on a financial institution agrees on a set of conditions that define a status quo allocation φ in case of bankruptcy. In practical terms, the proportional solution is a natural candidate, however, more general rules can be considered (O’Neill, 1982). Consequently, the value differentiated allocation, to be presented below, is an ex-post departure from the initial status quo allocation.Definition 1Personal-value, PVφ. For each(E,s)∈Band eachi∈N,PViφ(E,s)=vi+φi(E,s). A net-receiver is an agent withPViφ(E,s)≤0.A net-contributor is an agent withPViφ(E,s)>0.Hereinafter and for notational convenience, we list agents in increasing order in terms of their personal-values, i.e.,PV1φ(E,s)≤PV2φ(E,s)≤⋯≤PVnφ(E,s).Consequently, there exists an agent i = m ∈ N such thatPVmφ(E,s)≤0andPVm+1φ(E,s)>0,i.e., a total of m net-receivers and n − m net-contributors .In spite of the differentiating value, vi, has been introduced into the problem, the standard bankruptcy framework remains valid.Given this distribution, we might have a situation where all agents have: (i) a positive personal-value (PViφ(E,s)≥0), (ii) a negative personal-value (PViφ(E,s)≤0), or (iii) a combination of both.99In order to be more general, the reader is free to redefine the concepts of “positive” and “negative” personal-value with respect to some cut-off valueκ∈R.For expositional convenience, we normalize κ = 0.We focus on the latter scenario, which is the most common and interesting. For instance, some agents with an initial balanced budget constraint (IVi≥ 0) may get into a negative position after the bankruptcy (PViφ(E,s)<0), while others are able to retain a positive personal-value position (PViφ(E,s)≥0). Consequently, we can think of allocations that reduce the deficit of the agents with a negative personal-value. Since we assume no third party intervention (government or investors),1010For instance, Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial were acquired by Bank of America, Bear Stearns was acquired by JPMorgan Chase. IndyMac Bank was converted into a bridge bank by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The government of the United Kingdom took a shareholder position in Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley, and it also played an important role in the cases of Royal bank of Scotland (RBS), Halifax bank of Scotland (HBOS) and Lloyds TSB. In continental Europe, Fortis was supported by the government of The Netherlands, while Dexia was rescued in a joint effort of the governments of Belgium, France and Luxembourg.any differentiation in favor of the “in deficit” households must be financed by the “in surplus” households, through transfers.Many authors have attempted to differentiate the final allocation among agents, either by imposing “priorities” (Aggarwal, 1992), giving more “weights” to some claims (Lee, 1994) or imposing constraints (see Bergantiños and Lorenzo, 2008; Thomson, 2003; 2013 for further details). In our context, agents with a negative personal-value are financed by the agents with a positive personal-value. In order to proceed, we separate the claimants population into these two groups.1111The division of the claimants into two groups is not restrictive. Without loss of generality, the reader can think of an arbitrary number of partitions.Before proceeding, we define final-value as the personal-value readjusted by means of transfers t. In this way a redistribution of the resources is implicitly achieved.Definition 2The final-value, FVφ + t. For each(E,s)∈Band eachi∈N,FViφ+t(E,s)=vi+φi(E,s)+ti,where tidenotes any transfer, such thatti∈Rand ∑i ∈ Nti= 0. A net-receiver receives a non-negative transfer,ti≥ 0(PViφ(E,s)≤FViφ+t(E,s)). A net-contributor transfers part of her claim, ti≤ 0(FViφ+t(E,s)≤PViφ(E,s)).The next step is to rearrange the initial allocation by means of transfers. These cannot be arbitrary and must satisfy a set of minimum requirements.Fig. 1illustrates a situation in which the status quo allocation distributes the endowment proportional(solution ) to the claim (a). In the example the agents’ personal-value at point (1), is such that agent 1 is a net-receiver and agent 2 is a net-contributor (b). We propose “transfers” from agent 2 to agent 1 (c), such that the former preserves a non-negative final-value (d). We go from position (1) to (2), i.e., no agent is “in deficit”. Unfortunately, as we will see, this objective is not always feasible.Our goal is twofold: (i) to define the primitives of an allocation that reduces the deficit of the net-receivers (see Section 5), and at the same time, (ii) to establish a set of indisputable bounds that apply to every problem of this type. As a result, the set of acceptable transfers (and, hence the set of final allocations) is restricted.Order preservation(Aumann and Maschler, 1985) is considered as one of the minimal requirements of fairness. Specifically, it requires the social transfers cannot alter the existing value hierarchy. This requirement is crucial in any bankruptcy context. Otherwise, as a result of the reallocation of existing endowment, some agents could end up poorer or richer than those who precede or follow in the value hierarchy, respectively.Order preservation, Ord. For each(E,s)∈B,each i ∈ N, ifPVi−1φ(E,s)≤PViφ(E,s),thenFVi−1φ+t(E,s)≤FViφ+t(E,s).No gains from bankruptcy establishes that the final allocation φ + t cannot make a net-receiver better than before the bankruptcy.No gains from bankruptcy, NoGain. For each(E,s)∈Band each i ≤ m,FViφ+t(E,s)≤IVi.No gains from bankruptcy does not exclude the possibility that a net-receiver’s final-value becomes positive. If we do not restrict this possibility, then some net-contributors could end up in a worse position than some net-receivers. In addition, it contradicts the social purpose of the reallocation.No surplus net-receiver, NoSurp . For each(E,s)∈Band each i ≤ m,FViφ+t(E,s)≤0.No deficient net-contributor implies that anet-contributor cannot end up in a worse value position than any net-receiver who benefits from her transfers. Thus, an agent with a non-negative personal-value must end up with a non-negative final-value.No deficient net-contributor, NoDefi.For each(E,s)∈Band each i > m,0≤FViφ+t(E,s).No loss outside the bankruptcy guarantees that no net-contributor distributes value outside the bankruptcy vi. In other words, a net-contributor can at most lose assets associated with the bankruptcy, because only this endowment can be subject to transfers.No loss outside the bankruptcy, NoLoss. For each(E,s)∈Band each i > m,FViφ+t(E,s)≥ vi.LetRdenote the set of axioms composed by NoGain, NoSurp, NoDefi, NoLoss and Ord. We consider thatRdefines the minimal requirements that the maximum possible transfers among net-contributors and net-receivers should satisfy.Regarding the net-contributors side, i.e., for each i > m, Definition 2 and NoLoss imply that 0 ≤ φi(E, s) + ti≤ φi(E, s). Moreover, NoDefi imposes − vi≤ φi(E, s) + ti.1212Recall that vican take negative values, and at the same time, agent i can be a net-contributor. In this case, individual i must hold a sufficiently strong position in the bankrupted institution.In addition, Ord requires that φi − 1(E, s) + ti − 1 + (vi − 1 − vi) ≤ φi(E, s) + ti. The aggregation of them requires, 0 ≤ −ti≤min{φi(E,s),PViφ(E,s),−ti−1+(PViφ(E,s)−PVi−1φ(E,s))}. Since the transfer of agent i depends on the transfer made by the previous agent in the value hierarchy, to compute the net-contributors transfers, we must begin from the agent m + 1 and move up to n. Note that Ord between the agents m and m + 1 is guaranteed by NoDefi and NoSurp. Consequently, for i = m + 1 the transfer received by agent i = m is irrelevant, and we have0≤−tm+1≤min{φm+1(E,s),PVm+1φ(E,s)}.Regarding the net-receivers side, i.e., for each i ≤ m, Definition 2 and NoGain imply that φi(E, s) ≤ φi(E, s) + ti≤ si. Moreover, NoSurp imposes φi(E, s) + ti≤ −vi. In addition, Ord requires that φi(E, s) + ti≤ φi + 1(E, s) + ti + 1 + (vi + 1 − vi). The aggregation of them requires, 0 ≤ ti≤min{IVi−PViφ(E,s),−PViφ(E,s),ti+1+(PVi+1φ(E,s)−PViφ(E, s))}. Since the transfer of agent i depends on the transfer made by the next agent in the value hierarchy, for the net-receivers we must start from the agent i = m and move down up to i = 1. Similarly, for i = m the transfer of the agent i = m + 1 is irrelevant, and we have0≤tm≤min{IVm−PVmφ(E,s),−PVmφ(E,s)}.Therefore, given a transfer ti, we introduce the maximum possible transfer bisatisfying this set of axioms such that where |ti| ≤ bi.Proposition 1Transfers upper bounds.For each(E,s)∈Band each i ∈ N, the maximum possible transfer satisfyingRin absolute terms bi is defined by:∀i≤m,bm−=min{φm(E,s),−PVmφ(E,s)},bi−=min{si−φi(E,s),−PViφ(E,s),bi+1−−(PViφ(E,s)−PVi+1φ(E,s))};∀i≥m+1,bm+1+=min{φm+1(E,s),PVm+1φ(E,s)},bi+=min{φi(E,s),PViφ(E,s),bi−1++(PViφ(E,s)−PVi−1φ(E,s))}.Hereinafter, letbi+andbi−denote the transfers upper bound for a given net-contributor and net-receiver, respectively. DenoteB−≡∑i=1mbi−as the total amount of endowment required by the net-receivers, andB+≡∑i=m+1nbi+the total amount of endowment available from net-contributors. Letting B* = min {B−, B+}, it is possible to satisfy the constrained needs of all net-receivers via transfers when B* = B−. Otherwise, i.e.,B* = B+, the net-contributors constrained claims are not enough to cover the net-receivers needs.Example 1Let v = ( − 8, −5, −2, y) and s = (8, 4, 10, 8) where y ∈ (0, ∞), then IV = (0, −1, 8, 8 + y).1313We do not fix individual i = 4 value y ∈ (0, ∞). It does not place any restriction and it will be useful later in Example 2, which is a continuation of this one.Suppose that E = 15, i.e., half of the total claims, and that the status quo allocation is the proportional, i.e., φ(E, s) = (4, 2, 5, 4), then PVφ(E, s) = ( − 4, −3, 3, 4 + y). Starting from the poorest net-contributor i = 3, which is constrained by NoDefi, that isb3+=3.The bound of i = 4 is constrained by NoLoss, that isb4+=4.For the net-receivers, we start from i = 2, which is constrained by NoGain, that isb2−=2.The bound of i = 1 is constrained by Ord, that isb1−=3.Then, b = (3, 2, 3, 4) and B* = 5, because B− = 5 < B+ = 7.Proposition 1 restricts the set of final allocations. However, it does not return a unique solution. For instance, the initial exogenous status quo allocation satisfies the bounds presented above.Our proposal works as the constrained equal losses solution but imposing that no-one contributes or receives more than her bound. That is, it proposes an allocation where the losses are distributed as evenly as possible.The constrained equal losses solution (discussed by Maimonides 12th century; Aumann and Maschler, 1985) chooses the awards vector at which all agents incur the same losses (L=∑i∈Nsi−E), subject to no-one receiving a negative amount. The agents with highest claims receive awards before the agents with smallest claims. In fact, the first agent that receive awards is the highest claimant, once the difference between her claim and the second highest claim is satisfied (i.e., when both claims are equal), these two agents receive equal awards, and so on.The constrained equal losses solution, cel.For each(E,s)∈Band each i ∈ N, celi(E, s) ≡ max {0, si− μ}, where μ is chosen so that ∑i ∈ Nmax {0, si− μ} = E.1414Consider (E, s) = (36, (10, 20, 30)). Firstly, the cel solution satisfies the distance between s2 and s3, i.e., agent 3 gains 30 − 20 = 10. Therefore, agents 2 and 3 are now claiming 20 each. Secondly, it satisfies the new common claim distance of agents 2 and 3 with agent 1, i.e., each of the former ones receives 20 − 10 = 10. Finally, since the three agents claim the same, the remaining endowment is divided equally, i.e., 6/3 = 2. Therefore, cel(E, s) = (2, 12, 22).Specifically, in our context we have two possible cases when distributing the available endowment:•B+ ≥ B−, i.e., there is enough endowment to satisfy the net-receivers’ needs. The richest net-contributors start paying up to their bound until all the needs are honored. As in the cel solution, the richest net-contributor is the first agent that contributes, either (i) up to the distance between her personal value and the next richest net-contributor is satisfied (see Fig. 2(a) and (b)), and so on; or (ii) up to her bound (see Fig. 2 (c) and (d)).B+ ≤ B−, i.e., there is not enough endowment to satisfy the net-receivers’ needs. The poorest net-receivers start receiving up to their limit and the endowment is totally distributed. Again, as in the cel solution, the poorest net-receiver is the first agent that receives awards, either (i) up to the distance between her personal value and the next poorest net-receiver is satisfied, and so on; or (ii) up to her bound.. For each(E,s)∈Band each i ∈ N,di(E,s)={ai−+celi(B*−∑i≤mai−,s−¯),∀i≤m−ai+−celi(B*−∑i>mai+,s+¯),∀i≥m+1where,ai−=bi−,foreachi={1,…,k}suchthatPVkφ(E,s)=min{PViφ(E,s):PVi+1φ(E,s)−PViφ(E,s)≥bi−}and∑i≤kbi−≤B*.Otherwise, ai= 0.si−¯=0,foreachi={j,…,m}suchthatPVjφ(E,s)=min{PViφ(E,s):PVi+1φ(E,s)−PViφ(E,s)≥bi−}and∑i≤jbi−≥B*.si−¯=bi−,otherwise.ai+=bi+,foreachi={k,…,n}suchthatPVkφ(E,s)=min{PViφ(E,s):PViφ(E,s)−PVi−1φ(E,s)≥bi+}and∑i≥kbi+≤B*.Otherwise,ai+=0.si+¯=0,foreachi={m+1,…,j}suchthatPVjφ(E,s)=min{PViφ(E,s):PViφ(E,s)−PVi−1φ(E,s)≥bi+}and∑i≥jbi+≥B*.si+¯=bi+,otherwise.Technical considerations are gathered in Appendix A.The hydraulic representation of Fig. 2 provides an intuitive way to understand how the transfers di(E, s) are computed.1515See Kaminski (2000) for a deep understanding about hydraulic rationing.This figure shows a four-agent problem where two agents are net-contributors and the other two are net-receivers. Each agent personal-value is displayed by a vessel with the poorest agent on the left and the richest agent on the right. The dotted line represents each agent personal-value plus (net-receivers) or minus (net-contributors) the respective bound. The net-contributors’ vessels are initially full (gray color), so the goal is to draw out as much fluid (endowment) as possible. In Fig. 2 (a), first the tallest glass is poured out up to satisfy the difference with the second one. Then, both vessels are emptied (white color) at the same time, up to either all the needs are met or all the net-contributors have participated (i.e., reached their bounds). Fig. 2(b) is the final sequence of Fig. 2 (a). In Fig. 2(c), first the tallest glass is poured out up to the bound. Then, the second one is emptied up to the bound. From the net-receivers (i ≤ m) side, the vessels are initially empty, the goal is to fill them as much as possible. Now, the first left vessel is filled to the distance with the second one. Then, the process continues up to either all the available endowment have been exhausted or all needs are satisfied. Fig. 2(d) is the final sequence of Fig. 2(c). Example 2 provides a numerical representation of the previous description.Definition 4For each(E,s)∈Band each i ∈ N, the differentiated solution proposes the allocationDSiφ+d(E,s)=φi(E,s)+di(E,s).Therefore, thedifferentiated value associated with the differentiated solution, is the sum of the associated personal-value with the resulting transfers d(E, s) (positive or negative, depending on the agent’s type).Definition 5The differentiated value, DVφ + d. For each(E,s)∈Band each i ∈ N,DViφ+d(E,s)=vi+φi(E,s)+di(E,s).(Continuation of Example 1)Recall that B* = B− = 5 and B+ = 7. If y = 1, the agent i = 4transfers bound b4 = 4 is larger than the distance between agents’ i = 4 and i = 3 personal-valuesPV4φ(E,s)−PV3φ(E,s)= 2 (see Fig. 2(a) and (b)). We have the vector of differentiated transfers d(E, s) = (3, 2, −1.5, −3.5), the vector of differentiated solutions φ(E, s) + d(E, s) = (7, 4, 3.5, 0.5), and the vector of differentiated values DVφ + d(E, s) = ( − 1, −1, 1.5, 1.5). If y = 3.5, the agent i = 4 transfers bound b4 = 4 is smaller than the distance between agents’ i = 4 and i = 3 personal-valuesPV4φ(E,s)−PV3φ(E,s)=4.5(see Fig. 2(c) and (d)). We have the vector of differentiated transfers d(E, s) = (3, 2, −1, −4), the vector of differentiated solutions φ(E, s) + d(E, s) = (7, 4, 4, 0), and the vector of differentiated values DVφ + d(E, s) = ( − 1, −1, 2, 3.5).Note that the differentiated transfers d(E, s) allocate B* in terms of PVφ and its associatedupper bound. Furthermore, the solution reproduces the target allocation that we introduced previously. It departs from the status quo solution, without penalizing (benefiting) the net-contributors (net-receivers) population more than their bound. In our view, this is a crucial point, because in a bankruptcy, everybody losses something. Consequently, we limit the effort demanded on the net-contributors, while maintaining the equity objective. So, our proposal searches for a balance between two opposed interests in a bankruptcy situation: (i) it tries to mitigate the social issues that destabilize the functioning of the society as a whole (specially, among the agents in deficit); (ii) it tries to mitigate the discontent among net-contributors caused by departures from the initial allocation. Section 6 further develops this issue.The goal of the present section is twofold. Firstly, we present a characterization result of our proposal. Secondly, we discuss the adapted version of a set of well known axioms in the bankruptcy literature to our framework.Following Dutta and Ray (1989),Cowell (2000),Lambert (2001) and Arin (2007), we consider the Lorenz criterion(Lorenz, 1905) which “captures the idea that the desirable social goal is to treat everybody as equally as possible”. Furthermore, this is an interesting tool to compare the behavior of solution concepts. Particularly, Lorenz domination is a criterion used to check whether a solution is more favorable to smaller claimants relative to larger claimants. So, in some sense, a Lorenz dominant solution can be understood as more equitable (see Bosmans and Lauwers, 2011). LetR+nbe the set of positive n-dimensional vectors x = (x1, x2, …, xn) ordered from small to large, i.e., 0 < x1 ≤ x2 ≤ ⋅⋅⋅ ≤ xn. Let x and y be inR+n. We say that x Lorenz dominates y, x≻Ly, if for each k = 1, 2, …, n − 1: x1 + x2 + ⋅⋅⋅ + xk≥ y1 + y2 + ⋅⋅⋅ + ykand x1 + x2 + ⋅⋅⋅ + xn= y1 + y2 + ⋅⋅⋅ + yn. If x Lorenz dominates y and x ≠ y, then at least one of these n − 1 inequalities is a strict inequality. The following definition extends the notion of Lorenz dominance to bankruptcy solutions.1616For instance, consider the endowment E = 10, and two allocations x = (2, 2, 2, 4) and y = (2, 2, 3, 3). Note that y Lorenz dominates x since y1 ≥ x1, y1 + y2 ≥ x1 + x2, and y1 + y2 + y3 > x1 + x2 + x3.Lorenz domination. Given two functions φ and ψ, it is said that function φ Lorenz dominates function ψ, φ≻Lψ, if for each(E,s)∈Bthe vector φ(E, s) Lorenz dominates ψ(E, s).In order to characterize our solution we show that our proposal Lorenz dominates any solution that satisfiesR. Moreover, if to this result we apply the duality property, then our solution is the most equitable redistribution of losses in Lorenz sense that satisfiesR. We also analyze the fulfillment of (the bankruptcy literature) generally accepted axioms of Section 5.2.In bankruptcy problems, it is well known that the Constrained Equal Awards (cea) solution (Maimonides 12th century, see Thomson, 2003 and the definition below), Lorenz dominates any other solution. This result does not generalize to our setting, because of the inclusion of a monetary differentiating variable. However, the differentiated solution proposed in the present paper, Lorenz dominates any other solution in terms of the agents’ final-value, which is the relevant measure of “equity” for our setting.For instance, consider IV = (0, 3, 5), s = (2, 3, 4) and let E = 3. Then, cea(E, s) = (1, 1, 1) and PVcea(E, s) = ( − 1, 1, 2). The differentiated solution recommends, d = (1, 0, −1) and DVφ + d(E, s) = (0, 1, 1). Then,DV1φ+d(E,s)≥PV1cea(E,s),DV1φ+d(E,s)+DV2φ+d(E,s)≥PV1cea(E,s)+PV2cea(E,s),so DVφ + d(E, s)≽LPVcea(E, s), i.e., the differentiated solution Lorenz dominates the cea solution. Note that the Lorenz domination leads us to obtain the transfers t that equalize each agent’s personal value as much as possible.Therefore, the next result states that the proposed solution leads to the most equitable redistribution in Lorenz sense and fulfills a reasonable and intuitive set of axiomsR(Ord, NoGain, NoDefi, NoSurp and NoLoss). Moreover, it holds true for any status quo φ solution.Theorem 1Let φ be a solution and consider the family of transfers t satisfying the transfer upper bound b. Then, the differentiated solution Lorenz dominates any other redistributive solution.It is sufficient to show by contradiction that d Lorenz dominates every solution that satisfies the transfers upper bounds of Proposition 1. Letφ∈Rand(E,s)∈Bbe such that y = DVφ + ddoes not Lorenz dominate z = PVφ(E, s) + t in valueterms. Note DVφ + d= v + φ(E, s) + d(E, s) and FVφ + t(E, s) = v + φ(E, s) + t, where d and t denote the transfers recommended by the differentiatedand any other solution, respectively. We focus on the net-receivers side. Let k ∈ N be the smallest number such that σ1(y) + σ2(y) + …σk(y) < σ1(z) + σ2(z) + …σk(z).Hence, yk< zk≤ bk. (a) If B− ≤ B+, then B* = B− and each agent should receive her bi, by efficiency. By definition, yk= vk+ φ(E, s) + bk< vk+ φ(E, s) + tk= zk. Then, t does not satisfy the transfer upper bound b forR,since tk> dk(E, s) = bk. (b) If B− ≥ B+, then B* = B+. Because yk< zk, by efficiency for some agent k* > k,yk*>zk*>0. In this case, by the definition of the differentiated solution, (b.1)dk*(E,s)=bk*,or (b.2)PVk*−1φ(E,s)−PVk*φ(E,s)<dk*(E,s)≤bk*. On the one hand, (b.1) implies that for each j < k*, dj(E, s) = bj. If yk< zk, then t does not satisfy b forR,since tk> dk(E, s) = bk, as in case (a). On the other hand, (b.2) implies that for eachj<k*,PVj−1φ(E,s)−PVjφ(E,s)<yj≤bk*. If dj(E, s) < tj, thenPVjz(E,s)>PVj+1z(E,s),because the definition of the differentiated solution states thatPVjy(E,s)=PVj+1y(E,s). Thus, t does not satisfy the transfer upper bound b forR,since tk> dk(E, s) = bk. Following a similar reasoning, it would be straightforward to explain the same for the net-contributors.□Finally, note that by duality it is straightforward to see that if we distribute losses instead of awards, the differentiated solution proposes that the net-contributors (net-receivers) pay (receive) as evenly as possible. In fact, the dual of the differentiated solution works as the constrained equal awards solution, but imposing that no-one contributes d ≤ 0, or receives d ≥ 0, more than her bound. That is, it proposes an allocation where the awards are distributed as evenly as possible.1717The dual of φ (Aumann and Maschler, 1985), denoted by φd, assigns for each(E,s)∈Band each i ∈ N,φid(E,c)=si−φi(L,c).Herrero (2003) shows that the cea and cel solutions are dual to each other.The constrained equal awards solution (discussed by Maimonides 12th century; Aumann and Maschler, 1985) chooses the awards vector at which all agents receive the same awards, subject to no-one receiving more than her claim.The constrained equal awards solution, cea.For each(E,s)∈Band each i ∈ N, ceai(E, s) ≡ min {si, μ}, where μ is chosen so that ∑i ∈ Nmax {si, μ} = E.The next result, which comes straightforwardly from Theorem 1 and duality, states that the proposed solution leads to the most equitable redistribution of losses (i.e., it is the least equitable in awards) in Lorenz sense and fulfills a reasonable and intuitive set of axiomsR(Ord, NoGain, NoDefi, NoSurp and NoLoss). Moreover, it holds true for any status quo φ solution.Theorem 2Let φ be a solution and consider the family of transfers t satisfying the transfer upper bound b. Then, the dual differentiated solution is Lorenz dominated by any other redistributive solution.We start by introducing to our framework some axioms that have been considered as general in the bankruptcy literature (see Thomson 2003; 2013).Equal treatment of equals requires that the final-value of those agents whose personal value is equal should be equal.Equal treatment of equals. For each(E,s)∈Band each i, j ∈ N, ifPViφ(E,s)=PVjφ(E,s),thenFViφ+t(E,s)=FVjφ+t(E,s).Anonymity is a strengthening of equal treatment of equals, since this property implies that the identity of agents should not matter. Therefore, the final-value received by each agent, should depend only on their personal values, and not on who holds them.Anonymity. For each(E,s)∈B,each π ∈ ΠNand each i ∈ N,FVπ(i)φ+t(E,sπ(i))i∈N)=FViφ+t(E,s),where ΠNdenotes the class of bijections from N into itself.Progressivity requires that the richer net-contributors tend to pay relatively more than the poorer ones, with respect to their bound. Analogously, the poorer net-receivers tend to receive relatively more than the richer ones, with respect to their bound.Progressivity. For each(E,s)∈Band each i, j ∈ N, if bi(E, s) ≥ bj(E, s), thendi(E,s)bi(E,s)≥dj(E,s)bj(E,s).Claims monotonicity implies that whenever an agent’s personal value increases (and the other onesPV−iφdo not change) he should receive at least as much as he did initially.Claims monotonicity. For each(E,s)∈B,each i ∈ N, andPVφ(E,si′)≥PVφ(E,si), thenFViφ+t(E,si′,s−i)≥FViφ+t(E,s).Resource monotonicity (Curiel et al., 1987; Young, 1987) says that if the endowment increases, each agent should receive at least as much as she did initially.Resource monotonicity. For each(E,s)∈B,each i ∈ N, and ∑i ∈ Nsi≥ E′ > E, thenFViφ(E′,s)≥FViφ(E,s).Homogeneity implies that the units of measure do not matter.Homogeneity. For each(E,s)∈B,each i ∈ N, and each λ > 0, thenFViφ(λE,λs)≥λFViφ(E,s).Continuity simply says that small changes in the data of the problem should not lead to large changes in the chosen allocation vector.Continuity. For each sequence {(Eν, sν)} of elements ofB,each(E,s)∈B,and each i ∈ N, if (Eν, sν) converges to (E, s), thenFViφ(Eν,sν)converges toFViφ(E,s).Table 1shows some relevant properties and their relationship with our solution. The proofs are omitted because they can be straightforwardly obtained from the definition of the differentiated solution. Note that d guarantees that richer (poorer) net-contributors (net-receivers) pay (receive) relatively more than the poor (rich) ones, with respect to their bound (progressivity). Furthermore, it does not violate the personal value order (order preservation).In this section, we assume that the final allocation is the result of grim arguments between the interested groups. The population of net-contributors will attempt to block any departure from the status quo solution, i.e., they prefer a solution without differentiated transfers. On the other hand, the net-receivers population will argue in favor of differentiated transfers. Taking these opposed interests into account and following Thomson and Yeh (2006); 2008) and Giménez-Gómez and Peris (2014a); 2014b), we propose a convex combination between the status quo solution φ and the differentiated solution φ + d. Consequently, any distributions between points (1) and (2) in Fig. 1 is feasible. Formally,φiα(E,s)=α(φi(E,s)+di(E,s))+(1−α)φi(E,s).If α = 0 (respectively, α = 1) the initial status quo (respectively, differentiated) solution is implemented.Consider the following two arguments in favor of a large value of α (i.e., an allocation that is more “equity” concerned);(i) If B+ > >B−: in aggregate terms, the net-contributors population is in good financial conditions to satisfy the net-receivers needs. Consequently, the relative effort required from the former is low.(ii) If B− > >B+: in aggregate terms, the net-receivers population is in great need. Consequently, there is a serious social problem, and a more “equity” concerned solution easier to defend (even if a large effort is required from the net-contributors).Arguments (i) and (ii) strengthen the net-receivers claim for more “equity” (the inverse arguments support the opposite). Mathematically, the ratios B+/(B+ + B−) and B−/(B+ + B−) joined by max {B+, B−}, attempt to capture these arguments. We propose,(1)α=min{βmax{B+,B−}B++B−,1}.The ratio inside min {.} takes values in the interval [1/2, 1]. Moreover, α weakly increases with the difference between B+ and B−. If max {B+, B−} = B+, the argument (i) is the one represented mathematically, otherwise, it is argument (ii) that is modeled. Note that, if either B+ or B− goes to ∞, the ratio in (1) converges to one. On the contrary, the lowest value of the ratio equals to 1/2 and is obtained when B+ = B−.Higher the value of β ∈ (0, ∞), more the policy makers are concerned with “equity” issues. This bias is important to determine the convex solution. A value of β = 1 denotes an independent arbitrator. For β↓0 (respectively, β↑∞ ) we have α↓0 (respectively, α↑1) and the status quo (respectively, differentiated) solution is implemented.1818Note that for β ≥ (B+ + B−)/max {B+, B−} we have α = 1.Differentiation among claimants is necessary, the difficulty lies in the implementation. We comment on the European Union (EU) funds transfer policy, which is already in place, and on some practical issues associated with the application of our model to situations where the individuals’ total wealth is the differentiating variable.An actual case where policy makers apply differentiation to distribute endowment is in the EU. Countries are split into two groups, depending on their GDP. Specifically, those EU members with a GDP below 75 percent of the average EU GDP are considered poor. Therefore, a total of 81.9 percent of the EU structural funds are allocated to these countries. This distribution of endowment aims to increasing cohesion and GDP convergence among members states. This goal is captured by the solution proposed in the present paper.We have suggested a wide range of potential differentiator variables. In practice the net-wealth outside the bankrupted institution is a natural candidate. In this case vi= yi− ci+ ai, whereyi∈R+represents income derived from labor activities and/or other monetary inflows of the same kind,ci∈R+represents consumption needs and/or other monetary outflows of the same kind, andai∈R+represents capital, real estate, and/or any other kind of wealth stock.1919To differentiate among victims The 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund implemented a rather complex formula, which included variables like income, age, number of dependants, consumption habits among others.In what follows, we take a close look to some practical issues.Homogeneity of flows and adjustment times.Agents typically have short- or medium-term difficulties to increase their income flows. After an unexpected bankruptcy, some individuals are forced to reduce their consumption and/or increase their income. Consequently, we must allow a sufficiently large period of time for these changes to be feasible. In addition, to establish some homogeneity between flows and stocks, we should increase the weight on monetary flows.Income and wealth manipulation. Agents’ income and wealth stocks can be subject to counterfeit and/or misreporting. The likelihood of these events is country specific. In spite of these unavoidable issues, for developed countries we can assume the existence of sufficiently accurate information.2020This information can be requested directly to the institutions that keep these data or to the agent.Consumption related problems. The most a social planner can hold is a common knowledge distribution over consumption. Since the differentiated solution is biased in favor of the agents with lower personal-values positions, we naturally expect agents to over report their consumption needs.2121This comment opens the question of truth-telling mechanisms in the context of bankruptcy problems.Moreover, not all expenditures are equally relevant. For instance, the mortgage repayment by an agent with a tight budget does not have the same relative importance as the acquisition of an additional million dollars auto mobile by an extremely wealthy agent. The problem is that we cannot make the rich agent accountable for the poor agent mortgage nor censure her apparently excessive consumption habits. A balanced proposal that respects these trade-off is not an easy task. Finally, there is a large degree of heterogeneity between consumption and wealth. There are agents living above their means (high consumption with respect to their low wealth) and the opposite. Therefore, we need to make sure that agents with relatively low (high) consumption are not penalized (benefited) by that fact.Following the discussion and because personal consumption is private information, we should define a standard level of consumption,c¯,that applies to all claimants.2222The choice of a large value ofc¯tends to increases the population of net-receivers, while a low value has the opposite effect.This consumption can be adjusted to consider specific expenses such as rents and mortgage payments, long-term health treatment costs, etc.Our proposal offers important technical tools for the practitioners to reduce the effects of a broad class of claims problems. Specifically, the methods proposed in the present paper, following the traditional line of arguments in bankruptcy literature, provide an extension of the classical model introduced by O’Neill (1982) where individuals are differentiated or discriminated by other variables different from their claims.Nonetheless, if the proposed solution is anticipated by investors or firm’s management it is likely that will affect their ex-ante behavior. For instance, in connection with the bankruptcy law, since bondholders have priority over the shareholders, they tend to accept a lower risk premium. However, if the former would anticipate some ex-post discriminatory allocation (with respect to the usual rule), they would ask for an higher risk premium. This type of reasoning can be extended to the relation between insurer and insure, or financial institutions and clients. As mentioned in Introduction, such has also a strong impact on the individuals’ incentives to acquire information or on how they hedging their investments. In particular, this interesting issue pretends to analyze in depth (i) how differentiation affects the ex-ante behavior of investors and individuals, and, consequently, (ii) how the society as a whole adapts to these “discriminatory rules”. From our point of view, many of these questions might be a fruitful topic of further research.
