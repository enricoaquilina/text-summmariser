Many applications require the detection of unknown nonlinear frequency modulated (FM) signals in noise. In this paper, a nonlinear FM signal in one time interval is approximated by linear FM (LFM) segments in successive subintervals. Each LFM segment is parameterized by a 2-dimensional (2D) state vector and its evolution from a subinterval to the next one is modeled as a dynamic system of unknown statistics with linear state transition equations and nonlinear measurement equations. A forward–backward cost-reference particle filter (FB-CRPF) is proposed to estimate the state sequence. From the estimated state sequence, the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) statistic and the total variation (TV) statistic are computed for signal detection. In the 2D feature plane of the GLRT versus TV, the decision region of the null hypothesis at a given false alarm rate is determined by the 2D convexhull learning algorithm from noise-only training samples. Two kinds of simulated signals are used to test the proposed detector and results show that the proposed detector attains better performance than the two existing detectors.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Moving target detection is an important issue in radar and sonar. Returns of moving targets can be characterized by parametric or nonparametric models [1,2]. It is relevant to target movement situation and radar operating mode to use a parametric model or nonparametric one. The returns of a steady moving target in a short time interval can be parameterized by several unknown parameters, for instance, sinusoidal signals with unknown amplitude, initial phase and Doppler shift and linear FM signals with an additional chirp rate. The matched filters and time–frequency analysis methods have been developed to detect such signals in noise [2–6]. Detection of weak maneuvering targets requires a long integration time to attain enough gain of target returns against noise. For target's maneuvering and the long integration time, the returns exhibit complex Doppler modulation, which can be modeled as smooth functions of time and makes target returns be unknown nonlinear FM signals.There exist several methods to detect unknown nonlinear FM signals in noise. Their key is estimating the instantaneous frequency curve (IFC) of a signal from a noisy measurement. The ridge of the time-scale or time–frequency distribution of the measurement gives a robust estimate of the IFC. The detectors via ridge energy are typical nonparametric methods and the performance highly depends on the time–frequency distributions [1,7–9]. The nonparametric methods avoid the risk of signal model mismatch but abnegate the optimality for a special class of signal. The chirplet chain methods were developed to detect unknown nonlinear FM or highly oscillatory signals in noise [10,11], where the IFCs of signals are approximated by piecewise linear continuous functions. The chirplet chain model (CCM) contains much more parameters than the simple parametric models in [2–6] and thus has much stronger ability to characterize nonlinear FM signals. The CCM-based detectors are derived by substituting the model parameters estimated by the dynamic program into the likelihood ratio function [10,11]. Piecewise parametric models inherit the ability of nonparametric models to characterize complicated signals and support accurate parameter estimation in simple parametric models.In this paper, a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector based on the forward–backward cost-reference particle filter (FB-CRPF) is proposed to detect unknown nonlinear FM signals in white complex Gaussian noise. The time interval of received signals is divided into disjoint equi-length subintervals. The signal segment at each subinterval is approximated by an LFM atom and it is specified by a 2D state vector of the central frequency and chirp rate. The state evolution from a subinterval to the next one is modeled by a nonlinear dynamic system of unknown statistics. Hence, detection of unknown nonlinear FM signals is relevant to the state sequence estimation of the nonlinear dynamic system of unknown statistics.The particle filters (PFs) form a family of tools for state estimation of nonlinear dynamic systems and are widely used in target tracking and detection [12–24]. Most PFs are suited for systems of known statistics [12–19]. Dynamic systems of unknown statistics are frequently encountered. For instance, radar maneuvering target detection is relevant to the systemic noise of unknown statistics and the measurement noise of unknown statistics consisting of residual clutter plus noise [20]. The cost-reference PF (CRPF), also named the generalized PF, is developed to estimate the states of dynamic systems of unknown statistics [21]. The user-defined cost and risk in the CRPF play a key role in state estimation. A new cost function and the FB-CRPF using the cost function are proposed to estimate the state sequence. In the IFC estimation of noisy signals, the FB-CRPF attains much better performance than the nonparametric ridge estimator [9] and comparable performance with the CCM-based detector [10] but requires much lower computational cost. The estimated states form a random sequence when the received time series is noise-only. From estimated state sequence, the GLRT statistic and the total variation (TV) statistic are constructed for signal detection. When the two statistics are used, the detection problem boils down to the design of a one-class classifier [25] in the 2D feature plane. The fast convexhull learning algorithm [26,27] is used to determine the decision region of the null hypothesis from the noisy-only training samples. Then, a new detector based upon the FB-CRPF is developed.This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the state-space model to characterize nonlinear FM signals and the detection problem of unknown nonlinear FM signals is reformulated under the state space model. In Section 3, new cost and risk functions are defined and the FB-CRPF is proposed for state sequence estimation. Moreover, the FB-CRPF is compared with the TF-ridge estimator and CCM-based estimator in IFC estimation of noisy signals. In Section 4, the GLRT and TV statistics are derived and a bi-feature detector is presented. Section 5 reports simulated results and performance comparison. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 6.If a radar transmits a train of coherent pulses and a moving target is assumed to remain in a radar resolution cell in an observation interval[0,T], then the target detection problem is the following binary hypothesis test [1]:(1){H0:z(t)=w(t),t∈[0,T]H1:z(t)=a(t)exp⁡(j2πv(t))+w(t),t∈[0,T]wherez(t)is received time series of the cell under test (CUT),a(t)andv(t)are the amplitude and phase modulations of target returns andw(t)is independent of target returns and is assumed to be zero-mean complex Gaussian noise with a known varianceσ2.Detection strategy highly depends on the modeling of target returns. If the observation time T is short and target is steadily moving,a(t)is approximated by a constant andv(t)is a linear function. In this case, the matched filter realizes the optimal detection and an unknown Doppler shift of the target is searched along Doppler bins [2]. If T is moderate and target steadily moves,v(t)is approximated by a quadratic function of time and target returns are LFM signals with unknown central frequency and chirp rate. Time–frequency (TF) analysis methods are used for target detection [3–6] and the two unknown parameters are searched in the 2D parameter space. To find weak targets, some radars dwell in one beam position for a long time to attain enough integration gain [1,5,20]. For a long observation time, fluctuation of radar cross-section (RCS) of a target and radial velocity change must be considered. In this case,a(t)andv(t)are assumed to be unknown smooth functions. Generally,a(t)varies with time much slower thanv(t), meaning that target returns are unknown nonlinear FM signals with slow amplitude fluctuation. Such target returns also occur for high maneuvering targets even if the observation time T is short. The key to detecting nonlinear FM signals in noise is modeling of signals and estimation of model parameters.In what follows, a state-space model is given to characterize unknown nonlinear FM signals with slow amplitude fluctuation. As in [10,11], the observation time interval[0,T]is divided into K disjoint equi-length subintervals[(k−1)ΔT,kΔT),k=1,2,…,K,ΔT=T/K. Each subinterval corresponds to the kth time instant in the terminology of PFs and the signal segmentsk(t)at the kth time instant is approximated by an LFM atom with central frequencyfkand chirp raterk,(2)sk(t)≈akejφkexp⁡(2πj(fk(t−(k−0.5)ΔT)+0.5rk(t−(k−0.5)ΔT)2)),t∈[(k−1)ΔT,kΔT),whereakandφkare the amplitude and initial phase of the signal at the kth subinterval. In (2), the slowly-varying amplitude modulation is approximated by piecewise constant functions in the subintervals and fast-varying phase modulation is approximated by piecewise quadratic functions in the subintervals. The signal segment at each time instant is determined by the four parameters: amplitude, initial phase, central frequency and chirp rate. When an LFM signal embedded in noise is detected, the initial phase of the signal has no influence on the output of the integrator and the amplitude of the signal only affects the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the integrator [3–6]. Hence, the initial phase and amplitude in (2) are extrinsic parameters for signal detection [10], which can be treated in a simple manner in definitions of cost and risk. Herein, the central frequency and chirp rate are combined into the state vectorxkat the kth time instant to characterize the signal segment at the kth subinterval. The state vector consists of two intrinsic parameters, defined by(3)xk=[fk,rk]T.Therefore, the state vectors in all the K subintervals form a piecewise parametric description of nonlinear FM signals. Unlike the piecewise parametric models in [16,17,20], exclusion of the initial phase and amplitude from the state vector reduces the dimension of the state space and computational cost in the sequent procedure.Below, we derive the state transition equation from one time instant to another. Assume that the IFC of signal has at least continuous second-order derivative. The IFC is written by(4)fd(t)=v′(t),t∈[0,T].Then, the values offd(t)and its derivative attk=(k−0.5)ΔTconstitute the state vector at the kth time instant. From the Taylor expansion of the IFCfd(t)attk−1=(k−1.5)ΔT, we have(5)fk=fd((k−0.5)ΔT)=fk−1+ΔTrk−1+0.5(ΔT)2fd″(ξ1),rk=fd′((k−0.5)ΔT)=rk−1+ΔTfd″(ξ2),ξ1,ξ2∈((k−1.5)ΔT,(k−0.5)ΔT).The unknown quantitiesΔTfd″(ξ1)andΔTfd″(ξ2)alter with each signal and at each time instant and are assumed to be zero-mean random variablesvk(1)andvk(2)of unknown statistics. The state transition is expressed by a linear dynamic system.(6)xk=[1ΔT01]xk−1+[ΔT/2001][vk(1)vk(2)]≡Axk−1+Gvk.The state-space model using amplitude, central frequency and chirp rate to form the state vector has been successfully used in target tracking and TBD-based detection [12–18]. The models in [12–18] approximate the IFCs of nonlinear FM signals by piecewise constant functions. The low-dimensional state vector risks the loss for the model to mismatch target's returns. High-dimensional state vector increases computational burden. The CCM [10,11] uses continuous piecewise linear functions to approximate the IFCs of nonlinear FM signals. The model (6) uses piecewise linear functions (probably discontinuous at the knots of the subintervals). In contrast to the CCM, the state transition equation in (6) brings convenience in state estimation using PFs.Based on the state transition equation (6) and the measurement equation (2), the detection problem can be reformulated into(7){H0:zk(t)=wk(t),k=1,2,…,KH1:{xk=Axk−1+Gvkzk(t)=akejφkh(t;xk)+wk(t)h(t;xk)=e2πj(fk(t−(k−0.5)ΔT)+0.5rk(t−(k−0.5)ΔT)2),t∈[(k−1)ΔT,kΔT)where A and G are the state transition matrix and noise gain matrix,h(t;xk)is the unit-amplitude LFM atom specified by the state vectorxk,wkis the measurement noise vector andvkis the systemic noise vector of unknown statistics. Under the null hypothesis, the received vector at each time instant is zero-mean white complex Gaussian. Under the alternative hypothesis, the received time series is a nonlinear FM signal specified by an unknown state sequence plus measurement noise. Thus, the key to detecting unknown nonlinear FM signals is state sequence estimation of received time series.In typical applications such as radar and sonar, the measurement is a discrete time series with a sampling interval Δt. SetΔT=MΔtand then the measurement, signal segment and noise at each time instant are M-dimensional complex vectors. The nonlinear dynamic system in (7) can be reformulated into,(8)xk=Axk−1+Gvkzk=akejφkh(xk)+wk,k=1,2,…,Kwherezkandh(xk)are the measurement vector and an LFM vector specified by the state vectorxkat the kth time instant andwkis the measurement noise vector.wkis assumed to be zero-mean white complex Gaussian vector and its variance can be regarded to be known or is estimated from received time series by the absolute median estimator as in [1].The unit-modulus vectorh(xk)can be interpreted as a particle specified by the state vectorxk. The cost of this particle to approximate the measurementzkis defined by(9)cost(zk;xk)≡minak,φk⁡‖zk−akejφkh(xk)‖22=‖zk‖22−|zkHh(xk)|2‖h(xk)‖22=‖zk‖22−|zkHh(xk)|2M,where|⋅|is the modulus of complex number and‖⋅‖2is the 2-norm of a vector. The cost function is the energy of the projection of the measurement vector onto the complementary subspace of the particle. A small cost implies that the particle gives a good approximation of the measurement and the state vector provides a good estimate of the parameters of the signal segment at the kth time instant. The cost in (9) is achieved at the optimal amplitude and initial phase that satisfyakejφk=h(xk)Hzk/‖h(xk)‖22, which is the reason for the amplitude and initial phase to be excluded from the state vector in (3).A variety of filters have been developed for state estimation of dynamic systems. The Kalman filter invented over five decades ago is extremely useful for linear-Gaussian systems where the state and measurement equations are linear and the systemic and measurement noises have Gaussian statistics [12,13]. The extended and unscented Kalman filters are for nonlinear-Gaussian systems. The PFs were developed for nonlinear non-Gaussian systems of known statistics [12–18]. In many practical applications, the statistics of systems are unknown or are difficult to model by simple statistical models. The CRPFs were developed for nonlinear non-Gaussian systems of unknown statistics [21–23]. Therein, the particles are often determined by application itself and the user-defined cost and risk of the particles affect state estimation. Using the particle cost in (9) and particle risk with the similar form, a FB-CRPF is presented to estimate the state sequence of the dynamic system in (8). In contrast to the CRPF [21–23], the FB-CRPF has two significant improvements. The new particle cost and risk are defined to match the application in hand, which is related with the matched filter detection of a signal with unknown amplitude and initial phase in white Gaussian noise [2]. The forward filter and backward filter are combined to improve estimation and to avoid the transient effect from initial particles. In fact, early in 1995, the forward- and backward multiple-model filters were used to improve state estimates of Markovian switching systems with Gaussian posterior PDF [31]. A forward CRPF (F-CRPF) followed by a backward CRPF (B-CRPF) forms the FB-CRPF.(i)Particle initializationGenerate the initial particle set{x01,x02,…,x0N}at the 0th time instant by uniformly sampling the admissible space Ω of the state vectors. All the initial particles are assigned the null costc0n=0. The initial particles with costs are denoted byΛ0≡{(x01,c01),(x02,c02),…,(x0N,c0N)}. The admissible space is determined by the dynamic range of the central frequency and chirp rate of signals of interest.(ii)Particle risk computationGiven the particle setΛk={(xkn,ckn),n=1,…,N}at the kth time instant, the particle at the next time instant is predicted from a particlexkninΛkin terms of the state transition equation. The risk of a particlexknevaluates its significance and is defined by(10)Rkn≡λckn+minak+1,φk+1⁡‖zk+1−ak+1ejφk+1h(Axkn)‖22=λckn+(‖zk+1‖22−M−1|zk+1Hh(Axkn)|2).The first term in (10) is the inherited cost and the second term is the cost of the predicted particleAxknto approximate the measurement at the next time instant. The positive number0≤λ<1is a forgetting factor to achieve a trade-off between the inherited cost and the prediction cost. Whenλ=0, the risk of the particle is fully determined by its predictive ability of the predicted particle to approximate the measurement at the next time instant. When λ is close to one, the risk is mainly dominated by the ability of the state evolution sequence before the(k+1)th time instant to approximate the measurements. In practice, the forgetting factor is empirically chosen.(iii)Computation of resampling weightThe smaller the risk of a particle is, the more significant it is for the state estimation at the next time instant. From the N risks of the particle set at the kth time instant, the resampling weights are computed by(11)μ(Rkn)≡(Rkn)−q∑l=1N(Rkl)−q,whereq≥1is a positive constant. A large q value means that the resampled particles are centered around a small number of the most significant particles. Other types of decreasing functions can be used to replace1/xqin (11)[12,13].(iv)Resampling and cost updateLet(12)υn=[Nμ(Rkn)],n=1,2,…,Nwhere[x]denotes the integer nearest to x. Whenυn≥1,υnresampled particles at the(k+1)th time instant are replicated from the particlexknin terms of the state transition equation,(13)xk+1n(l)=Axkn+Gvk(l),l=1,2,…,υnwherevk(l)is a 2D random vector of a zero-mean truncated Gaussian distribution with a variance. It is relevant to the dynamic range of theΔTfd″(t)of signals of interest. The cost of the resampled particle is updated by(14)ck+1n(l)=λckn+minak+1,φk+1⁡‖zk+1−ak+1ejφk+1h(xk+1n(l))‖22=λckn+(‖zk+1‖22−M−1|zk+1Hh(xk+1n(l))|2)Asυn<1, no particle at the(k+1)th time instant is replicated from the particlexkn. At last, the particles with costs at the(k+1)th time instant constitute the set,(15)Λk+1={(xk+1n,ck+1n),n=1,2,…,N}.Repeat the steps (ii–iv) tillk+1=K. The particle sets at all the K time instants are generated.From the particle sets, the state vectors are estimated by the minimal cost estimator,(16)xˆkF=xkn0,n0=arg⁡minn=1,2,…,N⁡{ckn}.In the F-CRPF algorithm, the initial particles are obtained by uniformly sampling the state space and are not dense enough in the state space for computational realizability. Like other filters for state sequence estimation, the F-CRPF algorithm encounters the transient effect, in which the estimated states are of low precision at the first time instant and gradually improve with evolution of time instants. In substance, the F-CRPF is a gradual process of collecting and exploiting the state information from the measurement sequence. With the evolution of time instant, the particles gradually concentrate around the true state to give an increasingly accurate estimate. The backward smoothing is a selectable post-processing to improve target tracking [12,13]. Here, the forward–backward implementation is used to improve state sequence estimation.As in Section 2, the backward dynamic system is as follows:(17)xk−1=[1−ΔT01]xk+[ΔT/200−1][vk−1(1)vk−1(2)]≡ABxk+GBvk−1,zk−1=ak−1ejφk−1h(xk−1)+wk−1,k=K,K−1,…,2,1Using the particles obtained from the F-CRPF at the Kth time instant as the initial particles, the B-CRPF is applied in the same steps as the F-CRPF except the order is reversed. Let the particle sets obtained from the B-CRPF be(18)Λ¯k={(x¯kn,c¯kn),n=1,2,…,N},k=K,K−1,…,2,1.Then, the state vector sequence estimated by the FB-CRPF is given by(19)xˆk=x¯kn0,n0=arg⁡minn=1,2,…,N⁡{c¯kn}.From the estimated statesxˆk=[fˆk,rˆk]T,k=1,2,…,K, the IFC of the signal is approximated by the piecewise linear function(20)fˆd(t)=fˆk+rˆk(t−(k−0.5)ΔT),t∈[(k−1)ΔT,kΔT),k=1,2,…,K.Note that this function is probably discontinuous at the junctions of the subintervals, which is different than the continuous piecewise linear functions in the CCM [10,11].The FB-CRPF provides a method to estimate the IFC of a signal from its noisy version. The root mean squared error (RMSE) at each subinterval is computed by(21)RMSE(k)≡∫(k−1)ΔTkΔT(fd(t)−fˆk−rˆk(t−(k−0.5)ΔT))2dt,wherefd(t)is the IFC of the signal. The total RMSE at the interval[0,T]is computed by(22)RMSE=∑k=1K∫(k−1)ΔTkΔT(fd(t)−fˆk−rˆk(t−(k−0.5)ΔT))2dt.The convergence of the CRPFs has been discussed in [21–24]. The relevant results are used for the convergence analysis of the proposed FB-CRPF. Under a mild condition the mean incremental cost of the particles at a time instant converges to the minimal incremental cost in probability as the particle number tends to infinity [21,22]. Moreover, the estimated states converge to the minimal-cost state sequence as time passes and the particle number tends to infinity [24]. The F-CRPF with the additive cost (14) satisfies the condition in [24]. In our problem, the minimal-cost state sequence is(23)xkmin=arg⁡minxk∈R2⁡{‖zk‖22−M−1|zkHh(xk)|2},k=1,2,…,K,for the measurement vectorsz1,z2,…,zK. In terms of the result in [24], the state estimates by the F-CRPF asymptotically converge to the minimal-cost state sequence, i.e.,(24)limk→∞⁡limM→∞⁡d(xˆkF,xkmin)=0(in probability)whered(•,•)is a distance in the state space. The asymptotic convergence also holds for the B-CRPF except the time instant k varies in reverse order from K to 1.For a finite K and fixed number of particles, the distanced(xˆkF,xkmin)of the F-CRPF at the kth time instant is determined by the lag k and initial distanced(xˆ1F,x1min)at the first time instant. With the increase of the lag k, the distance gradually reduces from the initial distance. One way to speed up the convergence is to reduce the initial distance. In the FB-CRPF, the particles of the F-CRPF at the Kth time instant are used as the initial particles of the B-CRPF. Due to K particle updates, the distance of the F-CRPF at the Kth time instant is much smaller than the initial distance. Hence, the FB-CRPF improves the state estimates by relaying use of the F-CRPF and B-CRPF. The minimal-cost state sequence is an unbiased estimate of the true state sequence and the error is from the measurement noise.The experiment below is used to demonstrate the errors of the state estimates of the FB-CRPF with time instant. In each trial, a true state sequence of length 32 is generated by the state transition equation with systemic noisevkdrawn from a zero-mean uniform distribution within[−0.5,0.5]andΔT=1/32. From the state sequence, 32 measurement vectors of length 32 are generated by the equation (8) with unit-variance noise, constant amplitudeak=a=1/100.5(SNR=−10dB) and random initial phasesφkof uniform distribution in[0,π]. From the measurement vectors, the minimal-cost state sequence is estimated by fine grid searching in the state space and the state sequence is estimated by the FB-CRPF. From one true state sequence{xk=[fk,rk]T,k=1,…,32}and its estimate{xˆk=[fˆk,rˆk]T,k=1,…,32}, the RMSE at the kth time instant is computed by(25)RMSE(k)=(fˆk−fk)2ΔT+(rˆk−rk)2(ΔT)3/12The MSE at the kth time instant is the weighted sum of the MSEs of the central frequency and chirp rate and thus the errors of the state estimate and the IFC estimate error are consistent. To remove the dependency of the RMSEs on measurement noise and true state sequence, 103 independent trials are used to calculate the RMSEs.Fig. 1presents the RMSEs of the estimated state sequences from the FB-CRPF for the number of particlesN=102andN=202and the RMSEs of the minimal-cost state sequences. Note that the minimal-cost state sequence is obtained by using fine grid search in the state space that is computationally infeasible in most applications. The initial RMSE of the F-CRPF at the first time instant is determined by the sampling interval of the state space to generate the initial particles. The smaller initial RMSE whenN=202thanN=102originates from smaller sampling interval of the former. The RMSEs of the F-CRPF fast reduce with time instant while the RMSEs of the following B-CRPF remain around a constant as the time instant alters from 32 to 0. Therefore, the B-CRPF is necessary in the FB-CRPF and greatly reduces the dependency of the estimates on initial particles. Moreover, though allowed, the recursive use of the FB-CRPF hardly brings further improvement. Smaller RMSEs of the FB-CRPF than the minimal-cost state sequence is owing to the fact that the minimal-cost state at one time instant is completely determined by the current measurement and the state transition relation is not exploited in estimation.The FB-CRPF is also an effective IFC estimator and the performance of the IFC estimation often determines detection performance of unknown FM signals. Detection of an unknown nonlinear FM signal in noise consists of the IFC estimation and the matched filter using approximate reference signal constructed from the estimated IFC [1,10,11]. The TF-ridge estimator is a nonparametric method via the TF distribution [1,9]. The CCM-based estimator uses the piecewise linear IFC model and the dynamic program in the 2D TF grid [10,11]. Below, the performance of the three estimators is compared by using test signals with phase functions of fourth-order polynomials and amplitude fluctuation is given by(26)s(t)=A(t)exp⁡{2πj(νt+μt2/2+rt3/3+υt4/4)}A(t)=a(1+bcos⁡(12πt))(0<b<1)wheret∈[0,1], the sampling interval isΔt=1/512. The parameter b is used to adjust amplitude fluctuation. Small b means little amplitude fluctuation. The IFC of the test signal is a third-degree polynomial,(27)fd(t)=v+μt+rt2+υt3Its four parameters take value in[−20,20]so thatfd(t)always falls into the interval [−80 Hz, 80 Hz] to avoid sampling aliasing. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is specified by(28)SNR≡10log⁡10(a2(1+b2/2)σ2)(dB)whereσ2is noise variance.In the FB-CRPF, signals of length 512 are divided into 16 short vectors of length 32 (ΔT=1/16), the forgetting factor λ is 0.9 and the parameterq=8. The random disturbance in resampling is empirically selected for systemic noise of unknown statistic [19,20]. In terms of the dynamic systems in Section 2, the random disturbance is from the quantityΔTfd″(ξ). To assure that resampled particles cover all possible states, the random disturbances in (13) are taken as zero-mean truncated Gaussian distributed random variable of the standard deviationσv=0.5ΔTmaxξ∈[0,1]⁡{|fd″(ξ)|}=5for the test signals in (26). The state vectors are in the rectangle[−80,80]×[−120,120]and initial particles are generated by uniformly sampling P points along each dimension and the number of initial particles isN=P2. For radar targets, the range of the state vectors and the standard deviation of random disturbance in resampling are determined by the physical parameters of targets of interest such as the maximal radial velocity and acceleration.The computational cost of the FB-CRPF is determined by the number of particles. The first experiment is used to examine the influence of the particle number on the total RMSE in[0,1]. To remove its dependency on a special signal, 104 independent trials are used and each trial uses a signal whose four parameters randomly take values in[−20,20]in terms of (26) andb=0.9(high amplitude fluctuation). Fig. 2(a) plots the average RMSEs over 104 trials as the particle number of the FB-CRPF alters from 42 to 202. The RMSE is found to be hardly altered whenN≥102. Hence, the FB-CRPF with a small number of particles and low computational cost can realize good and stable state and IFC estimates, which is owing to the forward–backward structure and the fact that the resampling based on the reference cost in the CRPF assembles most particles around the true states and realizes locally dense sampling around the true states. Fig. 2(b) plots the average RMSEs of the F-CRPF and FB-CRPF at all the time instants over 104 independent trials forSNR=−10dB,b=0.9in (26) andN=102. The same phenomenon as in Fig. 1 occurs for the test signals. The RMSE of the F-CRPF gradually drops with time instant and that of the following B-CRPF is around a small constant.The FB-CRPF performs well when used as an IFC estimator for nonstationary signals. The FB-CRPF estimator is compared with the TF-ridge estimator [1,9] and the CCM-based estimator [10]. Experiment uses the test signals in (26) withb=0.9,K=16andΔT=1/16. At each SNR level, 104 independent trials are used to calculate the RMSE of each detector. The RMSEs of the three detectors are plotted in Fig. 2(c) for the SNR from −13 dB to −5 dB. It can be seen that TF-ridge estimator has the largest RMSEs. Its poor performance in the IFC estimation can be attributed to the following fact. The position of the maximum of each time slice of the TFD is sensitive to noise such that the estimated IFC often contains some outliers far from the IFC. The CCM-based estimator uses the original code opened by the authors at the website [32] where the dynamic program is applied to the TFD of time series to find the optimal path and two parameters to control the regularity are specified by the maximal magnitudes of the first and second derivatives of the IFCs of the test signals in (26). In contrast to the TF-ridge estimator, the CCM-based estimator has much smaller RMSEs, owing to the piecewise linear IFC model and the ability of the dynamic program to search the optimal path in a large number of admissible paths. The FB-CRPF estimator attains the smallest RMSEs. At high SNR cases, the RMSEs of the FB-CRPF estimator and the CCM-based estimator are rather close. In addition, the main merit of the FB-CRPF estimator is its low computational cost because it does not use the TF distribution and is allowed to use a small number of particles, which is important for radar target detection requiring real-time implementation. The robustness of the estimators to amplitude fluctuation of signals needs to be examined. In the test signals (26),b=0corresponds to constant amplitude andb=0.9to sharp amplitude fluctuation. Fig. 2(d) plots the RMSEs of the FB-CRPF estimator and the CCM-based estimator using 104 trials whenSNR=−10dBandb=0,0.1,…,0.9. It can be seen that the amplitude fluctuation brings a slight increase of the RMSEs, implying that the two estimators are robust to amplitude fluctuation of signals.In this section, the GLRT statistic via the estimated state sequence by the FB-CRPF is derived. And the total variation (TV) of the IFC constructed from the estimated state sequence is shown to be an effective statistic to tell noisy signals from noise. The fast convexhull learning algorithm [26–29] is used to determine the decision region of the null hypothesis on the 2D feature plane of GLRT versus TV.In the discrete form, the detection problem (7) can be reformulated into:(29){H0:zk=wk,k=1,2,…,KH1:zk=akejφkh(xk)+wk.If the amplitudes, initial phases and state sequence of signal are known, then the logarithmic likelihood ratio (LLR) for the optimal detection of a known signal in Gaussian white noise is(30)ℑ(Z|xk,ak,φk)=ln⁡(∏k=1K1(πσ2)Mexp⁡(−‖zk−akejφkh(xk)‖22/σ2)∏k=1K1(πσ2)Mexp⁡(−‖zk‖22/σ2))=1σ2(∑k=1K(‖zk‖22−‖zk−akejφkh(xk)‖22)),whereZ=[z1,z2,…,zK]consists of the measurement vectors at all the K time instants andσ2is the variance of white complex Gaussian noise. Maximizing the LLR on amplitudes and initial phases yields the maximal LLR for detection,(31)ζ(Z|xk)=1σ2maxak,φk⁡(∑k=1K(‖zk‖22−‖zk−akejφkh(xk)‖22))=1Mσ2∑k=1K|zkHh(xk)|2.The statistic is the sum of the outputs of the matched filters from all the subintervals. Like the integration scheme in [10,11], the test statistic is obtained by the non-coherent sum of the coherent detection statistics from each subinterval.The unknown state sequence is estimated by the FB-CRPF from the measurement vectors and is denoted by(32){xˆk,k=1,2,…,K}=FB-CRPF{z1,z2,…,zK}Substituting (32) into (31), the GLRT statistic is derived as follows:(33)ζ(Z)=1Mσ2∑k=1K|zkHh(xˆk)|2where M is the length of the vectorszk. The detector using (33) as the test statistic is the GLRT detector via the FB-CRPF. Note that the statistic (33) under the null hypothesis is independent of noise variance, because the denominatorσ2reduces the noise variance to one.Besides the GLRT statistic, the total variation (TV) of the estimated IFC is an effective test statistic for signal detection. The estimated IFC in (20) is linear in individual subintervals but probably discontinuous at the junctions of the subintervals. Its TV statistic is defined by [30](34)κ(Z)≡∑k=1K∫(k−1)ΔTkΔT|fˆd′(t)|dt+∑k=2K−1|limΔt→0+⁡fˆd(kΔT+Δt)−limΔt→0−⁡fˆd(kΔT+Δt)|=ΔT∑k=1K|rˆk|+∑k=2K−1|(fˆk+1−fˆk)−0.5ΔT(rˆk+1+rˆk)|.The TV statistic is computed from the estimated state sequence by using the FB-CRPF. The reason of the selecting TV as a test statistic is explained as follows. The estimated state sequence by the FB-CRPF is an approximation of the minimal-cost state sequence of the measurement vectors [24]. If the measurement vectors are white noise, then the minimal-cost state sequence is a random sequence in the 2D state space. Therefore, the state sequence estimated from white noise by the FB-CRPF is a random sequence in the state space. Due to the randomness of the central frequencies and chirp rates, the second term of (34) takes large values and thus the TV statistic takes large values for white noise. When the received time series is a noisy nonlinear FM signal, the piecewise linear function (20) derived from the estimated state sequence is an approximation of the smooth IFC of the signal. Though the curve is probably discontinuous at the junctions of the subintervals, the jumps at the junctions are often small and thus the TV statistic takes small values for noisy signals.Both the GLRT and TV statistics provide the ability to distinguish noisy signals from noise. Under the alternative hypothesis, the GLRT statistic takes large values and the TV statistic has small values. Conversely, under the null hypothesis, the GLRT statistic takes small values and the TV statistic has large values. Fig. 3(a) plots the empirical PDFs of the GLRT statistic from 50 000 independent trials under the two hypotheses whenK=16,M=32,N=102,SNR=−10dBfor the test signals (26) withb=0.9. Fig. 3(b) plots the empirical PDFs of the TV statistic. Fig. 3(c) illustrates the distributions of the GLRT and TV statistics under the 2D feature plane. It can be seen from Fig. 3(c) that the feature vectors of noisy signals and that of noise have good separability in the 2D feature plane. However, the sample distribution of noisy signals in the 2D feature plane alters with SNR and TF characteristics of signals and thus is unavailable while designing a detector. Only the samples of noise time series, or the training samples of one class, are available to design a detector, which is related with the one-class classifier in the anomaly detection [25]. Aiming at radar target detection, the greedy convexhull learning algorithms were developed to determine the decision region of the null hypothesis from training samples in the 2D and 3D feature spaces [26,27].Below, we give a brief course to determine the decision region of the null hypothesis from a set of training samples by the convexhull learning algorithm. At a given parameter setting of the FB-CRPF, simulate noise-only time series and calculate the values of the GLRT and TV statistics to form training samples of the null hypothesis. These training samples constitute into the setS={sr=(ζr,κr)T,r=1,2,…,R}. At a given false alarm ratepFA, finding the decision region of the null hypothesis from the training set is equivalent to searching the minimal-area convexhull containing[R(1−pFA)]samples out of the R training samples [27], where[x]denotes the integer part of real number x. For this NP-hard problem, the greedy convexhull learning algorithm was developed to iteratively remove[RpFA]training samples so that each removal reduces maximally the area of the intersection set of the convexhull spanning by the reminding training samples and a prior region Ω on the feature vectors of signals of interest. More details refer to [27]. Based on the fact that the GLRT statistic takes large values and the TV statistic takes small values, the prior region Ω of the feature vectors of noisy signals is taken as(35)Ω={s=[ζ,κ]T:ζ≥E{ζ|H0},κ≤E{κ|H0}}.In use, the conditional means of the GLRT and TV statistics under the null hypothesis are replaced by the sample means in the training set S. The greedy convexhull learning algorithm is acceptable in computational cost owing to the quick convexhull algorithm [26]. For the training set S and false alarm ratepFA, the obtained decision region is surrounded by a convex polygon [28,29](36)CH{S,pFA}=polygon{v1,v2,…,vr}={s∈R2:s=∑k=1rαkvk,αk≥0,∑k=1rαk=1},wherevk=[υkx,υky]T,k=1,2,…,ris the counter-clockwise arranged vertices of the polygon. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the convexhull is the decision region of the null hypothesis at the false alarm rate10−3, which is obtained by iteratively removing 50 outliers out of 50 000 noise-only training samples in Fig. 3(c). In the greedy convexhull learning algorithm, the percentage of removed outliers corresponds to the false alarm rate.For a measurement Z, calculate the values of the GLRT and TV statistics by the FB-CRPF to form the feature vectors=[ζ,κ]Tfor test. The null hypothesis is declared iff [26–29](37)s∈CH{S,pFA}⇔min1≤k≤r⁡{|ζκ1υkxυky1υk+1xυk+1y1|}≥0wherevr+1=v1and|A|denotes the determinant of the square matrix A.Finally, we summarize the structure of the proposed bi-feature-based detector as shown in Fig. 4. It consists of an online detection branch and an offline training branch. In the online detection branch, the received vector or time series at the CUT is first used as the input of the FB-CRPF to estimate the state sequence. From the estimated state sequence, the values of the GLRT test statistic and the TV test statistic are computed to form a 2D feature vector under test. Lastly, the signal of interest is detected by judging whether the 2D feature vector falls in the decision region Ω of the hypothesisH0. In the offline training branch, the decision region Ω ofH0at a given false alarm rate is determined by a Monte-Carlo test to noise-only time series. A large number of noise-only time series are generated first. The FB-CRPF is operated on each time series to obtain the estimated state sequence and from which the values of the GLRT test statistic and TV test statistic are computed to form a feature vector under theH0hypothesis. The convexhull learning algorithm is applied to the set of the collected feature vectors to determine a decision region Ω of theH0hypothesis at a given false alarm rate.In this section, the proposed detector is evaluated for two kinds of nonlinear FM signals and it is compared with the TF-ridge detector [1] and CCM-based detector [10]. The results of the matched filter using known signals are also reported to give an upper performance bound. The TF-ridge detector and CCM-based detector integrate the energy of a signal along an estimated IFC. The IFC is estimated by different methods from the TF distribution of noisy signal. The former uses the nonparametric ridge estimation and the latter uses the dynamic program under the piecewise linear approximation.In addition to the test signals in (26), a second kind of signal with constant amplitude and linear plus cosine frequency modulation is used as follows,(38)s(t)=aexp⁡(2πj(0.5bt2+csin⁡(4t+φ))),t∈[0,1]where the sampling interval isΔt=1/512, φ is a random initial phase in[−π,π], the parameter b randomly takes values in[−60,60]and c randomly takes values in[0,5]. The IFC and SNR arefd(t)=bt+4ccos⁡(4t+φ),SNR=20log10⁡(a/σ)(dB).The state vectors are restricted to the rectangle[−80,80]×[−140,140]. In the FB-CRPF to estimate state sequences, the following parameter values are used:ΔT=1/16,K=16,M=32,N=122. The random disturbance in the resampling procedure has a standard deviationσv=1/2ΔTmaxξ∈[0,1]⁡{|fd″(ξ)|}=10. The second kind test signal has complex Doppler evolution. The complexity of target returns at Doppler modulation depends on the operating mode of the radar. For instance, for the high-frequency over-the-horizon radar with pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of tens of Hertz and wide range resolution over ten kilometers [33], an aircraft remains in a single range cell for over ten seconds. The returns of a maneuvering aircraft in such a long observation time have complex Doppler modulation as the second kind test signal.In the first experiment, the three detectors are compared by using the two kinds of test signals (withb=0.6for the first kind). 105 independent trials of noise-only time series are used to determine the decision region ofH0at the false alarm rate10−3where the FB-CRPF withM=32,K=16andN=102is available. At each SNR level, 103 independent trials of noisy signals are used to calculate detection probability. The two kinds of test signals use different decision region of the null hypothesis due to different disturbance variance in the resampling procedure of the FB-CRPF. The CCM-based detector uses the same segmentation of the time interval[0,1]and the two parameters to control the regularity are determined by the maximal magnitudes of the first-order and second-order derivatives of the IFCs of test signals. Fig. 5presents the detection performance curves of the four detectors for the two kinds of test signals when SNR alters from −16 dB to −6 dB, which the matched filter detector using known signals gives the upper bound of the other detectors. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the proposed detector is superior to the TF-ridge detector and the CCM-based detector for the two kinds of test signals. For the first kind test signal, the CCM-based detector is better than the TF-ridge detector and is even better than the proposed detector at low SNR cases. For the second kind test signals, the CCM-based detector is better than the TF-ridge detector at low SNR cases while the situation is reversed at high SNR cases. It is found that the proposed detector keeps the gap over 4 dB from the performance upper bound by the ideal matched filter detector. The inclusion of the TV statistics of the estimated IFC to the CCM-based detector is also studied as seen in Fig. 3(d). It is found that the TV statistic does not bring significant improvement of the performance of the CCM-based detector.Besides the detection performance curves in Fig. 5, the receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curves of the three detectors are used for comparison. For the two kinds of test signals, we takeK=16,M=32,ΔT=1/16andSNR=−11dBand compute the detection probabilities of the three detectors at thepFAranges from10−4to 100. The ROC curves of the three detectors are shown in Fig. 6. The bi-feature-based detector using FB-CRPF performs better, particularly for the second kind of test signal with fast Doppler change.The proposed detector and the CCM-based detector use the piecewise linear parametric models of the IFC of signals. Therefore, their performance depends on the partitions of the observation time interval. For the two kinds of test signals, the observation time interval[0,1]is segmented byΔT=1/32,1/16and1/8. We examine the performance of the two detectors. As shown in Fig. 7where the particle numberN=102and false alarm rate10−3, the proposed detector is insensitive to the partition of the time interval. However, the CCM-based detector is sensitive to the partition of the time interval. The robustness to time interval partition is one merit of the proposed detector, which avoids the difficulty to select a proper partition in use.In the last experiment, we examine the influence of the amplitude fluctuation and the curvature of the IFC of signals on the detectors, whereM=32, the false alarm rate is fixed at10−3and the SNR is fixed at −11 dB. Fig. 8(a) plots the detection probabilities of the three detectors when the amplitude fluctuation parameter of the first kind test signal changes fromb=0(constant amplitude) tob=0.9(sharp fluctuation). The parameter b in the first kind of signals reflects amplitude fluctuation extent.b=0corresponds to constant amplitude signals andb=1to sharp amplitude fluctuation. It can be seen that the detection probabilities reduce as the amplitude fluctuation of test signals becomes acute for the three detectors. The proposed detector is robust to amplitude fluctuations while the TF-ridge detector is sensitive to amplitude fluctuation. For the second kind test signal, the parameter c reflects the curvature of the IFCs of the signals. Fig. 8(b) presents the detection probabilities of the three detectors as c alters from 0 to 5 (c=0corresponds to LFM test signals). It can be seen that the performance of the proposed detector and TF-ridge detector is robust to the curvature change while it brings an obvious change of the detection probability of the CCM-based detector.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The detection of unknown nonlinear FM signals is a problem frequently encountered in surveillance of weak maneuvering targets in radars. Weak returns require a long integration time during which the Doppler and amplitude modulations of target returns inevitably occur. The key to detecting such targets depends on the performance of modeling and estimation of the Doppler frequency evolution of the target in time. In this paper, a nonlinear dynamic system of unknown statistic with 2D state vectors is presented to characterize the evolution of the IFCs in time and the FB-CRPF with well-defined cost and risk functions are proposed for state estimation. The bi-feature-based detector using the GLRT statistic and TV statistic is given for detection of unknown nonlinear FM signals. Simulated results show that it attains better detection performance in contrast to the TF-ridge detector and CCM-based detector.
