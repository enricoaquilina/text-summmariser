This paper presents a cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) based adaptive infinite impulse response (IIR) system identification scheme. The proposed scheme prevents the local minima problem encountered in conventional IIR modeling mechanisms. The performance of the new method has been compared with that obtained by other evolutionary computing algorithms like genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The superior system identification capability of the proposed scheme is evident from the results obtained through an exhaustive simulation study.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
A pole-zero system can be modeled effectively using an adaptive infinite impulse response (IIR) model with a fewer number of coefficients compared to a finite impulse response (FIR) adaptive model. This capacity of adaptive IIR filters has resulted in making IIR filters popular in diverse fields of applications in signal processing [1,2], including noise control [3]. The error surface in an IIR filter is mostly multi-modal with respect to the filter coefficients. This may lead traditional gradient-descent approaches to fall into local optima. Stability is another concern in IIR filter design. The IIR systems may become unstable if the poles of the filter move outside the unit circle in the z-plane [4].In order to avoid the local optima problem encountered by gradient descent methods in IIR system modeling, several works have been reported in the literature, considering IIR system identification as an optimization problem solved using an evolutionary computing algorithm [5]. A genetic search approach, which infuses a GA search pattern into LMS algorithm has been used for IIR plant modeling in [6]. The authors have demonstrated the improved identification capability of the genetic search approach over the LMS algorithm based gradient-descent approach. An improved GA with multiple crossovers has been used for identification of band pass and band stop IIR filters in [7]. An eighteen parameter IIR plant was successfully identified using differential evolution (DE) in [8].In [9], the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), which has evolved as one of the most popular evolutionary computing algorithms [10], has been used for IIR system identification. An incremental PSO (IPSO) has been reported in [11] to achieve improved identification of IIR plants in the presence of outliers in the training samples. The IIR system identification problem has also recently evolved as one of the benchmark problems for testing the efficiency of evolutionary computing algorithms. The cat swarm optimization (CSO) algorithm has been utilized for IIR plant modeling in [12]. A gravitational search algorithm (GSA) based approach has been presented in [13] and an artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm based scheme has been demonstrated in [14].The cuckoo search algorithm (CSA), is a recently developed meta-heuristic algorithm, which combines the breeding behavior of cuckoos with the Lévy flight seen in some species of birds [15]. CSA has found applications in diverse fields [16] including mechanical engineering [17] and automobile engineering [18]. Also, recent work in [19] has demonstrated the application of CSA for gray level image enhancement. Moreover, [20] emphasizes the use of CSA in tsallis entropy based optimal multilevel thresholding, in the field of image processing. Many researchers have proposed other novel algorithms based on the CSA. A hybrid CSA has been proposed in [21] and [22] presents the inter-species cuckoo search (ISCS) algorithm which incorporates a novel Levy flight pattern. In [23], the authors have shown that CSA performs better than ABC in solving numerical optimization problems and the modified CSA has been reported to converge faster than DE [24]. Thus, CSA could be a potential meta-heuristic algorithm for obtaining higher performance in optimization problems. With an objective to improve the parameter modeling efficiency in an IIR system identification problem, this paper proposes a CSA based IIR system identification scheme.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The IIR system identification problem is discussed in Section 2. The steps involved in the cuckoo search algorithm are explained in Section 3. The IIR system identification problem is formulated as a CSA based optimization problem in Section 4. An exhaustive simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of CSA in identifying IIR plants in this section. The concluding remarks are drawn in Section 5.The IIR system identification problem involves the estimation of the feedforward and feedback parameters of an unknown IIR plant. The schematic diagram of a typical IIR system identification is shown in Fig. 1. Ifx(n)denotes the input signal to an IIR plant, the z-transform of the outputy(n),Y(z)of the IIR plant is given by(1)Y(z)=Hp(z)X(z)whereX(z)is the z-transform of the system input andHp(z)is the transfer function of the IIR plant. The output of the adaptive IIR filter model is obtained as(2)yˆ(n)=AT(n)Xa(n)+BT(n)Xb(n−1)whereA(n)=[a0(n),a1(n),…,aL(n)]Tis the weight vector of the feedforward path of the IIR filter model at time n andXa(n)=[x(n),x(n−1),…,x(n−L)]Trepresents the tap delayed input signal vector. Similarly, the feedback weight vector is given byB(n)=[b1(n),b2(n),…,bM(n)]TwithXb(n−1)=[yˆ(n−1),yˆ(n−2),…,yˆ(n−M)]T. The overall transfer function of the IIR model is given by(3)Hm(z)=A(z)1−B(z)In a gradient descent IIR system identification approach, the weight vectorsA(n)andB(n)are estimated with an objective to minimizeE[e2(n)], whereE[⋅]is the expectation operator ande(n)=y(n)−yˆ(n)is the error in estimation of the IIR model.The cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) is a recent meta-heuristic algorithm, which imitates the behavior of some species of cuckoos [15]. The CSA algorithm has been formulated to provide better performance than traditional meta-heuristic algorithms. In this regard, comparison of CSA with other well-established algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) has been done in [25], and the results suggest that CSA provides more robust and precise solutions.Cuckoos usually lay their eggs in the nest of some other species of bird, which is termed here as the host bird. In the event of the host bird discovering that the eggs are not its own, it may abandon the nest or may choose to destroy the eggs of the cuckoo. This leads to the evolution of the cuckoo eggs which try to imitate the eggs of the host bird. In the development of the CSA, the following simplifying assumptions were used: (a) The only egg laid by a cuckoo is dumped in a random nest. (b) Only the best nests (with the best egg) will survive and move to the next generation. (c) The number of nests is fixed. (d)pais the probability that the host bird will identify the cuckoo's egg. In addition to the breeding behavior of cuckoos, the CSA also combines Lévy flight, which are observed in some species of birds and animals. Lévy flight refers to a series of straight line flights followed by sudden 90° turns. The implementation of Lévy flights has largely been a key factor in improving the CSA performance. In [26], an analysis of Lévy flights has been provided using the Markov theory and an explanation has been given regarding the increased efficiency of Lévy flights over Gaussian random walks. The steps involved in CSA are as follows:Step 1Randomly generate an initial population of n host nestsxi(i=1,2,…,n)and evaluate the corresponding fitness functionFi.Carry out Lévy flights to get new nests given by:(4)xL=xi+α⊕Le´vy(λ)where α is the step size, ⊕ represents entry wise multiplication and λ is a Lévy flight parameter (1<λ≤3).Compute the fitness,FL, of the new nests and compare these fitness values with the fitness of the previous nests (Fi).For a minimization problem, ifFL<Fi,xiis replaced byxL.A fractionpaof the worst nests obtained after Step 4 are replaced by new nests (xn) using a random flight.Calculate the fitness of all the new nests.The best nestxpof the generation is updated.The best nest obtained until the current iteration,xb, is replaced byxp, if the fitness ofxp,Fpis less than the fitness ofxb,Fb(for a minimization problem).Repeat Steps 2–8 until stopping criteria is reached and returnxb.Fig. 2shows the search pattern in CSA for a generation. The dotted lines in the figure denotes the random motion discussed in Step 5 and the other lines represent Lévy flights. The complete flowchart of CSA is depicted in Fig. 3.Moreover, the success of CSA in solving optimization challenges has generated widespread interest amongst the scientific community. A multi-objective CSA has been reported in [27], in order to solve design optimization problems. CSA has been applied in diverse areas of engineering, advocating its effectiveness in addressing engineering challenges. An optimized adaptive noise canceler has been implemented using CSA in [28]. In the field of magnetics, [29] have formulated an improved multiobjective cuckoo search algorithm, for determining the Jiles–Atherton (J-A) parameters. CSA has also been applied for solving the non-convex economic dispatch problems [30].The IIR system identification problem discussed in Section 2 is formulated as a CSA based optimization problem in this section. The parameter vector of the IIR model, which needs to be estimated is represented by N nests in the search space. The nests are initially assigned random positions. The positions of the nests are updated using CSA in an endeavor to minimize the error in estimation of the IIR model. The complete schematic diagram of the proposed CSA based IIR system identification scheme is shown in Fig. 4. In the figure, x is the IIR system input, y is the IIR system output,[y1,y2,…,yN]are the outputs of the IIR models corresponding to the N nests andeifori=[1,2,…,N]denotes the error in modeling due to the ith nest.An extensive simulation study has been conducted to evaluate the performance of the CSA in identifying various IIR plants. The performance has been compared with that obtained by GA and PSO [31] schemes. Three sets of IIR plants, with orders varying from two to four, have been modeled in this study. The modeling has been performed by considering adaptive IIR filters of the same order as the models and a plant noise with a signal to noise ratio of 70 dB. Reduced order modeling was also considered. An additional experiment has been conducted where in an attempt has been made to model a fourth order plant with an eighth order model. The various simulation parameters employed in this study are described below. For PSO, the initial population size is taken as 100 and the acceleration parametersc1andc2are considered as 2. Bansal et al. [32] have studied various strategies for assigning inertia weights in a PSO algorithm. It has been reported that a linear variation of inertia weights results in minimum error in case of function approximation. Thus in this paper, the inertial weight,μp, has been linearly varied from 0.9 to 0.4 [33]. This also improves the searching methodology of the PSO algorithm [12]. For GA, the population size is 100, the crossover probability is 0.8 and the mutation probability is 0.05 [12]. In CSA, the initial number of nests is 100, λ is 2.5, step sizeα=1andpais 0.25. It has been reported that the convergence rate of CSA is not very sensitive to the initial parameters [15]. The number of iterations have been fixed as 200 for all the three algorithms considered. The comparison of performance in terms of accuracy of modeling has been done in this study using mean square error (MSE) as the metric. MSE, ξ, is defined as(5)ξ=1K∑k=0K−1[y(k)−yˆ(k)]2.In this experiment, a second order plant, with a transfer function(6)Hp(z)=[0.05−0.4z−11−1.1214z−1+0.25z−2]is considered. Efforts have been made to model this second order plant using a second order as well as a first order adaptive IIR model.In the first case, the second order plant defined above has been modeled using a second order model given by the transfer function(7)Hm(z)=[a0+a1z−11+b1z−1+b2z−2].The convergence of the three algorithms in identifying the second order plant has been compared in Fig. 5. CSA has been shown to identify the system more accurately than GA and PSO schemes. In addition, CSA converges to the global optimum values faster than GA and PSO. As evident from the convergence characteristics, CSA converges to its best fitness value in about 125 iterations. The average MSE, obtained after 200 iterations is 0.014420,6.196e−05and4.763e−08for GA, PSO and CSA respectively. The improved parameter identification capability of the CSA is also evident from the comparison of estimated model coefficients shown in Table 1. The comparison in terms of MSE, tabled in Table 2, also confirms the enhanced parameter identification ability of CSA.An attempt has been made to model the second order plant using a first order IIR filter model. The transfer function of the first order model is given by(8)Hm(z)=[a01+b1z−1],wherea0andb1are the parameters to be estimated. The convergence characteristics of the three algorithms compared is shown in Fig. 6. The faster initial convergence of CSA can be observed from the convergence characteristics. A statistical comparison has also been made in Table 3.A third order plant, with a transfer function(9)Hp(z)=[−0.2−0.4z−1+0.5z−21−0.6z−1+0.25z−2−0.2z−3]is modeled in this experiment to test the efficiency of the CSA.In this section, the third order plant defined above is modeled using a third order adaptive IIR filter model given by the transfer function(10)Hm(z)=[a0+a1z−1+a2z−21+b1z−1+b2z−2+b3z−3],wherea0,a1,a2,b1,b2andb3are the parameters to be estimated. The convergence characteristics of the three algorithms is shown in Fig. 7. From the figure, it can be observed that the minimum MSE obtained for CSA is approximately 20 dB lesser than the minimum MSE achieved by PSO. The faster convergence of CSA is also evident from the observations. The enhanced accuracy of the IIR models trained using CSA is clear from Table 4and Table 5. The average MSE, obtained after 200 iterations is 0.002404,7.204e−06and5.320e−08for GA, PSO and CSA respectively.The third order plant has been modeled using a second order adaptive IIR filter model in this section. The transfer function of the adaptive model is given by(11)Hm(z)=[a0+a1z−11+b1z−1+b2z−2],wherea0,a1,b1andb2are the parameters to be estimated. The convergence characteristics compared in Fig. 8shows the improved modeling ability of CSA over GA as well as PSO. The improved quality of the solutions obtained using CSA is reasserted by the statistical comparison of MSEs made in Table 6.The transfer function of the fourth order plant used in this experiment is given by(12)Hp(z)=[1−0.9z−1+0.81z−2−0.729z−31+0.04z−1+0.2775z−2−0.2101z−3+0.14z−4].The fourth order IIR plant defined above has been modeled using a fourth order adaptive IIR model in this section. The transfer function of the adaptive model is given by(13)Hm(z)=[a0+a1z−1+a2z−2+a3z−31+b1z−1+b2z−2+b3z−3+b4z−4],wherea0,a1,a2,a3,b1,b2,b3andb4are the adaptive parameters to be estimated. From the convergence characteristics shown in Fig. 9, it can be observed that GA and PSO converges to local minima. The average MSE, obtained after 200 iterations is 0.007343, 0.001033 and 0.000101 for GA, PSO and CSA respectively. The convergence characteristics also indicate faster convergence and lower MSE values for CSA compared to GA and PSO. The estimated parameter values are shown in Table 7. The improved modeling ability of CSA is also evident from the statistical comparison of MSE tabulated in Table 8.In this section, efforts have been put to model the fourth order plant using a reduced order (third order) model. The transfer function of the third order adaptive IIR filter model is given by(14)Hm(z)=[a0+a1z−1+a2z−21+b1z−1+b2z−2+b3z−3],wherea0,a1,a2,b1,b2andb3are the adaptive parameters to be estimated. The convergence characteristics for the reduced order modeling is shown in Fig. 10and a statistical comparison has been made in Table 9. Similar to that in other experiments, the ability of the CSA in achieving improved identification of IIR plants is evident from the results obtained.In an attempt to further validate the modeling capability of the proposed scheme, an excessive order modeling scenario is considered. The fourth order plant is being modeled using an eight order adaptive IIR model given by(15)Hm(z)=[a0+a1z−1+a2z−2+a3z−3+a4z−4+a5z−5+a6z−6+a7z−71+b1z−1+b2z−2+b3z−3+b4z−4+b5z−5+b6z−6+b7z−7+b8z−8],witha0,a1,…,a7andb0,b1,…,b8as the adaptive parameters to be estimated. An additional plant noise with an SNR of 40 dB has been assumed in this experiment and the improved convergence behavior of CSA based feedback system identification scheme is evident from the convergence characteristics shown in Fig. 11. The statistical comparisons are made in Table 10.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
The IIR system identification problem has been formulated as a CSA based optimization problem in this paper. The new system identification scheme has been employed for modeling a few benchmark IIR plants. The efficiency in parameter identification obtained using CSA has been compared with that obtained using GA and PSO. The improved identification capacity of CSA is evident from the experimental results reported in this paper. The improved identification accuracy can be attributed to the Lévy flight manoeuvre of the cuckoos in the search space. Even though the proposed scheme is adaptive, the method is not online and hence cannot be directly applied for identification of feedback systems in real time applications like active noise control. In addition, development of an appropriate online mechanism for selection of model order may further improve the identification accuracy of the proposed scheme.This work was supported by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India under the INSPIRE Faculty Award Scheme (IFA-13 ENG-45).
