@&#ABSTRACT@&#
Gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is based on law of gravity and the interaction between masses. In GSA, searcher agents are collection of masses and their interactions are based on Newtonian laws of gravity and motion. In this paper, to further improve the optimization performance of GSA, opposition-based learning is employed in opposition-based gravitational search algorithm (OGSA) for population initialization and also for generation jumping. In the present work, OGSA is applied for the solution of optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) of power systems. Traditionally, ORPD is defined as the minimization of active power transmission losses by controlling a number of control variables. ORPD is formulated as a non-linear constrained optimization problem with continuous and discrete variables. In this work, OGSA is used to find the settings of control variables such as generator voltages, tap positions of tap changing transformers and amount of reactive compensation to optimize certain objectives. The study is implemented on IEEE 30-, 57- and 118-bus test power systems with different objectives that reflect minimization of either active power loss or that of total voltage deviation or improvement of voltage stability index. The obtained results are compared to those yielded by the other evolutionary optimization techniques surfaced in the recent state-of-the-art literature including basic GSA. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach and show its effectiveness and robustness for solving ORPD problems of power systems.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In power systems, basic objective of optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) is to identify optimal setting of control variables which minimize the given objective function as either total transmission line loss (PLoss), or absolute value of total voltage deviation (TVD), or improvement of voltage stability index (VSI) while satisfying the unit and system constraints. This goal is accomplished by proper adjustment of reactive power variables like generator voltage magnitudes, transformer tap settings and switchable VAR sources [1].Several classical gradient-based optimization algorithms [2–6] have been applied to solve different ORPD problems of power systems. These techniques are, computationally, fast. However, conventional optimization techniques like lambda iteration method, linear programming, interior point method, reduced gradient method and Newton method rely heavily on the convexity assumption of generators’ cost functions and, usually, approximate these curves using quadratic or piecewise quadratic, monotonically increasing cost function [2,3]. These techniques have difficulties in handling problems with the nonconvex or discontinuous landscape and discrete variables. Ref. [7] may be referred for further discussion on these techniques. Hence, it becomes essential to develop optimization techniques that are capable of overcoming these drawbacks.In the past, computational intelligence-based techniques, such as genetic algorithm (GA) [8], improved GA [9], real parameter GA [10], adaptive GA [11], evolutionary programming (EP) [12], particle swarm optimization (PSO) [13], hybrid PSO [14], bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) [15], differential evolution (DE) [16–18], seeker optimization algorithm (SOA) [19], gravitational search algorithm (GSA) [20] etc have been applied for solving ORPD problem. These techniques have shown effectiveness in overcoming the disadvantages of classical algorithms. Specially, PSO and DE have received increased attention from researchers because of their novelty and searching capability. However, it does not mean that these techniques do not have any limitations. In solving complex multimodal problems, these methods may be easily trapped into local optima. Furthermore, their searching performance depends on the appropriate parameter settings [21]. Premature convergence and local stagnation are frequently observed in many applications [22].Rashedi et al. proposes gravitational search algorithm (GSA) in [23]. It is a heuristic evolutionary optimization algorithm based on the metaphor of gravitational interactions between masses. GSA is inspired by the theory of Newton that postulates every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.Tizhoosh introduced the concept of opposition-based learning (OBL) in [24]. The main idea behind OBL is simultaneous consideration of an estimate and its corresponding opposite estimate (i.e., guess and opposite guess) in order to achieve a better approximation for the current candidate solution. In the recent literature, the concept of opposite numbers has been utilized to speed up the convergence rate of an optimization algorithm such as opposition-based DE [25]. In opposition-based GSA (OGSA) [26], the same idea of opposite number is blended with GSA for population initialization and also for generating new population. Thus, GSA approach is based on the Newtonian physical law of gravity and law of motion while in OGSA the concept of OBL is employed for population initialization and also for generation jumping [27].In this work, OGSA is applied for the solution of ORPD problem of power systems. Three IEEE standard power systems like IEEE 30-, 57- and 118-bus power systems are adopted and the ORPD problem of these test power systems are solved with different objectives that reflect minimization of either PLossor that of TVD or improvement of VSI. Results obtained are compared to other computational intelligence-based meta-heurists surfaced in the recent state-of-the-art literature including basic GSA.The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, mathematical problem of ORPD is stated. In Section 3, OGSA is described. In Section 4, implementation of OGSA for ORPD problem is presented. In Section 5, simulation results are presented and discussed. Finally, conclusion of the present work is drawn in Section 6.Mathematical problem of the present work is either minimization ofPLossor that of TVD or improvement of VSI. These three objectives are described in the next three sub-sections followed by constraint handling mechanism for the ORPD problem.The objective of the reactive power optimization is to minimize the active power loss in the transmission network, which can be defined as follows [19](1)MinimizePLoss=fX1→,X2→=∑k∈NEgkVi2+Vj2-2ViVjcosθijsubject to(2)PGi-PDi=Vi∑j∈NiVj(Gijcosθij+Bijsinθij)i∈N0QGi-QDi=Vi∑j∈NiVj(Gijsinθij-Bijcosθij)i∈NPQVimin⩽Vi⩽Vimaxi∈NBTkmin⩽Tk⩽Tkmaxk∈NTQGimin⩽QGi⩽QGimaxi∈NGQCimin⩽QCi⩽QCimaxi∈NCSl⩽Slmaxl∈Nlwhere f(X→1,X→2) denotes the active power loss function of the transmission network;X→1is the control variable vector[VGTkQC.]T;X→2is the dependent variable vector; VGis the generator voltage vector (continuous) except the slack bus voltage; Tkis the transformer tap vector (integer); QCis the shunt capacitor/inductor vector (integer); VLis the load bus voltage vector; QGis the generator reactive power vector; k=(i,j), i∊NB, j∊Ni gkis the conductance of branch k; θijis the voltage angle difference between buses i and j;PGiis the injected active power at bus i;PDiis the demanded active power at bus i; Viis the voltage at bus i; Gijis the transfer conductance between bus i and j; Bijis the transfer susceptance between buses i and j;QGiis the injected reactive power at bus i;QDiis the demanded reactive power at bus i; NEis the of number of network branches; NPQis the of number of PQ buses; NBis the of number of total buses; Niis the set of numbers of buses adjacent to bus i (including bus i); N0 is the of number of total buses excluding slack bus; NCis the of number of possible reactive power source installation buses; NGis the of number of generator buses; NTis the of number of transformer branches; Slis the power flow in branch l; the superscripts “min” and “max” in (2) denote the corresponding lower and upper limits, respectively.Treating the bus voltage limits as constraints in ORPD often results in all the voltages toward their maximum limits after optimization, which means the power system lacks the required reserves to provide reactive power during contingencies. One of the effective ways to avoid this situation is to choose the minimization of the absolute deviations of all the actual bus voltages from their desired voltages as an objective function. Minimization of TVD of load buses can allow the improvement of voltage profile [1]. In this case, the power system operates more securely and there will be an increase in service quality. This objective function may be formulated as follows(3)MinimizeTVD=∑i∈NL|Vi-Viref|where NLis the number of load buses in the power system andVirefis the desired value of the voltage magnitude of the ith bus which is equal to 1.0 p.u.Voltage stability is the ability of a power system to maintain constantly acceptable bus voltage at each bus in the power systems under nominal operating conditions. A system experiences a state of voltage instability when the system is being subjected to a disturbance, or rise in load demand, or change in system configuration. Enhancing voltage stability may be achieved through minimizing the voltage stability indicator L-index values at every bus of the system and consequently the global power system L-index [16]. Voltage stability problem has a close relationship with the reactive power of the system. Voltage stability may be improved by minimizing the voltage stability indicator L-index. In order to enhance the voltage stability and move the system far from the voltage collapse point, improvement of the voltage stability margin is used as an objective for ORPD problem. The VSI objective may, mathematically, be expressed as:(4)L=min(Lmax)=min[max(Lk)]wherek=1,2,…,NLwhere Lkis the voltage stability indicator (L-index) of the kth node and may be formulated as [10]:(5)Lk=1-∑i∈NGFjiViVj∠αij+(δi-δj)where Fjiis the (i,j)th components of the sub matrix obtained by the partial inversion of YBusand is given by [16]:(6)Fji=-Yjj-1[Yji]where Yjjis the self-admittance of the jth bus; Yjiis the mutual admittance between the jth bus and the ith bus; αijis the phase angle of the term Fij; δi, δjare the phase angle of the ith and the jth bus voltages, respectively.It is worth mentioning that during the process of optimization, all the constraints are satisfied as explained below [1].(a)The load flow equality constraints are satisfied by power flow algorithm.The generator bus voltage (VGi), transformer tap setting (Tk) and switchable reactive power compensations (QCi) are optimization variables and these are self-restricted between their respective minimum and maximum values by the algorithm.The limits on active power generation at the slack bus (PGslack), load bus voltages (VLi), reactive power generation (QGi) and transmission line flow (Sli) are state variables. These are restricted by adding a penalty function to the objective function.GSA [23] is navigated by properly adjusting gravitational and inertial masses. In Physics, gravitation is the tendency of objects with mass to accelerate towards each other. In Newton’s law of gravity, each particle attracts every other particle with a force known as gravitational force. GSA is one of the newest heuristic algorithms that have been inspired by Newton’s law of gravity and motion.In GSA, agents are considered as objects and their performances are measured by their masses. All these objects attract each other by the gravity forces and these forces result a global movement of all the objects towards the objects with heavier masses [28]. Hence, masses cooperate using a direct form of communication through gravitational force. The heavier masses (which correspond to good solutions) move more slowly than the lighter ones. This guarantees exploitation step of the algorithm.To describe the GSA, consider a system with Npmasses in which position of the ith mass is defined as in (7)(7)Xi=(xi1,…,xid…,xin)fori=1,2,…,Npwherexidis position of the ith mass in the dth dimension and n is the dimension of the search space. Based on GSA, mass of each agent is calculated after computing current population’s fitness given in (8), (9)(8)mi(t)=fiti(t)-worst(t)best(t)-worst(t)(9)Mi(t)=mi(t)∑i=1Npmi(t)where Mi(t) and fiti(t) represent the mass and the fitness value of the agent i at t, respectively, and for a minimization problem worst(t) and best(t) are defined in (10), (11).(10)best(t)=mini∈{1,…,Np}fiti(t)(11)worst(t)=maxi∈{1,…,Np}fiti(t)Total forces applied on an agent from a set of heavier masses should be considered based on the law of gravity as stated in (12) which is followed by calculation of acceleration using the law of motion as presented in (13). Afterwards, next velocity of an agent, (as given in (14)), is calculated as a fraction of its current velocity added to its acceleration. Then, its next position may be calculated by using (15).(12)Fin(t)=∑j∈Kbest,j≠iNprandj×G(t)×Mi(t)×Mj(t)Rij(t)+ε×xjn(t)-xin(t)(13)ain(t)=Fin(t)Mi(t)=∑j∈Kbest,j≠iNprandj×G(t)×Mj(t)Rij(t)+ε×xjn(t)-xin(t)(14)vin(t+1)=randi×vin(t)+ain(t)(15)xin(t+1)=xin(t)+vin(t+1)In (13)–(15), randiand randjare two uniformly distributed random numbers in the interval [0,1], ɛ is a small value, Rij(t) is the Euclidean distance between two agents i and j (defined asRij(t)=‖xi(t),xj(t)‖2) and Kbest is the set of first K agents with the best fitness value and biggest mass which is a function of time (initialized to K0 at the beginning and decreases with time). Here, K0 is set to Np(total number of agents) and is decreased linearly to 1. In GSA, the gravitational constant (G) will take an initial value (G0), and it will be reduced with time as given in (16)(16)G(t)=G0×e-τiteritermaxwhere G0 is set to 100, τ is set to 10, iter and itermax are the current and the total number of iterations (the total age of the system), respectively. The steps of the GSA are depicted below.Steps of GSAStep 1Population-based initializationStep 2Fitness evaluation of the agentsStep 3Update Mi(t) based on (8), (9), best(t) based on (10)worst(t) based on (11) and G(t) based on (16) for i=1,2,…, NpStep 4Calculation of total forces in different directions by using (12)Step 5Calculation of acceleration by (13) and velocity by (14)Step 6Updating agents’ positions by (15)Step 7Check for the constraints of the problemStep 8Repeat steps 2 to 7 until a stopping criterion is metSince its inception in 2009, GSA is being hybridized by the researchers’ pool with an aim to have improved optimization performance. Refs. [29–31] may be recalled as just a few towards the attainment of this specific goal. Recently, GSA algorithm has captured much attention and has been, successfully, applied to solve a wide range of practical optimization problems such as edge detection [32,33], filter modeling [34], parameters identification of hydraulic turbine governing system [35], fuzzy controllers for servo systems [36], forecasting future oil demand [37], robust design of multimachine power system stabilizers [38], solution of ORPD [20] and so on.Evolutionary optimizations methods start with some initial solutions (initial population) and try to improve them toward some optimal solution(s). The process of searching terminates when some predefined criteria are satisfied. We, usually, start with random guesses in the absence of a priori information about the solution. The computation time, among others, is related to the distance of these initial guesses from the optimal solution. We may improve our chance of starting with a closer (fitter) solution by simultaneously checking the opposite solution[24,25]. By doing this, the fitter one (guess or opposite guess) may be chosen as an initial solution. In fact, according to the theory of probability, for 50% of the time, a guess is further away from the solution than its opposite guess. Therefore, starting with the closer of the two guesses (as judged by its fitness) has the potential to accelerate convergence. The same approach may be applied not only to the initial solutions but also continuously to each solution in the current population.Let y∊[L,U] be a real number. The opposite number is defined by (17)(17)y⌣=L+U-ySimilarly, this definition can be extended to higher dimensions [24,25] as stated in the next sub-section.LetY=(y11,…y1d…,y1n)be a point in n-dimensional space, where{y11,…y1d…,y1n}∈Rand yi∊[L,U]∀i∊{1,…,d,…,n}. The opposite pointY⌣=(Y⌣11,…Y⌣1d…Y⌣1n)is completely defined by its components as stated in (18).(18)y⌣i=L+U-yiNow, by employing the opposite point definition, the opposition-based optimization is defined in the next sub-section.LetY=(y11,…y1d…,y1n)be a point in n-dimensional space (i.e., a candidate solution). Assume f=(.) is a fitness function which is used to measure the candidate’s fitness. According to the definition of the opposite point,Y⌣=(y⌣11,…,y⌣1d,…,y⌣1n)is the opposite ofY=(y11,…,y1d,…,y1n)[24,25]. Now, iff(Y⌣)⩽f(Y)(for a minimization problem), then the point Y can be replaced withY⌣otherwise, we continue with Y. Hence, the point and its opposite point are evaluated simultaneously in order to continue with the fitter one.Similar to other population-based optimization algorithms, two main steps are distinguishable for GSA. These two are population initialization and producing new generations by adopting the principle of GSA. In the present work, the strategy of OBL [24,25] is incorporated in two steps. The original GSA is chosen as the parent algorithm and opposition-based ideas of [24,25] are embedded in it. Corresponding pseudo code of the proposed OGSA is presented below.Steps of OGSAStep 1Opposition-based population initialization.

The real-value position of the agent consists of three parts: generator voltages, transformer taps and shunt capacitors/inductors. The real-value position of the agents is changed into a mixed-variable vector which is used to calculate the objective function value of the problem based on Newton–Raphson power flow analysis [39]. The reactive power optimization based on OGSA may be described as follows.OGSA Algorithm for ORPD problemStep 1Read the parameters of power system and those of OGSA and specify the lower and upper limits of each variableStep 2Population-based initialization (P0)Step 3Opposition-based population initialization (OP0)Step 4Select Npfittest individuals from set of {P0,OP0} as initial population P0Step 5Fitness evaluation of the agents using the objective function of the problem based on the results of Newton–Raphson power flow analysis [39]Step 6Update Mi(t) based on (8), (9), best(t) based on (10), and worst(t) based on (11), and G(t) based on (16) for i=1,2,…,NpStep 7Calculation of the total forces in different directions by using (12)Step 8Calculation of acceleration by (13) and the velocity by (14)Step 9Updating agents’ positions by (15)Step 10Check for the constraints of the problemStep 11Opposition based generation jumpingStep 12Go to Step 5 until a stopping criterion is satisfiedIn the present work, OGSA is applied to IEEE 30-, 57- and 118-bus standard test power systems for the solution of ORPD problems. Description of these studied test systems is depicted in Table 1. The software is written in MATLAB 2008a computing environment and applied on a 2.63GHz Pentium IV personal computer with 3GB RAM. The value of G0 is set to 100 and τ is set to 10 [20]. The value of Jris selected as 0.3 (Explanation is given in Section 5.4). Number of fitness function evaluations (NFFEs) is set to 1000 for all the test cases. Discussions on simulation results of the present work are presented below. Results of interest are bold faced in the respective tables to indicate the optimization capability of the proposed OGSA algorithm. In this study, 30/100 test runs are performed for all the test cases to solve the ORPD problem and the best results are presented.IEEE 30-bus power system is taken as test system 1. Generator data, load data, line data, minimum and maximum limits for active power sources, bus voltages, tap settings and reactive power sources for this test system are taken from [20]. This test system has nineteen control variables and these are six generator voltage magnitudes (at the buses 1, 2, 5, 8, 11 and 13), four transformers with off-nominal tap ratio (at lines 6–9, 6–10, 4–12 and 28–27) and nine shunt VAR compensation devices (at buses 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24 and 29). The total system demand is 2.834 p.u. at 100 MVA base.The proposed approach is applied for minimization of PLossas one of the objective function. The obtained optimal values of control variables, as obtained from the proposed OGSA method, are given in Table 2. The results obtained by the proposed OGSA are compared to those reported in the literature like GSA [20], biogeography-based optimization (BBO) [40], DE [16], comprehensive learning PSO (CLPSO) [41], PSO [41] and self-adaptive real coded GA (SARGA) [42]. The obtained minimum PLossfrom the proposed approach is 4.4984MW. The value of PLossyielded by OGSA is less by 0.01591MW (i.e. 0.3524%) compared to GSA-based best results of 4.514310MW. Comparative GA-, PSO- and OGSA-based convergence profiles of PLoss(MW) for this test power system is presented in Fig. 1. From this figure it may be observed that the convergence profile of PLoss(MW) for the proposed OGSA-based approach for this test system is promising one. The computational times of the compared algorithms are also shown in Table 2. It may be seen from this table that the computing time of OGSA is less than other evolutionary meta-heuristics including the basic GSA reported in [20].The proposed OGSA-based approach is also applied for the minimization of TVD of this test power network. The results yielded by the proposed OGSA-based approach are presented in Table 3. The results obtained by the proposed OGSA are compared to those reported in the literature like GSA [20] and DE [16]. From this table, 5.37% improvement in TVD may be recorded by using the proposed OGSA-based algorithm as compared to GSA counterpart as reported in [20].

From this table, 10.11% improvement in voltage stability index may be recorded by using the proposed OGSA-based algorithm as compared to GSA reported in [20]. Comparative GA-, PSO- and OGSA-based convergence profiles of VSI for this test power system is presented in Fig. 3. From this figure it may be observed that the convergence profile of voltage stability index for the proposed OGSA-based approach for this test system is promising one.The standard IEEE 57-bus system consists of eighty transmission lines, seven generators (at the buses 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 12) and fifteen branches under load tap setting transformer branches is taken as test system 2. There reactive power sources are considered at buses 18, 25 and 53. Line data, bus data, variable limits and the initial values of the control variables are taken from [43,44]. The search space of this case system has twenty five dimensions, including seven generator voltages, fifteen transformer taps and three reactive power sources. The system loads are given as follows: PLoad=12.508 p.u., QLoad=3.364 p.u. The initial total generations and power losses are: PG=12.7926 p.u., QG=3.4545 p.u., PLoss=0.28462 p.u., QLoss=−1.2427 p.u. There are five bus voltages in p.u. outside the limits: V25=0.938, V30=0.920, V31=0.900, V32=0.926, V33=0.924.Table 4depicts the solution result for PLossminimization objective while the best reactive power dispatch solutions for this objective are tabulated in Table 4. In Table 4, OGSA based results are compared to other optimization technique recently reported in the literature like GSA [20]; nonlinear programming (NLP) [19]; canonical GA (CGA) [19]; adaptive GA (AGA) [19]; PSO with adaptive inertia weight (PSO-w) [19]; PSO with a constriction factor (PSO-cf) [19]; CLPSO [19]; a “real standard” version of PSO, called as SPSO-07 [19]; DEs with local search, instead of their corresponding original versions and denoted as L-DE [19], L-SACP-DE [19], L-SaDE [19]; SOA [19]; BBO [40]; BBO (after relaxing Q-limit of bus 2 and 9) [40]. From Table 4, it may be observed OGSA based results yield optimal value of PLossfor this power network. In [19], base case power loss for this test power network is reported as 0.28462 p.u. The% PSavein Table 5denotes the saving percent of the PLoss. Table 5 demonstrates that a power loss reduction of 17.68% (from 0.28462 p.u. to 0.2343 p.u.) is accomplished by using the proposed OGSA approach, which is the biggest reduction of power loss than that obtained by the other approaches. The total time of taken by the comparative algorithms are summarized in Table 6, which portrays the execution time taken by the proposed OGSA approach for this power network is the least one among the algorithms reported in this table.

From this figure it may be observed that the convergence profile of VSI for the proposed OGSA-based approach for this test system is promising one.To test the proposed technique in solving ORPD problems of larger power systems, a standard IEEE 118-bus test system is considered as test system 3 [43,45,46]. The search space of this case system has seventy seven dimensions, that is, the fifty four generator buses, sixty four load buses, one hundred eighty six transmission lines, nine transformer taps and fourteen reactive power sources. The system line data, bus data, variable limits and the initial values of control variables are given in [43,45]. The maximum and minimum limits of reactive power sources, bus voltage and tap-setting limits are taken from [20]. The system loads are given as follows: PLoad=42.4200 p.u., QLoad=14.3800 p.u. The initial total generations and power losses are as follows: PG=43.7536 p.u., QG=8.8192 p.u., PLoss=1.33357 p.u., QLoss=−7.8511 p.u.OGSA-based reactive power dispatch schedule for the test system of PLossminimization objective is presented in Table 9and the results obtained are compared to GSA [20], CLPSO [41] and PSO [41]. This table demonstrates that the OGSA yields optimal PLossas compared to other algorithms.Table 10shows the statistical comparison of results obtained by OGSA, GSA [20], CLPSO [41] and PSO [41] methods as regards to the objective function of minimizing PLossonly. From this table it is observed that execution time of OGSA is the least one among the reported algorithms. From this table it may also be noted that the standard deviation and median values are quite satisfactory for OGSA. Success rate of OGSA may also be found to be promising one. The results in this table clearly indicate the superiority of OGSA over either GSA or PSO or CLPSO.Fig. 7shows the variation of the PLoss(MW) against NFFEs for this test case for GA-, PSO- and OGSA-based approaches. Good convergence profile of OGSA may be noted from this figure by means of its ability to reach the near optimal solution.The best reactive power dispatch solutions as yielded by the proposed OGSA from 30 runs for TVD objective function minimization objective are tabulated in Table 11. Comparative GA-, PSO- and OGSA-based convergence profiles of TVD (p.u.) for this test power system is presented in Fig. 8. From this figure it may be observed that the convergence profile of TVD (p.u.) for the proposed OGSA-based approach for this test system is promising one.The best reactive power dispatch solutions as yielded by the proposed OGSA from 30 runs for VSI objective function minimization objective are tabulated in Table 12. Comparative GA-, PSO- and OGSA-based convergence profiles of VSI for this test power system is presented in Fig. 9. From this figure it may be observed that the convergence profile of voltage stability index for the proposed OGSA-based approach for this test system is promising one.The performance of any evolutionary algorithm largely depends on the right selection of its control parameters. The performance of the OGSA also depends on the selection of values of G0, τ and Jr. In the present work, a robustness study is carried out on IEEE 30-bus power system with transmission loss minimization objective. The known minimum solution for this problem from the literature is 4.514310MW [20]. Different sets of parameters are tried to find a result better than this one. The effects of parameters in OGSA are illustrated in Tables 13 and 14, where 100 random trial runs are performed for each parameter set. The value of NFFEs is set as 1000. Among the different set of parameters (like G0 and τ) for OGSA algorithm, Case 4 in Table 13 shows the best performance in terms of the highest number of hits to minimum solution. Thus, the values of G0 and τ are selected as 100 and 10, respectively. Similarly, Table 14 shows the best performance of the algorithm when the value of Jris selected as 0.3. Thus, these values of the parameters are subsequently selected for all the test cases of the current paper.
