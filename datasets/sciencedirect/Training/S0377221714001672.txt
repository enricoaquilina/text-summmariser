@&#ABSTRACT@&#
With modern data-acquisition equipment and on-line computers used during production, it is now common to monitor several correlated quality characteristics simultaneously in multivariate processes. Multivariate control charts (MCC) are important tools for monitoring multivariate processes. One difficulty encountered with multivariate control charts is the identification of the variable or group of variables that cause an out-of-control signal. Expert knowledge either in combination with wrapper-based supervised classifier or a pre-filter with wrapper are the standard approaches to detect the sources of out-of-control signal. However gathering expert knowledge in source identification is costly and may introduce human error. Individual univariate control charts (UCC) and decomposition ofT2statistics are also used in many cases simultaneously to identify the sources, but these either ignore the correlations between the sources or may take more time with the increase of dimensions. The aim of this paper is to develop a source identification approach that does not need any expert-knowledge and can detect out-of-control signal in less computational complexity. We propose, a hybrid wrapper–filter based source identification approach that hybridizes a Mutual Information (MI) based Maximum Relevance (MR) filter ranking heuristic with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based wrapper. The Artificial Neural Network Input Gain Measurement Approximation (ANNIGMA) has been combined with MR (MR-ANNIGMA) to utilize the knowledge about the intrinsic pattern of the quality characteristics computed by the filter for directing the wrapper search process. To compute optimal ANNIGMA score, we also propose a Global MR-ANNIGMA using non-functional relationship between variables which is independent of the derivative of the objective function and has a potential to overcome the local optimization problem of ANN training. The novelty of the proposed approaches is that they combine the advantages of both filter and wrapper approaches and do not require any expert knowledge about the sources of the out-of-control signals. Heuristic score based subset generation process also reduces the search space into polynomial growth which in turns reduces computational time. The proposed approaches were tested by exhaustive experiments using both simulated and real manufacturing data and compared to existing methods including independent filter, wrapper and Multivariate EWMA (MEWMA) methods. The results indicate that the proposed approaches can identify the sources of out-of-control signals more accurately than existing approaches.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Multivariate process control techniques were established by Hotelling in his paper Hotelling (1947). He introduced the problem of correlation between the quality characteristics of a process and devised the well-knownT2statistic to identify whether the whole process is out of control. Hotelling’sT2statistic is the optimal test statistic for detecting a general shift in the process mean vector for an individual multivariate observation. However, the technique has several practical drawbacks. Critically, when theT2statistic indicates that a process is out of control, it does not provide information on which variable or set of variables is out of control. Moreover, it is difficult to distinguish location shifts from scale shifts since theT2statistic is sensitive to both types of process changes.The difficulty of interpreting an out-of-control signal on a multivariate control chart has been discussed extensively Alt (1985), Doganaksoy, Faltin, and Tucker (1991), Murphy (1987), Pignatiello and Runger (1990), Lowry, Woodall, Champ, and Rigdon (1992) and Linderman, McKone-Sweet, and Anderson (2005) among others. When two or more correlated variables are monitored, use of a multivariate chart may cause signals at opposing times to the signals given by a set of univariate charts on the individual variables. This is because the control region for a multivariate chart on correlated variables is represented by a tilted elliptical region as opposed to the non-tilted square region obtained by the use of separate charts. In fact, the use of separate charts does not allow for the information concerning the correlation of the variables to be utilized. However, the combination of using a multivariate control chart for signalling purposes and then using separate charts for diagnostic purposes is often effective.Given an m-dimensional quality characteristics set of data, a fault detection and diagnosis subsystem in a multivariate process needs to find the optimal sources of fault for the out-of-control signals from the2msubsets of quality characteristics which is computationally expensive and exponential to the dimensions of characteristics set (Jackson & Morris, 1957). Moreover, the performance of the algorithms depends on its evaluation criterion and search strategies.Murphy (1987) proposed a method to identify the out-of-control variables based on discriminant analysis. He divided the complete set of variables into two subsets and then tried to determine which one caused an out-of-control signal. Alt (1985) proposed the use of the univariate t-statistic for ranking the variables most likely to have changed. Then, to further strengthen the belief that a certain variable has changed, they applied the Bonferroni-type interval. The obvious drawback of this method is that it only tells you which variable is most likely to have shifted, which is not conclusive. Also, this method does not allow the user to study the trends.Mason, Tracy, and Young (1995) showed that signal interpretation of theT2statistic is greatly aided if the corresponding value is partitioned into independent parts. The characteristic that is significantly contributing to the signal is more readily identified by decomposing theT2statistic into independent parts, each of which reflects the contribution of an individual variable. The drawback of this method is the extensive computation and its sensitivity to the number of variables. This approach reduces the search space from exponential toO(m2). However, for a large number of quality characteristics, search space still would be a cumulative factor for computational time.Many approaches have been suggested for identifying the variable or group of variables that causes the out-of-control signals. They can be grouped broadly into three main categories: (1) the wrapper model with expert knowledge (Chen & Wang, 2004; Chen & Wang, 2004; Francisco & Jos, 2010; Jianbo, Lifeng, & Xiaojun, 2009; Low, Hsu, & Yu, 2003; Zorriassatinea, Tannockb, & O’Brienb, 2003) (2) filter models with wrapper evaluation (Rodger, 2012; Sylvain, Teodor, & Abdessamad, 2008; Wang & Dub, 2000), and (3) statistical approaches (Francisco & Jos, 2010; Mason et al., 1995).Wrapper approach is one of the main approaches for fault diagnosis that uses a pre-determined induction algorithm where the performances of the algorithms are used as the evaluation criteria, see for example (Chen & Wang, 2004; Chen & Wang, 2004; Deborah, Christopherand, & Wolfe, 2006; Francisco & Jos, 2010; Jianbo et al., 2009; Lorton, douladirad, & Grail, 2013; Low et al., 2003; Wang, 2012; Zorriassatinea et al., 2003). The wrapper models use expert knowledge to build training pattern which is capable of identifying the sources of future out-of-control signals. The main disadvantage of these approaches is that they need expert inputs about the sources of out-of-control signals which may introduce human error. In addition, the wrapper models face huge computational overhead due to the use of the induction algorithm’s performance and subset generation process used in the wrapper search space. None of the above approaches use any heuristic score in subset generation process to reduce the search space for fault diagnosis in the multivariate processes.Outside the multivariate process control domain, wrapper approaches have also been used in many classification problems. Let us refer to few recent articles by Kohavi and John (1997), Puronnen, Tsymbal, and Skrypnik (2000), Huang, Z Cai, and Xu (2008), Hsu, Huang, and Schuschel (1999), Romero and Sopena (2008). In particular, Hsu et al. (1999) proposed a wrapper based heuristic in artificial neural network (ANN) known as Artificial Neural Network Input Gain Measurement Approximation (ANNIGMA) for a general classification problem. Hsu et al. (1999) demonstrated that a wrapper-based heuristic can improve search performance in a standard training environment of an ANN. However, the approach (Hsu et al., 1999) also needs expert-knowledge for ANN training and ignores the problem of standard training in ANN. The other approaches use different search strategies for subset generation based-on wrapper performance function which involves numerous call of wrapper re-training in a supervised experimental environment.Filter models are one of the computationally cheap models which have broadly been considered for many fault diagnosis problems, for example by Sylvain et al. (2008), Wang and Dub (2000), Jackson and Morris (1957). In contrast to wrapper models, filter models involve the implementation of a search algorithm by using different heuristics to the data set prior to its use for induction algorithm. Diverse heuristics have been reported in the literature, for example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by Jackson and Morris (1957) and Mutual Information by Wang and Dub (2000). Heuristics of filter models estimate the discrimination capabilities of the subsets of the quality characteristics which is followed by the ranking of the source characteristics based on the different search strategies and wrapper classifier. Filter approaches have also been applied in many other problems, for example, bankruptcy prediction, medical diagnosis Gene Selection, malware detection. Let us refer to few recent articles by Santos et al. (2010), Santos, Devesa, Brezo, Nieves, and Bringas (2012), Guo and Lyu (2006), Tsai (2009), Krier, Francois, Wertz, and Verleysen (2006), Ng and Chan (2005). In particular, Tsai (2009) provide a review of filter approaches and shows their comparative performances. Because filter models are independent from the induction algorithm, the selected quality characteristics subsets may result in poor fault diagnosis prediction accuracies. Principal components (Jackson & Morris, 1957) are not easily interpretable in many cases and do not have a one-to-one relation with the original variables. Nevertheless, in some cases, depending on the context, they can be very useful.Therefore there is a need for development of a procedure that can avoid the drawbacks of both filter and wrapper fault diagnosis approaches and can reduce the search space for better computational complexity for the detection of the source(s) of out-of-control signals. In this paper, we propose a hybrid wrapper–filter approach by injecting the filter’s ranking score in the wrapper approach. The objective is to find a suitable heuristics score for the wrapper stage that can improve the search space complexity and can find most significant compact set of the sources of out-of-control signals without any additional information other than control list for a multivariate quality control environment. We introduce a new heuristic score by hybridizing Mutual Information (MI) based Maximum Relevance (MR) filter ranking heuristics with the Artificial Neural Network Input Gain Measurement Approximation (ANNIGMA) wrapper heuristic (MR-ANNIGMA). The justification of hybridizing of the wrapper and filter score is provided later in Section 5.The novelty of our proposed approach is that it uses of a hybrid of wrapper and filter that utilizes the knowledge about the intrinsic pattern estimated by the filter in the wrapper search process and takes advantages of the complementary properties of both approaches. This type of hybrid approach is a new concept and to the best of our knowledge it has not been explored in the process control literature. The approach does not require any expert knowledge for detecting the out-of-control signals and is able to reduce the search space complexity by generating the subset of sources based on the hybrid score in the wrapper search.The standard training approaches of ANN may provide locally optimized estimation for the network parameters (Marco & Alberto, 1992) which may affect the wrapper score. An additional objective of the paper is to determine whether improvement in the training problem of ANN can find better ANNIGMA score and can improve overall performance in a fault-detection process of multivariate control environment. Different heuristic approaches were applied for training problem of neural network including evolutionary approaches (Garro, Sossa, & Vzquez, 2011) and swarm optimization (Gudise & Venayagamoorthy, 2003) approaches. Considering the computational complexity of evolutionary approach and wrapper training, we propose a derivative-free global optimization technique to estimate the optimal ANNIGMA score which is later hybridized with the filter score in the MR-ANNIGMA.This paper also deploys the MEWMA chart to monitor the multivariate data and compare the performance with the proposed approaches. The out-of-control signals are then investigated using univariate EWMA charts. Their performance is then compared with the proposed hybrid approaches in identifying the most significant variables for out-of-control signals.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next two section describe the theory of the univariate and multivariate EWMA chart and their applications in multivariate control processes. Section 4 describes standard filter and wrapper approaches for multivariate processes and Artificial Neural Network Input Gain Measurement Approximation (ANNIGMA). The proposed hybrid wrapper–filter source identification algorithm for out-of-control signals based on Maximum Relevance (MR) filter heuristics and ANNIGMA wrapper heuristic (MR-ANNIGMA) is described in Section 5. Section 6 presents a Global Optimization technique for optimal estimation of ANNIGMA and its use in the proposed hybrid approach. Experimental results and discussion are described in Sections 6 and 8. Conclusions of this study are presented in the last section.This chart was introduced by Worthham and Ringer (1971). The chart is effective for detecting small to moderate shifts and is very insensitive to normality assumptions; therefore it is an ideal chart for individual observations. It is proposed for applications such as chemical industries, financial and management control systems, particularly when the sample size is one. The chart can be used to control: an average (of a sample), an individual, a ratio or a proportion (of defects in the sample). In this chart, the older the observation the less weight it conveys. The plotted statistics are exponentially weighted moving average defined by:(1)Zi=λXi+(1-λ)Zi-1,0<λ⩽1,Z0=μ0whereλis a constant and the starting value (required with first sample ati=1) is the process target. In factziis a weighted average of all previous sample means,(2)Zi=λ∑j=0i-1(1-λ)jXi-j+(1-λ)iZ0and the variance ofZiis(3)σZi2=σ2λ2-λ[1-(1-λ)2i]when i increases(1-λ)2i→0, therefore,(4)σZi2=σ2λ2-λwhereσis the process standard deviation. The control limits for this charts are below:Upper Control Limit (UCL) is(5)UCL=μ0+Lσλ2-λ1-(1-λ)2iwhere L is a positive real number that defines the position of the control limits with respect to the central line. It is traditionally set at 3 to make the chart compatible to 3-sigmaX-barchart.Center Line isμ0and.Lower Control Limit (LCL) is(6)LCL=μ0-Lσλ2-λ1-(1-λ)2iTo simultaneously monitor m correlated quality characteristics, the multivariate EWMA (MEWMA) chart can be applied. Ignoring correlation between variables is the main weakness of the present practice of using independent univariate charts to track each of the m quality characteristics individually. The MEWMA introduced by Lowry et al. (1992) is a logical extension of the univariate EWMA. It is defined as follows:(7)Zi=λXi+(1-λ)Zi-1=0whereλ=diag(λ1,λ2,λ3,…,λm)and0<λ⩽1and 1 is the identity matrix. The quantity plotted on the control chart is(8)Ti2=ZíΣzi-1Ziwhere the covariance matrix is(9)Σzi=λ2-λ1-(1-λ)2iΣ>LThe upper control limit L is chosen to achieve a specified in-control limit andΣziis the covariance matrix ofZi. If there is no prior reason to weight past observation differently for the m quality characteristics being monitored thenλ1=λ2=λ3⋯=λm=λ.Σis the covariance matrix of training data which is collected when process is in-control. The upper control limit in this paper is produced by the statistical packageMINITAB-16based on Average Run Length(ARL)=200. Analogous to the situation in the univariate case, the MEWMA chart is equivalent toT2(or chi-square) chart ifλ=1.Filter approaches (Sylvain et al., 2008; Wang & Dub, 2000) use the MEWMA statistics and the quality characteristics as the training data. A subset generation process with empty or full quality characteristics set is used to generate the subsets. This is then followed by forward, backward or bi-directional searches. The generated subsets are evaluated using filter heuristics such as co-relation measure, Principal Component Analysis and Mutual Information (Sylvain et al., 2008; Wang & Dub, 2000). The search process stops on a user-defined stopping criteria based on the score and the number of optimal quality characteristics set. The final subset is justified further using a wrapper classification algorithm. Fig. 1provides the basic steps of this procedure. The selected most informative quality characteristics sets will be used for diagnosis purpose and fault classification.In the wrapper approach (Chen & Wang, 2004; Chen & Wang, 2004; Francisco & Jos, 2010; Jianbo et al., 2009; Low et al., 2003; Zorriassatinea et al., 2003) the data generated by the manufacturing systems are used to identify the out-of-control signals. An expert opinion is then made about an out-of-control source on the MEWMA classification. In many cases (Jian-bo & Li-feng, 2009), a wrapper classifier is trained using an out-of-control signal with known source(s) based on the user defined-criteria. These wrappers directly predict the source(s) of the out-of-control signal. However, limitations of these are obvious where expert knowledge may introduce human error and user-defined criteria may fail to cover all types of error. In the literature (Sylvain et al., 2008), wrapper with a pre-selection filter has been used for fault diagnosis. Different search strategies such as sequential backward elimination (SBE), sequential forward elimination (SFE) (Hsu et al., 1999) or bidirectional search approaches are used in the subset generation process. In the worst cases, growth of subset generation may increase in the order ofO(m2)toO(2m)as the dimension of data set m increases, see for example (Romero & Sopena, 2008). In most of the cases, the algorithm is trained repeatedly with the training data for each subset of quality characteristics. This makes the algorithms computationally very expensive. Comparisons of different search strategies have been made in Kolda, Lewis, and Torczon (2003). However, the subsets in the wrapper approach are evaluated by the predictive accuracies of the trained wrapper and therefore are more significant than those in the filter approach which only depend on quality characteristics redundancy or relevance. Fig. 2provides the basic steps of these procedures.Artificial Neural Network Input Gain Measurement Approximation (ANNIGMA) (Hsu et al., 1999) is a weight analysis based wrapper heuristic that ranks quality characteristics by relevance based on the weight associated with quality characteristic in a Neural Network based wrapper approach. The quality characteristics that are irrelevant or redundant will produce more error than the relevant quality characteristics. Therefore, during training, weights of noisy quality characteristics are controlled in such a way that they contribute to the output as minimally as possible. ANNIGMA is based on the above strategy of the training.For a two layer Neural Network (Fig. 3), ifi,jand k are the input, hidden and output layer and F is a logistic activation linear function of the first and second layers (10) then the output of the network is given in (11)(10)F(x)=1/(1+exp(-x))(11)Ok=∑jF∑iAi×Wij×W∼jkwhereWijandW∼jkare the network weights. Then the local gain can be defined as:(12)LGik=ΔOkΔAiAccording to Hsu et al. (1999), the local gain for ith input and kth output node can be written in terms of network weight as (13)(13)LGik=∑j|Wij×W∼jk|Then ANNINGMA score for ith quality characteristicsqiand kth node is defined as the local gain(LG)of kth output node normalized based on a unity scale as:(14)ANNIGMA(qik)=LGikmaxbLGbkwhereb=1,2,3,…,mand m=Total number of quality characteristics. In Hsu et al. (1999), C. Hsu, et al. tested ANNIGMA approaches for a classification problem given the expert-knowledge where ANNIGMA has been computed based on a standard training approach. However, Eq. (14) shows that ANNIGMA scores are dependent on network parameters. The standard training may suffer from the local optimization problem of training-objective function and may provide (Garro et al., 2011; Gudise & Venayagamoorthy, 2003) non-optimal values for parameters. Therefore, it is important to investigate whether a global approach for ANN training changes the ANNIGMA score that may affect the selection of final quality characteristics set and overall performance of our proposed hybrid fault detection algorithm.Filter approaches can extract knowledge of the intrinsic pattern from real quality characteristics data. However filter approaches do not use any performance criteria based on predictive accuracies. Subsequently, there is no guarantee that the final subset of quality characteristics makes a better prediction and would be the most informative subset for the out-of-control signal. In contrast, the wrapper approaches (Chen & Wang, 2004; Chen & Wang, 2004; Francisco & Jos, 2010; Jianbo et al., 2009; Low et al., 2003; Zorriassatinea et al., 2003) use a predetermined induction algorithm and different search strategies (Torczon, Pudil, Hatef, & Kittler, 1994) to find the most informative set of quality characteristics. Use of predictive-accuracy based evaluation criteria in the wrapper ensures optimal performance from the selected subset. However repeated execution of the induction algorithm (in the worst case exponential search space) in the search process incurs a high computational cost in the wrapper approach.In this paper, the proposed hybrid approaches introduce a filter heuristic in the wrapper stage that takes advantages of both approaches. Therefore it can find a more significant set of quality characteristics than either wrapper or filter alone. The idea behind this approach can be explained by the Venn-diagram (Fig. 4). If the two quality characteristics subsets (ACBF and ADBE) are separately ordered/ranked according to their score, then the common higher ranked subset (ACBD) is the most significant subset recommended by both algorithms. If the scores of both algorithms are normalized on the same scale and combined (summed), then the subsets with the higher combined scores provide the common higher ranked subsets. A Backward Elimination (BE) search strategy based on the combined score along with the wrapper evaluation criteria can determine the most significant sources of the out-of-control signals. The performance of the combined score can be affected by the performance of the incorporated filter for a particular wrapper approach in the hybrid. However, different filter approaches can be combined to find a suitable hybrid for a particular wrapper heuristic and vice versa. In this paper, we have combined filter heuristics mutual information based Maximum Relevance (MR) with Artificial Neural Network Input Gain Measurement Approximation (ANNIGMA) based wrapper. Here, we have focused on a Neural network based wrapper and filter heuristics. We will use other wrapper approaches in a future work. Fig. 5represents the different heuristics and steps of the proposed hybrid algorithm that are described in the following subsections.Relevant quality characteristics provide more information about the out-of-control signal than irrelevant quality characteristics. Therefore mutual information based maximum relevance (Wang, Bell, & Murtagh, 1999) is a suitable heuristic for selecting the most informative quality characteristics. If S is a set of quality characteristicsqiand class variable is c, the maximum relevance can be defined as:(15)Maximum Relevance(S,c)=1|S|∑qi∈SI(qi;c)Here c is the class and denotes whether a particular sample is in control or out-of-control.I(qi;c)is the mutual information betweenqiand class c which is defined as:(16)I(qi;c)=H(qi)-H(qi|c)H(qi)is the entropy ofqiwith the probability density function p. Ifqitakes discrete values from set of valuesV={v1,v2,v3,…,vl}, then,(17)H(qi)=-∑vl∈Vp(vl)log(p(vl))LetH(qi|c)be the conditional entropy betweenqiand c then,(18)H(qi|c)=-∑vl∈V∑cm∈Cp(vl,cm)log(p(cm|vl))where class variable c takes the discrete values from the setC={c1,c2,c3,…,cm}The proposed MR-ANNIGMA uses Artificial Neural Network as the classification algorithm in the wrapper stage. An n-fold cross-validation approach is used in MR-ANNIGMA to train the wrapper. In each fold we compute the ANNIGMA score for every quality characteristics. Then after training of all folds, the ANNIGMA score for ith quality characteristics and kth node is averaged as (by using (14)):(19)ANNIGMA(qik)average=1n∑fold=1nANNIGMA(qik)foldThe ANNIGMA score for ith quality characteristics(20)ANNIGMA(qi)=1K∑k=1KANNIGMA(qik)averagewhere K is the total number of output nodes of the network. When computing the combined score in the proposed ANNIGMA, the relevance of quality characteristics in the current subset is computed from the individual score which is scaled to the maximum individual relevance of the subset. Thus relevance of a quality characteristic in a subset in the hybrid approach is defined by(21)Relevance(qi)=I(qi;c)maxqi∈SI(qi;c)The combined score of the filter’s and wrapper’s heuristic in the proposed MR-ANNIGMA is computed by(22)Combined Score:MR_ANNIGMA(qi)=I(qi;c)maxqi∈SI(qi;c)+ANNIGMA(qi)Algorithm 1Hybrid Wrapper–Filter MR-ANNIGMA approach for Multivariate processesinput←D(q1,q2,…,qm)Training data withmquality characteristicsoutput←SBESTan optimal subset of quality characteristicsbegin1.

ReturnSBESTendThe hybrid approach uses a Backward Elimination (BE) search strategy to generate a subset of quality characteristics. Initially hybrid starts with the full set. Subset generation in BE is guided by the wrapper–filter hybrid heuristic score. The combined score computation follows the steps of Sections (5.2) and (5.3). When the number of quality characteristics in BE process is significantly reduced compared to the total, the filter score component is weighted less than the wrapper score as:(23)Combined Score:MR_ANNIGMA(qi)=u*I(qi;c)maxqi∈SI(qi;c)+u′*ANNIGMA(qi)where0⩽u,u′⩽1andu+u′=1.The proposed MR-ANNIGMA uses a single hidden layer Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) Network (Fig. 3) in the wrapper stage. An n-fold cross validation approach is applied in the training of the network. The evaluation criterion of quality characteristics subset is based on the average prediction accuracy over n-fold of the wrapper (MLP network). In Algorithm 1, (steps 1–11) computes the average accuracy over n-folds for the current subset of quality characteristics. (Steps 12–14) computes the hybrid score and ranks the quality characteristics based on their combined score. (Steps 15 and 16) generates new subset based on the quality characteristics ranking and keep the records of evaluated quality characteristics subsets and their respective accuracy. The BE processes in MR-ANNIGMA update MR, ANNIGMA and the combined score in every iteration. The combined score guides the subset generation. The BE continues until the number of quality characteristic in the current subset is reduced to one. The subset with highest accuracies or close to the highest accuracies with fewer quality characteristics is chosen as the final subset.The standard back propagation (BP) training algorithm for estimation of ANN parameters is a gradient-descent based method. One of the drawbacks of this algorithm is that it may get trapped in a local minimum (Marco & Alberto, 1992). Locally optimized network parameters can provide non-optimal values for ANNIGMA wrapper score which may affect MR-ANNIGMA combined score. Different approaches have been proposed for optimal estimation of ANN parameters including Genetic Algorithm (Dongkyu, Shingo, Kaoru, Kotaro, & Jinglu, 2008) and Particle Swarm Optimization (Jing-Ru, Jun, Tat-Ming, & Michael, 2007). In this paper, we propose a Global MR-ANNIGMA where a derivative-free global optimization based approach is used in combination with BP training for optimal estimation of ANN parameters and thereby optimal ANNIGMA score.Mammadov (2004), Mammadov, Rubinov, and Yerarwood (2005) proposed an Algorithm for Global Optimization Problems (AGOP) which is based on dynamical systems that are constructed using a non-functional relationship between two variables. AGOP is designed for solving unconstrained continuous optimization problems. It uses a line search mechanism where the descent direction is defined by a dynamical systems approach. AGOP can be applied to a wide range of functions, requiring only function evaluations to work. In particular it does not require gradient information and can be used to find minima of non-differentiable functions.Different versions of this approach have been implemented previously (Richter & Fettweis, 2012; Maroosi & Amiri, 2010). In this paper the proposed Global MR-ANNIGMA combines AGOP with each BE iteration of the MR-ANNIGMA for optimal estimation of ANNIGMA. In each BE iteration, we consider the objective function of BP training as the objective functionf:RN→Rfor AGOP and the network weight parameters as the input variables. These inputs are used to construct a box, sayB={(x1,x2,x3,…,xN)∈RN:ap⩽xp⩽bp,p=1,2,3,…,N}in which a global optimization procedure is performed. We must first be given a set of initial pointsΩ={x(t)∈B,t=1,2,3,…,T}that is constructed from the edge points of the box B. Suppose thatx∗∈Ωis the best of the points inΩ, that is,{f(x∗)⩾f(x):∀x∈Ω}. The setΩand the values of f at each of the points inΩis used to generate a dynamical system. This dynamical system determines a possible search direction v at the pointx∗. See for details (Mammadov, 2004; Mammadov et al., 2005). In the next step, a line search is performed as(24)xˆ(T+1)=x∗+α∗vwhere the stepα∗is calculated by taking small step sizeε>0as follows,(25)α∗=argmaxα{f(x∗+αv):α=kε,k=1,2,…;x∗+αv∈B}A local search aboutxˆ(T+1)is then carried out. This is done using a direct search method called local variation. This is an efficient local optimization technique that does not explicitly use derivatives and can be applied to a wide range of functions. A comprehensive survey of direct search methods can be found in Kolda et al. (2003). Lettingx(T+1)denote the optimal solution of this local search, the setΩis augmented to includex(T+1). Starting with this updated setΩ, the whole process can be repeated. The process is terminated when v is approximately 0 or a prescribed bound on the number of iterations is reached. The solution returned is the currentx∗, that is, the point inΩwith the highest objective function value. If objective function f is continuously differentiable then this solution will be local maxima.ANNIGMA is computed based on these final values of the weight parameters which has been used in the computation of hybrid scores in the MR-ANNIGMA by following the (steps-11 and 12) in Algorithm 1. Subset generation of quality characteristics follows the same procedure as Section 5.4. In each iteration of BE process, the quality characteristics with the lowest Global MR-ANNIGMA score is discarded from current set and a new subset is generated. Accuracy of the new subset is calculated and recorded. The process continues until the last quality characteristics is removed from theScurrentset in step-16 in Algorithm 1. The subset with the highest accuracy fromS0in Algorithm 1 is chosen as the best subset.The proposed hybrids MR-ANNIGMA and Global MR-ANNIGMA are tested using manufacturing data (Wang & Hubele, 1999). The real data set (Wang & Hubele, 1999) is from a manufacturing process with multivariate quality characteristics. It contains a sample of 100 parts that were tested on seven quality characteristics of interest to the manufacturer. The specification limits for these seven quality characteristics(q1,q2,q3,q4,q5,q6,q7)can be two-sided or one-sided, and they are0.100.04mm,0+0.50mm,115mm,0+0.2mm,0.550.06mm,0.070.05mmand0.070.05mm, forq1toq7respectively. The sample size is 1. Minitab statistical package is used to estimate the mean vectorμ0and the covariance matrix of the original data. The normality test on all the quality characteristics shows that onlyq2follows normal distribution. Johnson transformation is used to transform the six non-normal quality characteristics into normal.Minitab statistical package is used to generate three sets of multivariate normal samples of size 1. The first 400 multivariate samples are generated using the multivariate normal distribution and changing the mean vector of the original transformed data slightly but keeping the covariance matrix of the transformed original data. The second 100 multivariate samples are generated by creating the largest shift in the mean vector of the original transformed data. The last set of 100 multivariate samples has medium shift in the mean vector (the shift is between the first and second sets). Therefore all of the generated samples have shift in the mean and are refereed to as potential out-of-control data. The mean vectors for the original transformed data, the first 400, second and third 100 simulated data and the covariance matrix are:μ1μ2μ3μ4=0.060.10.50.40.082650.090.20.17-0.096-0.1-0.25-0.30.0270.080.230.180.01020.030.20.150.01420.0180.30.250.004-0.1-0.3-0.4The covariance matrix based on the original data,Σis as below:Σ=1.028650.0056293-0.061810.038360.2338840.0244320.032320.005630.00111610.001370.016300.011601-0.001445-0.00228-0.061810.00136591.075440.04219-0.0185420.1137740.016800.038360.01630390.042191.010830.058532-0.0251180.050780.233880.0116008-0.018540.058530.9240290.056395-0.090930.02443-0.00144450.11377-0.025120.0563950.9378730.573310.03232-0.00228040.016800.05078-0.0909330.5733121.03071The target mean vector and the Covariance matrix for the multivariate EWMA chart are estimated by the statistical package R based on all the 600 simulated samples.μ0=0.13310.12245-0.18700.1951-0.00790.1389-0.0945The covariance matrix based on the simulated data,Σ0=is as below:Σ0=1.139830.0120927-0.089680.026210.2713860.020041-0.013350.012090.0029530-0.001460.017770.0131070.001898-0.00938-0.08968-0.00146411.198410.09772-0.0804720.1573460.057620.026210.01777500.097721.038780.109970-0.036911-0.002910.271390.0131070-0.080470.109970.9561710.038714-0.134620.020040.00189780.15735-0.036910.0387140.9115810.55474-0.01335-0.00937990.05762-0.00291-0.1346250.5547411.07881CAIM (Kurgan, 2004) discretization technique is used for continuous attributes while computing filter score. A single hidden layer neural network with five hidden layer nodes is used for the wrapper. The proposed approaches is compared with independent filter and wrapper. ANNIGMA, MR, MR-ANNIGMA and Global MR-ANNIGMA were tested using 5-fold cross validation and are executed for 3-trials. In the BE process,2/3of the iterations uses(u=u′=1)and the last1/3of the iterations uses(u=0.3,u′=0.7). The average accuracies from 3 trials were considered for the assessment of the final accuracies and are given in Table 1.As shown in Table 1, the wrapper approach (ANNIGMA) achieves an accuracy of(66.9%)based on all quality characteristics while the filter-MR achieves accuracy(66.830%). The hybrid process (MR-ANNIGMA) starts with 7 quality characteristics and indicates that the 5th quality characteristic has the lowest score for both ANNIGMA and MR (Fig. 6(a)). Therefore, the hybrid eliminates the 5th quality characteristic after the first cycle. In the next cycle of BE (Fig. 6(b)) the hybrid re-computes all scores and shows that the 3rd quality characteristic attains the lowest score for ANNIGMA, the 4th quality characteristic attains the lowest score for MR and the first quality characteristic has the lowest combined score. Therefore the hybrid eliminates characteristic-1 in this cycle and achieves an accuracy of67.933%. The hybrid (MR-ANNIGMA) continues the iterations of BE process. The subset generation at different stages have been described in (Fig. 6(a)–(e)). The MR-ANNIGMA achieves the highest accuracy(72.533%)with two quality characteristics (2 and 4) which is higher than the final accuracies of ANNIGMA with four quality characteristics (2, 4, 6 and 7) and MR with two quality characteristics (2 and 7). The Global MR-ANNIGMA achieves an accuracy of67.167%based on all the seven quality characteristics, where the 6th quality characteristic provides the lowest ANNIGMA score and the 5th quality characteristic provides the lowest MR score. The Hybrid Global MR-ANNIGMA achieves the lowest score for the 5th quality characteristic. Therefore, the Global MR-ANNIGMA discards the 5th quality characteristic in the next BE iteration. Accuracies for different iteration of BE process for the Global MR-ANNIGMA has been given in Table 1. Different score computation and subset generation for the Global MR-ANNIGMA is depicted in (Fig. 6(f)–(h)). The Global MR-ANNIGMA achieves the highest accuracies of78.667%with two quality characteristics (2 and 4). Therefore, these two quality characteristics are considered as the sources of the out-of-control signal (s). The results indicate that both ANNIGMA and Global ANNIGMA finds the same final set of quality characteristics, however, application of global approach in Global MR-ANNIGMA improves the performance of fault-detection approach compared to individual ANNIGMA.The Mulivariate EWMA (MEWMA) chart is also computed to monitor the 600 multivarite samples. The parameters for MEWMA are;r=0.2,ARL=200and the control limits are set by R-package using Chi-Square Distribution. The MEWMA produced 325 out-of-control signals which are presented in Fig. 7. Recall that the last 200 samples have been generated to have significant increased (decreased) shift in the mean, therefore should be picked up as out control samples by the MEWMA chart. Fig. 7 shows that the last 200 samples and some of the first 400 samples have been picked up by the MEWMA control chart. We have then computed univariate EWMA chart to identify the source variables with the maximum influence on the MEWMA out-of-control signals. The parameters of the univariate EWMA charts are similar to the MEWMA chart, i.e.,weightλ=0.2,ARL=200and control limits at±2σ. The mean vector and covariance matrix are estimated by the statistical package. The individual EWMA chart forq2gives 505 out-of-control signals and 95 in-control signals. Out of the 505, out-of-controls, 312 are correctly matched with the out-of-control signals produced by MEWMA chart. Out of the 95 in-control signals, 82 match the in-control signals produced by MEWMA chart. This provides an accuracy of65.66%byq2. The EWMA forq2is given in Fig. 8. The out-of-control signals produced by other quality characteristics are: (1)q1provides 24 samples as out-of-control which are presented in Fig. 9, (2)q3provides 15 samples as out-of-control which are presented in Fig. 10, (3)q4provides 21 samples as out-of-control which are presented in Fig. 11, (4)q5,q6andq7show 22, 28 and 27 samples as out-of-control respectively. Therefore we can conclude thatq2has more influences on the out-of-control signals produced by the Multivariate chart. The MEWMA chart forq2andq4(Fig. 12) gives 406 out of control signals and 194 in-control signals. Out of the 406 out-of-control signals, 302 match the out-of-control signals produced by MEWMA chart based on all 7 characteristics. Out of the 194 in-control signals, 171 match the in-control signals produced by MEWMA chart based on all 7 characteristics. This provides an accuracy of78.83%by MEWMA based on only two characteristics (q2andq4). The above results summarizes that using individual EWMA chart based onq2only can detect the source of out-of-control signals by the accuracy of65.66%. However using the MEWMA chart based on characteristicsq2andq4would lead to accuracy of78.83%. In general a large number of quality characteristics with m dimensions, requires2msubset evaluation which is exponential time complexity. Our proposed algorithms can easily find the best subset of quality characteristics and overcomes drawbacks of the traditional EWMA based source detection approaches in polynomial time, because we need only m subset evaluation instead of2m.In this paper we consider a maximum-relevance filter with an ANNIGMA wrapper and a global-ANNIGMA wrapper. However, choice of filter may affect overall performances of the hybrid. Therefore, a suitable filter can be selected by using different filters with the wrapper and then evaluating them using the wrapper evaluation approach. Contrariwise, an improved approach can be applied to select a better filter by using the statistical goodness of fit criteria such as chi-square measure (Greene William, 2003), Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) (Akaike, 1973) without the wrapper evaluation. We consider these approaches of model selection for filter as a future work.The hybrid algorithms run a backward elimination (BE) process where each iteration involves the computational time in training the network, the computation of MR, ANNIGMA and hybrid scores. At the beginning, when all characteristics are used, the time for training and computing scores (MR, ANNIGMA, and hybrid) will be the highest. Subsequent computation for aforementioned scores will take less time. Considering the initial computational cost as a constant-maximum value including the cost for n-fold cross-validation, the rest of the wrapper search process in the BE iteration for MR, ANNIGMA and MR-ANNIGMA depends on the number BE iteration. For our proposed hybrid approach, number BE iteration is equal to the dimensions of the quality characteristics set as mentioned in the Algorithm 1. Therefore hybrid MR-ANNIGMA generates(m-1)subsets of features which demonstrates a search space complexity of a linear-function of the dimensions of the set of quality characteristics. Thus hybrid approach reduces the search space complexity. This also shows that the hybrid approach has linear computational time complexity which is a function of the dimensions of the set of quality characteristics. The experimental platform was 3.2-gigahertz Intel Core Duo CPU with 2gigabyte of RAM. The computational time for MR, ANNIGMA and MR-ANNIGMA are (0.1134, 0.1415 and 0.1705hours). MR-ANNIGMA takes longer time than either MR or ANNIGMA. However, Global MR-ANNIGMA takes longer time which is ten times higher than other approaches. This is due to the global search process in each trial of the algorithm for optimization of the network objective function. We applied other global optimization algorithm including evolutionary approach. However evolutionary approach could not achieve a better solution than MR-ANNIGMA within 24hour. Global MR-ANNIGMA produces higher accuracies than MR-ANNIGMA. One can introduce a parallel version of Global MR-ANNIGMA to reduce the computational time.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Traditional methods of detecting the sources of out-of-control signals for multivariate data sets use expert knowledge either in combination with wrapper-based supervised classifier (or a pre-filter filter with wrapper) or the simultaneous use of the individual univariate control charts (UCC). However gathering expert knowledge in source identification is not only computationally costly but may introduce human error. This may also pose exponential growth of search space in the worst case. This paper proposes novel hybrids of wrapper and filter approaches for detecting the source of the out-of-control signals in multivariate process control problems.The proposed method injects the filter’s ranking score in the wrapper stage to utilize the knowledge about the intrinsic characteristics of the quality control data during wrapper identification process. The novelty of our approaches is that it integrates knowledge (from the intrinsic characteristics of data) obtained by the filter approach into the wrapper approach and combines the wrapper’s heuristic score with the filter’s ranking score in the wrapper stage of the hybrid. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is new. The proposed hybrids combine a Maximum Relevance (MR) filter ranking heuristic with ANNIGMA (MR-ANNIGMA). The combined heuristics in the hybrids take the advantages of the complementary properties of both filter and wrapper heuristics and guide the wrapper to find a compact subsets of the sources of out-of-control signals. It also reduces the search space complexity to linear function of the dimension of the quality characteristics set. Our numerical results show that the highest ranked source quality characteristics set under the proposed hybrid algorithm (MR-ANNIGMA) achieves higher accuracies with a smaller source characteristics sets than both filter and wrapper approaches. We also formulated a Global MR-ANNIGMA to compute optimal ANNIGMA score in the hybrid. The results clearly indicate that the Global MR-ANNIGMA outperforms all other algorithms including a standard UCC approach. Experimental results on industrial data set clearly demonstrate that proposed approaches are capable of selecting the best significant subset and can easily be applied in industrial quality control applications.
