We model the costs and benefits of delayed product customization with supplier delivery performance.The optimal position of the customization point depends on the boundary of the supplier delivery window.The choice of the service level at the customization point affects the total operating cost.Keeping the boundary of the delivery window fixed will decrease the customization point.A non-constant service level impacts the customization point.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The concept of delayed product differentiation has received considerable attention in the research literature in recent years. However, few analytical models explain and quantify the benefits of delayed product differentiation strategy with additional consideration of supplier delivery performance. This paper proposes a delayed product differentiation model in which a supply of raw materials is integrated at the beginning of the production process to match uncertain demand in a cost-effective way given the constraint of lead time delivery window. It develops insights regarding a delayed product differentiation strategy and shows that with respect to delivery windows, supplier delivery performance plays an important role in the determination of the optimal point of differentiation. This study also shows that when the “on-time” and the “late” portions of the delivery window are constant, the proposed cost function coincides with similar models found in the literature. An extension of this work also reveals that when the customer service level varies across various production stages, its choice affects the decision to delay or postpone the customization point. A mini industrial case involving the customization of a personal desktop computer is used to illustrate the applicability of the resulting framework.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
With increasing customization needs, the ability to accurately forecast customer demand for different products, to provide high customer service while maintaining low inventories has emerged as an issue of concern for top management in today's global market (Chase, Aquilano, & Jacobs, 1998). Faced with expanding product variety due to increasing demand for customized products, most companies struggle to offer products of top quality, to manage costs and effectively compete. Product customization calls for an elaborate strategy to face some of these challenges and it can be realized by one of the practical methods, namely delayed product differentiation (also known as form postponement) (da Cunha, Agard, & Kusiak, 2007). According to Lee and Tang (1998), product differentiation is the split of products into separate items when components with different technical specifications are created, multiple end products with diverse functionalities are created, a product is packaged in different ways, or the exact same item is stored in different geographical locations. In this paper, we focus on the application of form postponement in product customization, or “delayed product customization,’’ which relies on delaying as much as possible the point where a work-in-process inventory is committed to a particular end-product.Form postponement has grown in popularity among supply chain practitioners and presents a number of benefits during product customization. For example: it attempts to reduce the risks associated with product variety by exploiting the commonality between items and by designing the production and distribution processes to delay the point of differentiation (Anand & Girota, 2007; Granot & Yin, 2008; Lee, 1996; Ma, Wang, & Liming, 2002; Ngniatedema, 2010, 2012). It also provides the flexibility for holding the right inventory at the right place and in the right form, therefore enabling a company to minimize supply chain risks and to respond more quickly to market demand while lowering inventory costs (Aviv & Federgruen, 2001; Christopher, Christopher, & Hanna, 2007; Garg & Tang, 1997; Lee & Tang, 1997; Nair, 2005; Ngniatedema & Chakravarthy, 2013; Sánchez & Pérez, 2005; Shao & Ji, 2008; Yang, Burns, & Backhouse, 2004).Lee and Tang (1997) proposed a delayed differentiation model for a production process in which two products can be manufactured in a series of N discrete stages and inventories can be stored in a buffer following each operation. The processes from the first to the kth stage are defined as the common production processes, whereas those from the (k + 1)th to end stages are called differentiated production processes for each individual product. The point k, also known as differentiation point, is assumed to be the point of last common operation after which the products are differentiated. An increase in the value of k implies that the postponement timing is deferred in the entire production process.However, their model, useful for analyzing the costs and benefits of delayed product differentiation, has a common major weakness in that it fails to address the possible risks associated with the supply of raw materials at the beginning of the production process. Ignoring such factors during postponement implementation can lead to considerable sunk costs and hence should be treated cautiously.In this article, we complement Lee and Tang's (1997) deficiency by incorporating the delivery of components from an external supplier at the beginning of the production network. This additional consideration is depicted in Fig. 1 with the point “0” designed to hold inventory of incoming components. We then introduce the following two random variables: (1) the quantity of raw materials received from the supplier prior to the start of the production process and, (2) the lead time delivery window, respectively. Our study also goes beyond Lee and Tang's (1997) decoupling assumption of using constant customer service levels at different production stages to examine the effect of non-constant service levels on postponement decisions.Building from previous modeling approaches, (e.g. Guiffrida & Nagi, 2006), we use the following notations at the point “0” of the production network: c1 represents the earliest acceptable delivery date, c2 represents the latest acceptable delivery date of components ordered from an external supplier, and the difference c2 − c1 representing the difference between the earliest acceptable delivery date and the latest acceptable delivery date is known as “delivery window.” This delivery window, specified by a contractual agreement between the manufacturer and the supplier, reflects the case in which a manufacturer is given a fixed due date at the moment where an order is placed. It also defines the benchmark provided by the manufacturer and it is used as criterion to classify deliveries as being early, on-time, or late. The former specifies a delivery range through c1 and c2, whereas the later also maintains or promises a delivery range through an early delivery date “a” and a late delivery date “b”, respectively. Fig. 2depicts a simplified example of a normally distributed delivery window with the parameters a; b; c1 and c2 (Guiffrida & Nagi, 2006). Ideally, the manager would like a scenario where c2 − c1 = 0 for economic reasons. However, when c2 − c1 > 0, this difference can be measured in hours, days, or weeks depending on each industry case. According to these authors, a delivery lead time consists of the internal manufacturing lead time(s) of the supplier plus the external lead time associated with transporting the delivery of raw materials from the supplier to manufacturer.Under these considerations, we contribute to the literature by introducing two additional costs components which are likely to impact the total customization cost. The first cost results from the buffer inventory coming from the supplier side, whereas the second one results from the impact of supplier reliability with respect to the firm's specification of delivery timeliness. Technically speaking, we introduce two important random variables to the delayed differentiation framework during a postponement scenario: (i) the quantity of raw materials coming from the supply side to match customer demand and (ii) the supplier lead time that follows a general distribution, thus complementing the literature on supplier lead time delivery performance with respect to the on-time delivery window (Guiffrida & Nagi, 2006). We also examine a special case where the supplier lead time is normally distributed and important conclusions are derived. According to (Guiffrida & Nagi, 2006), “delivery performance” refers to delivery timeliness to the final customer in a serial supply chain that is operating under a centralized management structure. In the remainder of this paper, delivery performance refers to the delivery timeliness of raw materials to the point “0” of Fig. 1 introduced in Kadje (2012).The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present Lee and Tang's (1997) model in the context of product customization and we recall Guiffrida and Nagi's (2006) model on lead time delivery performance with respect to the delivery window. We then highlight some shortcomings in these two streams of research followed by our new modeling assumptions and the new average total cost function for delayed product differentiation. Section 3 contains the analytical study of the proposed cost function in product customization scenarios. In Section 4, the model is illustrated using an industry example involving the customization of a personal desktop computer, whereas Section 5 contains some concluding remarks. The proofs of important findings can be found inAppendix A.In the following section, we extend Lee and Tang's (1997) delayed differentiation model to integrate the delivery of raw materials from an external supplier at the beginning of the production network, and incorporate a supplier lead time delivery window on the expanded model.Lee and Tang's (1997) model can be described using the following notations. Let Sibe the average investment cost per period if operation stage i is a common production process, that is, Si= 0 if i > k. This component reflects the situation in which the total investment cost for the supply chain operation is amortized over the time horizon or period of t units. The inventory maintenance cost, the unit production cost, and lead time for operation i are denoted by hi(k), pi(k) and ni(k) respectively, where k represents the last common operation.Under the assumption that the customer demand Dj(j = 1, 2) is normally distributed with mean μjand standard deviation σj, the safety factor at the inventory buffer of operation i is denoted by z, a variable used to measure the number of standard deviation from the mean as well as the service level of the operation. The authors assumed an identical service level at each buffer inventory and that there is no change in the demand during the period of study (from the beginning of the process to the end of the process). Using the order-up-to level inventory policy assumption, the average WIP inventory is equal to nj(k)μj, and the average buffer inventory for operation i is equal toμj/2+zσjni(k)+1. The customer demand for both products is assumed to be correlated with correlation coefficient denoted by σ12 and used for the standard deviation of the components demand prior to the differentiation point k where standard components are used for product 1 and product 2. Therefore, the total operational cost of the model proposed by Lee and Tang (1997) is(1)Z(k)=∑i=1kSi+∑i=1Npi(k)(μ1+μ2)+∑i=1Nhi(k)[ni(k)(μ1+μ2)]+∑i=1khi(k)[(μ1+μ2)/2+zσ12ni(k)+1]+∑i=k+1Nhi(k)[(μ1+μ2)/2+z(σ1+σ2)ni(k)+1In the following, we make new modeling assumptions related to the quantity Q of raw materials ordered from the supplier as well as to the cost-based performance metric.We assume that the system operates in a context in which product differentiation remains forecast-driven (Forza, Salvador, & Trentin, 2008; Jewkes & Alfa, 2009; Reimann, 2012) and, therefore, takes place before customer demand materializes. The raw materials are ordered from an external supplier for product customization. K represents the penalty cost per time unit late from the supplier and h0 represents the inventory maintenance cost per unit of product per unit of time at the initial inventory stocking point (point 0 of Fig. 1). Therefore, we assume for this study that a functional relationship exists between the quantity Q of raw materials ordered from the supplier and the customer demand D1 and D2 respectively. In particular, we assume that Q is a linear combination of D1 and D2, that is, Q = a1D1 + a2D2, where a1 and a2 are constant.ThusQ¯=a1μ1+a2μ2and σQ= (a1σ1)2 + (a2σ2)2 + 2ρ(a1σ1)(a2σ2) are its expected value and its standard deviation respectively.We assume that a continuous review inventory policy is in effect at the point “0” of Fig. 1 to enable a company to respond more quickly to market demand. In this case, an order can be placed to the supplier as soon as the inventory level drops below a predetermined reorder point set by the manufacturer. Because the supplier lead time and the quantity Q to be ordered are both random variables, the average buffer inventory cost G0 from supply side at point 0 of Fig. 1 is given by:G0=h0[Q¯μ+zμ(σQ)2+(Q¯)2(σ)2], (Silver & Peterson, 1979), where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of delivery lead time respectively.Therefore the first additional cost to Lee and Tang's cost model resulting from the buffer inventory from the supplier side at the beginning of the production process is(2)G0=h0(a1μ1+a2μ2)μ+zh0×μ((a1σ1)2+(a2σ2)2+2ρ(a1σ1)(a2σ2))+σ2(a1μ1+a2μ2)2This function is free of k because μ, σ, and h0 are free of k.We evaluate the supplier delivery performance within our model using the supplier delivery windows. The literature uses penalty cost based models to evaluate the supplier delivery performance. These models analyze delivery timeliness to the final customer with regard to the customer's specification of an on-time delivery window by translating the probability of untimely delivery into expected cost measures. The modeling approaches differ in the type of distribution chosen for the supplier delivery window.One stream of research assumes that the supplier delivery window follows a special distribution: the case of normally distributed delivery window can be found in Guiffrida and Nagi (2006), and the case of Gamma distribution can be found in Bushuev, Guiffrida, and Shanker (2011). On another modeling approach, Bushuev and Guiffrida (2012) examine the optimal positioning of delivery window when the distribution of the supplier delivery window has a closed form. We contribute to this literature by introducing a delivery window that follows a general random distribution.Historically, conditional expectation approaches are used in the supplier delivery window literature for modeling supplier performance metrics. A careful analysis of these stream of research shows that the proposed cost-based performance metrics can be broken down in three cost components: (i) the holding costs due to early deliveries and which contribute to excess inventory, (ii) the production stoppages costs due to late deliveries, and (iii) a zero cost for delivery within the delivery window. A major weakness emerging from these studies is the lack of consideration of the likelihood of raw materials delivery outside or inside the agree upon delivery window. Therefore, the cost models presented in past studies do not account for important supply risks, approaches which can lead to possible inaccurate conclusions. When the delayed differentiation strategy is used in a product customization scenario, knowledge of the likelihood of supply risks is important for planning purposes. To this end, we contribute to the literature by proposing a simple, yet pragmatic framework based on Probability Theory and using the expected value concept to develop a cost-based performance metric related to a supplier delivery window.Lastly, we model both the latest acceptable delivery date c2 and the earliest acceptable delivery date c1 of incoming raw materials from the supplier as functions of the differentiation point k (i.e. c1 = c1(k)andc2 = c2(k)). We posit that k is likely to shift due early or late postponement decisions based on the nature of the customer demand. In addition, because our model considers an initial inventory point (point “0” of Fig. 1) for stocking raw materials common to both products, the manufacturer starts the production with these components and places an order to the supplier for components required during individual product customization (following the differentiation point k) as well as common components to anticipate for unexpected demand. As the value of k gets closer to the end products (i.e. closer to N − 1), the manufacturer is likely to increase the boundary values of the delivery window so that components required for each individual product customization are received closer k.In this study, the delivery time for Q, or the elapsed time from the receipt of an order by the supplier to the receipt of the delivery by the manufacturer, is represented by a continuous random variable X with mean μ, standard deviation σ, a probability density function (pdf) fXand a cumulative distribution function (CDF) FXdefined over the closed interval [a; b]. By setting ϕ the pdf of the variableX−μσandΦits CDF, we see that the mean ofX−μσis 0 and its standard deviation is 1.A supplier delivery is considered: (i) early when: X < c1, (ii) on time when: c1 ≤ X ≤ c2; and (iii) late when: c2 < X. To capture the time in which the supplier is early and the time in which he is late respectively, we introduce two additional random variables X1 and X2 by using the notation: f+(x) = max (f(x), 0) from calculus and we obtain:(3)X1=(c1−X)+andX2=(X−c2)+The following results evaluate the expected values for early and late delivery times. A proof of each of these results is provided in Appendix A.Proposition 1AThe CDF, the pdf, and the expected value of X1are given respectively by:(4)FX1(x)=1−FX(c1−x)ifx≥0;andzeroelsewhere(5)fX1(x)=fX(c1−x)ifx∈[0,c1−a);andzeroelsewhereX1¯=∫ac1(c1−x)fX(x)dxThe CDF, the pdf, and the expected value of X2are given respectively by:(6)FX2(x)=FX(c2+x)ifx≥0;andzeroelsewhere(7)fX2(x)=fX(c2+x)ifx∈[0,b−c2);andzeroelsewhereX2¯=∫c2b(x−c2)fX(x)dxFrom the above proposition, we can now compute the penalty cost with the assumption that there is no cost incurred for on-time delivery. For that, we need the function g by:g(t)=−∫(a−μσ)txϕ(x)dx.Proposition 2AThe average cost Ya incurred from early delivery is given by:(8)Ya=Q¯h0[σg(c1−μσ)+(c1−μ)Φ(c1−μσ)]The probability that the supplier will deliver raw materials early is given by:(9)Pa=Φ(c1−μσ)The average cost Yl incurred from late delivery is given by:(10)Yl=K[σg(c2−μσ)−(c2−μ)(1−Φ(c1−μσ))]The probability that the supplier will deliver raw materials late is given by:(11)Pr=1−Φ(c2−μσ)The probability that the supplier will deliver raw materials on-time is given by:(12)Pt=Φ(c2−μσ)−Φ(c1−μσ)From the above propositions, we can now generate the following probability distribution table that enables us to find the total penalty cost Y = E(T).The average cost Y = E(T) incurred from the supplier delivery is derived from Table 1. To derive Y, we use the following results from Probability Theory (Jeffrey, 2006).Lemma 1Let A1, A2, A3be a subset of complementary events of a probability space; X and T be two random variables: E(T) = EX(E(T/X)).Thus E(T) = P(X ∈ A1)E(T/X ∈ A1) + P(X ∈ A2)E(T/X ∈ A2) + P(X ∈ A3) E(T/X ∈ A3).We can therefore claim that the average penalty cost from the supplier delivery is obtained as:Y=P(X<c1)Ya+P(c1≤X≤c2)0+P(X>c2)Yl=PaYa+PtYlThe following theorem establishes the average penalty cost generated by the supplier delivery.Theorem 1The average penalty cost resulting from supplier delivery time is given by:(13)Y(k)=(a1μ1+a2μ2)h0Φ(c1(k)−μσ)×[σg(c1(k)−μσ)+(c1(k)−μ)Φ(c1(k)−μσ)]+K(1−Φ(c2(k)−μσ))×[σg(c2(k)−μσ)−(c2(k)−μ)(1−Φ(c2(k)−μσ))]This result is obtained from Lemma 1 and Eqs. (8–12). □We now determine by the average total cost of the delayed product differentiation model by making the sum of three costs: (i) the penalty cost Y(k) from supplier delivery performance given by (13) , (ii) the buffer inventory cost G0 from supply side given by (2) and, (iii) the operational cost Z(k) given by (1)Theorem 2The average total cost delayed product differentiation cost to manufacture product 1 and product 2 fromFig. 1is C(k) = Y(k) + G0 + Z(k), that is,(14)C(k)=h0(a1μ1+a2μ2)μ+zh0×μ((a1σ1)2+(a2σ2)2+2ρ(a1σ1)(a2σ2))+σ2(a1μ1+a2μ2)2+(a1μ1+a2μ2)h0Φ(c1(k)−μσ)×[σg(c1(k)−μσ)+(c1(k)−μ)Φ(c1(k)−μσ)]+K(1−Φ(c2(k)−μσ))×[σg(c2(k)−μσ)−(c2(k)−μ)(1−Φ(c2(k)−μσ))]+∑i=1kSi+∑i=1Npi(k)(μ1+μ2)+∑i=1Nhi(k)[ni(k)(μ1+μ2)]+∑i=1khi(k)[(μ1+μ2)/2+zσ12ni(k)+1]+∑i=k+1Nhi(k)[(μ1+μ2)/2+z(σ1+σ2)ni(k)+1This result is obtained by adding G0, Y(k) and Z(k). □We end this section by deducing the average total cost in the particular case where the supplier delivery lead time X is normally distributed with mean μ and standard deviation σ.Without loss of generality, we assume that a, μ and b are far apart so that FX(a) is approaching 0 and FX(b) is approaching 1. That is, fXis 0 outside the closed interval [a, b]. This assumption is valid because from the normality assumption, we have:P(μ−4σ<X<μ+4σ)=P(−4<X−μσ<4)=2Φ−1=0.9999.We state the following observations from calculus.Remark 1dϕ(x)dx=−xϕ(x)sinceϕ(x)=e−12x22πanddϕ(x)dx=−xe−12x2.2πg(t)=ϕ(t)sinceg(t)=−∫(a−μσ)txϕ(x)dx=∫(a−μσ)tdϕ(x)dxdx=ϕ(t)−ϕ(a−μσ)=ϕ(t).From the above remarks, after updating the average penalty cost from the supply side (see (13)), we can therefore define average total cost of delayed product differentiation to manufacture product 1 and product 2.Corollary 1(15)C(k)=h0(a1μ1+a2μ2)μ+zh0×μ((a1σ1)2+(a2σ2)2+2ρ(a1σ1)(a2σ2))+σ2(a1μ1+a2μ2)2+(a1μ1+a2μ2)h0Φ(c1(k)−μσ)×[σϕ(c1(k)−μσ)+(c1(k)−μ)Φ(c1(k)−μσ)]+K(1−Φ(c2(k)−μσ))×[σϕ(c2(k)−μσ)−(c2(k)−μ)(1−Φ(c2(k)−μσ))]+∑i=1kSi+∑i=1Npi(k)(μ1+μ2)+∑i=1Nhi(k)[ni(k)(μ1+μ2)]+∑i=1khi(k)[(μ1+μ2)/2+zσ12ni(k)+1]+∑i=k+1Nhi(k)[(μ1+μ2)/2+z(σ1+σ2)ni(k)+1This result is obtained from Theorem 2 and Remarks 1 and 2. □In the following section, we analyze the cost functions for the following two cases: (i) the case where the service level is constant across all stages of the production network as in Lee and Tang (1997), and (ii) the case of not-constant service level.Remark 3(1)C(k + 1) − C(k) = Z(k + 1) − Z(k) + Y(k + 1) − Y(k) for all 0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1.If c1 and c2 are free of k (that is c1(k) = c1 and c2(k) = c2 for all 0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1), then Y(k + 1) = Y(k) = Y and C(k + 1) − C(k) = Z(k + 1) − Z(k).It follows from this remark that althoughLee and Tang (1997)did not integrate an external supplier to their model, their work is still valid when finding the optimal differentiation point when an external supplier is incorporated in the framework as long as the early and late portions of the delivery window accepted by the firm are free of the differentiation point. This is the situation where the width of the delivery window and the penalty costs per unit time late and early are specified by the contract between the buyer and the supplier. These parameters cannot be changed without resigning the contract. However, when either c1or c2is a function of k, their model is no longer valid when finding the optimal differentiation point.The following result states that the cost under study increases with the safety factor z, a situation that arises when the firm decides to increase the customer service level.Proposition 3The cost C(k) increases with the safety factor z.Notice that C = f(z) in (14). ThusdCdz=df(z)dz>0sincedf(z)dz=h0×μ((a1σ1)2+(a2σ2)2+2ρ(a1σ1)(a2σ2))+σ2(a1μ1+a2μ2)2+∑i=1khi(k)σ12ni(k)+1+∑i=k+1Nhi(k)(σ1+σ2)ni(k)+1>0.□In the next section, we continue with the analysis of the penalty cost function Y(k) under the following two scenarios where one of the two acceptable delivery dates (c1 and c2) is free of k and another one is a function of k. More precisely, we establish for each of these cases sufficient conditions under which the manufacturer can anticipate or postpone the differentiation point k. In the next section, we examine the case where both c1 and c2 are functions of k .The following result establishes conditions for which the average penalty cost incurred from the supplier delivery increases with the differentiation point under the assumption that the point of late delivery is constant (either fixed or free of k), and under the assumption that on average, the supplier delivery is not early.Proposition 4When c2(k)is free of k and c1(k) ≤ μ for all 0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1(16)andc1(k)−μc1(k+1)−μ≤(Φ(c1(k+1)−μσ))2(Φ(c1(k)−μσ))2,thenY(k)≤Y(k+1).c2(k) is free of k (or c2(k) = c2) models the situation in which the manufacturer has a fixed date for the positioning of the on-time delivery portion of the window where the supplier can deliver the raw materials late (the end of the acceptable delivery window), and this date is independent of the point of differentiation. This is a situation where in short term, knowing the average delivery time μ, the point of late delivery is specified by the contract between the buyer and the supplier and this parameter cannot be changed without resigning the contract. In practice, the manufacturer selects the position of the on-time delivery (c1and c2) that satisfies c1(k) ≤ c2(k). Under (16), conditions c2(k) = c2and c1(k) ≤ μ for all 0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1, it can be inferred fromProposition 4that on average, it is more costly to postpone the differentiation point due to the supplier penalty cost factor. Therefore, to take advantage of supply side costs, it pays off for the manufacturer not to postpone the differentiation point.The following result establishes conditions under which the average penalty cost from the supply side decreases when the differentiation point increases with additional considerations that the point of early delivery is free of k and on average the delivery of raw materials is not late.Proposition 5When c1(k)is free of k and μ ≤ c2(k) for all 0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1(17)andc2(k)−μc2(k+1)−μ≤(1−Φ(c2(k+1)−μσ))2(1−Φ(c2(k)−μσ))2,thenY(k+1)≤Y(k).Proposition 5provides conditions under which differentiation deferment can be beneficial. This result indicates that the penalty cost resulting from the supplier's conformance to the delivery schedule is smaller when product differentiation is implemented at earlier stages of the production process but increases as the production expands. Our results highlight that the penalty cost behaves differently depending on the selection of the on-time and late portions of the delivery window; that is, the on-time and late portions of the delivery window are important decision variables that should be taken into consideration when choosing the optimal point of differentiation provided that the average delivery time is known. Hence, with regard to the conformance to the delivery schedule window, the manufacturer should strategically choose these values when negotiating a contract with a supplier.In the following section, we examine the average total cost C(k) in the two special cases introduced in Lee and Tang (1997): (i) the lead time for each operation and the unit inventory maintenance cost at each stage are constant (independent of the positioning of k), and (ii) there is an additional investment cost for each operation and incremental processing costs for each operation prior to the differentiation point. The proofs of the obtained results are in Appendix A.Formally, these two conditions emphasize that: for all 0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1, ni(k) = ni, hi(k) = hi, pi(k) = piifi > k and pi(k) = pi+ βiif i ≤ k(βicaptures the additional material and processing costs when operation i is standardized).Substituting these values in Z(k), these authors obtained:(18)Z(k)=∑i=1kSi+∑i=1Npi(μ1+μ2)+∑i=1kβi(μ1+μ2)+∑i=1Nhini(μ1+μ2)+∑i=1khi[(μ1+μ2)/2+zσ12ni+1]+∑i=k+1Nhi[(μ1+μ2)/2+z(σ1+σ2)ni+1.The following result states the conditions under which deferring the differentiation point is beneficial when the position of late delivery on the delivery window is independent of k and that on average the supplier does not deliver the raw materials late.Proposition 6If(19)Sk+1+βk+1(μ1+μ2)>z(σ1+σ2−σ12)hk+1nk+1+1,c2(k) is free of k and c1(k) ≤ μ for all 0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1 and(20)c1(k)−μc1(k+1)−μ≤(Φ(c1(k+1)−μσ))2(Φ(c1(k)−μσ))2,thenC(k)≤C(k+1).Proposition 6provides conditions under which postponing the point of differentiation at later stages can be more expensive to the manufacturer. In other words, it provides incentives to the manufacturers to delay the point of differentiation.In the next result, we show that it is beneficial to postpone the point of differentiation when the position of the early delivery window is free of k.Proposition 7If(21)Sk+1+βk+1(μ1+μ2)≤z(σ1+σ2−σ12)hk+1nk+1+1,c1(k) is free of k and μ ≤ c2(k) for all 0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1(22)andc2(k)−μc2(k+1)−μ≤(1−Φ(c2(k+1)−μσ))2(1−Φ(c2(k)−μσ))2,thenC(k+1)≤C(k).When conditions (21) and (22) are satisfied, the result fromProposition 7implies that it pays off to postpone the differentiation point.(1)Conditions (19) and (21) of Propositions 6 and 7 are complementary and lead to the opposite variation of the average total cost C(k).It is important to notice that Propositions 6 and 7 complement Propositions 4 and 5 since they proposed an analysis of the total cost C(k) based on the analysis of one of its term Y(K).zhk+1(σ12−σ1−σ2)nk+1+1is non-positive and represents the decrease in inventory maintenance cost due to the decision to delay the differentiation point.Sk + 1 + βk + 1(μ1 + μ2) is positive and represents the supplementary investment cost and incremental processing costs when the differentiation point is postponed from point k to point k + 1. ThusSk+1+βk+1(μ1+μ2)+zhk+1(σ12−σ1−σ2)nk+1+1can fluctuate from a positive to a negative number and represents the change in the cost Z(k), a condition specified by Lee and Tang (1997) when the differentiation point is postponed from point k to point k + 1.We now turn our attention to the analysis of the average total cost function C(k) when the service level is not constant.We have assumed so far as in past studies that the service level is constant in all stages of the production network. In practice, the service level can vary across stages as the customer demand propagates throughout the production network due to supply chain uncertainties (Ngniatedema, 2010). For this section, we assume that the service level (or safety factor z) is non-increasing for a given value of k because a stock-out situation at the differentiation point k would likely cause a bigger loss than the case in which a stock-out occurs at the point (k + 1). Hence, we assume:z0 > z1 > ⋅⋅⋅ > zN − 1 > zN, where ziis the safety factor at the inventory stocking point i.Remark 5Under the same assumptions as in Section 3.1.2, we observe from (18) that:(1)Z(k+1)−Z(k)=Sk+1+βk+1(μ1+μ2)+hk+1(σ12−σ1−σ2)zk+1nk+1+1.Sk+1+βk+1(μ1+μ2)hk+1(σ1+σ2−σ12)nk+1+1≥zk+1iffZ(k+1)−Z(k)≥0.The following results show that the result of Propositions 6 and 7 remain valid if conditions (19) and (21) are substituted by the following similar conditions (23) and (24) in Proposition 8A and Proposition 8B respectively.Proposition 8AIf c2(k)is free of k and c1(k) ≤ μ for all 0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1 andc1(k)−μc1(k+1)−μ≤(Φ(c1(k+1)−μσ))2(Φ(c1(k)−μσ))2(it results fromProposition 5that Y(k) ≤ Y(k + 1)), then C(k) ≤ C(k + 1) when the management chooses zk + 1such that(23)Sk+1+βk+1(μ1+μ2)hk+1(σ1+σ2−σ12)nk+1+1≥zk+1.If c1(k)is free of k and μ ≤ c2(k) for all 0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1 andc2(k)−μc2(k+1)−μ≤(1−Φ(c2(k+1)−μσ))2(1−Φ(c2(k)−μσ))2,(it results fromProposition 6that Y(k + 1) ≤ Y(k)), then C(k + 1) ≤ C(k) when the management chooses zk + 1such that(24)Sk+1+βk+1(μ1+μ2)hk+1(σ1+σ2−σ12)nk+1+1≤zk+1.For the practitioner, the safety factor zk + 1is a key factor impacting the decision to delay the point of differentiation k. Therefore, the choice of the service level (or safety factor zk + 1) at the inventory buffer point k + 1 is very important from a financial perspective when the manager decides to postpone or not postpone the differentiation.Before concluding this work, we illustrate our study using a numerical example in the general case where the late and early delivery dates depend on k. This is due to the fact that the analysis of the total cost function in that case is a complex problem.The literature documents a number of successful case studies on delayed product customization, especially in the computer industry. Hewlett Packard is a classic example who successfully used delayed differentiation for final printer configuration (Aviv & Federgruen, 2001; Feitzinger & Lee, 1997); Dell is also well known for their success because it changed the landscape of the PC industry using postponement. By adopting postponement as one of its core strategies, Dell was able to achieve the flexibility needed to develop different version of products based on individual customer tastes. This strategy helps Dell to minimize their inventory and to generate cash much faster than any other company in the PC industry (Chopra & Van Mieghem, 2000; Fugate & Mentzer, 2004; Radstaak & Ketelaar, 1998). Other cases are cited for a PC manufacturer in China (Huang & Lo, 2003). Rietze (2006) also presented several case studies on the application of postponement in product customization for companies such as Xilinx, General Motors, Honda, Polaroid, and Reebook, to name a few.To illustrate our model, we limit this study to the application of delayed differentiation in desktop PC customization.The literature suggests that a modern desktop PC uses at least twenty components (Kumar, 2004; Rietze, 2006; Wu, 2006). To understand the decision making process in a desktop PC assembly, we conducted interviews with computer professionals in a Midwestern city and at a computer help desk of a metropolitan university in the Midwest. Participants were presented with the list of components of a modern desktop PC collected from the literature. Based on their responses, the assembly of a modern desktop PC (i.e. PC for Y2K) starts with the critical internal components that affect decision making during the assembly process in the following sequence: (i) motherboard, (ii) CPU, (iii) memory, (iv) video card, to which other secondary components and peripherals can be added later, (v) case, and finally (vi) other peripherals and internal components such as the hard drive or the optical drive (Kumar, 2004; Rietze, 2006). In some cases, the video card and the expansion cards, as well as the power supply are integrated on the motherboard and should be skipped on the previous assembly description. We summarize the assembly activity of a desktop PC customization in the following illustration (N = 6) (Fig. 3).Some of the parameters used in this illustrative example (Table 2) are adapted from Ernst and Kamrad, (2000) and Wu, (2006). A cost value is measured in US dollars and the supplier lead time is normally distributed. The mean and standard deviation of the delivery lead time, the lead time for each stage of the production network, and the parameters of the customer demand for each type of product are given in Tables 2 and 3.For internal manufacturing processes,the manufacturer observes a mean demand of 90 and 80 for type 1 and type 2 computer respectively (see Table 2). The standard deviation for the combined demand is:σ12=σ12+σ22+2ρσ1σ2=6.7. For the lead time delivery window, the early and late delivery dates c1 and c2 are defined by:c1(k)=μ−1+kNandc2(k)=μ+kN. The rest of the parameter values (inventory maintenance cost, processing cost and lead time) for each stage (stages 1–6) and for each differentiation scenario (k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are summarized in Table 4.We consider two cases with different service levels: (i) a case in which a 78.81 percent service level is maintained at all inventory stocking points, which yield a safety factor of z = 0.8, and (ii) a case in which a 95.05 percent service level is maintained at all inventory stocking points, which yield a safety factor of z = 1.65.
