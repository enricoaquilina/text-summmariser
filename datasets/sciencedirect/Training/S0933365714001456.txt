ObjectiveIn pattern recognition and medical diagnosis, similarity measure is an important mathematical tool. To overcome some disadvantages of existing cosine similarity measures of simplified neutrosophic sets (SNSs) in vector space, this paper proposed improved cosine similarity measures of SNSs based on cosine function, including single valued neutrosophic cosine similarity measures and interval neutrosophic cosine similarity measures. Then, weighted cosine similarity measures of SNSs were introduced by taking into account the importance of each element. Further, a medical diagnosis method using the improved cosine similarity measures was proposed to solve medical diagnosis problems with simplified neutrosophic information.Materials and methodsThe improved cosine similarity measures between SNSs were introduced based on cosine function. Then, we compared the improved cosine similarity measures of SNSs with existing cosine similarity measures of SNSs by numerical examples to demonstrate their effectiveness and rationality for overcoming some shortcomings of existing cosine similarity measures of SNSs in some cases. In the medical diagnosis method, we can find a proper diagnosis by the cosine similarity measures between the symptoms and considered diseases which are represented by SNSs. Then, the medical diagnosis method based on the improved cosine similarity measures was applied to two medical diagnosis problems to show the applications and effectiveness of the proposed method.ResultsTwo numerical examples all demonstrated that the improved cosine similarity measures of SNSs based on the cosine function can overcome the shortcomings of the existing cosine similarity measures between two vectors in some cases. By two medical diagnoses problems, the medical diagnoses using various similarity measures of SNSs indicated the identical diagnosis results and demonstrated the effectiveness and rationality of the diagnosis method proposed in this paper.ConclusionsThe improved cosine measures of SNSs based on cosine function can overcome some drawbacks of existing cosine similarity measures of SNSs in vector space, and then their diagnosis method is very suitable for handling the medical diagnosis problems with simplified neutrosophic information and demonstrates the effectiveness and rationality of medical diagnoses.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Due to the increased volume of information available to physicians from modem medical technologies, medical diagnosis contains a lot of incomplete, uncertainty, and inconsistent information, which is essential information about medical diagnosis problems. A symptom usually implies a lot of incomplete, uncertainty, and inconsistent information for a disease, which characterizes a relation between symptoms and diseases. Thus we work with the uncertainties and inconsistencies to lead us to proper decision making in medicine. In most of the medical diagnosis problems, there exist some patterns, and then the experts make a decision based on the similarity between unknown sample and the basic diagnosis patterns. In some practical situations, there is the possibility of each element having different truth-membership, indeterminacy-membership, and falsity-membership functions. Therefore, Smarandache [1] originally proposed the concept of a neutrosophic set from philosophical point of view. A neutrosophic set A in a universal set X is characterized independently by a truth-membership function TA(x), an indeterminacy-membership function IA(x), and a falsity-membership function FA(x). The functions TA(x), IA(x), FA(x) in X are real standard or nonstandard subsets of]−0, 1+[, i.e., TA(x): X→]−0, 1+[, IA(x): X→]−0, 1+[, and FA(x): X→]−0, 1+[. However, the domain of definition and range of the functions TA(x), IA(x) and FA(x) in a neutrosophic set A is the non-standard unit interval]−0, 1+[, it is only used for philosophical applications, especially when a distinction is required between absolute and relative truth/falsity/indeterminacy. To easily use in technical applications of the neutrosophic set, the domain of definition and range of TA(x), IA(x) and FA(x) can be restrained to the normal standard real unit interval [0, 1]. As a simplified form of the neutrosophic set, a simplified neutrosophic set (SNS) in [2] is an appropriate choice as it easily expresses and deals with incomplete, uncertainty, and inconsistent information in real science and engineering fields. SNSs include single valued neutrosophic sets (SVNSs) and interval neutrosophic sets (INSs) and a generalization of classic sets, fuzzy sets (FSs) [3], intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) [4] and interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs) [5]. However, FSs, IFSs and IVIFSs cannot represent and handle uncertainty and inconsistent information [1]. Then, similarity measure is not only an important mathematical tool in pattern recognition, medicine diagnosis, and decision making but also an important research topic in the neutrosophic theory. Various similarity measures have been proposed by some researchers. Broumi and Smarandache [6] defined the Hausdorff distance between neutrosophic sets and some similarity measures based on the distance, set theoretic approach, and matching function to calculate the similarity degree between neutrosophic sets. Majumdar and Samanta [7] introduced several similarity measures of SVNSs based on distances, a matching function, membership grades, and then proposed an entropy measure for a SVNS. Ye [8] also presented the Hamming and Euclidean distances between INSs and their similarity measures and applied them to multiple attribute decision-making problems with interval neutrosophic information. Ye [9] further proposed the distance-based similarity measure of SVNSs and applied it to group decision making problems with single valued neutrosophic information. Furthermore, Ye [2] proposed three vector similarity measures for SNSs, including the Jaccard, Dice, and cosine similarity measures for SVNSs and INSs, and applied them to multicriteria decision-making problems with simplified neutrosophic information. Till now, existing similarity measures for neutrosophic sets are scarcely applied to medical diagnosis problems. However, the cosine similarity measures defined in vector space [2,10] have some drawbacks in some situations. For instance, they may produce no defined (unmeaningful) phenomena or some results calculated by the cosine similarity measures are unreasonable in some real cases (details given in Section 3). Therefore, in the situations, it is difficult to apply them to pattern recognition and medicine diagnosis. To overcome some drawbacks of existing cosine measures in [2], this paper aims to propose improved cosine similarity measures for SNSs and apply them to medical diagnosis. To do so, the rest of the article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we briefly introduce some basic concepts of SNSs. Section 3 reviews existing cosine similarity measures of SNSs in vector space and their drawbacks. Section 4 proposes improved cosine similarity measures of SNSs based on cosine function, including single valued neutrosophic cosine similarity measures and interval neutrosophic cosine similarity measures, and investigates their properties. In Section 5, by two numerical examples we give the comparative analysis between the improved cosine similarity measures and existing cosine similarity measures for SNSs to show the effectiveness and rationality of the improved cosine measures. In Section 6, a medical diagnosis method is proposed based on the improved cosine similarity measures and is applied to medical diagnosis problems. Conclusions and further research are given in Section 7.Smarandache [1] originally presented the concept of a neutrosophic set from philosophical point of view. In a neutrosophic set A in a universal set X, its characteristic functions are expressed by a truth-membership function TA(x), an indeterminacy-membership function IA(x), and a falsity-membership function FA(x), respectively. The functions TA(x), IA(x), FA(x) in X are real standard or nonstandard subsets of]−0, 1+[, i.e., TA(x): X→]−0, 1+[, IA(x): X→]−0, 1+[, and FA(x): X→]−0, 1+[. Then, the sum of TA(x), IA(x) and FA(x) is no restriction, i.e., −0≤sup TA(x)+sup IA(x)+sup FA(x)≤3+.To apply a neutrosophic set to science and engineering areas, Ye [2] introduced SNS, which is a subclass of the neutrosophic set, and gave the following definition of a SNS.Definition 1[2]Let X be a space of points (objects), with a generic element in X denoted by x. A neutrosophic set A in X is characterized by a truth-membership function TA(x), an indeterminacy-membership function IA(x), and a falsity-membership function FA(x). If the functions TA(x), IA(x) and FA(x) are singleton subintervals/subsets in the real standard [0, 1], such that TA(x): X→[0, 1], IA(x): X→[0, 1], and FA(x): X→[0, 1]. Then, a simplification of the neutrosophic set A is denoted byA={〈x,TA(x),IA(x),FA(x)〉|x∈X},which is called a SNS. It is a subclass of the neutrosophic set and includes the concepts of INS and SVNS.On the one hand, if we only consider that the values of TA(x), IA(x) and FA(x) in a SNS A are single points in the real standard [0, 1] instead of subintervals/subsets in the real standard [0, 1], the SNS A can be described by three real numbers in the real unit interval [0, 1]. Therefore, the sum of TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)∈[0, 1] satisfies the condition 0≤TA(x)+IA(x)+FA(x)≤3. In this case, the SNS A reduces to the SVNS A.For two SVNSs A={〈x, TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)〉| x∈X} and B={〈x, TB(x), IB(x), FB(x)〉| x∈X}, there are the following relations [11]:(1)Complement: Ac={〈x, FA(x), 1−IA(x), TA(x)〉|x∈X};Inclusion: A⊆B if and only if TA(x)≤TB(x), IA(x)≥IB(x), FA(x)≥FB(x) for any x in X;Equality: A=B if and only if A⊆B and B⊆A.On the other hand, if we only consider three membership degrees in a SNS A as the subunit interval of the real unit interval [0, 1], the SNS can be described by three interval numbers in the real unit interval [0, 1]. For each point x in X, we have that TA(x)=[inf TA(x), sup TA(x)], IA(x)=[inf IA(x), sup IA(x)], FA(x)=[inf FA(x), sup FA(x)]⊆[0, 1], and 0≤sup TA(x)+sup IA(x)+sup FA(x)≤3 for any x∈X. In this case, the SNS A reduces to the INS A.For two INSs A={〈x, TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)〉| x∈X} and B={〈x, TB(x), IB(x), FB(x)〉| x∈X}, there are the following relations [12]:(1)Complement: Ac={〈x, [infFA(x), supFA(x)], [1−supIA(x), 1−infIA(x)], [infTA(x), supTA(x)〉|x∈X};Inclusion: A⊆B if and only if inf TA(x)≤inf TB(x), sup TA(x)≤sup TB(x), inf IA(x)≥inf IB(x), sup IA(x)≥sup IB(x), inf FA(x)≥inf FB(x), and sup FA(x)≥sup FB(x), for any x in X;Equality: A=B if and only if A⊆B and B⊆A.Especially when the upper and lower ends of three interval numbers TA(x), IA(x), FA(x) in A are equal, the INS A degrades to the SVNS A. Therefore, the SVNS A is a special case of the INS A, and also both are the special cases of the SNS A.In this section, we introduce existing cosine similarity measures for SNSs in the literature [2] and review their drawbacks.Then, similarity measures should satisfy axiomatic requirements in the following definition.Definition 2A real-valued function S: SNS(X)×SNS(X)→[0, 1] is called a similarity measure on SNS(X) if it satisfies the following axiomatic requirements for A, B, C∈SNS(X):(S1) 0≤S(A, B)≤1;(S2) S(A, B)=1 if and only if A=B;(S3) S(A, B)=S(B, A);(S4) If A⊆B⊆C, then S(A, C)≤S(A, B) and S(A, C)≤S(B, C).In this section, we only use SVNSs in SNSs. Assume that there are two SVNSs A={〈xj, TA(xj), IA(xj), FA(xj)〉| xj∈X} and B={〈xj, TB(xj), IB(xj), FB(xj)〉| xj∈X} in the universe of discourse X={x1, x2,…,xn}, where TA(xj), IA(xj), FA(xj)∈[0, 1] for any xj∈X in A and TB(xj), IB(xj), FB(xj)∈[0, 1] for any xj∈X in B. Then, Ye [2] presented the cosine similarity measure of SVNSs in vector space as follows:(1)C1(A,B)=1n∑j=1nTA(xj)TB(xj)+IA(xj)IB(xj)+FA(xj)FB(xj)TA2(xj)+IA2(xj)+FA2(xj)TB2(xj)+IB2(xj)+FB2(xj).However, one can find some drawbacks of Eq. (1) as follows:(1)For two SVNSs A and B, if TA(xj)=IA(xj)=FA(xj)=0 and/or TB(xj)=IB(xj)=FB(xj)=0 for any xjin X (j=1, 2,…,n), Eq. (1) is undefined or unmeaningful. In this case, one cannot utilize it to calculate the cosine similarity measure between A and B.If TA(xj)=2TB(xj), IA(xj)=2IB(xj), and FA(xj)=2FB(xj) or 2TA(xj)=TB(xj), 2IA(xj)=IB(xj), and 2FA(xj)=FB(xj) for any xjin X (j=1, 2,…,n). By applying Eq. (1), we haveSince A≠B, the measure value of Eq. (1) is equal to 1. This means that it only satisfies the necessary condition of the property (S2) in Definition 2, but not the sufficient condition.Therefore, in this case, it is unreasonable to apply it to pattern recognition and medical diagnosis.In this section, we only use INSs in SNSs. Assume that there are two INSs A={〈xj, TA(xj), IA(xj), FA(xj)〉| xj∈X} and B={〈xj, TB(xj), IB(xj), FB(xj)〉| xj∈X} in the universe of discourse X={x1, x2,…,xn}, where TA(xj)=[inf TA(xj), sup TA(xj)], IA(xj)=[inf IA(xj), sup IA(xj)], FA(xj)=[inf FA(xj), sup FA(xj)]⊆[0, 1] for any xj∈X in A and TB(xj)=[inf TB(xj), sup TB(xj)], IA(xj)=[inf IB(xj), sup IB(xj)], FB(xj)=[inf FB(xj), sup FB(xj)]⊆[0, 1] for any xj∈X in B. Then, Ye [2] presented the cosine similarity measure of INSs in vector space as follows:(2)C2(A,B)=1n∑j=1ninfTA(xj)infTB(xj)+infIA(xj)infIB(xj)+infFA(xj)infFB(xj)+supTA(xj)supTB(xj)+supIA(xj)supIB(xj)+supFA(xj)supFB(xj)[infTA(xj)]2+[infIA(xj)]2+[infFA(xj)]2+[supTA(xj)]2+[supIA(xj)]2+[supFA(xj)]2[infTB(xj)]2+[infIB(xj)]2+[infFB(xj)]2+[supTB(xj)]2+[supIB(xj)]2+[supFB(xj)]2.Similarly, one can find some drawbacks of Eq. (2) as follows:(1)For two INSs A and B, if TA(xj)=IA(xj)=FA(xj)=[0, 0] and/or TB(xj)=IB(xj)=FB(xj)=[0, 0] for any xjin X (j=1, 2,…,n), Eq. (2) is undefined or unmeaningful. In this case, one cannot calculate the cosine similarity measure between A and B.If TA(xj)=[2infTB(xj), 2sup TB(xj)], IA(xj)=[2inf IB(xj), 2sup IB(xj)], and FA(xj)=[2inf FB(xj), 2sup FB(xj)] or TB(xj)=[2infTA(xj), 2sup TA(xj)], IB(xj)=[2inf IA(xj), 2sup IA(xj)], and FB(xj)=[2inf FA(xj), 2sup FA(xj)] for any xjin X (j=1, 2,…,n). By using Eq. (2), we haveSince A≠B, the measure value of Eq. (2) is equal to 1. This means that it only satisfies the necessary condition of the property (S2) in Definition 2, but not the sufficient condition.Therefore, in this case, the cosine similarity measure of INSs is unreasonable in the application of pattern recognition and medical diagnosis.In order to overcome the above mentioned disadvantages, we shall improve cosine similarity measures of SNSs in the following section.Based on cosine function, we propose two improved cosine similarity measures between SVNSs and investigate their properties.Let A={〈xj, TA(xj), IA(xj), FA(xj)〉| xj∈X} and B={〈xj, TB(xj), IB(xj), FB(xj)〉| xj∈X} be any two SVNSs in X={x1, x2,…,xn}, where TA(xj), IA(xj), FA(xj)∈[0, 1] for any xj∈X in A and TB(xj), IB(xj), FB(xj)∈[0, 1] for any xj∈X in B. Then, based on cosine function, we propose two improved cosine similarity measures between A and B, respectively, as follows:(3)SC1(A,B)=1n∑j=1ncosπ(|TA(xj)−TB(xj)|∨|IA(xj)−IB(xj)|∨|FA(xj)−FB(xj)|)2,(4)SC2(A,B)=1n∑j=1ncosπ(|TA(xj)−TB(xj)|+|IA(xj)−IB(xj)|+|FA(xj)−FB(xj)|)6,where the symbol “∨” is the maximum operation. Then, the two improved cosine similarity measures satisfy the axiomatic requirements of similarity measures.Proposition 1For two SVNSs A and B in X={x1, x2,…,xn}, the cosine similarity measure SCk(A, B) (k=1, 2) should satisfy the following properties (S1–S4):(S1)0≤SCk(A, B)≤1;SCk(A, B)=1 if and only if A=B;SCk(A, B)=SCk(B, A);If C is a SVNS in X and A⊆B⊆C, then SCk(A, C)≤SCk(A, B) and SCk(A, C)≤SCk(B, C).(S1)Since the truth-membership degree, indeterminacy-membership degree, and falsity-membership degree in SVNS and the value of the cosine function are within [0, 1], the similarity measure based on the cosine function also is within [0, 1]. Hence 0≤SCk(A, B)≤1 for k=1, 2.For any two SVNSs A and B, if A=B, this implies TA(xj)=TB(xj), IA(xj)=IB(xj), FA(xj)=FB(xj) for j=1, 2,…,n and xj∈X. HenceTA(xj)−TB(xj)=0,IA(xj)−IB(xj)=0, andFA(xj)−FB(xj)=0. Thus SCk(A, B)=1 for k=1, 2.If SCk(A, B)=1 for k=1, 2, this impliesTA(xj)−TB(xj)=0,IA(xj)−IB(xj)=0, andFA(xj)−FB(xj)=0since cos(0)=1. Then, these equalities indicate TA(xj)=TB(xj), IA(xj)=IB(xj), FA(xj)=FB(xj) for j=1, 2,…,n and xj∈X. Hence A=B.Proof is straightforward.If A⊆B⊆C, then there are TA(xj)≤TB(xj)≤TC(xj), IA(xj)≥IB(xj)≥IC(xj), and FA(xj)≥FB(xj)≥FC(xj) for j=1, 2,…,n and xj∈X. Then, we have the following inequalities:|TA(xj)−TB(xj)|≤|TA(xj)−TC(xj)|,|TB(xj)−TC(xj)|≤|TA(xj)−TC(xj)|,|IA(xj)−IB(xj)|≤|IA(xj)−IC(xj)|,|IB(xj)−IC(xj)|≤|IA(xj)−IC(xj)|,|FA(xj)−FB(xj)|≤|FA(xj)−FC(xj)|,|FB(xj)−FC(xj)|≤|FA(xj)−FC(xj)|Hence, SCk(A, C)≤SCk(A, B) and SCk(A, C)≤SCk(B,C) for k=1, 2 since the cosine function is a decreasing function within the interval [0, π/2].Therefore, we complete the proofs of these properties.□Usually, one takes the weight of each element xjfor xj∈X into account and assumes that the weight of an element xjis wj(j=1, 2,…,n) with wj∈[0, 1] and∑j=1nwj=1. Thus we can introduce the following weighted cosine similarity measures between SVNSs:(5)WSC1(A,B)=∑j=1nwjcosπ(|TA(xj)−TB(xj)|∨|IA(xj)−IB(xj)|∨|FA(xj)−FB(xj)|)2,(6)WSC2(A,B)=∑j=1nwjcosπ(|TA(xj)−TB(xj)|+|IA(xj)−IB(xj)|+|FA(xj)−FB(xj)|)6,Especially when wj=1/n for j=1, 2,…,n, Eqs. (5) and (6) reduce to Eqs. (3) and (4).Similarly, we propose two improved cosine similarity measures between INSs and investigate their properties.Let A={〈xj, TA(xj), IA(xj), FA(xj)〉| xj∈X} and B={〈xj, TB(xj), IB(xj), FB(xj)〉| xj∈X} be any two INSs in X={x1, x2,…,xn}, where TA(xj)=[inf TA(xj), sup TA(xj)], IA(xj)=[inf IA(xj), sup IA(xj)], FA(xj)=[inf FA(xj), sup FA(xj)]⊆[0,1] for any xj∈X in A and TB(xj)=[inf TB(xj), sup TB(xj)], IA(xj)=[inf IB(xj), sup IB(xj)], FB(xj)=[inf FB(xj), sup FB(xj)]⊆[0, 1] for any xj∈X in B. Then, based on the cosine function, we propose two improved cosine similarity measures between A and B, respectively, as follows:(7)SC3(A,B)=1n∑j=1ncosπ4|infTA(xj)−infTB(xj)|∨|infIA(xj)−infIB(xj)|∨|infFA(xj)−infFB(xj)|+|supTA(xj)−supTB(xj)|∨|supIA(xj)−supIB(xj)|∨|supFA(xj)−supFB(xj)|,(8)SC4(A,B)=1n∑j=1ncosπ12infTA(xj)−infTB(xj)+infIA(xj)−infIB(xj)+infFA(xj)−infFB(xj)+supTA(xj)−supTB(xj)+supIA(xj)−supIB(xj)+supFA(xj)−supFB(xj),where the symbol “∨” is the maximum operation. Then, the two improved cosine similarity measures of INSs satisfy the axiomatic requirements in Definition 2.Proposition 2For two INSs A and B in X={x1, x2,…,xn}, the cosine similarity measure SCk(A, B) (k=3, 4) should satisfy the following properties (S1–S4):(S1)0≤SCk(A, B)≤1;SCk(A, B)=1 if and only if A=B;SCk(A, B)=SCk(B, A);If C is an INS in X and A⊆B⊆C, then SCk(A, C)≤SCk(A, B) and SCk(A, C)≤SCk(B, C).(S1)Since the truth-membership degree, indeterminacy-membership degree, and falsity-membership degree in an INS and the value of the cosine function are within [0, 1], the similarity measure value based on the cosine function also is within [0, 1]. Thus 0≤SCk(A, B)≤1 for k=3, 4.For any two INSs A and B, if A=B, this implies TA(xj)=TB(xj), IA(xj)=IB(xj), FA(xj)=FB(xj) for j=1, 2,…,n and xj∈X. HenceinfTA(xj)−infTB(xj)=0,infIA(xj)−infIB(xj)=0,infFA(xj)−infFB(xj)=0,supTA(xj)−supTB(xj)=0,supIA(xj)−supIB(xj)=0, andsupFA(xj)−supFB(xj)=0. Thus SCk(A, B)=1 for k=3, 4.If SCk(A, B)=1 for k=3, 4, this impliesinfTA(xj)−infTB(xj)=0,infIA(xj)−infIB(xj)=0,infFA(xj)−infFB(xj)=0,supTA(xj)−supTB(xj)=0,supIA(xj)−supIB(xj)=0, andsupFA(xj)−supFB(xj)=0since cos(0)=1. Then, these equalities indicate TA(xj)=TB(xj), IA(xj)=IB(xj), FA(xj)=FB(xj) for j=1, 2,…,n and xj∈X. Hence A=B.Proof is straightforward.If A⊆B⊆C, then there are infTA(xj)≤infTB(xj)≤infTC(xj), supTA(xj)≤supTB(xj)≤supTC(xj), infIA(xj)≥infIB(xj)≥infIC(xj), supIA(xj)≥supIB(xj)≥supIC(xj), infFA(xj)≥infFB(xj)≥infFC(xj), and supFA(xj)≥supFB(xj)≥supFC(xj) for j=1, 2,…,n and xj∈X. Then, we have the following inequalities:|infTA(xj)−infTB(xj)|≤|infTA(xj)−infTC(xj)|,|infTB(xj)−infTC(xj)|≤|infTA(xj)−infTC(xj)|,|supTA(xj)−supTB(xj)|≤|supTA(xj)−supTC(xj)|,|supTB(xj)−supTC(xj)|≤|supTA(xj)−supTC(xj)|,|infIA(xj)−infIB(xj)|≤|infIA(xj)−infIC(xj)|,|infIB(xj)−infIC(xj)|≤|infIA(xj)−infIC(xj)|,|supIA(xj)−supIB(xj)|≤|supIA(xj)−supIC(xj)|,|supIB(xj)−supIC(xj)|≤|supIA(xj)−supIC(xj)|,|infFA(xj)−infFB(xj)|≤|infFA(xj)−infFC(xj)|,|infFB(xj)−infFC(xj)|≤|infFA(xj)−infFC(xj)|,|supFA(xj)−supFB(xj)|≤|supFA(xj)−supFC(xj)|,|supFB(xj)−supFC(xj)|≤|supFA(xj)−supFC(xj)|.Since the cosine function is a decreasing function within the interval [0, π/2], hence SCk(A, C)≤SCk(A, B) and SCk(A, C)≤SCk(B, C) for k=3, 4.Thus, we complete the proofs of these properties.□When one takes the weight of each element xjfor xj∈X into account and assumes that the weight of an element xjis wj(j=1, 2,…,n) with wj∈[0, 1] and∑j=1nwj=1, we can introduce the following weighted cosine similarity measures between INSs A and B:(9)WSC3(A,B)=∑j=1nwjcosπ4|infTA(xj)−infTB(xj)|∨|infIA(xj)−infIB(xj)|∨|infFA(xj)−infFB(xj)|+|supTA(xj)−supTB(xj)|∨|supIA(xj)−supIB(xj)|∨|supFA(xj)−supFB(xj)|,(10)WSC4(A,B)=∑j=1nwjcosπ12|infTA(xj)−infTB(xj)|+|infIA(xj)−infIB(xj)|+|infFA(xj)−infFB(xj)|+|supTA(xj)−supTB(xj)|+|supIA(xj)−supIB(xj)|+|supFA(xj)−supFB(xj)|.Especially when wj=1/n for j=1, 2,…,n, Eqs. (9) and (10) reduce to Eqs. (7) and (8). Then, when TA(xj)=inf TA(xj)=sup TA(xj, IA(xj)=inf IA(xj)=sup IA(xj), and FA(xj)=inf FA(xj)=sup FA(xj) for any xj∈X in A and TB(xj)=inf TB(xj)=sup TB(xj), IB(xj)=inf IB(xj)=sup IB(xj), FB(xj)=inf FB(xj)=sup FB(xj) for any xj∈X in B, the INSs A and B reduce to the SVNSs A and B, and then Eqs. (7)–(10) reduce to Eqs. (3)–(6), respectively.To compare the improved cosine measures with existing cosine measures [2] in simplified neutrosophic setting, we provide two numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of the improved cosine similarity measures of SNSs.Example 1We consider two SVNSs A and B in X={x} and compare the improved cosine similarity measures with existing cosine similarity measure in [2]. The comparison of pattern recognitions is indicated by the numerical example in Table 1. By applying Eqs. (1), (3) and (4), these similarity measure results are shown in Table 1.Let us consider two INSs A and B in X={x} and compare the improved cosine similarity measures with existing cosine similarity measure in [2]. The comparison of pattern recognitions is demonstrated by the numerical example in Table 2. By using Eqs. (2), (7) and (8), these similarity measure results are shown in Table 2.The results of Tables 1 and 2show that the existing cosine similarity measures in [2] not only cannot carry out the recognition between Case 1 and Case 5 but also produces unreasonable phenomena for Case 5 and undefined (unmeaningful) phenomena for Case 4. This will get the decision maker into trouble in practical applications. However, the improved cosine similarity measures SC1 and SC3 cannot also carry out the recognition between Case 3 and Case 4, but do not produce the undefined (unmeaningful) phenomena. Then, the improved cosine similarity measures SC2 and SC4 demonstrate stronger discrimination among them. Obviously, the improved cosine similarity measures are superior to the existing cosine similarity measures in [2]. Furthermore, the cosine similarity measures SC2 and SC4 are superior to the cosine similarity measures SC1 and SC3, respectively.The two examples all demonstrate that in some cases the improved cosine similarity measures of SNSs based on the cosine function can overcome the disadvantages of the existing cosine similarity measures between two vectors.Due to the increased volume of information available to physicians from modem medical technologies, medical diagnosis contains a lot of incomplete, uncertainty, and inconsistent information. In some practical situations, there is the possibility of each element having different truth-membership, indeterminacy-membership, and falsity-membership degrees, by which an SNS is expressed. Hence, similarity measures for SNSs are a suitable tool to deal with medical diagnosis problems with simplified neutrosophic information. Hereby, we apply the improved cosine similarity measures of SNSs to medical diagnosis.In medical diagnosis problems, we propose a medical diagnosis method below.Let us consider a set of diagnoses Q={Q1, Q2,…,Qn}, and a set of symptoms S={s1, s2, s3,…,sm}. Assume that we take a sample from a patient P with all the symptoms. Then, the characteristic information of Q, S and P is represented by the form of SNSs. To find a proper diagnosis, we can calculate the cosine measure SCk(P, Qi) (k=1, 2, 3, 4; i=1, 2,…,n). The proper diagnosis Qi*for the patient P is derived byi*=argmax1≤i≤n{SCk(P,Qi)}.To illustrate the medical diagnostic process, we provide two medical diagnosis examples to demonstrate the applications and effectiveness of the medical diagnosis method using the improved cosine similarity measures.Example 3Let us consider the medical diagnosis problem adapted from [13]. Assume that a set of diagnoses is Q={Q1 (viral fever), Q2 (malaria), Q3 (typhoid), Q4 (gastritis), Q5 (stenocardia)} and a set of symptoms is S={s1 (fever), s2 (headache), s3 (stomach pain), s4 (cough), s5 (chest pain)}. Then characteristic values of the considered diseases are represented by the form of SVNSs, which are shown in Table 3.In the medical diagnosis, assume that we take a sample from a patient P1 with all the symptoms, which is represented by the following SVNS information:P1 (patient)={〈s1, 0.8, 0.2, 0.1〉, 〈s2, 0.6, 0.3, 0.1〉, 〈s3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.8〉, 〈s4, 0.6, 0.5, 0.1〉, 〈s5, 0.1, 0.4, 0.6〉}.For convenient comparison, we utilize the existing cosine measure [2] and the two improved cosine measures to handle the diagnosis problem. By applying Eqs. (1), (3) and (4), we can obtain the results of the three similarity measures between the patient P1 and the considered disease Qi(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5), as shown in Table 4.Since the largest similarity measure indicates the proper diagnosis, we can see from Table 4 that the patient P1 suffers from malaria. Obviously, the medical diagnoses using various similarity measures of SVNSs indicate the same diagnosis results and demonstrate the effectiveness of these diagnoses. However, as mentioned above, since the improved cosine measures of SVNSs in this paper cannot produce undefined (unmeaningful) or unreasonable phenomena in some real cases, they can avoid some drawbacks of the existing cosine measure in [2] in some cases. Hence, the improved cosine measures of SVNSs are superior to the existing cosine measure of SVNSs.To compare the diagnosis results of cosine similarity measures between SVNSs and between IFSs, here we quote the results of the cosine similarity measure of IFSs in [13] as follows:CIFS(P1, Q1)=0.9046, CIFS(P1, Q2)=0.8602, CIFS(P1, Q3)=0.8510, CIFS(P1, Q4)=0.5033, and CIFS(P1, Q5)=0.4542.Obviously, the diagnosis result of the patient P1 is viral fever under the intuitionistic fuzzy environment, while the diagnosis result of the patient P1 given in this paper is malaria under the single valued neutrosophic environment. Therefore, there are different diagnosis results under different environments. The reason is that the diagnosis method in [13] is on the basis of the cosine measure of IFSs, which only considers the truth-membership and falsity-membership degrees but not the indeterminate-membership degree; while the diagnosis method in this paper is based on the improved cosine measures of SVNSs and contains more information (the truth-membership, falsity-membership, and indeterminate-membership degrees). Therefore, different measure methods with different kinds of information represented by IFSs and SVNSs may give different diagnosis results. Furthermore, the diagnosis method in [13] cannot handle the diagnosis problem with single valued neutrosophic information and may produce an undefined (unmeaningful) or unreasonable phenomenon based on the cosine similarity measure of IFSs in some real cases, while the diagnosis method in this paper can deal with the diagnosis problems with intuitionistic fuzzy information and simplified neutrosophic information and overcome the indicated drawbacks. Hence, the diagnosis method based on the improved cosine measures of SVNSs is superior to the one of the cosine measure of IFSs [13].However, by only taking one time inspection, we wonder whether one can obtain a conclusion from a particular person with a particular decease or not. Hence, we have to examine the patient at different time intervals (e.g., two or three times a day) and can obtain that data collected from multiple time inspections for the patient are interval values rather than single values. In this case, the improved cosine measures of INSs are a better tool to find a proper disease diagnosis.Example 4Let us consider Example 3 again. Then, a patient P2 with all the symptoms can be represented by the following INS information:P2 (patient)={〈s1, [0.3, 0.5], [0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5]〉, 〈s2, [0.7, 0.9], [0.1, 0.2], [0.1, 0.2]〉, 〈s3, [0.4, 0.6], [0.2, 0.3], [0.3, 0.4]〉, 〈s4, [0.3, 0.6], [0.1, 0.3], [0.4, 0.7]〉, 〈s5, [0.5, 0.8], [0.1, 0.4], [0.1, 0.3]〉}.Similarly, we utilize the existing cosine measure [2] and the two improved cosine measures of INSs to handle the diagnosis problem. By applying Eqs. (2), (7) and (8), we can obtain the results of various similarity measures between the patient P2 and the considered disease Qi(i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5), as shown in Table 5.Therefore, we can see from Table 5 that the patient P2 suffers from typhoid. Then, the medical diagnoses using various similarity measures of INSs indicate the same diagnosis results and demonstrate the effectiveness of these diagnoses. However, as aforementioned advantages of the improved cosine measures, the improved cosine measures between INSs can also overcome some drawbacks of the existing cosine measure of INSs in [2] in some cases and are superior to the cosine similarity measures of SVNSs because INSs are the extension of SVNSs and more suitable for expressing and handling medical diagnosis problems than SVNSs.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper proposed the improved cosine similarity measures for SNSs based on cosine function, including single valued neutrosophic cosine similarity measures and interval neutrosophic cosine similarity measures. Then, the weighted cosine similarity measures of SNSs are introduced by considering the importance of each element. Compared with existing cosine similarity measures under simplified neutrosophic environment, the improved cosine measures of SNSs demonstrate their effectiveness and rationality and can overcome some drawbacks of existing cosine similarity measures of SNSs. Finally, two medical diagnosis problems with simplified neutrosophic information are provided to demonstrate the applications and effectiveness of the medical diagnosis method using the improved cosine similarity measures of SNSs.In further work, it is necessary to apply the cosine similarity measures of SNSs to other areas such as decision making, image processing, and clustering analysis.
