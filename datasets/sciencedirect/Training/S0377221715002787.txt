@&#ABSTRACT@&#
We show that a number of scheduling problems with competing agents and earliness minimization objectives are equivalent to the corresponding problems with tardiness minimization objectives.Mor and Mosheiov (2010) (to be called M–M in the sequel) analyzed scheduling problems with two competing agents and earliness minimization objectives. The purpose of this note is to point out that by invoking the well-known equivalence between earliness and tardiness problems on a single machine (see Du & Leung, 1990), we can derive the results in M–M from known results for the corresponding problems with tardiness minimization objectives. We also list additional competing agent problems with earliness minimization objectives (not considered by M–M) that can be analyzed by invoking the earliness–tardiness equivalence.Using the notation in M–M knowledge of which is assumed, for each two-agent earliness problem PRE, we can define an equivalent two-agent tardiness problem PR'Tin the [0, D] interval withp′jA=pjA,d′jA=D−djA+pjAfor all j = 1, …, nAandp′jB=pjB,d′jB=D−djB+pjBfor all j = 1, …, nB. Let SEbe an optimal sequence of JA∪JBfor PRE; then, we can construct an optimal sequence S'Tfor PR'Tso that the job in position j in SEis sequenced in position nA+ nB− j + 1 in S'T. As shown in Du and Leung (1990),E[j]=T[nA+nB−j+1]′where [j] denotes the job in position j in a given sequence; this equivalence is also true when E[j] is replaced by fj(E[j]) where fj(x) is a non-decreasing function of x with fj(x) = 0 for x ≤ 0.All jobs are available at time zero, with no precedence relationships among them; the machine is continuously available without any inserted idle time in the [0, D] interval. In a single-agent setting, a number of known results for tardiness-related objectives can be extended to the corresponding earliness-related objectives. The focus of this note is to utilize the earliness–tardiness equivalence for single-machine competing agent problems; our findings are summarized next in Table 1 where A⇔B denotes that problems A, B are equivalent.Problems 1–5 were considered by M–M. Problem 1 is equivalent to the1//fmaxA:fmaxBproblem solved in O[(nA)2 + nBlog nB] time by Agnetis, Mirchandani, Pacciarelli, and Pacifici (2004). Problem 2 was solved by Agnetis et al. (2004) in O(nAlog nA+ nBlog nB) time. Problem 3 is equivalent to the1//∑wjACjA:CmaxBproblem because of the common job due date; the1//∑wjACjA:CmaxBproblem is ordinary NP-hard (Agnetis et al., 2004). Problem 4 is equivalent to the1//∑wjACjA:fmaxBproblem which is strongly NP-hard (Leung, Pinedo, & Wan, 2010). Problem 5 is a special case of the1//∑CjA:fmaxBproblem which was solved in O(nAlog nA+ nBlog nB) time by Agnetis et al. (2004).Problems 6–7 were not considered by M–M. Problem 6 was shown to be ordinary NP-hard and solvable inO[(nA)4(∑j∈JApjA+∑j∈JBpjB)+nBlognB]time by Leung et al. (2010). Problem 7 is a generalization of problem 1 to k > 2 agents and was solved by Agnetis, Pacciarelli, and Pacifici (2007) in O(nlog n) time where n is the total number of jobs for all k agents.
