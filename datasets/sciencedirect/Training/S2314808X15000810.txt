@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A new series of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-3-carbonitrile and pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-3-carbonitrile derivatives was synthesized by the reaction of 5-amino-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazole-3,4-dicarbonitrile as a key starting material with various electrophilic and nucleophilic reagents. All the newly synthesized compounds were structurally confirmed by various modern analytical methods (IR, 1H NMR and MS). All the title compounds have been evaluated for their potential cytotoxicity against human laryngeal epidermoid carcinoma cells (Hep2). Among the screened compounds, 3 and 4 exhibited the highest significant effect.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Pyrazole derivatives are characterized by their biological and pharmacological activities as potential inhibitors of HIV-1 [1], pesticides [2], fungicides [3], antihypertensive agents [4] and anticancer activity [5]. They are also important and useful precursors for the synthesis of other fused heterocyclic systems, among these pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives [6], which have a considerable chemical and pharmacological importance as purine analogues [7–9]. In the literature, it was found that the replacement of 1H of pyrazole of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine ring system by some other bioactive moieties drastically alters its pharmacological properties [10]. Also, the pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine derivatives represent important building blocks in both natural and synthetic bioactive compounds [11]. They show anxiolytic activity along with xanthine oxidase inhibitors, cholesterol formation inhibitor, and anti-Alzheimer [12]. Moreover, fused heterocyclic containing pyrazolopyridine systems have been described to be associated with several biological and medicinal activities [13–16]. In the present work, some new 1-tosyl-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine and 1-tosyl-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine derivatives incorporating the tosyl moiety were synthesized to evaluate their potential cytotoxicity against epidermoid carcinoma of the larynx (Hep2).All melting points (uncorrected) were determined on an electrothermal Gallenkamp melting point apparatus. The IR spectra were recorded in KBr disks on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS 50 FT-IR spectrometer (not all frequencies are reported). The NMR spectra were acquired using a Bruker WP 300 spectrometer at 300 MHz using TMS as an internal standard and DMSO-d6as solvent. The mass spectra were performed using a LC-MS (Shimadzu-Mass spectrometer) at 70 eV.

The mixture was then cooled and the white precipitate was collected and washed with ethanol.Yield 80%; mp (°C); 213–215 (Lit. m.p. = 214–216 °C) [17]; IR (V¯/cm−1): 3313, 3246 (NH2), 2238 (CN), 1639 (CN); 1H NMR (DMSO-d6): δ/ppm = 2.30 (s, 3H, CH3), 7.10 (d, 2H, Ar-H, J = 7.95 Hz), 7.50 (d, 2H, Ar-H, J = 1.80 Hz), 7.85 (s, 2H, NH2); MS (EI): m/z (%) = 287 (molecular ion, 19), 272 (14), 242 (7), 215 (33), 195 (8), 173 (15), 155 59), 139 (6), 114 (37), 91 (base peak, 100), 77 (23), 65 (40).

This colorimetric test is based on the transformation of the yellow 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a purple formazan derivative by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase in practical cells. Hep2 was refined in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The anti-toxins included were 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cell line was seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well [19] at 37 °C for 48 hours under 5% CO2. After incubation the cells were treated with distinctive concentration of compounds and incubated for 24 hours. After 24 hours of medication treatment, 20 µl of MTT solution at 5 mg/ml was added and incubated for 4 hours. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in volume of 100 µl is added into each well to dissolve the purple formazan formed. The colorimetric test is measured and recorded at the absorbance of 570 nm utilizing a plate reader (EXL 800, USA). The relative cell viability in percentage was ascertained as: (A570 of treated samples/A570 of untreated sample) × 100.
