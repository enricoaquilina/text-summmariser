@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Contrast enhancement is a technique which improves the image quality for various applications. In medical image analysis, contrast enhancement algorithms are used as a preprocessing module. Medical image analysis mainly helps in improving the clarity of diagnosis. Generally, contrast enhancement is classified as example based [1] and intensity based [2]. Intensity based enhancement is broadly classified as the histogram based, transform domain, filter based and masking based approaches. Histogram based approach is a conventional contrast manipulation technique [3]. Akila et al. [4] performed a comparative study on different histogram based techniques for mammogram image enhancement. Improved histogram techniques are modified for better enhancement; such as automatic exact histogram specification [5], segments dependent dynamic multi histogram equalization [6] and threshold optimized histogram equalization [7] etc. Wavelet transform techniques have a greater role in image processing such as compression [8], segmentation [9], enhancement [10] etc. Lie et al. [11] developed a Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) based enhancement for finding the de bonding defects in solid rocket motors. Feng et al. [12] developed a contourlet transform based technique for retinal image enhancement. Liao et al. [13] proposed multi scale top hat transform based enhancement technique for retinal vessel enhancement; quality of enhancement is analyzed using extracted blood vessels and the available ground truth vessels. Fourier domain is a very conventional approach in transform based signal processing. Rallabandi and Roy [14] proposed a Fourier based image enhancement approach for Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. Anand et al. [15] proposed directional transform based enhancement algorithm for mammographic X-ray images. Filtering is the process of selecting a desired band of signal. In image communication, filter based techniques are mainly used for restoration [16–18] and enhancement. Paul et al. [17] proposed a neighborhood filter for MR image enhancement. Unsharp masking is an enhancement approach, in which scale value is used for mask formulation. Depending on the scale value, mask is classified as unsharp mask and high boost mask. Conventional masking techniques use static scale value, which is based on random selection [19–20]. Polesel et al. [19] proposed an adaptive unsharp masking technique for image enhancement. Optimum scale value selection can dynamically adjust the scale value using an optimization algorithm. There are various optimization algorithms applied in image processing applications, such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) [21,22], Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [23–25], Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) [26,27], Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) [28,29] etc., which are some examples. Enhanced Genetic Algorithm (EGA) is a modified technique, in which crossover ratio and mutation ratio are selected based on the threshold value [30]. Conventional cuckoo search algorithm is modified for the performance improvement based on genetic operators and adaptive parameters [31–33].The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the generalized unsharp masking and the need of optimum scale value. Section 3 presents the proposed optimum wavelet based masking in detail. Section 4 discusses the conventional cuckoo search algorithm, need of the proposed adaptive rebuild of worst nest and enhanced cuckoo search algorithm in detail. Section 5 discusses the results and discussion. Lastly, Section 6 presents the conclusions.Unsharp masking is a reliable contrast enhancement technique [34] in which, the filtered version of an original image is scaled with a fixed value and the resultant is subtracted from the original image, which is called a mask and is added with the original image as shown inFig. 1. The main difficulty of this scheme is, fixed scale value irrespective of input images, in which scale values are selected randomly.Our proposed technique is a dynamic unsharp masking, in which scale selection is performed using an optimization algorithm. Original image is decomposed as approximation coefficients and high pass filter using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) given by Eq. (1). The approximated coefficients reconstructed using Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transformation (IDWT) is given by Eq. (2).(1)Wφ(j0,m,n)=1MN∑x=0M−1∑y=0N−1f(x,y)φj0,m,n(x,y)(2)f(x,y)A=1MN∑m∑nWφ(j0,m,n)φj0,m,n(x,y)Where,Wφ(j0,m,n)is the approximation coefficients,φrepresents the scale coefficients,j0is the arbitrary initial scale value,m,nis the wavelet domain discrete variables. In which,f(x,y)is the input time domain image with discrete variablesx,ywith sizeM×N, herej0=0,φj0,m,n(x,y)is the scale function andf(x,y)Ais the reconstructed approximation coefficients [35].The reconstructed approximation coefficients consist of wavelet low pass filtered image. In our approach instead of the original image, wavelet approximated image is considered for masking formulation. Reconstructed low pass signal is optimum scaled using an enhanced cuckoo search algorithm. The mask formulated is optimum wavelet mask, which can dynamically improve the contrast of the image. Optimum wavelet mask is added to the original image and an intensity improved image is obtained as output image as shown inFig. 2. The proposed technique can be used as preprocessing technique; here it is tested for brain MRI, face XR, MRI and ribs from Brain Web data base and various mammogram images from MIAS data base.TableAlgorithm for proposed OWBMInput: Original medical imageOutput: Enhanced medical imageStep 1: Read the input imageStep 2: Perform DWT (db4) decomposition as frequency sub bands [LL, LH, HL, HH]Step3: Reconstruct approximation coefficients LLStep 4: Select the optimum scale value using ECSAStep 5: Perform product of scale value and approximated imageStep 6: Subtract the product from original image [mask]Step 7: Add the mask with original imageThis section is divided into 3 subsections as follows,1.Conventional cuckoo search algorithm.Need of adaptive nest rebuilding.Proposed enhanced cuckoo search algorithm.Yang and Deb [29] proposed a biological inspired optimization technique called cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) based on brood parasites of bird cuckoo. Usually cuckoo does not construct nests but lay their eggs in some host bird nests. If it identifies that the eggs are not their own, host bird either rebuild their nest or they will abandon their eggs. Egg contained in a nest is considered as a solution and cuckoo egg considered as a new solution. In cuckoo search, generation of new solutions x(t+1) is performed using levy fight.(3)xit+1=xit+α⊗Levy(λ)In Eq. (3) step size(α)is related to the scales of the problem of interests. The product⊗represents entry wise multiplications. The Levy flight essentially provides a random walk while the random step length is drawn from a Levy distribution.(4)Levy~u=t−λ,(1<λ≤3)The objective of this technique is to replace the not so good egg by the new solution. In the conventional form, each nest has one egg. Nevertheless, the simplest algorithm can be extended to multiple solution applications [36].In conventional cuckoo search, rate or probability (Pa) of nest rebuilding is a static value irrespective of the fitness of nests [29,36]. Yang and Deb [29] tested various probability values from 0.01 to 0.5 and reported probability value 0.25 is suited for their application. Stationary nests rebuilt can lead to keep in local minima or local maxima region. Li and Yin [31] proposed a self-adaptive approach based on static learning based on two learning parameters.In this section, we have proposed an adaptive cuckoo search algorithm for scale value optimization. Here, fitness of each nest is estimated for all iterations and the threshold value is fixed based on the fitness value. The nests below the threshold value are abandoned each time and the probability of nest rebuilding is dynamically changed in all iterations. The abandoned nest is replaced using adaptive crossover and mutation. In our approach, the same threshold value is used for the probability of nest rebuilding and adaptive genetic operators. Unlike the conventional cuckoo search algorithm, in our proposed technique dynamically operates based on adaptive crossover and adaptive mutation as shown inFig. 3. Implementation parameters of cuckoo search and genetic algorithm is given inTable 1.
