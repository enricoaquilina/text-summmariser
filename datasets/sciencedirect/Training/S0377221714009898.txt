@&#ABSTRACT@&#
In today's competitive markets, most firms in United Kingdom and United States offer their products on trade credit to stimulate sales and reduce inventory. Trade credit is calculated based on time value of money on the purchase cost (i.e., discounted cash flow analysis). Recently, many researchers use discounted cash flow analysis only on the purchase cost but not on the revenue (which is significantly larger than the purchase cost) and the other costs. For a sound and rigorous analysis, we should use discounted cash flow analysis on revenue and costs. In addition, expiration date for a deteriorating item (e.g., bread, milk, and meat) is an important factor in consumer's purchase decision. However, little attention has been paid to the effect of expiration date. Hence, in this paper, we establish a supplier–retailer–customer supply chain model in which: (a) the retailer receives an up-stream trade credit from the supplier while grants a down-stream trade credit to customers, (b) the deterioration rate is non-decreasing over time and near 100 percent particularly close to its expiration date, and (c) discounted cash flow analysis is adopted for calculating all relevant factors: revenue and costs. The proposed model is an extension of more than 20 previous papers. We then demonstrate that the retailer's optimal credit period and cycle time not only exist but also are unique. Thus, the search of the optimal solution reduces to a local one. Finally, we run several numerical examples to illustrate the problem and gain managerial insights.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
In today's competitive markets, most companies grant buyers varied credit terms to stimulate sales and reduce inventory. “Estimates suggest that more than 80 percent of business-to-business transactions in the United Kingdom are made on credit, while about 80 percent of United States firms offer their products on trade credit” as shown in Tirole (2006). The presence of trade credit reduces the buyer's inventory holding cost, and hence affects the buyer's economic order quantity (EOQ). Goyal (1985) established the retailer's optimal EOQ when the supplier offers a permissible delay in payments. Later, Aggarwal and Jaggi (1995) generalized the EOQ model from non-deteriorating items to deteriorating items. Jamal, Sarker, and Wang (1997) further extended the EOQ model to allow for shortages. Thereafter, Teng (2002) amended the model by using selling price to calculate the revenue instead of unit cost, and obtained an easy analytical closed-form solution. Afterwards, Huang (2003) extended the trade credit problem to both up-stream and down-stream trade credit financing. Then Liao (2008) further generalized Huang's model to an economic production quantity (EPQ) model for deteriorating items. Subsequently, Teng (2009) established optimal ordering policies for a retailer to deal with bad credit customers as well as good credit customers. After, Teng, Krommyda, Skouri, and Lou (2011) obtained the optimal ordering policy for stock-dependent demand under progressive payment scheme. Further, Teng, Min, and Pan (2012) extended the demand from constant to non-decreasing pattern. Ouyang and Chang (2013) then built up an EPQ model with imperfect production process and complete backlogging. Lately, Ouyang, Yang, Chan, and Cárdenas-Barrón (2013) considered two-level trade credit link to order quantity. Recently, Chen, Cárdenas-Barrón, and Teng (2014a, 2014c), discussed the retailer's optimal EOQ/EPQ when the up-stream trade credit is link to order quantity or when the down-stream trade credit is only a fraction of the purchase amount. Currently, Sarkar, Gupta, Chaudhuri, and Goyal (2014) established an integrated inventory model with lead time, defective units, and delay in payments. Likewise, Liao, Huang, and Ting (2014) derived optimal strategy for deteriorating items with capacity constraints under two-level trade credit. In all articles described above, the EOQ/EPQ models with trade credit financing were studied only from the perspective of the buyer. From the seller's perspective to determine the optimal credit period has been received relatively little attention until now. Teng and Lou (2012) first established the seller's optimal credit period and cycle time in a supply chain with up-stream and down-stream trade credits. Currently, Chern, Pan, Teng, Chan, and Chen (2013, 2014) discussed Stackelberg and Nash solutions in a vendor–buyer supply chain model with trade credit financing. Lately, Seifert, Seifert, and Protopappa-Sieke (2013) organized a review of trade credit literature and provided a detailed agenda for future research.Many products such as vegetables, fruits, volatile liquids, blood banks, fashion merchandises and high-tech products deteriorate continuously due to evaporation, spoilage, obsolescence, etc. In the literature, Ghare and Schrader (1963) built an EOQ model with an exponentially decaying inventory. A decade later, Covert and Philip (1973) extended the constant exponential deterioration rate to a two-parameter Weibull distribution. Later, Dave and Patel (1981) studied an EOQ model for deteriorating items with linearly increasing demand. Sachan (1984) further generalized the EOQ model to allow for shortages. Thereafter, Hariga (1996) established EOQ models for deteriorating items with log-concave time-varying demand. Teng, Chern, Yang, and Wang (1999) then generalized EOQ models with shortages and fluctuating demand. Teng, Chang, Dye, and Hung (2002) further extended the model to allow for partial backlogging. Skouri, Konstantaras, Papachristos, and Ganas (2009) established inventory EOQ models with ramp-type demand rate and Weibull deterioration rate. In a subsequent paper, Skouri, Konstantaras, Papachristos, Teng (2011) further generalized the model for deteriorating items with ramp-type demand and permissible delay in payments. Recently, Dye (2013) studied the effect of technology investment on deteriorating items. Although deteriorating items cannot be sold after expiration dates, none of the above mentioned papers took the expiration date into consideration until recently such as in Chen and Teng (2014), Sarkar (2012), Wang, Teng, and Lou (2014), and Wu, Ouyang, Cárdenas-Barrón, Goyal (2014).The trade credit, either the cost to the seller or the benefit to the buyer, is calculated based on time value of money on the purchase cost (i.e., discounted cash flow analysis or net present value method). Recently, many researchers use discounted cash flow analysis only on the purchase cost while not on the revenue which is significantly larger than the purchase cost. For a sound and rigorous analysis, one should use a discounted cash flow analysis on all relevant revenue and costs. Consequently, in this paper, we propose an EOQ model in a supplier–retailer–customer supply chain in which: (a) the supplier offers the retailer an up-stream trade credit of S years meanwhile the retailer grants a down-stream trade credit of R years to the customer, (b) trade credit not only increases sales and revenue but also opportunity cost and default risk, (c) deteriorating rate is closed to 100 percent especially near to its expiration date, and (d) the retailer determines both credit period and cycle time to maximize his/her present value of the annual total profit. In fact, the proposed inventory model forms a general framework that includes numerous previous models as special cases such as Goyal (1985), Teng (2002), Huang (2003), Teng and Goyal (2007), Teng and Lou (2012), Lou and Wang (2013), Wang et al. (2014), Wu et al. (2014), and others. We then discuss the retailer's objective functions under different possible alternatives. By applying existing theorems in concave functions, we prove that there exists a unique global optimal solution to the retailer's credit period and replenishment time. Finally, we run several numerical examples to illustrate the problem and provide some managerial insights.The rest of the paper is designed as follows. To establish a general framework, we assume in Section 2 that (i) the deterioration rate is non-decreasing with time and close to 100 percent near its expiration date, and (ii) both the demand and the default risk are log-concave with credit period. Then we derive mathematical expressions of the retailer's present value of the annual total profit function under each alternative case in Section 3. In Section 4, we demonstrate that both the optimal credit period and cycle time exist uniquely which simplifies the search for the optimal solution to a local one. In Section 5, we show that several previous inventory models are special cases of our proposed model including those non-deteriorating items. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the model and obtain managerial insights in Section 6. Finally, in Section 7, we provide the conclusions and the future research.The following notation and assumptions are used in the entire paper.For simplicity, we define the symbols for parameters, decision variables, functions, and optimal values accordingly.Parameterscpurchasing cost per unit in dollars.holding cost per unit per year in dollars excluding interest charge.expiration time in years, which starts at the order received and ends at product expiration date.ordering cost per order in dollars.selling price per unit in dollars.annual compound interest paid per dollar per year.up-stream credit period in years by the supplier.time in years.interest charged per dollar per year.interest earned per dollar per year.down-stream credit period in years by the retailer.replenishment cycle time in years.deterioration rate at time t, which is a non-decreasing function in t.demand rate, which is increasing in R.inventory level at time t.present value of annual total profit, which is a function of R and T.optimal down-stream credit period in years.optimal replenishment cycle time in years.optimal present value of annual total profit in dollars.We then propose some necessary assumptions to build up the mathematical model.1.In a supplier–retailer–customer supply chain system, the retailer buys deteriorating items from his/her supplier, and then sells them to his/her customers. Since near 80 percent of UK and US companies offer their products on trade credit, we may assume without loss of generality (WLOG) that the supplier grants an up-stream credit period of S years to the retailer while the retailer in turn provides a down-stream credit period of R years to his/her customers.Trade credit attracts new buyers who consider it a type of price reduction. Hence, we may assume that the demand rate D(R) given down-stream trade credit R is increasing and log-concave in R, which satisfies the following conditions:(1)D(R)≥0,D′(R)>0,andD(R)D′′(R)≤[D′(R)]2,For convenience, D(R) and D will be used interchangeably.On the other hand, the longer the retailer's down-stream credit period, the lower the percentage that the buyer will be able to pay off debt obligation. Therefore, the percentage of down-stream credit sales E(R) that will not become bad debts is a positive fraction but decreasing in R. For generality, we may assume WLOG that E(R) is positive, decreasing, and log-concave in R. That is,(2)0<E(R)≤1,E′(R)≤0,andE(R)E′′(R)≤[E′(R)]2.For convenience, E(R) and E will be used interchangeably.A deteriorating item deteriorates continuously and cannot be sold after its expiration date. Hence, the deteriorating rate is 100 percent near to its expiration date. As a result, we may assume WLOG that the deterioration rate θ(t) at time t,  0 ≤ t ≤ m, satisfies the following conditions:(3)0≤θ(t)≤1,θ′(t)≥0,andθ(m)=1.Since the deterioration rate reaches 100 percent after expiration date, we may assume WLOG that both the down-stream credit period R and the replenishment cycle time T are less than or equal to the expiration time m (i.e., R ≤ m and T ≤ m).The retailer collects the payment from the last customer at time T + R while must pay off the entire purchasing cost to the supplier at time S. Consequently, if S ≤ T + R, then the retailer settles the purchasing amount at time S and starts paying for the interest charges with rate Icover the interval [S, T + R]. On the other hand, if S ≥ T + R, then the retailer collects all sales revenue at time T + R, settles the purchasing account at time S, and there is no interest charge during the replenishment cycle time.If the up-stream credit period is longer than or equal to the down-stream credit period (i.e., S ≥ R), then the retailer can accumulate revenue and earn interest during the time interval from R to S with rate Ie. Conversely, If the up-stream credit period is shorter than or equal to the down-stream credit period (i.e., S ≤ R), then there is no interest earned for the retailer.Receipt of inventory is instantaneous and complete. In other word, the inventory from an order arrives in one batch at one time.Given the above notation and assumptions, it is time to derive the retailer's annual total profit as a function of credit period R and cycle time T for a deteriorating item with expiration time into a mathematical model.During the replenishment cycle [0, T], the inventory level is depleted by demand and deterioration, and hence governed by the following differential equation:(4)I′(t)=−D−θ(t)I(t),0≤t≤T,with the boundary condition I(T) = 0. Notice that from now on ‘ and “ are denoted the first-order and second-order derivatives, respectively. Solving the differential Eq. (4), we get(5)I(t)=e−δ(t)∫tTeδ(u)Ddu,0≤t≤T,where(6)δ(t)=∫0tθ(u)duisnon-decreasing,0≤t≤T.At time 0, the retailer orders deteriorating items. Hence, the present value of the retailer's ordering cost per cycle time T is(7)OC=o.Since the up-stream trade credit is S years, the retailer must pay the supplier the entire purchasing cost at time S. As a result, the present value of the retailer's purchasing cost per cycle time T is(8)PC=ce−rSI(0)=cD∫0Teδ(t)−rSdt.Likewise, the present value of the retailer's holding cost per cycle time T is(9)HC=h∫0Te−rtI(t)dt=hD∫0T∫tTeδ(u)−δ(t)−rtdudt.The retailer offers his/her customers a down-stream credit period of R years. Thus, the retailer receives revenue from time R to time T + R. Consequently, the present value of the retailer's sales revenue per cycle time T is(10)SR=pE∫RT+RDe−rtdt=pDEr[e−rR−e−r(T+R)].From the values of R and S, we have two potential cases: (1) R ≤ S, and (2) R ≥ S. Let us discuss them separately.Case 1.R ≤ SIn this case, we have two possible sub-cases. If S ≤ T + R, then the retailer pays off all units sold by S – R at time S, keeps the profits for other usage, and starts paying the interest charges on the items sold after S – R, which is shown in Fig. 1. On the other hand, if S ≥ T + R, then the retailer receives the total revenue at time T + R, and will pay off the entire purchasing cost at time S. The graphical representation of this sub-case is shown in Fig. 2. Now, let us discuss the detailed formulation in each sub-case.Sub-case 1-1:S ≤ T + RIn this sub-case, the retailer cannot pay off the purchasing cost at time S, and must finance all items sold after time S – R at an interest charged Icper dollar per year. Therefore, the interest charged per cycle time is Ictimes the area of the triangle BS(T + R) as shown in Fig. 1. Hence, the present value of the interest charged per cycle is given by(11)IC=cIc∫ST+RD(T+R−t)e−rtdt.On the other hand, the retailer sells items at time 0, but receives the money at time R. Consequently, the retailer accumulates revenue in an account that earns Ieper dollar per year from R through S. Therefore, the interest earned per cycle is Iemultiplied by the area of the triangle ARS as shown in Fig. 1. Hence, the present value of the interest earned per cycle is(12)IE=pIe∫RSD(t−R)e−rtdt.Combining the above results, we know that the present value of the retailer's annual total profit for this case is as follows:(13)PTP1(R,T)=1T(SR−PC−HC−OC−IC+IE)=pDErT[e−rR−e−r(T+R)]−cDT∫0Teδ(t)−rSdt−hDT∫0T∫tTeδ(u)−δ(t)−rtdudt−oT−cDIcT∫ST+R(T+R−t)e−rtdt+pDIeT∫RS(t−R)e−rtdt.Next, we derive the retailer's annual total profit for the other sub-case in which S ≥ T + R.Sub-case 1-2:S ≥ T + RIn this sub-case, the retailer receives the total revenue at time T + R, and is able to pay off the total purchase cost at time S. Hence, there is no interest charge while the interest earned per cycle is Iemultiplied by the area of the trapezoid on the interval [R, S] as shown in Fig. 2. Consequently, the present value of the retailer's interest earned per cycle time is(14)IE=pIe[∫RT+RD(t−R)e−rtdt+∫T+RSDTe−rtdt].Hence, similar to (13), we know that the present value of the retailer's annual total profit for this sub-case is(15)PTP2(R,T)=1T(SR−PC−HC−OC+IE)=pDErT[e−rR−e−r(T+R)]−cDT∫0Teδ(t)−rSdt−hDT∫0T∫tTeδ(u)−δ(t)−rtdudt−oT+pDIeT[∫RT+R(t−R)e−rtdt+T∫T+RSe−rtdt].Combining (13) and (15), we get(16)PTP1(R,S−R)=PTP2(R,S−R).Then we formulate the retailer's annual total profit for the case of R ≥ S below.Case 2.R ≥ SThere is no interest earned for the retailer in this case. In addition, the retailer must finance the entire purchasing cost at time S, and pay off the loan from time R to time T + R. As a result, the interest charged per cycle is Icmultiplied by the area of the trapezoid on the interval [S, T + R], as shown in Fig. 3. Thus, The present value of the retailer's interest charged per cycler is given by(17)IC=cIc[∫SRDTe−rtdt+∫RT+RD(T+R−t)e−rtdt].Hence, the present value of the retailer's annual total profit is(18)PTP3(R,T)=1T(SR−PC−HC−OC−IC)=pDErT[e−rR−e−r(T+R)]−cDT∫0Teδ(t)−rSdt−hDT∫0T∫tTeδ(u)−δ(t)−rtdudt−oT−cDIcT[T∫SRe−rtdt+∫RT+R(T+R−t)e−rtdt]Therefore, the retailer's objective is to determine the optimal credit period R* and cycle time T* such that the present value of the annual total profit PTPi(R, T) for i = 1, 2, and 3 is maximized. In the next section, we characterize the retailer's optimal credit period and cycle time in each case, and then obtain the certain conditions in which the optimal T* is in either S ≤ T + R or S ≥ T + R.To solve the problem, we apply the following theoretical result in generalized concave functions. If f(x) is non-negative, differentiable and (strictly) concave, and g(x) is positive, differentiable and convex, then the real-value function(19)z(x)=f(x)/g(x)is (strictly) pseudo-concave. For detailed proof, please see Cambini and Martein (2009, p. 245). For any given R, by applying (19), we can prove that the present value of the retailer's annual total profit PTPi(R, T) for i = 1, 2, and 3 is strictly pseudo-concave in T. As a result, for any given R, there exists a unique global optimal solutionTi*such that PTPi(R, T) is maximized.Next, we characterize the optimal solution in two cases: the case of R ≤ S first, and then the case of R ≥ S.By applying the theoretical result in generalized concave functions as in (19), we can demonstrate that the present value of the retailer's annual total profit PTPi(R, T) for i = 1, and 2 is strictly pseudo-concave in T. Consequently, we have the following theoretical results.Theorem 1For any given R,(a)PTP1(R, T) is a strictly pseudo-concave function in T, and hence exists a unique maximum solutionT1*,ifS≤T1*+R, then PTP1(R, T) subject to S ≤ T + R is maximized atT1*,ifS≥T1*+R, then PTP1(R, T) subject to S ≤ T + R is maximized at S − R.. See Appendix A.To findT1*, for any given R, taking the first-order derivative of PTP1(R, T) with respect to T, setting the result to zero, and re-arranging terms, we get(20)pDE[Te−r(T+R)−e−rR−e−r(T+R)r]−cD[Teδ(T)−rS−∫0Teδ(t)−rSdt]−hD(T∫0Teδ(T)−δ(t)−rtdt−∫0T∫tTeδ(u)−δ(t)−rtdudt)+o−cDIc[T(T+R−S)e−r(T+R)−∫ST+R(t−S)e−rtdt]−pDIe∫RS(t−R)e−rtdt=0.Likewise, for any given T, taking the first-order derivative of PTP1(R) ≡ PTP1(R, T) in (13) with respect to R, setting the result to zero, and re-arranging terms, we get(21)p[e−rR−e−r(T+R)][D′E+DE′r−DE]−[c∫0Teδ(t)−rSdt+h∫0T∫tTeδ(u)−δ(t)−rtdudt]D′−[cIc∫ST+R(t−S)e−rtdt−pIe∫RS(t−R)e−rtdt]D′−D[cIc(T+R−S)e−r(T+R)+pIe∫RSe−rtdt]=0.Next, for any given T, we demonstrate that PTP1(R) is strictly pseudo-concave in R under certain conditions. For simplicity, let(22)X1=p[e−rR−e−r(T+R)][E′r(D′−DD′′D′)+(E′rE−2)(D′E+DE′)+DE(r+D′′D′)]−D{cIce−r(T+R)[1−r(T+R−S)]−pIee−rR}.It is clear from (21) that D'E + DE' > 0. Since E' ≤ 0, we may assume without loss of generality that X1 < 0. Consequently, we have the following results.For any given T > 0, if X1 < 0, then PTP1(R, T) is strictly pseudo-concave in R, and hence exists a unique maximum solutionR1*.See Appendix B.Likewise, applying (19) to PTP2(R, T), we obtain the following results.For any given R,(a)PTP2(R, T) is a strictly pseudo-concave function in T, and hence exists a unique maximum solutionT2*,ifS≥T2*+R, then PTP2(R, T) subject to S ≥ T + R is maximized atT2*,ifS≤T2*+R, then PTP2(R, T) subject to S ≥ T + R is maximized at S − R.The proof is omitted because it is similar to that in Theorem 1.For any given R, to findT2*, by taking the first-order derivative of PTP2(R, T) in (15) with respect to T, setting the result to zero, and re-arranging terms, we obtain(23)pDE[Te−r(T+R)−e−rR−e−r(T+R)r]−cD[Teδ(T)−rS−∫0Teδ(t)−rSdt]−hD(T∫0Teδ(T)−δ(t)−rtdt−∫0T∫tTeδ(u)−δ(t)−rtdudt)+o−pDIe∫RT+R(t−R)e−rtdt=0.There are two possible solutions (i.e., eitherT1*orT2*) for the case of R ≤ S. To identify which one is the optimal solution, for any given R, let's define the discrimination term Δ(T) to be the first derivative of PTP2(R, T) with respect to T.(24)Δ(T)=1T2{pDE[Te−r(T+R)−e−rR−e−r(T+R)r]∫0T−cD[Teδ(T)−rS−∫0Teδ(t)−rSdt]−hD(T∫0Teδ(T)−δ(t)−rtdt−∫0T∫tTeδ(u)−δ(t)−rtdudt)+o−pDIe∫RT+R(t−R)e−rtdt∫0T}.Combining Theorems 1 and 3, and (16), we can prove the following theoretical results.For any given R,(a)if Δ(S − R) < 0, then the retailer's optimal cycle time isT2*,if Δ(S − R) = 0, then the retailer's optimal cycle time is S − R,if Δ(S − R) > 0, then the retailer's optimal cycle time isT1*.See Appendix C.Next, we derive the optimal trade credit for PTP2(R, T). For any given T, taking the first-order derivative of PTP2(R) ≡ PTP2(R, T) with respect to R, setting the result to zero, and re-arranging terms, we get(25)p[e−rR−e−r(T+R)][D′E+DE′r−DE]−[c∫0Teδ(t)−rSdt+h∫0T∫tTeδ(u)−δ(t)−rtdudt]D′+pIe[∫RT+R(t−R)e−rtdt+T∫T+RSe−rtdt]D′−pDIe[∫RT+Re−rtdt]=0.Then we obtain the following results.For any given T > 0, PTP2(R, T) is strictly pseudo-concave in R, and hence exists a unique maximum solutionR2*.See Appendix D.Similarly, using the theoretical result in (19), we can prove that the present value of the retailer's annual total profit PTP3(R, T) is strictly pseudo-concave in T. Consequently, we have the following theoretical results.Theorem 6For any given R, PTP3(R, T) is strictly pseudo-concave in T, and hence exists a unique maximum solution,T3*.The proof is omitted because it is similar to that in Theorem 1.To findT3*, for any given R, taking the first-order derivative of PTP3(R, T) with respect to T, setting the result to zero, and re-arranging terms, we get(26)pDE[Te−r(T+R)−e−rR−e−r(T+R)r]−cD[Teδ(T)−rS−∫0Teδ(t)−rSdt]−hD(T∫0Teδ(T)−δ(t)−rtdt−∫0T∫tTeδ(u)−δ(t)−rtdudt)+o−cDIc∫RT+R(t−R)e−rtdt=0.Likewise, we derive the optimal trade credit for PTP3(R, T). For any given T, taking the first-order derivative of PTP3(R) ≡ PTP3(R, T) with respect to R, setting the result to zero, and re-arranging terms, we get(27)p[e−rR−e−r(T+R)][D′E+DE′r−DE]−[c∫0Teδ(t)−rSdt+h∫0T∫tTeδ(u)−δ(t)−rtdudt]D′−cDIc[∫RT+Re−rtdt]=0.Then we obtain the following results.For any given T > 0, PTP3(R, T) is strictly concave in R, and hence exists a unique maximum solutionR3*.The proof is omitted because it is similar to that in Theorem 2.Next, we show that the proposed model is a general case of many previous models.In our proposed model, we assume that1.the deteriorating rate θ(t) is non-decreasing and θ(m) = 1,the demand rate D(R) is non-decreasing and log-concave in R,the rate of non-default E(R) is positive, decreasing, and log-concave in R, andthe up-stream credit period is S and the down-stream credit period is R.In numerous previous inventory models, θ(t), D(R), and E(R) are assumed in a specific form. Consequently, they are indeed special cases of the proposed model here. In this section, we discuss some popular adopted deterioration rates, which are special cases of ours. Notice that Dye, Yang, and Kung (2014) did not consider the opportunity cost (i.e., r = 0) nor the up-stream trade credit (i.e., S = 0). Hence, if r = 0 and S = 0, then the proposed model is simplified to Dye et al. (2014).Case 1.θ(t) = 1/(1 + m − t), D(R) = KeaR, E(R) = e−bR, and r = 0.(i)In this case, the proposed model is simplified to the model in Wu et al. (2014).If S = 0, then the proposed model is reduced to that in Wang et al. (2014).If θ(t) = 0 (i.e.,  m → ∞), and S = 0, then the proposed model is equivalent to the model by Lou and Wang (2013).If θ(t) = 0, then the proposed model is the same as that in Teng and Lou (2012).If θ(t) = 0, a = 0, and b = 0, then the proposed model becomes to that in Teng and Goyal (2007).If θ(t) = 0, p = c, Ic> Ie, a = 0, and b = 0, then the proposed model is reduced to that in Huang (2003).If θ(t) = 0, R = 0, p = c, a = 0, and b = 0, then the proposed model is the same as the model of Goyal (1985).We then discuss the most commonly used two-parameter Weibull deterioration rate (i.e., θ(t) = αβtβ − 1, 0 < α < 1 and β ≥ 1).Case 2.θ(t) = αβtβ − 1, D(R) = KeaR, E(R) = e−bR, and r = 0.(i)If θ(m) = 1, R = 0, a = 0, b = 0, and β = 1, then the proposed model is the same as that in Liao and Chung (2009), and Teng, Chang, and Goyal (2005).If θ(m) = 1, a = 0, b = 0, and α= 0, then the proposed model is reduced to the model of Teng, Chang, Chern, and Chan (2007).If θ(m) = 1, R = 0, a = 0, b = 0, and α= 0, then the proposed model is simplified to that by Teng (2002).If θ(m) = 1, R = 0, p = c, Ic≥ Ie, a = 0, b = 0, and β = 0, then the proposed model is equivalent to that in Chung (1998).If θ(m) = 1, R = 0, p = c, Ic> Ie, a = 0, b = 0, and β = 1, then the proposed model becomes that of Chu, Chung, and Lan (1998).If θ(m) = 1, S = 0, R = 0, a = 0, and b = 0, then the proposed model is that in Covert and Philip (1973).If θ(m) = 1, S = 0, R = 0, a = 0, b = 0, and β = 1, then the proposed model is equal to that in Ghare and Schrader (1963).Now, it is time to present some numerical examples in the next section.In this section, we use MATHEMATICA 10 to run several numerical examples in order to illustrate theoretical results as well as to gain some managerial insights on different deterioration rates.Example 1For θ(t) = 1/(1 + m − t), let's assume that D(R) = 1000eaR, E(R) = e−bR, a = 0.2, r = 0.05, p = $20/unit, c = $10/unit, o =$20/order, h = $2/unit/year, S = 0.25 years, Ic= 0.03, Ie= 0.03, and m = 1. By using software MATHEMATICA 10, we obtain the optimal solutions to b = 0.1 and 0.2 for each case as shown in Table 1.Consequently, if b = 0.1, then the optimal solution to the problem isR*=1.0000year=365days,T*=0.0672years=25days,andPTP*=$10,655.70.Fig. 4reveals thatPTP*(R,T)is a strictly pseudo-concave function in both R and T. However, if b = 0.2, then the optimal solution to the problem becomesR*=0.0000years=0days,T*=0.0671years=24days,andPTP*=$9557.99.Similarly, Fig. 5reveals thatPTP*(R,T)is also a strictly pseudo-concave function in both R and T.Example 2For θ(t) = αβtβ − 1, let's use the same data as those in Example 1, and set α = 0.3 and β = 1.0. Applying software MATHEMATICA 10, we have the computational results to b = 0.1 and 0.2 for each case as shown in Table 2.As a result, if b = 0.1, then the optimal solution to the problem isR*=1.0000year=365days,T*=0.0769years=28days,andPTP*=$10,727.80.However, if b = 0.2, then the optimal solution to the problem becomesR*=0.0000years=0days,T*=0.0774years=28days,andPTP*=$9633.92.We study the sensitivity analysis and obtain the computational results which are similar to those in Wu et al. (2014). To avoid unnecessary repeating similar sensitivity analysis, we just list the computational results as follows: (i) if the value of a, K, p, or S increases, then the values of R* and PTP* increase while the value of T* decreases, (ii) in contrast, if the value of b, or r increases, then the values of R* and PTP* decrease but the value of T* increases, (iii) an increase in c, h, or Iccauses the values of R* and PTP* decrease, (iv) the higher the ordering cost o, the higher the cycle time T* but the lower the annual total profit PTP*, and (v) a higher value of m causes higher values of R*, T*, and PTP*.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
Trade credit is vital to today's business tractions, and calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis on the purchase cost. If trade credit is important to both seller and buyer, then discounted cash flow analysis should also be used on the revenue (which is significantly larger than the purchase cost) and the other costs. Additionally, expiration date for a deteriorating item is an important factor in consumer's purchase decision. However, it has received relatively little attention on these two issues. As a result, we have established a supplier–retailer–buyer supply chain system in which (a) the retailer receives an up-stream trade credit from the supplier while grants a down-stream trade credit to the buyer, (b) a down-stream credit period increases not only demand but also opportunity cost and default risk, (c) the deterioration rate is 100 percent especially near to the expiration date, and (d) discounted cash flow analysis is adopted for calculating all relevant factors including revenue and costs. Furthermore, we have formulated the present value of the retailer's total profit as function of credit period and cycle time, and then demonstrated that the optimal trade credit and cycle time exist uniquely. Moreover, we have shown that the proposed model is a generalized case for numerously previous inventory models. Finally, we have used software MATHEMATICA 10 to provide numerical examples and obtain some managerial insights.All models have their limitations. In practice, deterioration rate depends on product, time, place, weather, etc. Based on the best of our knowledge, due to the complexity of the problem, none has scientifically measured and quantified the deterioration rate of a product before. Likewise, none has quantified demand rate and default risk as functions of trade credit. Hence, how to quantity deterioration rate as well as demand rate is a major obstacle to implement the proposed model into a real-world application. Additionally, in traditional marketing and economic theory, price is a major factor on the demand rate. As a result, one could take pricing strategy into consideration in the future research. Furthermore, there are four distinct economic equilibrium solutions between the seller and the buyer: (i) non-cooperative Nash equilibrium solution without a dominating player, (ii) non-cooperative Stackelberg equilibrium solution with a dominating player, (iii) cooperative Pareto equilibrium solution through negotiation, and (iv) integrated optimal solution for an integrated organization. Therefore, for the future research one should derive and compare those four distinct economic equilibrium solutions among players in a supplier–retailer–customer supply chain. Finally, one might generalize our proposed model in the directions of recent research papers such as Chen et al. (2014b), Huang, Kuo, and Lu (2014), Gilding (2014), Zhang and Zhang (2015),
