@&#ABSTRACT@&#
A new methodology of making a decision on an optimal investment in several projects is proposed. The methodology is based on experts’ evaluations and consists of three stages. In the first stage, Kaufmann’s expertons method is used to reduce a possibly large number of applicants for credit. Using the combined expert data, the credit risk level is determined for each project. Only the projects with low risks are selected.In the second stage, the model of refined decisions is constructed using the new modification of the previously proposed possibilistic discrimination analysis method (Sirbiladze, Khutsisvili, & Dvalishvili, 2010). This stage is based on expert knowledge and experience. The projects selected in the first stage are compared in order to identify high-quality ones among them. The possibility levels of experts’ preferences are calculated and the projects are ranked.Finally, the third stage deals with the bicriteria discrete optimization problem whose solution makes it possible to arrange the most advantageous investment in several projects simultaneously. The decision on funding the selected projects is made and an optimal distribution of the allocated investment amount among them is provided.The efficiency of the proposed methodology is illustrated by an example.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
The decision support methodology and optimization play a significant role in improving nearly every aspect of the human society’s life. Intensive studies carried out in recent years have led to a noticeable progress in decision-making science and optimization from both theoretical and practical standpoints. Optimization and decision-making problems for complex systems are traditionally solved using either the deterministic numerical or the probabilistic approach. The first of these approaches provides an approximate solution that totally ignores uncertainty and the other assumes that any uncertainty can be represented as a probability distribution. Both approaches only partly take into account the factor of uncertainty which actually exists in the form of known possibility distributions. Bellman and Zadeh (1970), Dubois and Prade (1988), Klir and Wierman (1999), Liu (2002), Yager (2002, 2007), Sirbiladze (2009a, 2009b, 2010a, 2010b), Sirbiladze, Khutsisvili, and Dvalishvili (2010), Sirbiladze et al. (2011), and Durbach and Stewart (2011, 2012) and other authors clearly support the use of the fuzzy set theory, fuzzy aggregation methods and soft computing techniques to further expand the human capability to make optimal decisions that take into account non-probabilistic uncertainty.In the environment of market economy and competition, investments are exposed to the risk of loss, especially in the sphere of crediting. Hence the issue of increasing the effectiveness of credit policies and lowering credit risks becomes very topical (Aliev, Fazlollahi, & Aliev, 2004; Ruan, Kacprzyk, & Fedrizzi, 2001; Uyemura & Van Deventer, 1993; Wu & Olson, 2010 and others).To examine the nature of risks related to financial decisions, various special methods are used. Along with the traditional statistical techniques, new credit scoring models are developed to support credit decisions. The ultimate goal of these models is to decrease imprecision and uncertainty in credit decisions so that creditworthy applicants could be granted credit, thereby increasing the profit of a bank, and non-creditworthy applicants could be denied credit, thus decreasing bank losses.The analysis of investment projects involves experts’ evaluations that may become dominant in the decision making process. Experts’ qualitative (verbal) evaluations can be correctly processed by applying possibility analysis and the fuzzy-set approach (Aliev et al., 2004; Dubois & Prade, 1988; Hájek, 2012; Klir & Wierman, 1999; Ruan et al., 2001; Wu, Zhang, Wu, & Olson, 2010 and others). In particular, when analyzing the risks of bank investments, the set of possible risks can be described by means of the following fuzzy terms of the linguistic variable “risk” (Sirbiladze, Sikharulidze, & Korakhashvili, 2003): an ultimate risk of unsuccessful investment, a high risk of unsuccessful investment, an average risk of unsuccessful investment, a low risk of unsuccessful investment, an insignificant risk of unsuccessful investment. Then models based on the fuzzy-set methodology establish a functional correlation between the experts’ verbal information (in the form of linguistic variables) and the membership functions of the fuzzy terms of linguistic variables, which indicate an extent of membership of the measured parameters (in our case, credit worthiness) in fuzzy descriptions.Thus the investment decision-making process is influenced by various uncertainty factors as well as by the need to formalize and process fuzzy, insufficient and, mostly, expert data. The ignoring of these factors results in inadequate decisions.Due to a high reliability of decisions made by expert systems developed on this basis, the fuzzy set theory has an indisputable advantage over probabilistic approaches, especially, when applied to problems of credit risk evaluation. Fuzzy statistics, possibility approaches and methods of fuzzy optimization are widely used when solving problems by modeling optimal decisions and especially when constructing decision support systems (Bellman and Zadeh, 1970; Khutsishvili, 2006; Liesiö and Salo, 2012; Liu, 2002; Norris, Pilsworth, & Baldwin, 1987; Ruan et al., 2001; Sirbiladze, 2009a, 2009b, 2010a, 2010b, 2013; Sirbiladze et al., 2003; Sirbiladze and Gachechiladze, 2005; Sirbiladze and Sikharulidze, 2003; Sirbiladze, Ghvaberidze, Latsabidze, & Matsaberidze, 2009; Sirbiladze, Sikharulidze, & Sirbiladze, 2010; Sirbiladze, Khutsisvili, & Dvalishvili, 2010; Sirbiladze et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2010; Yager, 2002, 2007 and others).Nowadays it has become crucial to create informational-expert methodologies that, apart from objective databases, also use the knowledge of experienced experts (financial managers and others), which we call the knowledge base. Literature published in the past decade proposes the application of fuzzy-statistical models, neural and fuzzy-neural networks and genetic algorithms when evaluating credit risks (Chen, 2007; Finlay, 2010; Hoffmann, Baesens, Mues, Van Gestel, & Vanthienen, 2007; Kahraman, Ruan, & Tolga, 2002; Lee and Chen, 2005; Li and Ho, 2009; Malhotra and Malhotra, 2002; Sirbiladze et al., 2003; Sirbiladze, Khutsisvili, et al., 2010; Yu, Wang, & Lai, 2009 and others). All of the above-mentioned approaches are based on the objective databases and expert data.When there is little or no objective data to make an investment decision, experienced expert-managers are commissioned to solve the problem. In that case, the knowledge and intellectual activity of experts yield expert data. Trustworthy evaluations based on such data can be prepared and analyzed only by applying informational-expert methodologies.Such situations have often to be dealt with in developing countries. The authors of this paper, who reside in one of the developing countries, propose to apply the combination of two fuzzy-statistical methods for credit scoring and the solution of a bicriteria discrete optimization problem when a decision on an optimal investment in several projects has to be made. For illustration, in our case this approach ensured a more precise evaluation of investment decision risks and gave a chance to use the expert data provided by the group of experts of the Investment Fund.When an applicant for credit submits the business-plan to the Investment Fund or a bank, the first thing experts have to do is to investigate the applicant’s credit repayment capacity. In particular, they check certain factors that are essential for granting credit. The set of factors is determined by the group of experts representing the Investment Fund or a bank.Out of the submitted projects usually based on more or less objective data the experts select a small number of projects with insignificant credit risks. They further perform re-evaluation in order to obtain more precise data within the selected set of projects and pick out the most trustworthy ones. Considering the procedure, the decision support methodology, which employs the experts valuations, should involve the following stages:•applying the method based on the analysis of both objective and expert data in order to condense the experts’ knowledge;applying the method which is well-suited for processing solely expert data.The authors of this paper have experience in applying heuristic and fundamental methods to the solution of decision-making problems in which both objective and expert data are used (Khutsishvili, 2006, 2009; Sirbiladze, 2009a, 2009b, 2010a, 2010b, 2013; Sirbiladze and Gachechiladze, 2005; Sirbiladze and Sikharulidze, 2003; Sirbiladze et al., 2003, 2009, 2011; Sirbiladze, Khutsisvili, et al., 2010; Sirbiladze, Sikharulidze, et al., 2010). By comparing various methods and evaluating their reliability, the authors decided on the two methods, which will be discussed below, and applied them successfully to the problem of credit scoring.In the first stage, the method consists in selecting projects with insignificant or low credit risks among all submitted projects. The selection is made by the expertons method (Kaufmann, 1988, 1992; Sirbiladze, Khutsisvili, et al., 2010) using expert data. The method uses interval (pessimistic–optimistic) evaluations defined by the experts in order to reduce a possibly large number of investment projects requesting for credit. The expert knowledge is thereby condensed and compatibility levels on the set of possible risks for each investment project are constructed. This approach is justified since the number of competing projects may be high in the case of requests for large credit amounts. The method is described in Section 3.2.In the second stage, the method of possibilistic discrimination analysis developed by the authors (Sirbiladze et al., 2003; Sirbiladze, Khutsisvili, et al., 2010) is used. Its aim is to make more precise decisions as to the competitiveness of the selected projects, to compare the selected projects and perform their qualitative ranking. This method is the possibilistic generalization of the well-known fuzzy discrimination analysis method (Norris et al., 1987). As different from the classical method which works with objective data only, in this paper we propose a further modification of the method of possibilistic discrimination analysis. Using the expert knowledge and experience, the possibility distribution is constructed on the set of all possible decisions (projects), which is used for projects ranking. The description of the modified method is presented in Section 3.3.In practice, the capital is frequently invested in several projects simultaneously, each of them requiring a different credit amount. However, if the total investment amount has already been predetermined and fixed, it becomes necessary to decide on a share of each project in the initial total investment amount. This is the objective of the third stage of the proposed methodology. Using the decision (recommendation) worked out in the second stage and taking into consideration the total investment amount, the third stage deals with a bicriteria discrete optimization problem (Ehrgott, 2005; Sirbiladze et al., 2009, 2011; Taha, 2011; Wang, 2012) whose solution makes it possible to arrange the most advantageous investment in several projects simultaneously.Thus, in the third stage, those projects are selected, which possess a maximum possibility level of credit repayment and of gaining a maximum profit for the bank. The method is discussed in Section 3.4.In addition to the proposed new methodology, the authors developed on its basis the software package which can be used to support decisions on optimal credit granting. The package has already been successfully used in an investment tender. An example of investment decision making clearly illustrating the work of the proposed methodology is given in Section 4.In the two decision-making methods described in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, the expert knowledge uncertainty is represented by means of the possibility measure Pos (Dubois & Prade, 1988 ) as follows.Let D be a finite set of some alternatives (or decisions).The possibility measure Pos on the events of all alternatives (decisions) 2Dcan be uniquely determined by its possibility distribution functionπ:D→[0,1];maxd∈Dπ(d)=1using the formula:∀B∈2DPos(B)=maxd∈Bπ(d),where π(d) is a possibility level of the choice of an alternative d; B is some event of alternatives and Pos(B) is a possibility level of the choice of an event B.The possibility of the choice of some event differs from the probability of the choice because the possibility is a maximum of possibility levels of elements of an event, and the probability is an additive sum of probabilities of elements of an event.The possibility theory as an uncertainty measure theory of incomplete information is a well-known means of expert knowledge representation (Dubois & Prade, 1988 ). As a rule, the problem of construction of possibility levels is focused on the heuristic approaches (in our case on the expertons method and possibilistic discrimination analysis method) of knowledge representation.In this study, the use of the expertons theory allows the Investment Fund experts to evaluate the competition results of investment projects, represent these results in general form, condense data and obtain optimal evaluations (Kaufmann, 1988, 1992).The objective of involvement of the experts is to aggregate their subjective evaluations in our specially created model of a decision-making system. The system further acts as an adviser that assists the experts in selecting applicants with minimal credit risks. Hence the system serves as a convenient tool for obtaining an optimal combined estimator of all the experts that incorporates their knowledge and intellectual activity.The expertons theory was pioneered by Kaufmann (1988) in the 1990s. An experton is the generalization of probability when cumulative probabilities are replaced by monotonically decreasing intervals. These intervals are statistically defined by a group of experts. The concept of the expertons theory can be briefly described as follows.Let D be a set of decisions (possible risks in our case). The group of r experts is requested to express their subjective opinion on each element from D in the form of a confidence interval (Kaufmann, 1992):∀d∈D:a∗j(d),aj∗(d)⊂[0,1],where ⊂ denotes an interval inclusion and j is the number of an expert.Suppose we have some set of monotone compatibility levels: 0<α1<α2<⋯<αℓ<1.We consider the statistics which for each possible alternative (decision) d∈D involve the values of both the lower and the upper bound of confidence intervals. The cumulative distribution law F∗(α, d) is then given bya∗j(d), and F∗(α, d) byaj∗(d). Thus we obtain(1)∀d∈D,∀α∈[0,1]:A∼(d)=[F∗(α,d),F∗(α,d)],whereF∗(αi,d)=∑j:a∗j(d)⩾αi1r,j=1,2,…,r,i=1,2,…,ℓ,is the lower cumulanta, i.e.∑j:a∗j(d)⩾αi1counts the number of lower bounds of confidence intervals for whicha∗j⩾αi;F∗(αi,d)=∑j:aj∗(d)⩾αi1r,j=1,2,…,r,i=1,2,…,ℓ,is the upper cumulanta, and∑j:aj∗(d)⩾αi1counts the number of upper bounds of confidence intervals for whichaj∗⩾αi;A∼denotes an interval experton.The following characteristics of an experton are obvious:∀d∈D,∀α,α′∈[0,1]:(α<α′)⇒([F∗(α′,d),F∗(α′,d)]⊂[F∗(α,d),F∗(α,d)]).The experton, which is used as a possibility of the choice of a decision d, is reduced to a possibility distribution (Dubois & Prade, 1988) on the set of possible decisions D by averaging the midpoints of interval expertons:(2)π(d)=∑i=1ℓ(F∗(αi,d)+F∗(αi,d))/2ℓ,d∈D.Here π(d) is a possibility level of the choice of an alternative d and the possibility distribution π introduces the preference relation ≽ on the set of all alternatives D. We say that the alternative diis preferred to (or dominates over) the alternative dj(di≻dj) if π(di)>π(dj) and the alternative diis equivalent to the alternative dj(di≡dj) if π(di)=π(dj).To process expert data we propose a new modification of the generalized method (Sirbiladze, Khutsisvili, et al., 2010) of fuzzy discrimination analysis (Norris et al., 1987). We call this modification the possibilistic discrimination analysis.Let the set of all possible factors which influence possible decisions and are determined by the group of experts be Ω={ω1,ω2,…,ωm}. The set of decisions that represents all competitors with minimum risks selected by the expertons method is written in the form D={d1,d2,…,dn}. As different from the above-mentioned generalized method, we also consider the weight vector w={w1,w2,…,wm}, whose component widetermines the significance level of the factor ωifor a decision:wi∈[0,1],∑i=1mwi=1. The weight vector is determined by experts.The discrimination analysis method can be applied provided that we can construct the so-called tabular-numerical knowledge base of conditional frequencies{fji}, wherefjiis a fraction of decisions djthat were correct in the presence of the factor ωi. Relative frequenciesfjican be calculated if there exist statistical databases on successfully implemented investment projects.However, for problems related to making decisions on investments, databases either do not exist at all or the body of data on projects for which favorable decisions were adopted is too small. In that case,f̃jican be defined by a psychometric survey of competent experts in the field. Thenf̃jiwill be a fraction of the experts who considered djto be a correct decision due to the presence of the factor ωi. If N experts participate in the psychometric survey, then(3)f̃ji=Nij/N,where Nijis a number of experts who supported the decision djbecause the factor ωiwas present for the competitor dj.Note that frequenciesf̃jiare subjective and in discrimination analysis their direct use instead of frequenciesfjiis not recommended since the latter are objective conditional frequencies and can be replaced by a probability distribution.Hence, instead of the tabular-numerical knowledge base of conditional frequencies{f̃ji}it is advisable to construct the so-called conditional possibility tabular-numerical knowledge base{πji}, whereπjiis conditional possibility (Dubois & Prade, 1988) that the experts will make the decision djif the factor ωishows up (see Table 1).There are several methods of constructing the possibility distribution table (Khutsishvili, 2009; Sirbiladze et al., 2003). For instance, one of the methods states that if the values off̃jiare known, then the values ofπjiare calculated by the formula (Sirbiladze et al., 2003):(4)πji=f̃jimaxj=1,n¯f̃ji.Technically, the procedure of determining the values off̃jiconsists of the following steps: each expert is provided with a template table (delivered, say, via Internet); the expert fills in the table with 1’s and 0’s and enters the value 1 in the cell (i, j) if he/she believes the decision dj(that the applicant djdeserves to be granted credit) is justified when the factor ωiexhibits itself. Otherwise, the expert enters the value 0 (see Table 2).Then the values of Nijfor the cell (i, j) with 1’s are calculated and formula (3) is applied.The creation of such a knowledge base not is labor- and time-consuming. Moreover, this, in turn, guarantees a high degree of objectivity. The created knowledge base relies on the experts’ knowledge, experience and also takes into account a degree of their objectivity. All this makes it possible to perform the ranking of possible decisions for the set of factors Ω and to choose one or several projects that are most favorable for investment.As compared with the classical version of the fuzzy discrimination analysis method which uses the frequency tabular-numerical knowledge base and processes only the objective data, the proposed method of possibilistic discrimination analysis processes only the expert data and is based on the possibility tabular-numerical knowledge base.Taking into account the possibility distribution table, the algorithm of a possibilistic variant of the discrimination analysis method can be described as follows:(1)applying the well-known transformation principle, transform the conditional possibility distribution table to the conditional probability distribution table (Dubois and Prade, 1988; Sirbiladze, Khutsisvili, et al., 2010) as follows.Let, for ∀ωi(i=1,2,…,m) conditional possibilities be sorted out in decreasing orderπj1i⩾πj2i⩾⋯⩾πjni, then the conditional probabilitypjicorresponding to the conditional possibilityπjiis expressed by the formula(5)pj1i=(πj1i-πj2i)/1+(πj2i-πj3i)/2+⋯+(πjni-πjn+1i)/n;pj2i=(πj2i-πj3i)/2+⋯+(πjni-πjn+1i)/n;⋮pjni=(πjni-πjn+1i)/n;πjn+1i≡0.Note that formula (5) actually gives a probability distribution for each ωi∈Ω on the set of possible decisions D={d1,d2,…,dn}. Indeed, it can be easily verified that0⩽pjki⩽1andpj1i+pj2i+⋯+pjni=1. We use the obtained conditional probabilitiespjiin discrimination analysis instead of objective frequenciesfji, which certainly makes the method more reliable.construct positive pijand negative nijdiscriminations on Ω×D, i.e. calculate the specific compatibility levels which determine to what extent some factor influences (positive discrimination) and to what extent it does not influence (negative discrimination) the decision as compared to other decisions:The positive discrimination pijis defined as the influence level of the factor ωion the decision djas compared to other decisions. The negative discrimination nijshows the level of non-influence of the factor ωion the decision djas compared to other decisions.Remark 1It is understood that the notions of positive and negative discriminations do not complement each other (in general, pij+nij≠1) and therefore the influence of the factor ωion the decision djis represented in the form of pairs (pij; nij).Ifπjiare numbers of nearly the same order, then for the spectral decomposition of pijand nijit is desirable to take values αs<1 by the principle of the best correspondence to the experiment;to decrease the information entropy, construct the following weighted average positive and negative discriminations on the set of solutions D:(8)μj=∑i=1mpijwi,νj=∑i=1mnijwi,j=1,2,…,n,where wiis the weight of the factorωi,0⩽wi⩽1,∑i=1mwi=1;construct the possibility distribution ∀j=1,2,…,n on the set of possible decisions D={d1,d2,…,dn}:If μjand νjare numbers of nearly the same order, then for the spectral decomposition of the possibility levels πjit is desirable to take values β<1 by the principle of the best correspondence to the experiment;perform the ranking of possible decisions: π(d) is a level of the choice of a decision d, whereas the possibility distribution π introduces the preference relation ≽ on the set of all decisions D. We say that the decision diis preferred (or dominates over) the decision dj(di≻dj) if π(di)>π(dj) and the decision diis equivalent to the decision dj(di≡dj) if π(di)=π(dj).If it is necessary to select a unique decision, then a decision with a maximum valueπj0on the possibility distribution {πj} is believed to be the most convincing one:(10)πj0=maxjπj.Suppose that after the second stage of evaluation of the projects is completed, there remain n ranked projects with insignificant credit risks, and for each possible decision (project) djthe possibility level πjof its choice is calculated. Below we discuss the issue of possible financing of n selected projects in ℓ years.Let us assume that there are additional conditions for financing the chosen projects. In particular, it is known that for financing the jth project j∈{1,2,…,n} within the ith year i∈{1,2,…,ℓ}, aijmonetary units are required; the profit gained by the implementation of the jth project is cjmonetary units, and the monetary amount biis allocated to finance the chosen projects within the ith year.In practice, the amount of funding is as a rule insufficient to satisfy the selected projects. Therefore here we assume that for at least one i∈{1,2,…,ℓ} the inequality∑j=1naij>biis true.Taking into consideration the above-listed constraints, we have to find an answer to the question as to which of the chosen projects should be financed to get a maximum investment profit at a minimum risk. We propose the following solution of the problem.If we introduce the Boolean variables xj, j∈{1,2,…,n} by the rulexj=1ifthejthprojectisfinanced,0otherwise,we will obtain the bicriteria Boolean linear programming problem(11)max∑j=1nπjxj,(i)max∑j=1ncjxj(ii)∑j=1naijxj⩽bi,i=1,…,ℓ,(iii)xj=0∨1,where the criterion (i) is the decision on selection of a group of projects with maximum possibility, the criterion (ii) is the decision on selection of a group of projects ensuring a maximum profit, and the conditions (iii) are financial constraints.The purpose of solving problem (11) is to pick out and finance a group of projects with maximum possibility among the projects with a potential to ensure a maximum profit.Thus, the objective functions (criteria) are as follows:(1)f1=max∑j=1nπjxjis selecting a group of projects with maximum possibility;f2=max∑j=1ncjxjis receiving a maximum profit.If the aim of the first stage of the application of our methodology is to reduce the initial number of projects, and that of the second stage is to rank the remaining projects by their possibilities, in the third stage the selection is made among the projects with minimum credit risks. Then to solve problem (11) we apply the method developed by the authors for discrete possibilistic bicriteria problems (Sirbiladze et al., 2009; Sirbiladze et al., 2011).Let X is the set of all Boolean vectors satisfying the conditions of the bicriteria optimization problem. Then by considering the scalar optimization problem(12)λf1+(1-λ)f2→max,(x1,x2,…,xn)∈X,λ∈(0,1),with conditions (iii), where λ is a weighted parameter, we can find, in the general case, some Pareto optima (Ehrgott, 2005; Sirbiladze et al., 2009, 2011; Taha, 2011).The choice of a parameter λ depends on the preferences of the decision-making person (DMP) towards the criteria f1 and f2.Thus the bicriteria discrete optimization problem can be solved by the linear convolution of the criteria.The constructed mathematical model can be generalized. For example, in applied problems the following requirement can be met: if the kth project is financed, then the sth project should also be financed. To meet this requirement, we impose the following constraint(13)xs-xk⩾0.Constraint (13) does not essentially change the structure of problem (11). However, it should be noted that problem (11) represents a multi-dimensional Knapsack problem that requires the application of special methods, whereas by imposing constraint (13) we obtain a more general model.We have developed a software package supporting decision-making for optimal credit granting. The decision-making block consists of three main soft computing modules – the first is based on the expertons method, the second provides the software platform for the application of the possibilistic discrimination method, and the third is used to solve a discrete optimization problem.The software package was tested on concrete data. The required information was provided by the group of 10 experts from the Bank of Georgia and filtered according to our demands after consultations with the managers of the Bank’s crediting department.In the first stage of evaluation of projects, applicants were selected by the first soft computing module. Processing the information by the expertons method allows one to select only those competitors whose profile shows either an insignificant or, possibly, a low credit risk.Suppose the number of possible risk estimates for some competitor, i.e. the number of possible decisions (crediting risks) is equal to 4 (dj, j=1,…,4), whered1 is crediting with an insignificant risk;d2 is crediting with a low risk;d3 is crediting with an average risk;d4 is crediting with a high risk.Assume that the experts consider 4 possible decisions (i.e. the levels of credit granting risks for the concrete competitor) d1, d2, d3, d4. Instead of expressing their opinion by a value α∈[0,1], they provide confidence intervals which are included in the interval [0,1]: [a1, a2]⊂[0,1], where a1 is the pessimistic level of risk evaluation, and a2 is the optimistic level. Such an approach gives the expert a chance to use his/her knowledge and experience when determining the risk level.Below we present the results of risk level evaluation for one applicant project.The aggregate table of experts’ estimates has the following form (see Table 3).Let us consider 11 α -cuts from 0 to 1, and for each of the possible decisions dj, j=1,…,4 calculate two statistics for each cut: one for the lower bound of the interval and, the other, for the upper bound. By extending these statistics (see formula (1)) to the set of levels{0,0.1,0.2,…,0.9,1}, we obtain an experton as shown in the table below (see Table 4).An expertonA∼is then transformed as follows:•an averaged experton is calculated by taking a mean arithmetic value of the bounds for each interval;the averaged experton is reduced to the possibility distribution πj=pos({dj}), j=1,…,4 on the set of decisions D={d1, d2, d3, d4} by taking the mean values of all α -cuts for each decision;if necessary, a non-fuzzy set, the closest to the fuzzy one, is found.Using formula (2) we calculate the averaged experton (see Table 5).After calculating the mean values for each djon the set D={d1, d2, d3, d4}, we obtain the possibility distribution π={π1, π2, π3, π4 }={0.68636,0.56364,0.41364,0.43182} on D of identified risks of the considered competitor (see formula (2) ). Hence πjis the possibility level of the choice of a risk dj. The pair djand πjcan be written as a set of representations:{d1/0.68636,d2/0.56364,d3/0.41364,d4/0.43182},where, for example, d1/0.68636 denotes the pair: decision d1 and the value of the possibility level π1=0.68636 of the choice of the decision d1.To obtain a unique decision, we apply defuzzification by the principle of maximum possibility:πj0=maxj=1,…,4π(dj). In our caseπj0=π1=0.68636.This means that in conformity with the common opinion of the experts the experton gives preference to the decision (risk) d1, i.e. the considered competitor has an insignificant crediting risk. Such a decision, of course, permits the applicant to participate in the second stage of the competition.Using the expertons method algorithm for another candidate, we obtain the final possibility distribution on the set of decisions (risks){d1/0.472727,d2/0.409091,d3/0.586364,d4/0.490909},and the decision for this applicant is crediting with an average riskThis decision of the computer system excludes the credit applicant from the list of selected competitors for further consideration since only applicants with insignificant or low risks can be chosen.The second stage of the decision making methodology for investment projects evaluation involves a more detailed analysis of external and internal factors that determine the current state of activities and perspectives for each applicant. In other words, if in the first stage the expertons method based selection is done according to the classes of credit risks, the next stage chooses from the number of the selected candidates by evaluating certain factors characteristic of these candidates. Possibilities of the choice of candidates are evaluated by the method of possibilistic discrimination analysis. In our case, after processing data by the expertons method, for further consideration only eight applicants remained out of forty possible candidates considered in the first stage. Their data was then processed by the second soft computing module fully based on the possibilistic discrimination analysis.Let us define the basic factors ωk, k=1,2,…,9, by which the group of all experts will score a candidate seeking a credit.The following factors influencing the decision-making should be taken into consideration (Sirbiladze et al., 2003, 2011; Sirbiladze, Khutsisvili, et al., 2010):ω1: business profitability;ω2: purpose of the credit;ω3: pledge guaranteeing repayment of the credit;ω4: credit amount (monetary value);ω5: payment of credit interest rate;ω6: credit granting date;ω7: credit repayment date;ω8: monthly payment of a portion of the principal and accrued interest (repayment scheme);ω9: percent ratio of the pledge to the credit monetary amount.As mentioned, each expert evaluates each factor assigning to it the value 1 or 0. The experts fill in the template tables where djis the jth competitor and ωkis the list of evaluated factors.In our case,f̃jiis the value obtained by averaging over the number of experts (see formula (3)).f̃jidescribes the level of the ith factor for the jth competitor. Since the number of our experts is 10, the factors to be evaluated are ωk, k=1,2,…,9, and, after the preliminary selection, the number of competitors equals to 8 (dj, j=1,2,…,8).The aggregate table of values off̃jiis as follows (see Table 6).Using formula (4) we first calculate the table of values of the conditional possibility distributionπjias shown in the table below (see Table 7).By converting it to the table of values of the conditional probability distributionpjiwe construct the following table (see formula (5)) (see Table 8).Further, to calculate the tables of positive and negative discriminations, we take as the coefficients αs, s=1, 2, the values α1=0.25, α2=0.75 (chosen empirically for the “spectral decomposition” of the values pijand nij). As a result, (see formulas (6) and (7)) we obtain the table of positive and negative discriminations (see Table 9).We proceed with calculating μjand νjwhich are the weighted average values of positive and negative discriminations for the jth competitor (see formula (8)). The weight vector w={0.125,0.125,0.125,0.11,0.125,0.0775,0.0775,0.11,0.123} is defined by the group of experts.Taking the coefficient value equal to β=0.95 (chosen empirically for the “spectral decomposition” of the values of πj), we determine the possibility distribution on the set D={d1,d2,…,d8} (see formula (9)) (see Table 10).According to this table, the ranking of the considered projects by the possibility distribution {πj} is d5≻d3≻d4≻d6≻d2≻d1≻d8≻d7.Frequently, the investment amount has to be distributed among several projects. We can do this in the third stage of the proposed methodology.Taking into account the possibility distribution{πj}j=18of the chosen projects, which was obtained in the second stage, and the allocated investment amount, the third evaluation stage of the projects deals with the bicriteria discrete optimization problem whose solution makes it possible to arrange investment in a number of projects simultaneously.For all eight projects (the set of possible alternatives D={d1,d2,…,d8}) selected in the second stage after processing them by the possibilistic discrimination analysis method, we obtained the possibility distribution(14){d1/0.57692,d2/0.57758,d3/0.59902,d4/0.59307,d5/0.62056,d6/0.58958,d7/0.53659,d8/0.57416}.The Bank considers to grant an investment amount of 120 million dollars over three years (i=1, 2, 3), 40 million dollars per year (bi=40).The investment amounts aijrequired for the jth project in the ith year, as well as profits cjdue to the realization of the jth project in three years are shown in the following table.Using formula (12), data (14) and Table 11, we can solve problem (11) and (12).The objective functions guaranteeing, respectively, maximum possibility levels of projects selection, and a maximum profit have the form:f1=0.57692·x1+0.57758·x2+0.59902·x3+0.59307·x4+0.62056·x5+0.58958·x6+0.53659·x7+0.57416·x8f2=20·x1+45·x2+15·x3+25·x4+40·x5+30·x6+35·x7+20·x8Using the relationf¯i=fi/fi∗, wherefi∗=maxfi,i=1,2, in order to pass over to dimensionless values, we obtainf¯1=0.193653·x1+0.193874·x2+0.201071·x3+0.199074·x4+0.208301·x5+0.197902·x6+0.180115·x7+0.192726·x8f¯2=0.133333·x1+0.3·x2+0.1·x3+0.166667·x4+0.266667·x5+0.2·x6+0.233333·x7+0.133333·x8By solving problem, (11) and (12) forf¯1andf¯2we see that, in general, its solution depends on a choice of the parameter λ (see (12)).The results of solution of problem (11) and (12) obtained for different values of the parameter λ are shown in the following table (see Table 12).As we can see, for λ∈[0;0.4] an optimal solution is the group of projects {d1, d2, d3, d5, d6}, for λ∈[0.5;0.8] an optimal solution is the group of projects {d1, d2, d3, d4, d6}, and for λ∈[0.9;1] we have an optimal solution {d1, d3, d4, d5, d6}.The choice of λ from the interval [0;0.4] means that the DMP is more inclined to the subjective criterion f1, whereas other chosen values of λ mean that the DMP is inclined to the objective criterion f2.
