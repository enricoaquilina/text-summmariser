@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This paper presents a new relaxation technique to globally optimize mixed-integer polynomial programming problems that arise in many engineering and management contexts. Using a bilinear term as the basic building block, the underlying idea involves the discretization of one of the variables up to a chosen accuracy level (Teles, J.P., Castro, P.M., Matos, H.A. (2013). Multiparametric disaggregation technique for global optimization of polynomial programming problems. J. Glob. Optim. 55, 227–251), by means of a radix-based numeric representation system, coupled with a residual variable to effectively make its domain continuous. Binary variables are added to the formulation to choose the appropriate digit for each position together with new sets of continuous variables and constraints leading to the transformation of the original mixed-integer non-linear problem into a larger one of the mixed-integer linear programming type. The new underestimation approach can be made as tight as desired and is shown capable of providing considerably better lower bounds than a widely used global optimization solver for a specific class of design problems involving bilinear terms.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Decision-making problems, such as production planning, location and distribution (Horst and Tuy, 1993), risk management (Sherali et al., 1995), water usage and treatment networks (Teles et al., 2012), chemical process design (pooling and blending) and others in engineering design (Duffin et al., 1967; Floudas and Pardalos, 1990) are very often formulated as multivariate polynomial problems under polynomial constraints. Finding the global optimal solution of such problems can be a difficult task because many special cases of it, such as the non-convex quadratic optimization problem, are known to be NP-hard. Intense research activity has been carried out on polynomial programming (PP) and several algorithms have been proposed in the literature. Some of these works (Shor, 1987; Nesterov, 1997; Lasserre, 2001; Parrilo, 2002; Nie et al., 2006; Pena et al., 2008) concern representation theorems to characterize the set of polynomials that are non-negative on a given domain. All the PP-based approaches rely on the construction of sums-of-squares (SOS) certificates of non-negativity for a suitable representation of the PP problem. Although the resulting hierarchies yield very tight approximations of the original PP problem, they suffer from a common limitation, namely the explosion in size of the semidefinite relaxations involved, which affects formulations of combinatorial problems as PP. One way to overcome this difficulty is to exploit problem structure. This can be done either by taking advantage of symmetry (Klerk et al., 2007; Klerk, 2010) or by exploiting sparsity (Kojima et al., 2003; Waki et al., 2006; Waki et al., 2008; Nie and Demmel, 2008; Kojima and Muramatsu, 2009). However, in the absence of any favorable structure, the practical application of the SOS approach is severely limited. More recently, Ghaddar et al. (2011) propose an iterative scheme that improves the semidefinite relaxations to approximate polynomial programs without incurring exponential growth in their size. They use a dynamic scheme to generate valid polynomial inequalities for general polynomial programs. These valid inequalities are then used to construct better approximations of the original problem.The Reformulation–Linearization-Technique (RLT) (Adams and Sherali, 1986; Adams and Sherali, 1990; Adams and Sherali, 1993) generates tight linear programming relaxations for not only constructing exact solution algorithms but also to design powerful heuristic procedures for large classes of discrete combinatorial and continuous non-convex programming problems. Focus has been on 0–1 and mixed 0–1 linear and polynomial programs (Sherali and Adams, 1990; Sherali and Adams, 1994), as well as on the more general family of continuous, non-convex polynomial programming problems (Sherali and Tuncbilek, 1992; Sherali, 1998; Sherali and Wang, 2001). For the family of mixed 0–1 polynomial programs, the RLT generates an n-level hierarchy, with the nth level providing an explicit algebraic characterization of the convex hull of feasible solutions (Sherali and Driscoll, 2002; Sherali and Desai, 2005). The RLT essentially consists of two steps: (i) a reformulation step in which certain additional non-linear valid inequalities are automatically generated, and (ii) a linearization step in which each product term is replaced by a single continuous variable. The level of the hierarchy directly corresponds to the degree of the polynomial terms produced during the reformulation stage. Although the RLT algorithm is very promising in solving polynomial programming problems, it needs to generate a high amount of bounded constraints at the expense of a large increase in problem size, leading to heavy computational burden. For the continuous case, (Sherali and Tuncbilek, 1992) prescribe an RLT process that employs suitable polynomial factors to generate additional polynomial constraints through a multiplication process, which upon linearization through variable redefinitions, produces a linear programming relaxation used together with a suitably designed partitioning technique that attempts to reduce the error between the original non-linear and their resulting linearized terms. The goal was to develop an algorithm that was proven to converge to a global optimum. Special classes of polynomial constraints based on grid factors, Lagrange interpolating polynomials, and mean value theorem constraints can be generated to further tighten these RLT relaxations (Sherali and Tuncbilek, 1997). While RLT essentially operates on polynomial functions having integral exponents, many engineering design applications lead to polynomial programs having general rational exponents. For such problems, a global optimization technique has been designed (Sherali, 1998) by introducing a new level of approximation at the reformulation step, and accordingly, redesigning the partition scheme in order to induce the overall sequence of relaxations to become exact in the limit.Li and Chou (1994) proposed a method for solving the PP problem, based on the multi-level single linkage technique to obtain a global optimum at a pre-specified confidence level. The difficulty is that a large amount of non-linear optimization problems based on various starting points are required, resulting in a heavy computational burden. Li and Chang (1998) derived a 0–1 linearization approach. However, it can only solve PP problems of small size.Polynomial problems with solely binary variables (polynomial 0–1 formulations) are a special class that can be found in multi-project scheduling (Pritsker et al., 1969), accounting control systems (Hamlen, 1980), facility allocation (Curry and Skeith, 1969), capital budgeting (Mao and Wallingford, 1968; Peterson and Laughhunn, 1971), cluster analysis (Rao, 1971) and media selection (Zangwill, 1965). Previously reported exact solution methods in the literature that deal with these particular formulations can be classified into four groups: reduction methods to an unconstrained problem (Sinclair, 1986), linearization methods (Glover and Woolsey, 1973, 1974; Watters, 1981; Sherali and Adams, 1999), cutting-plane methods (Granot et al., 1982; Lasserre, 2004) and implicit enumerations (Hansen et al., 1993; Li and Sun, 2006). According to whether this sort of problems is solved directly or indirectly via an equivalent two-level problem, implicit enumeration methods can be further classified into two subgroups. The first group includes relaxation algorithms (Lawler and Bell, 1966), which solve the problem directly without any transformation. The second group includes methods that tackle the problem by reducing it to a master problem (linear) with its secondary polynomial constraints (Hammer and Rudeanu, 1969; Snyder and Chrissis, 1990; Wang et al., 2007).Porn et al. (1999) proposed some convexification techniques for positive polynomial functions involving solely integer or discrete variables and applied it to a large bilinear trim loss problem regularly encountered at paper-converting mills. Lundell et al. (2009) extended the work to signomial terms with continuous variables, using power transformations in combination with piecewise linear approximations of the inverse power transformations to solve problems to global optimality. In order to eliminate the degrees of freedom regarding how the transformations are chosen, a method was given to determine which variables need to be transformed and what power values should be used. Lundell and Westerlund (2009) proved that the exponential transformation is always tighter than the negative power transformation for positive signomial terms. These convex underestimation techniques, as well as positive power transformations, where illustrated on a few signomial functions and compared to other methods used in global optimization solvers such as αBB (Adjiman et al., 1998) and BARON (Tawarmalani and Sahinidis, 2005). Additional information can be found in Lundell and Westerlund (2012).The method discussed in this paper can be seen as a new paradigm. Specific power transformations are applied to both convex and non-convex monomial terms in order to convert the general polynomial problem into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), which can be easier to solve to global optimality than the original mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP). The seminal paper for polynomials of continuous variables can be found in our recent work (Teles et al., 2013) where the transformation technique was named multiparametric disaggregation and the resulting MILP was an approximation problem, thus capable of generating an upper bound to the original minimization NLP. Using the same concept, we now show that problems with integer variables are actually a special case and propose an alternative formulation that relies on fewer variables and constraints. The shared concept is now named univariate parameterization for two reasons: (i) the bilinear term forms the basic building block and it is required to parameterize just one of the variables; (ii) its value will be determined by a sum of parameters multiplied by a set of binary variables mimicking the way numbers are represented.The main novelty is however the derivation of a relaxation approach to underestimate the solution of the original MINLP. By defining the exact value of the parameterized variables and monomial terms as a sum of approximation (shared with the upper bounding formulation) and residual variables, linear envelopes can be generated for the latter that become increasingly tight as the approximation becomes better. Note that the accuracy of the approximation with respect to the value of the parameterizing variables needs to be specified by the user.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 3, we discuss fundamental concepts related to numeric representation systems and show how to approximate a bilinear term using univariate parameterization. Section 4 reviews our previously proposed multiparametric disaggregation technique, upgrading it from a decimal to a generic base. The new closely related formulation is the subject of Section 5, while the highlight is left for Section 6, where we prove that both the under-and overestimating formulations give the optimal solution in the limit of absolute accuracy. In Section 7, we consider two simple examples and generate the full sets of constraints for the base-2 and base-10 numeric systems, as well as highlighting other important aspects. Further examples are addressed in Section 8, while Section 9 is concerned with performance evaluation on a set of larger test problems. Finally, the conclusions are left for Section 10.The polynomial programming problem considered in this work can be expressed as follows:(P)minΦ0(x)+α0s.t.Φq(x)+αq⩽=⩾0∀q=1,…,mΦq(x)=∑t∈Tqδqt∏i∈Iqtxiγqti∀q=0,1,…,m0⩽x̲i⩽xi⩽x¯i∀i=1,2,…,nx∈Nr×Rn-rwhere Φq(x), for all q=0, …, m, are multivariate, non-convex polynomial functions; αqare scalars; n is the number of non-negative variables, r is the number of integer variables, and x is the n-vector of variables, whose ith component is denoted by xi, which must lie between given finite lowerxiand upperx¯ibounds. Set Tqincludes the monomials and Iqtthe indices of the variables appearing in monomial t of function q. Exponents γqtiare rational and may be of either sign while δqtare scalars.Any positive real number xican be represented in a base-10 numeric system by the structure:(1)xi=a∞…a2a1a0.a-1a-2…a-∞=∑k∈Zak·10k,ak∈{0,1,…,9}The position of all ak’s in the sequence determines the digit’s contribution to the total value of the number and there is a single set that makes such a representation unique. The representation for variable xican easily be truncated on the left at point ηiby using information concerning its upper bound, Eq. (2). In contrast, truncating on the right at some point ψi, with ηi⩾ψiandηi,ψi∈Z, will in general lead to an approximate representation,x̃i, see Eq. (3). More precisely, ψiwill set the desired accuracy level for variable xi, which is being approximated up to K10,i=ηi−ψi+1 significant digits, whereaηiis the most significant digit andaψiis the least significant digit. As a special case, ψi=0 leads to an exact representation for integer variable xi(i∈Iiv).(2)ηi=⌊log10x¯i⌋(3)xi≈x̃i=∑k=ψiηiak·10k=10ψi·∑k=0ηi-ψiak+ψi·10k,aηi≠0An equivalent representation of Eq. (3) is given in Eq. (4), where the representative part of xi,Ni=aηi…aψi+1aψi, is positive integer.(4)x̃i=10ψi·(aηi…aψi+1aψi)10=10ψi·(Ni)10As it is well known from numerical theory, the system used to represent numbers in the conventional base-10 system can be generalized to represent numbers in any integer base β⩾2. It is also straightforward to use the expansion method to convert a number on the base-β representation to base-10. In order to avoid unhandled alphabetic letters, existing in other representation systems, the following will be limited to bases not higher than 10.The approximation of xiin a generic base-β system is given by Eq. (5) and the minimum number of positions Kβ,ithat are required to represent natural number Niin base-β, by Eq. (6).(5)x̃i=10ψi·∑k=0Kβ,i-1bk·βk,bk∈{0,1,…,β-1}(6)Kβ,i=⌈logβ(Ni+1)⌉As an illustrative example, consider a continuous variable with upper boundx¯i=408.279613and suppose that we are looking for an accuracy corresponding to K10,i=5 significant digits. Using Eq. (2) we have ηi=2 and thus ψi=2−5+1=−2, i.e.x̃i=10-2·(40827)10. Note that for a base-2 numeric system, K2,i=16 positional digits ranging from 0 to 1 would be mandatory, i.e. the same approximation would be written asx̃i=10-2·(1001111101111011)2.Let z12=x1·x2 be a bilinear term involving two non-negative and upper bounded real or integer variables x1 and x2. The term can be approximated(z̃12)by Eq. (7), where one of the variables is being approximated through a univariate parameterization (discretization) scheme and the other remains with a continuous domain. Letx̃1andx̃2give the approximation for the original variables, Kβ,ithe required number of digits for representing the approximation of xiin base-β and yi,j,kbe binary variables. The linearization of Eq. (7) by means of a new set of MILP constraints and disaggregated variables, using the decimal representation system, is the building block to tackle polynomial problems in Teles et al. (2013) being named multiparametric disaggregation (MDT). Following the description of MDT, a new univariate parameterization technique (UPT) is proposed.(7)z̃12=x1·10ψ2·∑k=0Kβ,2-1∑j=1β-1y2,j,k·j·βk︸x̃2∨z̃12=x2·10ψ1·∑k=0Kβ,1-1∑j=1β-1y1,j,k·j·βk︸x̃1,yi,j,k∈{0,1}The multiparametric disaggregation approach can be used to reformulate the original polynomial problem as an approximation MILP (Teles et al., 2013). The approach, presented using base-10, is now extended to a generic base-β numeric system by presenting the formulation for a monomial term with natural exponents. But first let us start with the transformation of the bilinear term.Remark 1Consider the approximation of the bilinear termz̃12=x1·x̃2=x̃12. It can be transformed into an equivalent linear term through the use of a new set of continuous (disaggregated) variablesxˆ1,j,k, see Eq. (8). Notice that the domain of position index k for the disaggregated variables is linked to the approximation of variablex̃2, expressed as a multiparametric sum of active powers as determined by the 0–1 variables y2,j,k, see Eq. (9). The original variable x1 is related to the disaggregated variables through Eq. (10), which must lie between the former lower and upper bounds, Eq. (11). Notice the appearance of variablesxˆ1,0,kand y2,0,kthat were not part of Eqs. (8) and (9), since index j∈{1, …, β−1}, to allow for the value of variablex̃2in position k to be equal to 0. Naturally, there can only be one selected digit j at position k, Eq. (12). The domain of the new set of variables is given in Eq. (13).(8)x1·x2≈x̃12=10ψ2·∑k=0Kβ,2-1∑j=1β-1xˆ1,j,k·j·βk(9)x2≈x̃2=10ψ2·∑k=0Kβ,2-1∑j=1β-1y2,j,k·j·βk(10)x1=∑j=0β-1xˆ1,j,k,∀k∈{0,…,Kβ,2-1}(11)y2,j,k·x̲1⩽xˆ1,j,k⩽y2,j,k·x¯1,∀j∈{0,…,β-1},k∈{0,…,Kβ,2-1}(12)∑j=0β-1y2,j,k=1,∀k∈{0,…,Kβ,2-1}(13)xˆ1,j,k⩾0,y2,j,k∈{0,1},∀j∈{0,…,β-1},k∈{0,…,Kβ,2-1}Any monomial termx1γ1x2γ2…xnγn, withγi∈N,i∈{1,…,n}, can be approximated by a linear expression through a recursive application of MDT given the required positions Kβ,ifor the chosen accuracy. The transformation procedure is illustrated by starting the parameterization with the variable with highest index, decreasing its exponent one by one in the resulting monomial and then proceeding from right to left, Eq. (14). Note that the superscript indices of the approximation and disaggregated variables are not actual exponents but simply a reference identifying the monomial being linearized (e.g.x̃12is a single variable representing the linearization ofx12and not the square of a hypothetical variablex̃1). The approximation of variable xiis given by Eq. (15), while (16) relates the approximation to the disaggregated variables. The latter can be different from zero only if the corresponding binary variable is active, Eq. (17). Finally, Eq. (18) ensures the selection of a single digit per position and Eqs. (19)–(21) identify the required model variables. The elements of the indices of the constraints and summations are given in Eq. (22).(14)x1γ1x2γ2…xiφi=x1γ1x2γ2…xiφi-1·xi≈x̃1…iγ1,…,φi=10ψi·∑ki∑j=1β-1xˆ1…i,j,kiγ1,…,φi-1·j·βki,∀i,φi(15)xi≈x̃i=10ψi·∑ki∑j=1β-1yi,j,ki·j·βki,∀i(16)x̃1…iγ1,…,φi-1=∑jxˆ1…i,j,kiγ1,…,φi-1,∀i,φi,ki(17)yi,j,ki·∏i′=1i-1x̲i′γi′·x̲iφi-1⩽xˆ1…i,j,kiγ1,…,φi-1⩽yi,j,ki·∏i′=1i-1x¯i′γi′·x¯iφi-1,∀i,φi,ki(18)∑jyi,j,ki=1,∀i,ki(19)x̃1…iγ1,…,φi⩾0,∀i,φi(20)xˆ1…i,j,kiγ1,…,φi-1⩾0,∀i,φi,j,ki(21)yi,j,ki∈{0,1},∀i,j,ki(22)i∈{1,…,n},φi∈{1,…,γi},j∈{0,…,β-1},ki∈{0,…,Kβ,i-1}A new transformation technique relying on the same univariate parameterization concept is now presented. Compared to MDT, this new transformation has the advantage of generating MILP formulations with fewer variables and constraints for the same accuracy level. To make it easier to identify the similarities and differences we rely on the same set of variables, even though they may have a different meaning and domain.Let us return to the simplest case, and to the bilinear terms x1·y2,j,k, generated from the left disjunction of Eq. (7). If we define a new set of variablesxˆ1,j,k=x1·y2,j,k, Eq. (7) becomes Eq. (8). Then, the McCormick (1976) envelopes can be applied to the product of a continuous and binary variable, resulting in Eqs. (23) and (24). We get an exact representation of the bilinear term since: (i) for y2,j,k=1, the outcome from Eq. (23) isxˆ1,j,k=x1; (ii) for y2,j,k=0 we get from Eq. (24)xˆ1,j,k=0. Notice that Eq. (24) is very similar to Eq. (11), the difference being the smaller domain for j. To allow for digit j=0 to be selected in every position k without such index being part of the domain of y2,j,k, the summation of the binary variables must now be lower rather than equal to one, see Eq. (25). As an example consider the representation of x2=7 using base-3. (7)10=0·32+2·31+1·30=(021)3. Clearly, the active binary variables would be y2,2,1=1 and y2,1,0=1. In contrast, in MDT, we would also have y2,0,2=1.(23)(1-y2,j,k)·x̲1⩽x1-xˆ1,j,k⩽(1-y2,j,k)·x¯1,∀j∈{1,…,β-1},k∈{0,…,Kβ,2-1}(24)y2,j,k·x̲1⩽xˆ1,j,k⩽y2,j,k·x¯1,∀j∈{1,…,β-1},k∈{0,…,Kβ,2-1}(25)∑j=1β-1y2,j,k⩽1,∀k∈{0,…,Kβ,2-1}The number of constraints can be reduced if the McCormick (1976) envelopes are applied to∑j=1β-1xˆ1,j,k=x1·∑j=1β-1y2,j,kafter noting that the lower and upper bounds for∑j=1β-1y2,j,kfor any position k are exactly those of y2,j,k(0 and 1), due to Eq. (25). One under-and one overestimating constraint lead to Eq. (26), which replaces Eq. (23).(26)1-∑j=1β-1y2,j,k·x̲1⩽x1-∑j=1β-1xˆ1,j,k⩽1-∑j=1β-1y2,j,k·x¯1,∀k∈{0,…,Kβ,2-1}The same basic principle can be extended to the case of a multilinear term involving all variables i∈{1, …, n}. Letx̃1…i≈∏i′=1ixi′represent the required set of approximation variables, bounded by0⩽∏i′=1ix̲i′⩽x̃1…i⩽∏i′=1ix¯i′. Assuming that the variable further to the left (i=1) is the only one not being parameterized, Eqs. (27)–(29) become the generalization of Eqs.

(14), (15), (17), (19)–(21), (30)–(32), with Eq. (32) indicating the domain of the different indices.(30)1-∑jyi,j,ki·∏i′=1i-1x̲i′γi′·x̲iφi-1⩽x̃1…iγ1,…,φi-1-∑jxˆ1…i,j,kiγ1,…,φi-1⩽1-∑jyi,j,ki·∏i′=1i-1x¯i′γi′·x¯iφi-1,∀i,φi,ki(31)∑jyi,j,ki⩽1,∀i,ki(32)i∈{1,…,n},φi∈{1,…,γi},j∈{1,…,β-1},ki∈{0,…,Kβ,i-1}The two univariate parameterization techniques (MDTβand UPTβ) approximate the original problem (P) by means of a MILP. More precisely, the domain of the parameterized variables is being discretized up to a certain accuracy level and so the resulting MILP is more constrained than (P). Thus, if the MILP is feasible, its solution will provide an upper bound to the solution of (P) (a minimization problem). While this can be somewhat useful, most MINLP local optimization solvers can also provide an upper bound to (P) given a good initialization point and they have the advantage of being orders of magnitude faster. What is really needed is a formulation that can find an underestimator to the solution of (P) so that an optimality gap can be computed for any given accuracy, set through the values of ψiand consequently Kβ,i.Let the exact value of parameterized variable xibe given by the sum of its approximationx̃iand a residual termx⃛i, see Eq. (33) where kiis the positional index belonging to the set of integer numbers in the case of the exact representation, recall Eq. (1). The maximum error that can be incurred is the gap between two consecutive discretization points, thus0⩽x⃛i⩽10ψi. For a generic monomial with natural exponents, the exact representation is given by Eq. (34). The approximation term is given by Eq. (14) whereas the bilinear term can be relaxed using the McCormick (1976) under and overestimators.(33)xi︸ki∈N=x̃i︸ki∈{0,…,Kβ,i-1}+x⃛i︸ki∈{Kβ,i,…,+∞}(34)x1γ1x2γ2…xiφi︸monomial=x1…iγ1,…,φi︸singlevariable=x1…iγ1,…,φi-1︸variable·(x̃i+x⃛i)=x̃1…iγ1,…,φi︸variable+x1…iγ1,…,φi-1·x⃛i︸bilinearterm=x̃1…iγ1,…,φi+x⃛1…iγ1,…,φiRemark 5Any monomial termx1γ1x2γ2…xnγn, withγi∈N,i∈{1,…,n}, can be relaxed by a linear expression through a recursive application of either univariate parameterization technique given the required positions Kβ,ifor the chosen accuracy, through Eqs.

Thus,limψi→-∞(x̃1…iγ1,…,φi+x⃛1…iγ1,…,φi)=limψi→-∞x̃1…iγ1,…,φi. It remains to show that the limit of this variable that represents the approximation of the monomialx1γ1x2γ2…xiφitends to its exact value. Using again the definition in Eq. (34), we have:limψi→-∞x̃1…iγ1,…,φi=x1…iγ1,…,φi-1·limψi→-∞x̃i=x1…iγ1,…,φi-1·xi=x1…iγ1,…,φi=x1γ1x2γ2…xiφiwhich concludes the proof.□Under the context of the MDT and UPT transformation techniques, mixed-integer polynomial programs can actually be considered a special case of non-linear problems. Whereas continuous variables being discretized will only assume the exact values in the limit of ψi=−∞, for integer variables this will occur for ψi=0. Thus, using such setting for pure integer problems will lead to the global optimal solution with both the under-and overestimating formulations. The latter has the advantage being potentially faster (see discussion concerning test problems nvs23 and nvs24 in Section 8) since it does not require the residual variables and its associated constraints.Concerning the applicability and practical implementation of univariate parameterization techniques it should be highlighted that they generate MILP problems that are typically one order of magnitude larger (both in terms of variables and constraints) than the original problem (P), being strongly dependent on the degree of the monomials. The problem size is a function of the accuracy level, growing logarithmically with the number of discrete points considered for the parameterized variables and linearly with the change of power (ψ value).Variables participating in bilinear terms may need to be disaggregated in some terms and discretized in others. As an example, consider z12=x1·x2, z23=x2·x3 and z13=x1·x3. Clearly, two variables need to be discretized (either x1 and x2, x1 and x3, or x2 and x3) but this will not occur in the same term (see test problem P2 in Section 7.2). We are thus still using univariate parameterization.For problems where the monomial exponents have a wider domain, i.e. either negative or positive fractional terms, elementary algebraic transformations can be applied to transform the original problem into one featuring monomials with natural exponents. More specifically, whenever any negative exponent term involving some variable xjis present in a constraint, we can multiply this constraint byxjp, where p is the greatest absolute value of the negative exponents appearing for xjin the constraint. Repeating this process for each variable in each constraint will convert the problem into form (P). Alternatively, for any variable xjthat appears in the problem with a negative rational exponent (−t), we can substituteup=xj-tand add the constraintupxjt=1to obtain an equivalent problem of the form (P).Finally, although positive variables are adopted frequently to represent engineering and scientific systems, it is also common to introduce free variables to model the system behavior. By means of a trivial change of variables, a problem with free variables can be replaced by one with solely non-negative variables (Tsai and Lin, 2008).Four small problems from the literature (P1–P3, zhuP1) are presented in this section to better highlight the differences between MDTβand UPTβand the similarities between the treatment given to non-linear and mixed-integer non-linear problems. We show the full set of variables and constraints required by the lower bounding formulations for P1 using base-10 and the upper bounding formulations for P2 for the case of base-2. For P3, we evaluate the different options available concerning the choice of parameterized variables.The mathematical formulations arising from UPT and MDT were implemented and solved in GAMS 23.7 using CPLEX 12.3 (1 thread) with a relative optimality tolerance of 10−6. The original NLPs or MINLPs were also tackled by BARON 9.3.1 (Tawarmalani and Sahinidis, 2005). Computational experiments were made on an Intel Core i7 950 @ 3.07gigahertz processor with 8gigabytes of RAM memory running Windows 7 Professional.Test problem P1 is a non-linear test problem with a feasible region consisting of two disjoint sub-regions (Lasserre, 2001). The objective function is linear but the two constraints include three multilinear terms featuring a single variable, x1. Therefore, this will be the only variable that needs to be parameterized. In order to replace the non-linear terms, new sets of variables need to be defined:x12,0,x13,0andx14,0. Given the upper boundx¯1=3, we can set η1=0 and write the lower bounding formulation as a function of the position of the least significant digit ψ1 for both UPT10 and MDT10, see Fig. 1.(P1)min-x1-x2s.t.2x14-8x13+8x12-x2+2⩾04x14-32x13+88x12-96x1-x2+36⩾00⩽x1⩽3,0⩽x2⩽4The computational statistics in Table 1show a very similar size for the resulting MILPs from MDTβand UPTβ. Taking β=10 and ψ1=0 as the example, there is one less binary variable, 4 fewer variables and 3 fewer constraints, simply because of the domain of index j does not include j=0 for UPT10. Notice that there are just 3 binary variables for UPT10 since we take into account thatx¯1=3and thus there is no need to consider j={4, …, 9} for k=0. Decreasing the value of ψ1 improves the accuracy of the approximation/relaxation as can be seen in Fig. 2, with the solution of the over-and underestimating problems rapidly approaching the global optimal solution, −5.508013. The values of variables x1 and x2 are given in the last two rows, with the number of decimals reflecting a continuous (six decimals for x2) or a discrete domain (six decimals for the parameterized variable x1 from the overestimating problem only for ψ1=−6).Test problem P2 is taken from (Floudas et al., 1999) and all non-linear terms are of the bilinear type. Both x1 and x2 need to be parameterized and we choose six significant digits (η=1, ψ=−4) to generate the full set of constraints of the approximation (overestimation) MILP for the binary numeric system. According to Eq. (6), and for N=100,000, we need a total of K2=17 positions for both variables.(P2)min6x12+4x22-2.5x1x2s.t.x1x2-8⩾01⩽x1⩽10,1⩽x2⩽10The complete set of constraints for the upper bounding MILP problems resulting from UPT2 and MDT2 is given in Fig. 3. Five approximation variables are required, two representing the original variablesx̃1andx̃2, and three other to replace the bilinear terms appearing in the constraints,x̃12,0,x̃22,0andx̃12.An important aspect is that x2 is being discretized in the linearization of two different monomials,x22and x1·x2, therefore according to Eq. (14) two sets of disaggregated variables are needed,xˆ12,j,k1,0andxˆ2,j,k1. Note also that the variable resulting from the left-hand side of Eq. (16) or Eq. (30),x̃121,0, represents the approximation of monomialx11x20, and thus can be replaced byx̃1. Another remark is that Eq. (31) is redundant for base-2.The impact of the new transformation technique on problem size is deeper for the binary numeric representation system, with UPT2 requiring half the number of binary variables and significantly fewer constraints than MDT2, see Table 2. With respect to the comparison between the decimal and binary bases, the latter typically becomes significantly more efficient with the increase in complexity, particularly for the underestimating problems. UPT2 and MDT2 exhibit roughly the same performance while MDT10 is considerably faster than UPT10 for P2. Still, for this test problem, the commercial global optimization solver BARON proves optimality of the original NLP three orders of magnitude faster (MDT and UPT require ψ=−7, see Fig. 4), being indisputably a better option.Test problem P3 corresponds to Problem 106 in Hock and Schittkowski (1981) and features five bilinear terms and three non-convex inequalities. It is now used to illustrate how the choice of parameterized variables affects solution quality and computational time.(P3)minx1+x2+x3s.t.0.0025(x4+x6)-1⩽00.0025(-x4+x5+x7)-1⩽00.01(-x5+x8)-1⩽0100x1-x1x6+833.33252x4-83333.333⩽0x2x4-x2x7-1250x4+1250x5⩽0x3x5-x3x8-2500x5+1250000⩽0100⩽x1⩽10,000,1000⩽x2,x3⩽10,000,10⩽x4,x5,x6,x7,x8⩽1000While the univariate parameterization techniques were described assuming that in the monomials the parameterization goes from right to left in terms of the variables index, it is straightforward to consider otherwise. Since the number of parameterized variables has a major effect on problem size, particularly in the number of binary variables, a sensible choice would be to select as few of them as possible, but is this really the best approach? To answer this question let us consider three different options ranging from 3 to 5 parameterized variables, see Table 3.Clearly the best option is to parameterize x4−x8 (P3c), since both the under-and overestimating problems can be solved in less than 200 CPUs for an optimality gap of 0.007%, with the overestimating problem being able to find the global optimal solution with an accuracy of 3 decimals already for ψ=-1. Naturally, this cannot be achieved with P3a since the parameterized variables are the only ones appearing in the objective function. In other words, the accuracy of the solution from the overestimating problem matches the accuracy of the parameterized variables. The other aspect worth emphasizing is that the domain of the parameterized variables (value of η) also affects the optimality gap. While in P3a η=(4, 4, 4) in P3b η=(4, 3, 3, 3) and in P3c η=(3, 3, 3, 3, 3), leading to a higher accuracy for P3a for the same value of ψ. Moreover, even if one compares P3a for ψ and the others for ψ−1, the performance of the former is still worse.Test problem zhuP1 is taken from Zhu (2005) and features two integer variables appearing quadratically in the objective function and linearly in the constraints. Clearly, both variables need to be discretized and η=4. As mentioned before, using η=0 guarantees a solution to the MILP that is global optimal for the original problem. However, it is not necessary to go that far, since the optimal solution of x1=0 and x2=75,000 can be obtained with ψ=3 using either the under-or overestimating problems, see Table 4. It should also be highlighted that the discrete variables of the MILP include integer variables xiand binary variables yi,1,k, while variablesxˆi,1,k1,0,x⃛iandx⃛i2,0are defined as continuous (check the required variables for the linearization of a quadratic term in Fig. 1). There are thus 4 residual variables and eight constraints (Eqs. (37) and (38) where φi=2) that are not part of the overestimating problem.(P4)min-16x12-18x1-7x22+12x2s.t.6x1-x2⩽100x1+2x2⩽1500000⩽xi⩽99999,xi:integer,i∈{1,2}We consider 14 MINLP test problems from the literature for validation and comparison purposes. Problem P2 is taken from Patil et al. (2012), zhuP1 and zhuP2 are from Zhu (2005) and the remaining 11 are part of the MINLPLib (http://www.gamsworld.org/minlp/minlplib/minlpstat.htm). We provide the results for global solvers BARON and LINDOGlobal and local solvers AlphaECP, Bonmin and DICOPT, which were obtained through the GAMS 23.9.5 interface of the NEOS server for optimization (http://www.neos-server.org/neos/) accessed January 22 and 23, 2013. The maximum computational time was set to 1hour.To provide a fair comparison, global optimization algorithms based on the proposed approaches were implemented and run on the same interface/server. These go along the lines of algorithm 3 in (Kolodziej et al., 2013). More specifically, mathematical formulations UPT2 and MDT10 are employed for generating the lower bound, initializing the continuous variables and fixing the integer variables of the original MINLP problem (P). Then, a fast local solver (in this case CONOPT 3) is to use to solve the relaxed MINLP and, in case the solution is feasible, to provide a tight upper bound. Starting with ψi=ηi, with the values of ηicalculated from Eq. (2), a pair of (MILP, NLP) subproblems are solved iteratively by making ψi=ψi−1 until the relative optimality gap is below 10−6 (recall that for integer variables, lower bound of ψi=0).The results in Table 5show that all but two problems can be solved to global optimality in a few seconds. The exceptions are nvs23 and nvs24 for which the optimality gap at time of termination for ψ=0 was still high (43% and 50% for UPT2, 30% and 57% for MDT10, respectively). It should however be highlighted that the UPT2 upper bounding formulation, which features fewer variables and constraints, can prove optimality for ψ=0 in 377 and 1873 CPUs when using CPLEX 12.3 in parallel mode (up to eight threads) and the hardware described in Section 7. Since these are problems with solely integer variables, global optimality has thus been proved (recall the discussion in Section 6.1). When compared to the commercial MINLP solvers, BARON is always faster, being able to prove optimality in under 30 CPUs. The other global optimization solver, LINDOGlobal, returns a higher optimality gap for nvs23 and nvs24 (55% and 68%). With respect to the local solvers, infeasible or suboptimal solutions are returned for at least 3 problems, with Bonmin being better than AlphaECP, which in turn overcomes DICOPT.A couple of aspects are worth highlighting concerning the UPT2/MDT10 upper bounding formulations. First, when in presence of MINLP problems requiring discretization of continuous variables, they may only provide feasible solutions at very fine discretization levels. As an example, while the just described global optimization algorithm can prove global optimality for ex1225 in a single iteration (ψ=0), the overestimating MILP formulation is only feasible for ψ=−6. Second, fixing the integer variables to the values from the underestimating MILP can lead to infeasible NLPs (e.g. nvs23, nvs24 and PatilP2 for ψ∈{1, 2}) and the absence of an upper bound. This does not mean that the upper bounding formulation is infeasible for such settings, which in fact is not (solutions equal to −484, −396 and 68 for ψ=1, respectively).To evaluate how the univariate parameterization techniques scale with problem size, nineteen test problems from (Teles et al., 2009) were also tackled using the hardware and software described in Section 7. These involve the optimal design of water-using networks, which can be formulated as a non-linear problem featuring bilinear terms resulting from the product of flowrates by contaminant compositions. They have been recently tackled by the overestimating MDT10 and MDT2 approach (Teles et al., 2012), leading to failures with respect to finding a feasible solution for Ex7, Ex9, Ex14–15, MDT10, and Ex9 for MDT2. For the feasible outcomes, and after initializing the variables of the original NLP, CONOPT failed to find the global optimal solution for Ex13, using MDT10, and Ex13–14 (MDT2).As the results in Table 6show, the new lower bounding schemes, by making the domain of the parameterized variables continuous rather than discrete, could always find a very good feasible solution for the resulting MILPs with the maximum reported optimality gap equal to 0.35% for Ex15 when solved with UPT2. The new univariate parameterization technique featuring the binary system was found more efficient than the new lower bounding formulation for the previously published MDT. This can be checked by the inferior computational time or lower optimality gap at the 3600 CPUs termination for the same value of ψ, or the ability to reach an higher accuracy (lower ψ) before reaching the resource limit (Ex7, Ex11–13, Ex20). In terms of problem size related statistics, the number of binary and total variables is again lower for UPT2 but the number of equations is now higher. This is related to the fact that the variables being parameterized are the compositions, which by being multicontaminant entities (meaning an additional index in Eqs. (41) and (42)) multiply the difference between K2 and K10.Overall, the two approaches could always find the global optimal solution when followed by CONOPT, similarly to BARON. Whereas BARON could prove optimality in just two problems (Ex5 and Ex8), MDT10 and UPT2 did it for 5 problems (Ex1, Ex4–5, Ex17–18) and in less than 7.1 CPUs. With the exception of Ex8, the optimality gap was always higher for BARON for the same 1-h maximum resource limit. Moreover, MDT10 and UPT2 were able to prove optimality within 0.1% gap in 79% of the cases, while for BARON the value was 26%.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#
This paper has described two techniques for reformulating a mixed-integer polynomial problem into one of the mixed-integer linear type. They involve discretizing the domain of some of the variables using a generic base-β representation of real numbers leading to an overestimating MILP. The new univariate parameterization technique has the advantage of leading to smaller problem sizes than its multiparametric disaggregation predecessor, enabling to reduce the number of binary variables by a factor of two when using the binary numeric system.The most significant development has however been a novel relaxation strategy, where the two underestimating MILP formulations were derived following the definition of new sets of variables, acting as residual terms in the calculation of the values for the discretized variables and linearized monomials. The lower bounding formulation complements its upper bounding counterpart, enabling one to compute an optimality gap for a given accuracy of the parameterized variables. This has been proven to tend to zero in the limit of an exact representation for the parameterized variables.The two univariate parameterization techniques have been validated using 14 MINLP test problems from the literature, exhibiting a better performance than local optimization solvers, being competitive to global optimization solver LINDOGlobal, while being outperformed by global solver BARON. They were also shown to perform better than the latter on a set of nineteen NLP water networks design problems, with the binary numeric system prevailing over base-10. Future work will involve further comparisons to piecewise relaxation methods and incorporating the underestimating formulation within a spatial branch-and-bound framework so as to obtain a more efficient approach for challenging industrial problems.
