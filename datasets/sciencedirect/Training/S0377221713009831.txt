@&#ABSTRACT@&#
To safeguard analytical tractability and the concavity of objective functions, the vast majority of models belonging to oligopoly theory relies on the restrictive assumption of linear demand functions. Here we lay out the analytical solution of a differential Cournot game with hyperbolic inverse demand, where firms accumulate capacity over time à la Ramsey. The subgame perfect equilibrium is characterized via the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations solved in closed form both on infinite and on finite horizon setups. To illustrate the applicability of our model and its implications, we analyze the feasibility of horizontal mergers in both static and dynamic settings, and find appropriate conditions for their profitability under both circumstances. Static profitability of a merger implies dynamic profitability of the same merger. It appears that such a demand structure makes mergers more likely to occur than they would on the basis of the standard linear inverse demand.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Most of the existing literature on oligopoly theory (either static or dynamic) assumes linear inverse demand functions, as this, in addition to simplifying calculations, also ensures both concavity and uniqueness of the equilibrium, which, in general, would not be warranted in presence of convex demand systems (see Friedman, 1977; Dixit, 1986, inter alia). However, the use of linear demand function is in sharp contrast with the standard microeconomic approach to consumer behavior, where the widespread adoption of Cobb–Douglas preferences (or their log-linear affine transformation) yields hyperbolic inverse demand functions. The same applies to the so-called quasi-linear utility function, concave in consumption and linear in money, that again yields a convex demand system. Indeed, both preference structures share the common property of producing isoelastic demand functions.2For a thorough illustration of these issues in consumer theory, see the classical textbooks: Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) and Varian (1992), inter alia.2Furthermore, such demand functions have been employed in rent-seeking games, where important contributions have been provided by Chiarella and Szidarovsky (2002) and Szidarovsky and Okuguchi (1997), which showed the strict relations between the rent-seeking games and the Cournot oligopoly models. An application to international trade is provided in Matsumoto and Serizawa (2007). The isoelastic demand function has also been widely analyzed in static settings (duopoly, Puu (1991), triopoly, Puu (1996)), devoting a particular attention to the stability of equilibrium and the possible chaotic implications (see also Puu & Norin, 2003; Puu, 2008).In fact, this is sometimes openly referred to in the field of industrial organization, where researchers mention the opportunity of dealing with non-linear demand curves, and then promptly leave it aside for the sake of tractability.3A noteworthy example in this respect is Shy (1995, pp. 53–54), using quasi-linear utility function to define the concept of consumer surplus.3Additionally, the econometric approach to demand theory has produced the highest efforts in building up a robust approach to the estimation of non-linear individual and market inverse demand functions, yielding a large empirical evidence in this direction.4See Hausman (1981), Varian (1982) and Varian (1990), inter alia.4A relevant market demand structure was proposed by Anderson and Engers at the beginning of the 1990s (Anderson & Engers, 1992), which deserves some discussion: calling Q the aggregate quantity of a homogeneous good andp(Q)the inverse demand function, they assumed the formp(Q)=(a-Q)1αto generalize the linear case (a>0is the market reservation price). Such inverse demand leads to different scenarios depending on parameterα: convex ifα>1, concave ifα<1, linear ifα=1, as is outlined by the following figures (see Figs. 1and 2).As can be simply seen, only the hyperbolic inverse demand function has an important technical prerogative: it admits an unbounded strategy space (or control space, in the differential game setup) for the quantity variables, which are feasible if they are positive. In other words, for every positive level of production, the market price of the good, and consequently the net revenue, is positive.With these considerations in mind, it appears desirable to investigate the bearings of hyperbolic demand systems on the performance of firms operating in oligopolistic markets, using thus a setup with solid microfoundations corroborated by robust empirical evidence, even though this is a costly approach in terms of analytical tractability.With specific reference to differential games, the use of linear inverse demand functions (jointly with either linear or quadratic cost functions) allows for the closed-form solution of the feedback equilibrium through the Bellman equation of the representative firm, as the model takes a linear-quadratic form and therefore one can stipulate that the corresponding candidate value function is also linear-quadratic. However, there is no particular reason to believe that a linear function describes correctly virtually any market demand in the real world, and therefore it is of primary interest to design, if possible, closed-form solutions of market games with non-linear demand functions. To the best of our knowledge, the only existing examples of differential oligopoly games with non-linear market demand are in Cellini and Lambertini (2007), Esfahani and Lambertini (2012) and Lambertini (2010). The first one uses a non-linear demand à la Anderson and Engers ( Anderson & Engers, 1992) and also investigates horizontal mergers, whereas the second one carries out a profitability assessment of small horizontal mergers subject to a sticky price dynamics. The third one employs a hyperbolic demand with sticky prices (as in Simaan & Takayama (1978) and Fershtman & Kamien (1987)) as well, but leaves the merger issue out of the picture. Other non-linear-quadratic structures are investigated by Jun and Vives (2004) and Koulovatianos and Mirman (2007).5For excellent and largely complementary surveys of differential oligopoly games, see Dockner and Gaunersdorfer (2001) and Long (2010).5The aim of this paper is to illustrate a way out of the aforementioned problem, offered by dynamic game theory. We are going to illustrate a dynamic Cournot model where firms (i) accumulate capacity à laRamsey (1928), (ii) bear an instantaneous cost of holding any given capacity, and (iii) discount future profits at a constant rate.We choose to model a dynamic accumulation of capacity in compliance with a recent stream of literature taking into account the relationship between production capacity investments and nonstandard demand structures. Namely, a dynamic programming approach to an optimal capacity choice problem under demand uncertainty was illustrated by Dangl (1999), whereas the issue of how firms adjust their capacity investments over time in presence of demand uncertainties has been recently studied by Genc and Zaccour (2013). Furthermore, specific consideration has been given to the issue of possible variations in demand structures6For a quite complete survey of all demand structures employed in operations management models, see Huang, Leng, and Parlar (2013).6in other areas of operations research literature such as supply chain modeling, where a vast related literature exists. Just to cite a few, examples of such approaches are Caliskan-Demirag, Chen, and Li (2010), where the choice of a nonstandard demand increases the chance to achieve coordination between supplier and retailer in designing a wholesale price contract, and Kyparisis and Koulamas (2013), where in a two-tier supply chain model with one manufacturer and many asymmetric retailers the Stackelberg equilibrium is characterized based on a general nonlinear inverse demand function.The main results of this paper are threefold.1.First, we determine the feedback information structure of the differential game both over infinite and finite horizon, solving in closed form the related Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman systems of equations when the accumulation dynamics is linear and the accumulation cost is a polynomial function of a generic degree of the firm’s capital endowment. When the accumulation follows a linear growth dynamics, the resulting feedback equilibrium coincides with the open-loop equilibrium, hence it is indeed subgame perfect.Secondly, we investigate the standard Ramsey Ak model where the inverse demand is a hyperbolic curve. By applying the above results, we are able to completely characterize the equilibrium structure. Some results on feasibility of states and controls and on the comparison between the firms’ profits in the static and in the dynamic frameworks are also featured.Finally, we use it to investigate the profit (or, private) incentive towards horizontal mergers, to find that taking a dynamic perspective widens the range of privately feasible mergers. In particular, the form of the demand curve is crucial to allow for profitable mergers to take place in all setups7To the best of our knowledge, scant attention has been devoted to the implications of dynamic competition on merger incentives, with the exceptions of Dockner and Gaunersdorfer (2001) and Benchekroun (2003), using a price dynamics à laSimaan and Takayama (1978) and Cellini and Lambertini (2007) adopting a Ramsey-type capital accumulation dynamics. All of these contributions, however, assume linear demand functions.7: That is, the presence of discounting, depreciation and a cost associated to holding capacity increases the firms’ willingness to merge horizontally, for any admissible merger size. Any merger, of course, has undesirable consequences on consumer surplus and ultimately for welfare (at least in this model, where the efficiency defense is not operating).The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 features the basic concepts on the static game, and subsequently the complete calculation and the related properties of the feedback information structure of the differential game with capacity accumulation over infinite and finite horizons. In Section 3 two applications are taken into account and characterized: the Cournot–Ramsey differential game and the analysis of profitability of horizontal mergers. Section 4 incorporates our conclusions and further possible developments.Consider a market where N single-product firms supply individual quantitiesqi>0,i=1,…,N. The good is homogeneous, and the market inverse demand function is(1)p(q1,…,qN)=aq1+⋯+qN=aQ.(1) is the outcome of the constrained maximum problem of a representative consumer endowed with a log-linear utility function(2)U(Q)=log[Q]+m,where m is a numeraire good whose price is normalized to one. The budget constraint establishes that the consumer’s nominal income Y must be large enough to cover the expenditure, so thatY⩾p(Q)Q+m. The representative consumer is supposed to solve the following:(3)maxQL(Q)=U(Q)+μ(Y-p(Q)Q-m).Solving the above problem, one obtains indeed the hyperbolic inverse demand function (1), wherea=μ-1>0.On the supply side, production entails a total costCi=cqi, wherec>0is a constant parameter measuring marginal production cost. Market competition takes place à la Cournot–Nash; therefore, firm i choosesqiso as to maximize profitsπi=(p(Q)-c)qi. This entails that the following first order conditions must be satisfied (given their form, it is not necessary to assume interior solutions):(4)∂πi∂qi=aQ-i(qi+Q-i)2-c=0whereQ-i≡∑j≠iqj. The associated second order condition:(5)∂2πi∂qi2=-2aQ-i(qi+Q-i)3<0is always met whenqi>0for alli=1,…,N. Then, imposing the symmetry condition on all outputs, i.e.qi=qj=q, one obtains the individual Cournot–Nash equilibrium outputqCN=a(N-1)N2c, yielding profitsπCN=aN2. If the N firms were operating under perfect competition, thenp∗=cand thereforeq∗=aNc.It is apparent that the above solutions (i.e., both the Cournot–Nash equilibrium and the perfectly competitive equilibrium) are well-defined and feasible for allc>0.In the remainder of the paper, we will turn our attention to a differential game where the demand structure is the same as here. We will separately investigate the infinite horizon and finite horizon cases.Several aspects of capacity accumulation and capacity-constrained oligopolistic competition have been treated in the latest years in all areas of economic modeling. For example, in Dawid, Kopel, and Kort (2013) a duopolistic market is studied where the firm with the smaller capacity on the established market has a higher incentive to innovate and attains a larger share on the market for the new product. In Garcia and Shen (2010), a dynamic oligopoly model is developed with a stochastically growing demand to analyze the inherent tension in market-based incentives for capacity expansion where capacity additions take place in the long run. Another dynamic model is provided by Besanko, Doraszelski, Lu, and Satterthwaite (2010), where in a Markov-prefect equilibrium framework a fully dynamic model of an oligopolistic industry with lumpy capacity and lumpy investment/disinvestment is described and analyzed.We intend to contribute to the theoretical side of the ongoing literature by employing the tool of differential game theory to model a dynamic N-firm oligopoly. We are going to consider a market existing overt∈[0,+∞), and which is served by N firms producing a homogeneous good. Letqi(t)∈(0,+∞)define the quantity sold by firm i at time t. Firms compete à la Cournot, the demand function at time tbeing:(6)p(t)=aQ(t),Q(t)=∑i=1Nqi(t).In order to produce, firms bear linear instantaneous costsCi(t)=cqi(t), whereC>0. Moreover, they must accumulate capacity or physical capitalki(t)∈[0,+∞)over time. If we denote withyi(t)the output produced by firm i at time t, we assume thatkiaffects the production ofyiin the sense that∂yi∂ki>0. Capital accumulates as a result of intertemporal relocation of unsold outputyi(t)-qi(t).8Of course, capacity decumulates wheneveryi(t)-qi(t)⩽0.8This can be interpreted in two ways. The first consists in viewing this setup as a corn–corn model, where unsold output is reintroduced in the production process. This interpretation is admittedly unrealistic (although systematically mentioned in the whole macroeconomic debate stemming from Ramsey (1928)) as it implies that the final good and the capital input are homogeneous. The second consists in thinking, a bit more realistically, of a two-sector economy where there exists an industry producing the capital input which can be traded against the final good at a price equal to one (for further discussion, see Cellini & Lambertini (2007)), this channel being used to finance investment projects as an alternative to borrowing from the banking sector (which otherwise should be explicitly modeled). In a nutshell, the Ramsey dynamics is a blackbox hiding a market where firms sell part of their production at a fixed price for fund raising aimed at financing their growth.Unlike the standard macroeconomic approach to growth models in a Ramsey fashion, here we will allow for the presence of an instantaneous cost of holding installed capacity. This cost will beΓi(ki(t)), possibly asymmetric across firms. In the remainder, we will refer to∂Γi∂kias a measure of the opportunity cost of a unit of capacity. We will employki(t)as the ith state variable subject to the following dynamic constraints:(7)dki(t)dt≡k̇i(t)=Gi(ki(t))-qi(t)ki(t0)=ki0>0,whereGi(ki(t))is aC2(R+)function affecting the growth dynamics of capital. The ith firm’s strategic variable isqi(t), while the ith firm’s state variable iski(t).A standard assumption in dynamic economic models concerns the kind of discounting: since the game takes place in a unique market, all firms discount profits at a same constant rateρ⩾0, possibly depending on monetary factors such as the expected rate of currency depreciation. The discount rate is assumed to be common to the entire population of firms since the latter are supplying a homogeneous good and use the same technology, i.e. they are a priori fully symmetric.The problem of firm i is to choose the output levelqi(t)so as to maximize its own discounted flow of profits (from now on, we will omit time arguments whenever possible):(8)maxqi∈R+Ji(ki0,t0)≡∫t0∞pQ(τ),τ-cqi(τ)-Γi(ki(τ))e-ρ(τ-t0)dτ=∫t0∞a∑i=1Nqi(τ)-cqi(τ)-Γi(ki(τ))e-ρ(τ-t0)dτ.We are going to adopt the dynamic programming approach, relying on the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations,9In the 1950s Richard Bellman extended the Hamilton–Jacobi theory, which was developed in the 19th century to describe and solve problems in Classical Mechanics.9generally considered as the most powerful tool in dynamic Game Theory and in a large number of economic models (both in discrete and continuous time).The issue to be tackled is the determination ofVi(ki0,t0), i.e. the optimal value of the ith objective functional (8), over the set of all feasible pathsqi:[t0,∞)⟶R. When the involved time horizon is infinite, the optimal value function does not depend on the initial time, but only on the initial state. In both cases, each optimal value function can be achieved as the solution of a Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation (for the complete derivation, see Dockner, Jørgensen, Long, & Sorger (2000, Chapter 3)).Callki0=k. Denoting withVi(k)the ith optimal value function for (8), the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) system of equations reads as follows:(9)ρVi(k)=maxqia∑i=1Nqi-cqi-Γi(k)+∂Vi∂k(Gi(k)-qi),for alli=1,…,N. Note that becauseJionly depends on the ith capital, in (9) the first order partial derivatives ofViwith respect to the remaining state variables do not appear.To proceed with the analytical solution of the feedback problem, we are going to determine the symmetric Nash equilibrium of the game. Suitable symmetry assumptions are commonly employed both in Static and in Differential Game Theory, in that the players are identical firms, having an identical initial capital endowment and identical payoff structures.10Note that in such a problem some asymmetric elements might be admitted when they do not change the HJB dramatically, for example growth rates or marginal cost parameters, but that goes beyond the scope of our paper.10This leads us to introduce suitable symmetry conditions from the beginning of the procedure: one isqi=qjfor alli≠j, saying that the equilibrium quantity must be symmetric across all firms. The assumption of symmetry across capitals states that, from the standpoint of a generic firm i, the rivals’ capacities (and therefore also their weights in the value function) must be equal when the respective growth dynamics and cost structures are equal.Proposition 1Assuming symmetry across all variables, the HJB equation of the problem is given by:(10)∂V∂k=ρV(k)G(k)+Γ(k)-aN2G(k),Maximizing the r.h.s. of (9) with respect toqiyields:(11)aQ-i(qi+Q-i)2-c-∂Vi∂k=0.Given that firms act on equal footing from the very outset (selling a homogeneous good produced with the same technology), symmetry can be assumed to operate at equilibrium across relevant variables and functions, i.e.q1=…=qN=q,V1=⋯=VN=V,Γ1(·)=⋯=ΓN(·)=Γ(·),G1(·)=⋯=GN(·)=G(·). Hence, we have that (11) yields the following expression for the optimal strategyq∗11Note that these first order conditions provide us with an intuitive explanation for employing the hyperbolic inverse demand instead of the isoelastic one. If we had an isoelastic demand, the HJB equations would read as:ρVi(k)=maxqia-∑i=1Nqi1α-cqi-Γi(k)+∂Vi∂k(Gi(k)-qi),and the related maximization would yielda-∑i=1Nqi1α-1αa-∑i=1Nqi1α-1qi-c-∂Vi∂k=0which cannot be solved forq∗in terms of the remaining quantities.11:(12)q∗=a(N-1)N2∂V∂k+c,which must be plugged into (9) to achieve:ρV(k)=N∂V∂k+cN-1-ca(N-1)N2∂V∂k+c-Γ(k)+∂V∂kG(k)-a(N-1)N2∂V∂k+c⇔ρV(k)=aN∂V∂k+cN2∂V∂k+c-Γ(k)+∂V∂kG(k)-∂V∂ka(N-1)N2∂V∂k+c⇔ρV(k)+Γ(k)-∂V∂kG(k)=aN2∂V∂k+cN∂V∂k+c-(N-1)∂V∂k⇔ρV(k)+Γ(k)-∂V∂kG(k)=aN2∂V∂k+c∂V∂k+c⇔∂V∂k=ρV(k)G(k)+Γ(k)-aN2G(k).□(10)admits the following family of solutions in any interval properly contained in the set{k∈R+∣G(k)≠0}:(13)V∗(k)=C∼+∫kΓ(s)-aN2G(s)e-∫sρG(τ)dτdse∫kρG(s)ds,whereC∼is a constant depending on the initial conditions of (10).Expression (13) is useful to characterize the standard cases. In particular, when the capital’s production function is linear and it does not involve fixed costs in absence of capital, it suggests us the following result:Proposition 3IfG(k)is linear,G(0)=0andΓ(k)is an mth degree polynomial in k, then one solution of(10)is an mth degree polynomial in k as well.By assumption, callG(k)=αkandΓ(k)=∑l=0mβlkl. Replacing such functions in (13) yields:V∗(k)=C∼+∫k∑l=0mβlsl-aN2αse-∫sρατdτdse∫kραsds=C∼+∫k∑l=0mβlsl-aN2αss-ραdskρα=C∼kρα+∫k1α∑l=0mβlsl-ρα-1-aαN2s-ρα-1dskρα=C∼kρα+∑l=0mβlαl-ρkl+aρN2,hence the solution corresponding to the choiceC∼=0is an mth degree polynomial in k. □By plugging the solution into (12), it follows that:Corollary 4If the assumptions ofProposition 3hold, the optimal feedback strategy is given by:(14)q∗(k)=a(N-1)N2∑l=1mlβlαl-ρkl-1+c.From expression (14) it is immediate to deduce that firms’optimal strategy is a decreasing function of the initial capital, and it is feasible (positive) irrespective of the parameters, and consequently of the industry under examination.Before investigating the finite horizon case, we should recall that in such cases sometimes the objective functional to be maximized isJiplus a scrap value. The scrap value depends on the terminal value of the state, and can be seen as a kind of terminal prize or a final product of the accumulation of the state (see several examples in Dockner et al. (2000)). Even if we are not going to consider any scrap value to avoid further technical complications, it can suggest a further interpretation for a corn–corn model. Provided that capital and output are proportional, the scrap value can represent a part of unsold output, which can be employed in a subsequent game starting after time T, as the initial condition for the new capital to be accumulated.On a finite horizon[t,T], where0⩽t<T<∞, the HJB system of equations of our problem takes the following form12The difference with respect to Eq. (9) in the infinite horizon case consists in the presence of the first partial order derivative with respect to time.12:(15)-∂Vi∂t+ρVi(k)=maxqia∑i=1Nqi-cqi-Γi(k)+∂Vi∂k(Gi(k)-qi),whereVidepends on both k and initial time t. Differently from the infinite horizon case, we must additionally take into account the transversality conditions on allVi:(16)limt⟶TVi(k,t)=0.Proposition 5IfG(k)is linear,G(0)=0andΓ(k)is an mth degree polynomial in k, then the system(15)admits the following solution:(17)V(k,t)=-β0+aN2ρ[1-eρ(t-T)]+∑l=1mβlαl-ρ[1-e(ρ-αl)(t-T)]kl.As in Proposition 3, callG(k)=αkandΓ(k)=∑l=0mβlkl. The maximization of the r.h.s. of (15) yields:(18)aQ-i(qi+Q-i)2-c-∂V∂k=0,then, by assuming symmetry on the relevant variables and functions, i.e.q1=⋯=qN=q,V1=⋯=VN=V,Γ1(·)=⋯=ΓN(·)=Γ(·),G1(·)=⋯=GN(·)=G(·), we have that (18) yields the following expression for the optimal strategyq∗:(19)q∗=a(N-1)N2∂V∂k+c,which must be plugged into (15) to achieve (the steps are analogous to those in Proposition 3, so we omit them):(20)-∂V(k,t)∂t+ρV(k,t)+∑l=0mβlkl-αk∂V(k,t)∂k-aN2=0.We guess a function of the following kind forV(k,t):(21)V(k,t)=∑l=0mAl(t)kl,whereAl(t)∈C1([t,T])and the transversality conditions areAl(T)=0for alll=0,1,…,m. Plugging (21) into (20), we obtain:-∑l=0mȦl(t)kl+ρ∑l=0mAl(t)kl-aN2+∑l=0mβlkl-αk∑l=0mlAl(t)kl-1=0,subsequently, all the coefficients of the powers of k are supposed to vanish, giving rise to the following dynamic system:-Ȧ0(t)+ρA0(t)-aN2+β0=0-Ȧ1(t)+ρA1(t)-αA1(t)+β1=0…-Ȧm(t)+ρAm(t)-mαAm(t)+βm=0.By employing the transversality conditions, we achieve the following unique solutions:A0(t)=-β0+aN2ρ[1-eρ(t-T)],Al(t)=βlαl-ρ[1-e(ρ-αl)(t-T)],for alll=1,…,m. Finally, substituting the found solutions in (21), we obtain the optimal value function in closed form:(22)V(k,t)=-β0+aN2ρ[1-eρ(t-T)]+∑l=1mβlαl-ρ[1-e(ρ-αl)(t-T)]kl.□If the assumptions ofProposition 5hold, the optimal feedback strategy is given by:(23)q∗(k,t)=a(N-1)N2∑l=1mlβlαl-ρ[1-e(ρ-αl)(t-T)]kl-1+c.From (23) we can note thatq∗(k,T)=qCN, meaning that the optimal strategy tends to the Cournot–Nash equilibrium at finite time irrespective of parameters and of the initial capital endowment. A direct comparison between the equilibrium quantities will be carried out in the next section.In this well-known example, in order to produce, firms must accumulate capacity or physical capitalki(t)over time. We chose to consider the kinematic equations for capital accumulation as in Ramsey (1928), i.e. the following dynamic constraints:(24)k̇i(t)=Aki(t)-qi(t)-δki(t)ki(0)=ki0>0,whereAki(t)=yi(t)denotes the output produced by firm i at time tandδ>0denotes the decay rate of capital, equal across firms. I.e., this is the familiar Ak version of the Ramsey model, whereA=∂yi∂ki>0represents the constant growth rate at which output is produced as capital gets accumulated, essentially a measure of output productivity. The related cost will beΓi(t)=bki(t), withb⩾0, representing the aforementioned opportunity cost of a unit of capacity.BecauseGi(ki(t))=αki(t)=(A-δ)ki(t), we can apply all the results collected in the previous section.13Since the differential game at hand is a linear state one, i.e. one where, if we callHi(·)the ith firm’s Hamiltonian function, we have that:∂2Hi(·)∂qi∂kj=∂2Hi(·)∂kj2=0for alli,j=1,…,N, (for more on linear state games, see Dockner et al. (2000, Chapter 7), inter alia ), the open-loop equilibrium is subgame perfect as it coincides with the feedback equilibriumq∗(k,t)yielded by the HJB equation. Moreover, this would hold true also in the more general case whereyi(t)=Gi(ki(t)), withGi′(ki(t))>0andGi′′(ki(t))⩽0. That is, state-linearity is not necessary to yield subgame perfection in a Cournot–Ramsey game. For more on this issue, see Cellini and Lambertini (1998) and Cellini and Lambertini (2008).13In particular, if we posit the following:β0=0,β1=b,β2=…=βm=0,α=A-δ,then the application of formulas (13), (14), (22) and (23) respectively entail:•Infinite horizon:V∗(k)=bA-δ-ρk+aρN2,q∗(k)=a(N-1)(A-δ-ρ)N2[b+c(A-δ-ρ)].Finite horizon:14As an ancillary observation, it is worth noting that here, since the feedback optimal strategy coincides with the open-loop one and the strategic contributions cannot be distinguished under symmetry, the co-state variable at initial time appearing in the open-loop formulation of the game, which we omit here for brevity, can be appropriately considered as a shadow price of an additional unit of capacity, while, in general, this is true only of the partial derivative of the value function at initial state (for more on this aspect, see Caputo (2007)).14V∗(k,t)=aρN2[1-eρ(t-T)]+b[1-e(ρ-A+δ)(t-T)]A-δ-ρk,q∗(k,t)=a(N-1)(A-δ-ρ)N2[b(1-e(ρ-A+δ)(t-T))+c(A-δ-ρ)].In order to ensure the feasibility (i.e., the positivity) of such strategies, we need suitable parametric assumptions. In the next three Propositions, we will choose A as the crucial parameter, so as to refer all conditions to the level of output productivity.Proposition 7In the infinite horizon case, if one of the following conditions:1.A>ρ+δ,δ<A<-bc+ρ+δ,In particular, in both cases we have to assumeA>δto ensure accumulation of capital (otherwisek̇i(t)would be negative at all t). IfA>ρ+δ, the numerator and the denominator ofq∗(k)are both positive, implying its feasibility. On the other hand, ifδ<A<-bc+ρ+δ, the numerator and the denominator are both negative, so feasibility is ensured as well. □Moreover, hereq∗(k)is constant whereask∗(t)grows unbounded in thatA>δ. We can easily compare the optimal output with the one in the Cournot–Nash static setup:Proposition 8In the infinite horizon case, we have that:1.ifA>-bc+ρ+δ, thenqCN>q∗(k);A<-bc+ρ+δ, thenq∗(k)>qCN.It suffices to evaluate the difference between optimal quantities:q∗(k)-qCN=a(N-1)(A-δ-ρ)N2[b+c(A-δ-ρ)]-a(N-1)N2c=-ab(N-1)N2c[b+c(A-δ-ρ)].□In the finite horizon case, the situation is different and we need to establish a time interval over whichq∗(k,t)is feasible. However, note that att=Tthe optimal strategy coincides with the Cournot–Nash optimal strategy:q(k,T)=qCN.Proposition 9In the finite horizon case we have that:1.Ifδ<A<-bc+ρ+δ,q∗(k,t)is feasible for eacht∈[0,T).IfA>-bc+ρ+δ,q∗(k,t)is feasible for eacht∈(t∼,T), wheret∼=T+1ρ-A+δlncb(A-ρ-δ)+1.We are going to consider the two different cases:IfA<ρ+δ, then the numerator is negative, hence we have to ensure that the denominator is negative too:b(1-e(ρ-A+δ)(t-T))+c(A-δ-ρ)<0⇔⋯⇔e(ρ-A+δ)(t-T)>cb(A-δ-ρ)+1.If the r.h.s. is negative, i.e.A<-bc+ρ+δ,q∗(k,t)is positive for allt∈[0,T). If the r.h.s. is positive, then:t-T>1ρ-A+δlncb(A-ρ-δ)+1,hence if we callt∼=T+1ρ-A+δlncb(A-ρ-δ)+1,q∗(k,t)>0over(t∼,T).Subsequently, considerA>ρ+δ, we have to prove the positivity of the denominator ofq∗(k,t):b(1-e(ρ-A+δ)(t-T))+c(A-δ-ρ)>0⇔⋯⇔t-T>1ρ-A+δlncb(A-ρ-δ)+1,thenq∗(k,t)>0over(t∼,T), meaning that the relevant condition for the restriction of the time interval isA>-bc+ρ+δ.□The next Figs. 3and 4sketch the behavior of the optimal strategy in finite horizon, showing the difference between its possible domains(t∼,T]and[0,T]in compliance with Proposition 9. As can be seen, the strategy is defined over the whole interval[0,T]only if A is sufficiently small, i.e. if the expansion of capital does not grow too fast.Now we are going to focus our attention on the dynamic behavior of the optimal capacity. If we substituteq∗(k,t)in the dynamic constraint (24), we can also achieve the expression of the optimal statek∗(t):k̇i(t)=(A-δ)ki(t)-a(N-1)(A-δ-ρ)N2[b(1-e(ρ-A+δ)(t-T))+c(A-δ-ρ)]ki(0)=ki0,whose unique solution is given by:(25)k∗(t)=k0-a(N-1)(A-δ-ρ)N2∫0te-(A-δ)sb(1-e(ρ-A+δ)(s-T))+c(A-δ-ρ)dse(A-δ)t.Now the joint feasibility ofq∗(t)andk∗(t)can be evaluated:Proposition 10Under the same assumptions as in Proposition9, ifq∗(t)is feasible and ifk0>a(N-1)(A-δ-ρ)N2∫0te-(A-δ)sb(1-e(ρ-A+δ)(s-T))+c(A-δ-ρ)dsfor allt∈(0,T], thenk∗(t)is feasible as well.It immediately follows from the positivity ofq∗(t)and from the expression (25). □The next Proposition provides the exact expression ofk∗(t):Proposition 11The optimal state of the Cournot–Ramsey game is given by the following function:(26)k∗(t)=k0-a(N-1)(A-δ-ρ)N2e-(A-δ-ρ)Tρ(e-ρt-1)++b+c(A-δ-ρ)ρe-2(A-δ-ρ)Tloge-(A-δ-ρ)T-(b+c(A-δ-ρ))e-(A-δ-ρ)te-(A-δ-ρ)T-(b+c(A-δ-ρ))e(A-δ)t.The explicit calculation of (25) needs the calculation of the related integral:I(t)=∫0te-(A-δ)sC1-C2e(ρ-A+δ)sds,whereC1=b+c(A-δ-ρ)andC2=e-(ρ-A-δ)T. We have that:I(t)=∫0t(-C2)e-(A-δ-ρ)s+C1-C1(-C2)eρs(C1-C2e(ρ-A+δ)s)ds=1C2e-ρsρ0t+C1C2∫0t1eρs(C1-C2e(ρ-A-δ)s)ds=1ρC2e-ρt-1+C1C2∫0t1eρs(C1-C2e(ρ-A-δ)s)ds.Then, applying the change of variablex=e-ρs, leading to the change of differentialds=-dxρx, we obtain:(27)I(t)=1ρC2e-ρt-1-C1ρC2∫1e-ρtdxC1-C2xA-δ-ρρds=1ρC2e-ρt-1+1ρC2∫e-ρt1dx1-C2C1xA-δ-ρρds=1ρC2e-ρt-1+1ρC2∫e-ρt1∑k=0∞C2C1xA-δ-ρρkds=1ρC2e-ρt-1+1ρC2∑k=0∞C2C1kxA-δ-ρρk+1k+1e-ρt1=1ρC2e-ρt-1+1ρC2C1C2∑l=1∞C2C1ll-C1C2∑l=1∞C2C1e-(A-δ-ρ)tll=1ρC2e-ρt-1+C1ρC22-log1-C1C2+log1-C1C2e-(A-δ-ρ)t=1ρC2e-ρt-1+C1ρC22logC2-C1e-(A-δ-ρ)tC2-C1.Finally, plugging (27) into (25) yields the complete expression (26) of the optimal capital:k∗(t)=k0-a(N-1)(A-δ-ρ)N2I(t)e(A-δ)t=k0-a(N-1)(A-δ-ρ)N2e-(A-δ-ρ)Tρ(e-ρt-1)++b+c(A-δ-ρ)ρe-2(A-δ-ρ)Tloge-(A-δ-ρ)T-(b+c(A-δ-ρ))e-(A-δ-ρ)te-(A-δ-ρ)T-(b+c(A-δ-ρ))e(A-δ)t.□Given (26), we can evaluatek∗(T), i.e. the terminal value of capital at the end of the time interval15We omit the most tedious calculations, reminding the readers that all of them are available upon request to the authors.15:(28)k∗(T)=k0-a(N-1)(A-δ-ρ)N2I(T)e(A-δ)T=-a(N-1)(A-δ-ρ)ρN21-eρT++b+c(A-δ-ρ)e-(3(A-δ)-2ρ)Tlog1-[b+c(A-δ-ρ)]1-[b+c(A-δ-ρ)]e(A-δ-ρ)T+k0e(A-δ)T.If we callπ∗=π(q∗(T),k∗(T))the profit function evaluated at the terminal instant T, we are able to compare it with the profit functionπCN=π(QCN)evaluated at the steady state in the static Cournot problem as shown in Section 2.1. Namely, we have that:(29)π∗=aNqi∗(T)-cqi∗(T)-bki∗(T)=aN-cq∗(T)-bk∗(T)==aN2-bk0e(A-δ)T-a(N-1)(A-δ-ρ)N2(1-eρT)++b+c(A-δ-ρ)ρe-(3(A-δ)-2ρ)Tlog1-[b+c(A-δ-ρ)]1-[b+c(A-δ-ρ)]e(A-δ-ρ)T.Proposition 12Under the hypotheses of Propositions9 and 10, ifq∗(t)andk∗(t)are both feasible at allt∈[0,T], then the Cournot–Nash equilibrium profit is larger than the Ramsey–Cournot equilibrium level at the terminal instant.It suffices to consider the difference:π∗-πCN=aN2-bk∗(T)-aN2=-bk∗(T)which is strictly negative by the feasibility ofk∗(t)at all instants, meaning that the Cournot–Nash equilibrium profit exceeds the Ramsey–Cournot terminal profit. □It is worth noting that comparing the two optimal strategies in the static and in the dynamic cases, one immediately sees that the presence of capital accumulation in the dynamic game plays a key role in opening the way towards a solution to the indeterminacy issue affecting the static game as the marginal production cost c of the consumption good drops to zero. Essentially, ifc=0, no solution exists for the static game if no strategy space is compact, whereas in the differential game with capacity accumulationq∗(k,t)is well-defined and feasible under suitable parametric conditions even when the marginal cost is zero, both over finite and infinite horizons.Propositions 8 and 12 suggest that at the subgame perfect equilibrium of the dynamic game the representative firm may produce either more or less but she earns higher profits when she plays the Cournot–Nash equilibrium of the static game, irrespective of the levels of marginal cost, opportunity cost, intensity of capacity accumulation growth and intertemporal discount rate.Having characterized the subgame perfect equilibrium of the differential game, we can now proceed to the analysis of its application to horizontal mergers.To illustrate the advantages of our approach to the feedback solution of the differential oligopoly game à la Ramsey, we illustrate here its applicability to the analysis of the private profitability of a horizontal merger, and its welfare appraisal.As is well known, a lively debate has taken place on this topic from the 1980’s, based upon static oligopoly models. A thorough overview of it is outside the scope of the present paper, and it will suffice to recollect a few essential aspects. Examining a Cournot industry with constant returns to scale, in Salant, Switzer, and Reynolds (1983) it is shown that a large proportion of the population of firms has to participate in the merger in order for the latter to be profitable. In particular, a striking result of their analysis is that, in the triopoly case, bilateral mergers are never profitable. Enriching the picture by allowing for the presence of convex variable costs and fixed costs, one may find a way out of this puzzle (in particular, see Perry & Porter (1985) and Farrell & Shapiro (1990)).Now take the static Cournot game and examine the incentive forM>1firms to merge horizontally, out of the initial N. Before proceeding, we deem necessary to clearly define what is meant here as horizontal merger by a subset of the population of firms: the merger creates a single firm whose property is symmetrically distributed across the owners of the previously independent firms, and the resulting merged entity has a single control as well as a single state. This view of the merger can be justified on several grounds. To begin with, our assumptions on product homogeneity imply that productive capital is also homogeneous across firms, and therefore the merging process involves that indeed all previously independent plans are homogenized into a single entity. Additionally, our approach to the modeling of the merger is in line with the antitrust norms currently adopted both in the EU and in North America (US and Canada), establishing that the firms proposing a merger shall reduce their collective capacity endowment lest they attain a dominant position after the merger has taken place (see Compte, Jenny, & Rey (2002) and ch. 5 in Motta (2004), among others). Of course, the capacity and output of the firm resulting from the merger are necessarily larger than those associated to a generic firm if the merger does not occur, but this is simply the natural consequence of the decrease in the population of firms. Therefore, we are going to compare the performance of a firm in two games, alternatively characterized by N orN-M+1firms, all else equal.After the merger (if it does take place), there remainN-M+1firms. If we callπCN(j)the profit of a firm in the Cournot static game among j firms, without distinguishing the original ones from those generated by the merger, we can prove the following:Proposition 14In the static Cournot game with hyperbolic inverse demand, the merger is profitable if and only ifN<M+M.Profitability holds whenπCN(N-M+1)M>πCN(N)⇔aM(N-M+1)2>aN2⇔N2>M(N-M+1)2⇔⋯⇔N2-2MN-M(1-M)<0,which entailsN∈M-M,M+M. SinceN⩾M, the necessary and sufficient condition boils down toN<M+M.□It is easily checked that, contrary to Salant et al. (1983), ifN=3andM=2, the merger is profitable.On the other hand, if we consider the terminal outcome of the differential game over finite horizon, in compliance with the above notation, we can assess the profit incentive scheme for an M-firm merger in the dynamic framework too, sticking to the assumption of one state and one control variable per firm.As for the assumptions of Proposition 9, ensuring the feasibility of the optimal strategy on[0,T], we can state the following:Proposition 15If a horizontal merger of M firms is profitable in the Cournot static game, then ifδ<A<-bc+δ+ρ, the same merger is profitable in the Cournot–Ramsey game on the horizon[0,T]as well.Provided that the net revenue at the equilibrium of the Cournot static game isaN2and the net revenue of the same game when a merger of M firms occurs isa(N-M+1)2, the profitability of a merger in the Cournot–Ramsey game is measured by(30)1Ma(N-M+1)2-bkN-M+1∗(T)>aN2-bkN∗(T),where we calledkl∗(T)the capital at time T under circumstances where a merger ofN-lfirms took place. In order to simplify the notation, callg(T)=1-eρT+b+c(A-δ-ρ)e-(3(A-δ)-2ρ)Tlog1-[b+c(A-δ-ρ)]1-[b+c(A-δ-ρ)]e(A-δ-ρ)Tas in (28). The inequality (30) becomes:aM(N-M+1)2-bM-a(N-M)(A-δ-ρ)(N-M+1)2g(T)+k0e(A-δ)T>aN2-b-a(N-1)(A-δ-ρ)N2g(T)+k0e(A-δ)T,which amounts to(31)aN2-M(N-M+1)2MN2(N-M+1)2-bk0e(A-δ)T1M-1+ba(A-δ-ρ)g(T)N-MM(N-M+1)2-N-1N2>0.By Proposition 14, the first term of (31) is positive when the M-firm merger is profitable in the static framework, the second term is positive for allM>1, whereas the remaining term is positive forA<-bc+δ+ρ<δ+ρ(the condition ensuring feasibility of the strategy over[0,T]by Proposition 9) if and only if the quantityN-MM(N-M+1)2-N-1N2is negative. In fact, we have that:N-MM(N-M+1)2-N-1N2=N-MM(N-M+1)2-1N+1N2<N-MM(N-M+1)2-1N+1M(N-M+1)2=1M(N-M+1)-1N=N-MN+M2-MNM(N-M+1)=(N-M)(1-M)NM(N-M+1)<0,where we exploited the inequalityN2>M(N-M+1)2. Hence, this completes the proof. □Taken together, these facts entail that the interval wherein the M-firm merger is profitable may be the same in the dynamic setup and in the static one, given that the measure of output productivity A is small enough.The examination of the welfare consequences of a merger is omitted, as it goes without saying that any merger would diminish social welfare, both in the static as well as in the dynamic setting. This is trivially due to the fact that the damage caused to consumer surplus always outweighs the increase in industry profits.16In line of principle, a merger could allow for some reduction in the total opportunity costs for the industry, giving rise to a possible efficiency defense argument (see Farrell & Shapiro (1990)). Although we omit the related calculations for brevity, it is quickly checked that this never outweighs the loss in consumer surplus necessarily generated by any merger. Hence, in this model the efficiency argument cannot be advocated to justify the merger itself.16Most of the existing literature on oligopoly theory postulates the presence of linear demand functions, this being quite specific in itself and, in general, at odd with empirical evidence. With this in mind, we have constructed a dynamic oligopoly model based on a non-linear demand. In particular, we have characterized the subgame perfect equilibrium of a dynamic Cournot game with inverse hyperbolic demand and costly capacity accumulation, showing that the feedback solution, coincident with the open-loop one, is subgame perfect. We have fully carried out the calculation of the optimal value functions and of the strategies of the differential game subject to a Ramsey-type dynamic constraint. Then, to illustrate the applicability of our framework, we have employed the model to analyze the feasibility of horizontal mergers in both static and dynamic settings, finding out appropriate parametric conditions under which the profitability of a merger in a static game implies the profitability in a dynamic game as well.Possible future developments of our findings consist in the analysis of the feedback information structure of further differential oligopoly games endowed with a hyperbolic inverse demand function, possibly in presence of more complex dynamic constraints dealing, e.g., with issues related to international trade, environmental and resource economics and R&D activities.
