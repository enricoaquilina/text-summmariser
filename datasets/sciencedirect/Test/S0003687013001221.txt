@&#ABSTRACT@&#
This contribution to the Ken D. Eason special issue is an illustration of the value of socio-technical analysis applied at an organizational level. We provide a brief historical overview of socio-technical IS research and review studies investigating the impact of IT on organizational structures in the last five decades, identifying a dominating (new) research theme in each decade. A key overall impact of IT in all decades has been a dramatic decrease in transaction costs making it increasingly easier for organizations to source from external providers. A five level taxonomy of sourcing arrangement is developed together with a framework of organizational activities, and a number of significant cases are offered of how organizations are sourcing practically all types of business processes, including innovation. We argue that future IT will further accelerate the movement towards more sourcing, eventually leading to a new type of organization that we call the Ambient organization.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Since the introduction of commercial computing in organizations in the 1950s, information and telecommunication technology (here abbreviated to IT) has been related to organizational change. This has attracted a large number of researchers contributing to a wealth of studies that investigate the relationship between IT and organizational change using a variety of research methods.This paper acknowledges Ken D. Eason as one of the significant contributors of the socio-technical research tradition and illustrates the value of socio-technical analysis applied at an organizational level. More specifically, by adopting a socio-technical perspective such as the one he represents, we attempt to explain how the development and use of IT in organizations over time has contributed to producing significant changes to the way organizations are structuring themselves and sourcing products, services, resources as well as business processes. Based on our analysis, we argue that we have not reached a saturation point regarding IT development, nor are we likely to reach this stage in the next few decades. On the contrary, we are likely to see an accelerated development of IT, which we believe will lead to a totally new type of organization and which we have chosen to name the ‘Ambient Organization’.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief historical overview of socio-technical information system (IS) research. In the third section, we perform a non-exhaustive review of studies investigating the impact of IT on organizations in the last four decades, identifying the dominant research theme in each decade. In the fourth section, we explain how the development of IT over time has contributed to a decrease in transaction costs, making it easier for organizations to increasingly source from the market rather than to produce internally. In the fifth section, we present a number of third party platforms facilitating sourcing before presenting a framework consisting of five different types of sourcing arrangements in section six. The seventh section discusses the future development of IT and how it can lead to the type of organization we have chosen to call the ‘Ambient Organization’. The paper ends with conclusions and projections for the Ambient Organization.The socio-technical research tradition is traditionally attributed to the Tavistock School founded in 1964 with researchers such as Fred Emery and Eric Trist (Emery, 1969; Emery and Trist, 1965). Another important locus for socio-technical research at that time was the Work Research Institute (WRI) founded in 1964 in Oslo, Norway, with researchers such as Einar Thorsrud (Emery and Thorsrud, 1976). Using the general principles of socio-technical research, researchers were first interested in studying the relationship between production technology and organizational structure (Woodward, 1981). Later, a number of socio-technical researchers identified the enormous potential of electronic data processing (EDP), later referred to as information technology (IT), and attempted to apply socio-technical approaches to study this technology. Among the pioneers in this new research field were Ida Hoos in California (Hoos, 1961), Enid Mumford in UK (Mumford and Banks, 1967), and a young cognitive ergonomist named Ken D. Eason (Eason et al., 1975). He joined the social-technical research tradition by forming, along with other researchers such as Leela Damodaran and Tom Stewart, the small, but very effective, HUSAT research group at Loughborough University. For an overview, see also Bansler (1989), Bjørn-Andersen et al. (1979), Briefs et al. (1985), Kling (1980) and Mowshowitz (1980).Since the implementation of commercial computing in the 1950s, the impact of IT on organizational structure has attracted a large number of researchers using various research methodologies to study the impact of IT artifacts on multiple aspects of organizations and individuals. This area has also been identified early as one of the core topics in information systems research (Culnan, 1987), and this stream of research is still actively pursued by numerous scholars.The methodology applied for re-constructing the historical overview, to a very large extent, was one of an exploratory tracer approach, where every publication that typically had a number of references, was pursued. Contrary to literature surveys for the last two decades, most of the material from the early days was not electronically available; conferences and working papers provided further information.Based on this analysis, we shall argue that the dominating research focus has changed over the last five decades in a way that each new decade can be said to introduce a new research stream. This does not mean that the old ones disappeared, as most of them continued, but each decade was dominated by a particular research design, which we identify as:•1960s and 1970s: IT impact on organizations and individuals1980s: IT impact on organizational design1990s: IT impact on inter-organizational design2000s: IT impact on organizational re-inventionIn this way, as we shall argue later, IT moves from being seen predominantly as an exogenous, deterministic influence to a powerful tool, useful in socio-technical design of new organizational forms, gravitating towards what we have chosen to call Ambient organizations.The introduction of commercial computing in organizations started in the 1950s, and from the very beginning, the potential of IT to produce changes in the role of individuals and on organizational structures attracted the attention of several researchers. For example, one of the earliest studies of IT impact applied longitudinal fieldwork to examine organizational changes associated with the implementation of mainframe computing in the 1950s (Mann and Williams, 1960). One area of particular interest was the impact of IT on organizational structures. For example, researchers speculated on the impact of IT on organizational structures by hypothesizing that organizations would become hourglass shaped because the need for middle managers would diminish (Whisler, 1970).However, the prime focus at that time was the impact of IT on workers. Researchers were speculating about the impact of computers (e.g., Hoos, 1960), and there were empirical investigations of the impact of IT on insurance clerks (Hoos, 1961), its influence on job content and job satisfaction of workers (Bjørn-Andersen et al., 1979; Mumford and Banks, 1967), its impact on middle managers (Robey, 1977; Stewart, 1972), and the nature and extent to which IT would create new work roles (Den Hertog et al., 1980).Investigating the impact of IT, and especially a more specialized area called human–computer interaction (HCI) (Waterson and Eason, 2009), was also center stage for Ken D. Eason in the late 1970s. For example, he found that while more advanced systems are likely to be more flexible and useful to managers, their higher complexity can also be an obstacle to their effective and full use (Eason, 1974). Another finding was the common mismatch between the sophistication of a user's task-related information needs and its ability and willingness to make the required effort to learn how to use the computer to perform the task (Eason, 1976). As such, the biggest challenge of computer designers is to find ways of serving the needs of infrequent users with open-ended tasks without assuming those tasks to exhibit more closed characteristics than is in fact the case (Eason, 1980). To allow organizational needs to define the design of IT, a higher involvement of users is needed in the IT design and implementation processes as well as a move from a one shot technology-led implementation towards a more evolutionary way of implementing IT (Eason, 1982).The first author of this paper had the pleasure of collaborating with Ken D. Eason on a project that was published nine years later as ‘Managing computer impact’ (Bjørn-Andersen et al., 1986). Technology was found not to be an exogenous, deterministic variable but a variable for which humans were able, to a large extent, to influence IT impact, for example, the desired level of centralization. Even though IT and computer systems were found to be very much the result of a design process, their eventual impact was found to be the result of more or less explicit choices taken early in the design process. Accordingly, it was argued that at any particular point in time the IT system for a given organization can have very different implications, and the concrete outcome is very much a function of design and implementation activities, as pointed out by Ken D. Eason in his book ‘Information Technology and Organizational Change’ (1988), which, for many years, was the textbook the first author used in his classes on the implementation of IT.Overall, the dominating perspective in the 60s and 70s was that computers (or IT) were a powerful exogenous force that had a deterministic impact on clerks, managers and organizational structure.The number of IT impact studies grew in the 80s, with the dominating research questions changing to relate more to the impact of IT on the process of organizational design. Given the accumulated knowledge about the predominantly negative impacts of IT on organizations and individuals, practitioners and researchers became interested in exploring how IT could improve the working conditions and the design of organizations in order to make them more effective and efficient. Among the major research perspectives used in this decade, two of them could be identified as being more closely related to the topic of this paper: the so-called socio-technical perspective spearheaded by Enid Mumford (Mumford and Weir, 1979) in the Ethics method, and the political perspective largely used to study the collaboration efforts with trade unions in the NJMF project (Nygaard and Bergo, 1974) and the DUE project (Kyng and Mathiassen, 1980). For an overview, see Bansler (1989).Both from the socio-technical and the political perspective, there was a strong emphasis on user participation or democratization of systems development. But the method and format were different. In the socio-technical perspective, which was also the one pursued by Ken D. Eason (1988), the actual end-users, who were to work with the new IT-system, took part in the systems design together with specialists and managers (Mumford and Weir, 1979). The basic premise was that users, specialists and management together should work out the proper design of the new systems, including its job design. From the political perspective, the premise was that in such a socio-technical process, users would not stand a chance, due to information asymmetry and lack of power. Accordingly, democratization would just be an effective way of implementing the new system, and if the users interest should be truly taken into account, the democratization process had to be anchored in ‘central support from the trade union for decentralized action’ (Nygaard and Bergo, 1974). For an overview, see Bansler (1989) and Bjerkeness and Bratteteig (1995).Regarding management, the beginning of the 80s brought the introduction of the Japanese management concepts of quality circles, flexible, agile and just-in-time (e.g., McMillan, 1996), as well as the very broad-based trend towards the concept of business excellence, as exemplified in the EFQM awards (see www.efqm.org). Moreover, this decade saw the development of new types or models of organizations, such as the ‘Shamrock organization’ (Handy, 1990) and the ‘Lattice organization’ (Gore, 1985). Even though many of these new organizational models, visions and concepts came from business schools and management consultants, they were, to a large extent, based on the development of IT as enabling new organizational forms.The need to look at organizations as part of value chains or value networks - instead of isolated individual organizations – became clearer in the 90s. General Motors was not competing with Ford; it was the full value network of GM cars competing with the full value network of Ford cars competing. (For textbook discussions, see e.g., Grant, 2010). As a result, optimizing for the organization itself was found to be much less effective than optimizing the total value chain or network and thus contributed to the development of inter-organizational IT systems such as electronic data interchange (EDI) systems (Krcmar et al., 1995). Since no chain is stronger than its weakest link, the implementation and use of new inter-organizational IT systems became a key strategy for many organizations.The development of new inter-organizational information systems and technologies contributed to removal of organizational barriers and facilitating communications between organizations. They also contributed to decreasing transaction costs and making it easier for organizations to source from the market rather than producing internally (Grant, 2010). This meant that for many organizations it became much more advantageous to concentrate on core business processes and outsource other business processes from external organizations offering ‘best-of-breed’ practices. These IT opportunities contributed to the creation of new organizational forms. One example was the very popular concept of ‘virtual organization’ (Dubinskas and Hargreaves, 1993; Handy, 1995; Malone and Laubacher, 1998; Mandy, 1995; Voss, 1996).Another related example was the concept of ’boundaryless organization’ propagated by former General Electric chairman John Francis “Jack” Welch, Jr. in his address to the shareholder meeting in 1990: ‘Our dream for the 1990s is a boundaryless company, a company where we have to knock down the walls that separate us from each other on the inside, and separate us from our key constituencies on the other side.’ A third example was the introduction of the concept of the ‘spaghetti organization.’ This name was given by the CEO of the Oticon Company, Lars Kolind, for the organization after its total metamorphosis. This case attracted interest of several researchers, such as Morsing and Schultz (1998), who carried out a comprehensive analysis of this new organizational model as well as Bjørn-Andersen and Turner (1998), who investigated the role of IT in this metamorphosis. IT provided for much more transparency, connectivity and knowledge utilization, leading to these new more effective organizational models.Within mainstream management, this decade saw the introduction of new management concepts, such as the ‘Postmodern’ and ‘Scandinavian’ management models, emphasizing a more democratic leadership style with a high level of delegation. It was realized in this decade that IT was making it possible to have centralized control and, at the same time, provide a substantial delegation of the decision-making processes due to higher level of overall transparency and accountability.In this first decade of the twenty first century the continuous development of IT contributed to increasing the competition in the business environment, for example, by reducing barriers to entry in several markets, increasing information transparency about costs and prices and making competitive advantages more difficult to sustain (Grant, 2010). This increasingly competitive business environment – combined with the increasing diversity and complexity of almost any product and service delivery, as well as the new information-based economy fueled by the World Wide Web and the Internet (Porter, 2001) – contributed to the emergence of new organizational models based on the principles of innovation and re-invention.Models such as the ‘New Virtual Organization’ and ‘New Virtual Eco-system’ were introduced in this decade in response to the new challenges that Evans and Wurster (1997) describe: ‘Over the next decade, the new economics of information will precipitate changes in the structure of entire industries and the way companies compete’ (p. 71). The CEO of Cisco, John Chambers, noted in the 2003 annual report: ‘The New Virtual Organization is the most fundamental and significant change in organizational structure, we have ever experienced.’ These networked organizations attracted researchers such as Hacki and Lighton (2001), who founded a subgroup of very successful organizations coined as ‘Network Orchestrators’. These organizations were able to establish comprehensive gated networks of suppliers and partners using standard functions as a lingua franca for exchanging information of all types. For instance, eBay became a particularly good example of a network orchestrator. Moreover, as their name suggests, these models went beyond the traditional virtual organization model in which only non-core business processes were outsourced. The rationale for sourcing core business processes will be discussed in detail in the next section.In summary, while not exhaustive, Fig. 1below depicts graphically the key IT-enabled organizational models discussed earlier according to their approximate time of adoption. Obviously, there can be some discussion about the exact position of the introduction of these organizational models. For instance, focusing on the time these organizational models were first introduced instead of the time of their more widespread adoption by organizations is likely to produce different results. However, the main thrust should be clear: IT does not have a deterministic impact, but IT has enabled novel ways of organizing, which are likely to be much more effective for a large number of organizations in their pursuit of providing value for their customers, as pointed out among others by Bjørn-Andersen et al. (1986).As we can see, there seems to be overwhelming evidence that the continuous IT development has contributed to the emergence of important organizational models over time regarding the creation of new working situations for workers and management. We argue that IT development has not reached a plateau. On the contrary, it will continue and even accelerate in the future. This will lead to the emergence of a new organizational model that we call the ‘Ambient Organization’ representing an organization that is even more networked, more distributed, more knowledge-intensive and to a much higher degree sourced from others than what we see today. The next section presents the theoretical arguments supporting these claims.For organizations, the costs of delivering a product or service to customers can be seen as consisting of two types of costs: production costs and transaction costs (Wallis and North, 1986; p. 97). Production costs (or as the authors term it, transformation costs) are defined as the costs of transforming inputs into outputs or the direct production expenses. Transaction costs, on the other hand, are defined as the costs of making an exchange or the indirect production expenses. Both of these two cost categories are dramatically changed when buying instead of producing using in-house production. Production costs are typically lower in the market, unless the company in question is the most low cost producer globally. Transaction costs, first coined by Commons (1931), later pointedly discussed by Coase (1937) in his insightful analysis of why we have firms, and most decisively discussed by Williamson (1995), include:•searching costs to find potential supplierstransportation costs to bring components to where they will be usedinventory holding costs to prevent fluctuations in supplyquality assurance costscommunication and coordination costs between the organization and its external supplierscosts of writing and enforcing contracts with external suppliersIf we first look at production costs, it is clear that the impact of IT has contributed to the reduction of production costs, e.g., through minimizing stocks, improving supply chains and creating more flexible production. However, it is also clear that production costs have been reduced both when using in-house production and when buying in the market. If anything, production costs have probably been reduced faster for the most effective low cost producer in the market than for a company not having this production as its core (Williamson, 1995).But if we look at transaction costs, we see a very different picture. With the exception of the costs of writing and enforcing contracts with external suppliers, IT and telecommunication have dramatically reduced all types of transaction costs over time. Today (and predicted to be even more so in the coming decades) the transaction costs for sourcing externally from the market are approaching the costs of sourcing internally from the organization's own hierarchy. Moreover, since the production costs of the most effective and efficient suppliers in the market are likely to be substantially lower than those of most organizations, we are seeing a strong tendency towards the adoption of various sourcing arrangements through which a decreasing number of processes related to the provision of products and services to customers are produced in a traditional hierarchy (Gurbaxani and Whang, 1991). Because of the dramatic decrease in transaction costs and the fact that most organizations will always be producing at higher costs than the best organizations in the market, it will become more advantageous for many organizations to source from the market rather than to produce internally. Continuous IT development in almost all areas of business is creating new opportunities over time for new ways of organizing and sourcing.In this way, transaction cost economics provides important theoretical reasons to explain the increase in sourcing adopted by organizations over time. In the words of Coase (1937): ‘Firms exist because the costs for frequent transactions are lower in a formal contract or hierarchy (internal production) than in the market’. Over the last more than 100 years, we have seen the emergence of large hierarchical organizations, mainly based upon the fact that it has been more advantageous to produce internally in the hierarchy rather than to buy in the marketplace. The tools and capabilities for managing and coordinating activities inside the organization have been far more effective and efficient than trying to manage and coordinate activities outside the organization with many suppliers and partners in the market. But this equation is reversed due to the introduction and widespread adoption of IT in all business processes, and we see across all industry sectors a widespread tendency to source from the market (Lacity and Willcocks, 2012).An important part of transactions costs not mentioned thus far includes the motivation costs related to sourcing from the market, which could be divided into costs of cheating or opportunistic behavior by the agent (Williamson, 1975), the so-called Agency costs (Milgrom and Roberts, 1992). These can reduce the extent to which organizations will source from external providers. For example, Agency Theory explains the agency costs resulting from having ‘others than the principal’ carrying out a specific task (Gurbaxani and Whang, 1991). As such, the decrease in transaction costs driving organizations towards sourcing from the market has to be balanced against the agency costs associated with the use of external agents. However, agency costs are also likely to diminish with increased use of IT, e.g., for supervision and control of the agent. Accordingly, we argue that the overall picture is one-directional: we shall see a strong increase in different types of sourcing arrangements eventually leading to an organizational model that we call the ‘Ambient organization’.Before beginning that discussion, we shall first present a new type of organization providing IT-based platforms that facilitate the transactions between companies interested in sourcing and external providers of sourcing arrangements. Later in section six, we shall provide a taxonomy of sourcing types, relevant for characterizing the development of how organizations are stripping themselves of non-core, as well as core, functions or processes.The IT development in general, and the Internet development in particular, have enabled the emergence of organizations offering new IT-based platforms for connecting buyers and vendors of sourcing services. These new IT-based platform providers contribute to decreasing the transactions costs related to outsourcing of business processes, including processes hitherto considered core. New IT-based cloud computing services are provided by traditional IT hardware suppliers (Intel, Cisco, Microsoft, IBM, etc.), facility management firms (Microsoft, Infosys, Cap Gemini, CSC, etc.), as well as new entrants such as Amazon and Google. A few examples of some of the most important new IT-based platforms are presented below.In the early days of the dot.com age, namely in the late 90's, we saw steep growth in so-called online or electronic marketplaces (e-marketplaces) supported by IT-based platforms. Gartner Group even predicted in 2000 that the number of those e-marketplaces would exceed 10,000 by the end of 2009. However, an overwhelming part of these original e-marketplaces have disappeared because the market liquidity was simply not there and did not come. Many reasons can explain this situation. First, vendors could not figure out how to avoid a perfect price competition eroding profits for everybody, and the winning vendor often got the contract with an unprofitable deal. Second, buyers were skeptical about the quality and reliability of supplied goods and services. Third, and partly as a consequence of the first two reasons, e-marketplaces had a hard time finding a sustainable business model that would make buyers and vendors come back and not trade outside the e-marketplace.Today, far fewer e-marketplaces have survived and flourished. For example, Amazon allows other merchants to sell their products to customers through its IT-based platform, and it has now become one of the world's largest online retailers next to becoming a major provider of cloud computing services. Another spectacular success is the Chinese business-to-business (B2B) e-marketplace, Alibaba.com. Started in 2003, the company now employs 12,000 employees and is boasting that at any point in time, they have about 6 million transactions between buyers and vendors taking place simultaneously. It offers unlimited trading for an annual fee of $300 for Chinese companies and $4000 for non-Chinese companies. One might say that Alibaba, to a very high degree, is enabling China to become the manufacturing hub of the world. However, Alibaba is not only connecting buyers and vendors through its IT-based platform, but it is also providing a number of services to facilitate online trading such as credit rating, logistics and procurement services. Interestingly, despite the high level of initial investment and the trivial initial amounts charged to customers for using its services, the combination of the very effective and efficient information systems - combined with millions of customers – yield very attractive revenues to such companies.As a natural extension of the outsourcing seen so abundantly within the IT field, a number of companies are now offering Business Process Outsourcing, where the outsourcer is sourcing full business processes from a third party. Large companies offering such services include US based companies (e.g., Accenture, HP and IBM) as well as European companies (e.g., Cap Gemini) and Asian companies (e.g., Infosys, TCS and Wipro), but there are also many smaller companies offering specialized services where they take over, e.g., the HR function, travel reimbursement functions, etc. (Lacity and Willcocks, 2012).We have also seen the development by external providers of new IT-based platforms supporting open innovation. These IT-based platforms support open innovation, for example, by facilitating the cloudsourcing and crowdsourcing of innovative ideas through the Internet. For example, Albert Angern and his research group at INSEAD have developed and provide the InnoTube platform (www.calt.insead.edu), a Web-based system aimed at supporting and stimulating innovation-centered knowledge exchange among distributed groups and communities. This IT-based platform includes more than twenty tools to support the sourcing of innovation from third parties.Another example of a platform to support innovation is the so-called ‘Mechanical Turk’ launched by Amazon in 2005. The Mechanical Turk is an IT-based platform designed to enable crowdsourcing of innovation by providing a website, an e-marketplace and a Web service on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) for the exchange of innovative ideas. Basically, the requester (an individual or an organization) places any type of human intelligence task (HIT) on the website with the use of an application programming interface (API). It is even possible for the requester to ask for particular qualifications of workers. Potential workers can then browse the various human intelligence tasks to find interesting tasks worthy of their time/energy and perform the selected tasks. Workers are paid upon delivery of their work through an electronic funds transfer via PayPal or Amazon's gift certificates.A final example is the IT-based platform provided by the open innovation company, InnoCentive, initially funded by Eli Lilly. InnoCentive helps organizations to achieve innovative business results by crowdsourcing innovative ideas from a Web community of about 200,000 experts. Basically, InnoCentive takes research and development problems related to a broad range of domains, framing them as ‘challenge problems’ for anyone to solve, and gives cash awards for the best solutions to solvers who meet the challenge criteria. It also provides a suite of training and implementation services called the Open iNnovation Rapid Adoption Methods and Practices (ONRAMP), which is designed to help organizations implement open innovation rapidly and successfully.The main effect of these and many other third party platforms is to reduce transaction costs for organizations wanting to source products and services, and, as we shall see below, this has had, and will continue to have, a huge effect.While the outsourcing phenomena started in the late 1980s within the IT field (Willcocks et al., 2004), it soon spread to other business areas, and nowadays organizations source not only manufacturing of products and services but also complete business processes in what is referred to as business process outsourcing (BPO). After an extensive analysis, we found that the different types of sourcing arrangements can be classified as follows, gradually moving away from the traditional sourcing of products, services, or business processes of the internal hierarchy (internal production) to the most remote and least controlled:1)Shared service center established as a cost center: sourcing is done from a shared service center which is owned by the mother company and provides services to the strategic business units (SBU) of the organization on a cost sharing basis (Grant, 2010)Shared service center established as a profit center: sourcing is done from a shared service center which is owned by the mother company and provides services to the organization's strategic business units (SBU) for a profit (Grant, 2010)Outsourcing: sourcing is done from a known external provider (Lacity and Willcocks, 2012)○Onshore outsourcing: outsourcing is done within the country of originNearshore outsourcing: outsourcing is done in neighboring countriesOffshore outsourcing: outsourcing is done overseasCloudsourcing: Sourcing of a service provided by a known external provider through the Internet, but where the exact location of the service being provided is unknown. This has also been described as third generation outsourcing (Rajan, 2010)Crowdsourcing: sourcing is done from an initially unknown external provider, which is typically rewarded upon delivery (Howe, 2006)In order to investigate the scope, feasibility and proliferation of these external sourcing arrangements, we need a comprehensive model of organizational activities. Probably the most well-known model for characterizing organizational activities is the value chain model developed by Porter (1985), identifying what he calls primary activities and support activities. Primary activities refer to activities related to inbound and outbound logistics, production, and sales and service. Support activities refer to activities related to procurement, infrastructure, human resources, finance and accounting. However, 25 years after the model was proposed, it seems dated in the sense that there is no explicit mentioning of innovation, which by researchers, business leaders and politicians is seen as the key challenge today. A Google search for ‘innovation research’ gave no less than 406 million hits. Although it could be argued that innovation is in every sub-category in the value chain framework, we find that it is so important that we extend the Porter's framework (1985) with innovation when we pursue our analysis of feasibility of sourcing arrangements, since we want to document that even a core activity such as innovation can indeed be sourced.In Table 1we use the five types of sourcing arrangements in the first column with increasing arm's length of the sourcing arrangement. The three remaining columns contain the primary and support activities from Porter, supplemented with what we term ‘innovation activities’. The main body of the table contains examples of organizations, which are transferring what we used to think of as typical core, strategic organizational activities to a sourcing provider. In other words, the organizations mentioned in the table use the various sourcing arrangements and, in essence, deconstruct the traditional organizational hierarchy.It should be stressed that the companies mentioned in the table are not meant to be representative. We are not interested in the average or median company. The companies have been carefully chosen because the examples are enlightening, critical or even paradigmatic (Flyvbjerg, 2004). The purpose is not to show what typical companies do; the purpose is to show that ‘if one of the least likely companies is sourcing from others, then it is likely that it will be relevant to others’. For example, when the world's largest and one of the most respected auto manufacturers, VW, decides to outsource one of its most crucial, core primary activities of internal logistics to DHL, it is likely that it will be relevant to others too.The first line in the table showing ‘Sourcing from a company's owned shared service center’ is becoming standard practice in organizations organized with independent strategic business units (SBUs) or lines of business (LOBs). Accordingly, there is no reason to point to specific organizations as examples. For the remaining four sourcing arrangements, we provide detailed examples below of organizations using these for each of the three categories of primary, support and innovative organizational activities.The primary activities consist of organizational activities such as inbound and outbound logistics, production, as well as sales and service. The traditional way of organizing these was a divisional structure, and General Motors in the 20's was an especially clear example of that. Every brand (e.g., Cadillac or Oldsmobile) had its own independent division, which had the full control of all primary activities. Ford had a Ford UK, a Ford Germany and a Ford US, but today Ford and GM manufacture global cars, where a number of important primary activities are sourced rather than produced in-house. In other words, activities are sourced from fully owned profit centers or SBUs (Grant, 2010).The strongest trend, however, is the sourcing from external providers, where an obvious example is that many organizations are outsourcing their production activities to relatively low labor cost regions such as Asia. As a result, China is becoming the manufacturing center of the world. Moreover, many organizations also outsource their activities related to inbound and outbound logistics. An interesting example is the Danish company, Bestseller, which is in the clothing fashion business. Design is done in the head office in Denmark, and all production takes place in China. What is more interesting is that all inbound logistics are outsourced to an external logistics provider, PrimeCargo, which takes care of all logistics from manufacturers in China to the central warehouse of PrimeCargo in Denmark, from where finished goods are distributed to retailers across Europe. Moreover, the B2C Bestseller e-commerce activities are outsourced to another external provider, Bootz, located in Sweden, handling the website and everything related to customer experience with the website, but they outsource the physical distribution to PrimeCargo.Business process outsourcing (BPO) is used by more and more organizations. Interestingly, this can also take place inside a fully-owned manufacturing plant. Volkswagen has chosen the external logistics provider, DHL, to manage the internal supply chain logistics of its manufacturing plant in Bratislava, Slovakia. No less than 800 DHL employees are now responsible for handling 50% of all production material, including inbound material receiving, material put away and storage, picking and kitting material, sequencing and delivering material directly to Volkswagen's production lines. Volkswagen's head of logistics in Bratislava, Juraj Janá, explains this sourcing arrangement as follows: ‘Logistics are essential in vehicle manufacturing. DHL has convinced us, due to its innovative concepts that they can provide a supply chain solution tailored exactly to our needs’.If we move sourcing even further away from the outsourcer (line four in Table 1) an example of cloudsourcing arrangement of primary activities comes from the company, Salesforce.com, which is offering a state-of-the-art customer relationship management (CRM) software package for marketing and sales as a software as a service (SaaS) solution over the Internet. Interestingly, Salesforce.com is itself crowdsourcing the service support and ideas for further development of its successful CRM software package from anybody signing up on their website. This crowdsourcing arrangement provides Salesforce.com with information about new requirements in a much more efficient way than do traditional competitors. Furthermore, the company can rely on a large community of users to assist each other in solving problems and, in this way, cloudsource service for their customers.Finally, in the last line of Table 1 we have crowdsourcing of primary activities. Another interesting example, apart from Salesforce.com, is the use of crowdsourcing for the examination of different types of scanned pictures in hospitals. Hospitals, especially in the UK and US, have found that it is much more advantageous to source highly skilled doctors, e.g., for x-ray examinations, from the virtual reality platform called Second Life than it is to attempt to hire the same doctors from foreign countries (e.g., India) and bring them physically to their hospital. The process of studying x-rays for tumors can be done anywhere in the world, and Second Life provides the marketplace for it.Support activities are listed in the second column of Table 1, and we see here that a huge number of companies are going through major transformations of their support activities by adopting new sourcing arrangements. These may take place within the same multinational organization, even though it may be organized with a number of very independent SBUs; for example, the Carlsberg group, which manages production and sales activities around the world centralizes its accounting activities in Poland to benefit from economies of scale. While this may seem a small step, this is hardly easy to do, considering the fact that the group consists of more than fifty previously independent breweries, each with its own brand, production, local market and administration.The second level is sourcing from a company owned profit center. A good example is Proctor & Gamble, which has established a global shared service center and centralizes all its activities related to accounting, finance, human resources and IT to achieve higher effectiveness and economies of scale. But there are also many companies who have restructured their IT function, as a company owned profit center (e.g., the Maersk group, which established its IT function as a profit center in the 90's, and in 2004 entered into a sale and leaseback agreement with IBM), moving the sourcing arrangement to the third category of outsourcing.Some organizations are adopting a more dramatic approach by sourcing support activities from external providers. A spectacular example is Unilever, which decided to outsource all human resource activities to the external provider, Accenture, due to ‘huge cultural and technical barriers involved in handling these activities internally’.Cloudsourcing support activities are also becoming more prominent over time for support activities. Even though cloudsourcing is a well-known sourcing arrangement for IT services such as sourcing IT operations centers, IT infrastructure, computer networks and software applications directly over the Internet, we are now just at the beginning of this huge market, according to the trade press (Gartner and IDC). For example, traditional IT vendors (such as Microsoft) are offering cloudsourcing of IT services on their Azure platform, and new players (such as Amazon) are entering what a few years ago looked like an almost blue ocean market. An interesting example is the very successful Danish company, e-conomic, which is offering accounting services and a simple ERP system for SMEs. This company now has approximately 50,000 customers paying as little as €25 per month for a basic accounting package delivered through a web browser. It is worth noting that with this type of sourcing arrangements, the start-up costs for client organizations are typically a fraction of the costs of acquiring and implementing a small ERP package.Finally, there is also an increase in crowdsourcing of support activities. A research team from HP used the Mechanical Turk IT-based platform provided by Amazon to collect tweets about 24 films in the week prior to the film premiere on a Friday night. Based on the results, they developed a prediction model, which was later tested on two films. For these two films, they collected 15,000 tweets in the last week before the opening. They used the Mechanical Turk platform provided by Amazon to ask workers to perform a sentiment analysis of the tweets. 3000 workers accepted classifying the tweets into positive, neutral or negative comments about the film. Each tweet was analyzed by three workers, eliminating assessments by workers which were not consistent or who were clearly outliers. The amazing final result was that they were able to predict with 95% accuracy the number of tickets sold at the box office in the first week after the film opening. Considering that the tweets were all from the week prior to the film opening before the film reviewed in traditional media, this is going a long way towards documenting the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ as opposed to using opinions from experts (filmmakers, reviewers, journalists), who would not be able to get equivalent accuracy in their predictions (Szabo and Huberman, 2010).Innovation activities are some of the most important organizational activities, as most companies find these activities absolutely critical for their long term survival. While for a long time it was not possible or advisable to outsource core organizational activities such as innovation activities, this is exactly what is happening for some organizations. Although establishing an internal research and development unit is a common practice, many other sourcing arrangements for innovation services have been tried out in practice by organizations. Xerox created the independent research center Xerox Parc in 1969, but it is probably fair to say that Xerox was not particularly successful in transferring innovations generated from the Xerox Parc into the main company. Accordingly, Xerox Parc was transformed to a wholly owned subsidiary in 2002 in an attempt to integrate it better with the main company.Some organizations have gone the other way and have decided to outsource innovation activities to external providers. An interesting example is the upscale Hi-Fi equipment manufacturer, Bang & Olufsen, which for many years has been a leader in the design of Hi-Fi equipment, based on what is called the Scandinavian design. While initially the head designer was Dane Jacob Jensen, the company decided in recent years to outsource the very crucial core activity of developing Scandinavian design to an American designer, thus partly based outside the Scandinavian countries.Some organizations have also successfully cloudsourced innovation activities from external providers. For example, the toy manufacturer, Lego, originally launched its Mindstorms product in 1998, which is basically a programmable robot. Users were encouraged to build their own robots and program them to perform particular tasks. Soon after the launch, Lego found that some MIT PhD students were breaking the software code to achieve new functionalities. After the initial dismay, Lego later embraced users wishing to contribute to their innovation, and thus the second generation of Mindstorms was developed by four members of the Adult Friends of Lego (AFOL) club, and was later tested by 114 invited AFOL friends.More recently, Lego has gone into crowdsourcing. Initially, this model for crowdsourcing innovations was tested in Japan on the so-called CUUSOO platform provided by third party, where users of LEGO could upload their designs, and other visitors could vote on the most innovative designs. From 2012, LEGO is using CUUSOO world-wide, and they are getting a large number of suggestions for new Lego products using this channel for crowdsourcing. Another example is the large pharmaceutical company, Eli Lilly, which is using the IT-based platform InnoCentive to actively perform crowdsourcing of ideas for innovation.As we can see from these examples, an increasing number of primary, support and innovation activities of organizations are being sourced to an increasing degree using the five different sourcing arrangements defined. The main reason for this growth in sourcing is the steep drop in transaction costs, making it increasingly attractive to buy in the market rather than producing oneself. This is a development which has been very strongly fueled by the spectacular advances in IT. But if we look at current IT developments, there is no reason to believe that it will not continue for a substantial period of time, making it relevant to ask what the long term impact will be on how we organize. We shall turn our attention to this issue in the following.In the previous sections, we have discussed the impact of IT on organizations, and we have demonstrated how the Internet, World Wide Web, e-commerce and e-business - in combination with significant advances in processing speed, storage capacity, and in the speed and capacity of telecommunication networks - are fueling these changes. Moreover, we have seen the extensive miniaturization, proliferation and distribution of IT, often referred to as the ‘Internet of things,’ which more than ten years ago was referred to as the concept of ‘ambient intelligence’ in the 2002–2006 Information Society Technology research program of the EU commission (Ducatel et al., 2001). In this document, ambient intelligence is defined as referring to:•Unobtrusive hardware (miniaturization, nanotechnology, smart devices, sensors, etc.)A seamless fixed or mobile web-based communication infrastructure (wired and wireless networks, interoperability between different devices, etc.)Dynamic and massively distributed device networksNatural feeling human interfaces (intelligent agents, multi-modal interfaces, models of context awareness, etc.)Dependability and security (self-testing and self-repairing software, privacy ensuring technology, etc.)Ambient intelligence, based on these technological developments, is expected to bring many changes and benefits to both organizations and individuals. For example, Ducatel et al. (2001) suggest that ambient intelligence describes a future in which ‘people will be surrounded by intelligent intuitive interfaces that are embedded in all kinds of objects and by an environment that is capable of recognizing and responding to the presence of different individuals in a seamless, unobtrusive and often invisible way’. This development will provide greater user-friendliness and user-empowerment, as well as more efficient support for services and human interactions. It will offer almost endless possibilities to individuals for searching, storing, analyzing, structuring, reproducing and disseminating information in the form of figures, text, graphs, sounds, and videos to anybody anywhere in the world with wireless devices, which for all practical purposes will have access to unlimited processing capacity, unlimited storage capacity, and unlimited telecommunication capacity allowing, for example, video broadcasting in high resolution or 3D. More importantly, this will allow individuals to collaborate with others in new ways, which is likely to be much more effective irrespective of physical location.These ‘unlimited’ processing, storage and telecommunication capacities will, in turn, enable new ways for organizations to organize and to source capabilities from other. We argue that this should lead to the emergence of a new organizational model which we call the ‘Ambient organization’ described in the next section.Since the introduction of the organizational model called the ‘virtual organization’ in the early 90s (Dubinskas and Hargreaves, 1993; Handy, 1995; Malone and Laubacher, 1998; Mandy, 1995; Voss, 1996), we have seen substantial IT developments as described above. We argue that these more recent IT developments are not just more of the same. They represent a qualitatively different era of IT development that is going to create organizations different from the traditional concept of ‘virtual organization’ in which only non-core business processes were outsourced. According to one of the pioneers of the Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, these technologies offer an alternative to hierarchy and market in the form of open collaboration with no or minimal investment costs for the relation (Benkler, 2006). While the 2002–2006 Information Society Technology research program (Ducatel et al., 2001) primarily discusses the implications of ambient intelligence for individuals, it does not specifically discuss its implications for organizations and industry structures. This is a shortcoming that we address here, since we believe that ambient intelligence will have huge implications for all business processes and will radically change industry structures in general, and in particular, change organizations to become what we call the ‘Ambient Organizations’.The ‘Ambient organization’ is defined as an organization utilizing ambient technologies and the lower transaction costs to sourcing most of its business processes. Since the costs of producing internally by definition will be almost higher than the production costs of the most effective and efficient organizations in the market, we are likely to see a growth in organizations using outsourcing rather than producing themselves. In other words, if the transactions costs are reduced, it will become an advantage to source from the best organizations in the market rather than producing internally.When this happens, the Ambient organization will redefine or reinvent its existing business model and organizational structures by sourcing its resources and capabilities in the form of resources, business processes and technologies from everywhere, notably from external individuals or organizations, which are not owned or directly managed by the Ambient organization. It builds strongly on contractual and even non-contractual short term sourcing relationships (cloudsourcing and crowdsourcing) in order to meet increasingly complex, competitive and dynamic environments and to deliver enhanced customer value. As such, the concept of the Ambient organization illustrates the fact that any modern organization needs to be present everywhere, whether it is procuring the best raw material, recruiting the best minds, manufacturing in the most optimal location in the world, marketing via social networks, selling in a range of different markets, serving and supporting a wide variety of customers, and last but certainly not least, innovating with customers and various business partners.
