Survey of Korean pedestrians' natural preference for walking directions

@&#HIGHLIGHTS@&#
The majority of pedestrians preferred walking on the right side, regardless of the location.No significant differences were found in the preferred walking direction by age or gender.Significant discrepancies in the preferred walking direction depending on pedestrians'dominant hand and foot exist.Left-handed and footed pedestrians are more likely to the Left-hand Traffic rules, while right-handed and footed are on the right side.The dominant hand appears to have a greater impact on the pedestrian's preferred walking direction than the dominant foot.

@&#ABSTRACT@&#
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the stereotypes of Koreans regarding preferred walking directions when encountering various public walking facilities, and to provide useful information to pedestrians and traffic policy legislators. To this end, this study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, we conducted observational research on pedestrians' walking directions in ten different situations. In the second phase, six hundred Korean male and female subjects were selected to investigate the various statistics about their preferred walking directions and their employment characteristics in diverse walking facilities. The results showed that 59.3% abided by the Left-side Traffic rule while 40.7% abided by the Right-side rule. On the contrary, 73.7% of respondents showed preferences to the Right-side Traffic rule. Moreover, right-handed people showed strong tendencies to walk on the right side of the road and vice versa, hence suggesting that the direction people naturally prefer in walking should be a crucial determinant when regulating traffic policies.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#
Facing Traffic, or Bidirectional Traffic, indicates the roads that allow two or more pedestrians to face each another while walking in opposite directions. The opposite of Facing Traffic is One-way Traffic. Facing Traffic encompasses two types of rules, Right-hand Traffic (RHT) and Left-hand Traffic (LHT), which depends on the traffic regulations of the sovereign country. According to Lucas (2012) and McGregor (2011), 66% of the world's population has adopted Right-hand Traffic, while 34% observes Left-hand Traffic. Of all the existing roads around the world, 72% of them have adopted the Right-hand Traffic rules, while 28% employ the Left-hand Traffic rules.It was not until 2010 that the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs of Korea (MLTMAK, 2011) amended walking regulations from Left- to Right-side Traffic rules in order to increase pedestrian safety and convenience and to be inline with global walking customs. Before the amendment, Article 13 Section 3 of the Korean Road Traffic Act stated that “You must operate your vehicles and horses on the right side of the center of the road (on the right side of the median line in cases where a median line is drawn on the road)” and Article 8 Section 2 stipulated that “Pedestrians shall walk on the left side of the road or along the wayside on roads where there is no separate sidewalk area.” Therefore, in the case of Korea, the regulations on traffic directions of automobiles and pedestrians were stipulated differently.After careful consideration of information acquired through survey responses and research results conducted by experts from various fields, including the findings from the current study, the MLTMAK decided to amend the walking regulations on 1 July 2010. As 34% of the world's population resides in countries that still stipulate Left-side Traffic rules (Lucas, 2012; McGregor, 2011), the current study on walking directions prospects to serve as a landmark for other countries to take into account.Reports have shown different transport directions of pedestrians and transportation modes regulated by different countries. Table 1indicates that pedestrians in Korea and Germany abide by the Left-hand Traffic rules while the rest of the countries have adopted the Right-hand Traffic rule. Additionally, it is shown that transport directions of pedestrians and automobiles remain different in some of the listed countries. Although countries including the United States, China, Sweden and Taiwan stipulate for a unified transport direction, countries such as Korea, Great Britain, Germany, Japan and Singapore appear to encompass inconsistent transport directions. Moreover, not only do the countries that require automobiles to be driven on the right side adopt walking on the right side, such as in the United States, Sweden and China, but countries that stipulate that automobiles should use the left side of the road also have adopted pedestrians walking on the right side. Regarding revolving doors, the countries that require driving on the right side generally have doors revolving counterclockwise (access on the right side) and vice versa, although this has not been shown to be universally applied (Beadmore, 2000; Lucas, 2012).According to Article 9 Section 1 of The United Nations Convention on Road Traffic (Geneva, 19 September 1949), “All vehicular traffic proceeding in the same direction on any road shall keep to the same side of the road, which shall be uniform in each country for all roads”, stressing the necessity for consistency in moving direction. In some countries such as the United States and Canada, where each state or province has its own legislature, different states may have different road rules, but in general they tend to not differ much. For example, no significant discrepancies across the states have been shown in the U.S. since traffic-related state rules and laws conform to the Uniform Vehicle Code (UVC) stipulated by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances.However, certain areas in Canada, France, Island, Italy, Portugal, Great Britain, Spain and the United States have also shown exceptional cases where such laws were not properly regulated (Kincaid, 1986; Lucas, 2012). Cases in Korea have shown to be even more complicated. While the national railroads built during the Japanese colonial period stipulate Left-hand Traffic rules, subways that have been constructed since the modernization period under the heavy influences from Western cultures, especially the United States, have adopted the Right-hand Traffic rules. The inconsistent traffic direction rules across transportation modes have caused public confusion, indicating potential problems emerging amidst the effort to construct a connecting line between the Right-hand subways and the Left-hand railroad systems.There has been little research on the effects of pedestrians' walking directions. Reviewing the scant research on such subject, Gipps and Marksjo (1985) presented a model for the interactions between pedestrians, which was intended for the use of graphical computer simulation. Helbing (1991) simulated on computers that the movements of pedestrians are supposed to show certain regularities, which can be best described by an algorithm for the individual behavior. This behavior is assumed to be determined by an intended velocity, by several attractive and repulsive effects and by fluctuations. The movement of pedestrians is dependent on decisions, which have the purpose of optimizing their behavior and can be explicitly modeled. In other words, previous studies have focused on pedestrians' behaviors and interactions between pedestrians based on computer simulations or a mathematic model. Ergonomics studies, such as those conducted by Johansson and Rumar (1968), Owens et al. (1994), and Shinar (1984, 1985), have especially focused on the visibility. Finnis and Walton (2008) and Kretz et al. (2006) have focused on the effects of pedestrian walking speeds. Kretz et al. (2006) conducted a pedestrian counterflow experiment in a corridor. The participants were divided into two groups of varying size and walked in opposite directions through a corridor. The video footage taken during the experiment was used to evaluate the passing times, walking speeds, fluxes and lane formations, and symmetry breakings within a corridor. Their results included that the increment of counterflow percentage affected the time, speed and flux factors in various experimental situations.Although some research has been conducted in relation to pedestrians, studies have lacked in examinations of walking directions and pedestrians' natural preferences. Lucas (2012, p. 18) states that “most people are right-handed, which leads to a natural tendency to favor one side of the road or another depending on the means of transportation being used.” As demonstrated in Table 1, the majority of the listed countries have unified the direction automobiles and pedestrians ought to observe. In fact, many countries including the United States, Canada, Sweden, Austria and Great Britain, have adopted the Right-side Traffic policies as their fundamental walking directions in consideration of the greater percentage of right-handed people. Therefore, even in Korea, where current walking rules conform to the Left-side Traffic policy, revolving doors, airport entrances and exits, moving walks, escalators and subway turnstiles move to the right, abiding by the international standards. However, people who are accustomed to the “People to the left, automobiles on the right” rule, which has been instructed since elementary traffic rule education, tend to feel perplexed when exposed to facilities that move towards the right. This is due to the inconsistencies between the left-side walking stipulations and right-side entries and exists, hence causing confusion between incoherent traffic lines. Especially, as people are accustomed to walking on the left side in subway alleys, when they approach subway turnstiles, frequent collisions occur between pedestrians walking from opposite sides. Therefore, as inconveniences caused by clashing into approaching pedestrians emerge due to the inconsistent walking rules, unifying traffic rules would not only prevent confusion between traffic lines but also are expected to increase walking speeds.Although accidents caused by confusion resulting from the inconsistencies between walking and driving directions generally are not fatal, such problems tend to cause inconveniences in people's daily lives. Especially, in the event of urgent circumstances such as conflagration accidents in small alleys, consistent walking rules are imperative for prompt evacuation. Therefore, standardizing pedestrians' walking directions by regulation is of paramount importance, and its stipulations ought to reflect different transportation modes, human expectations and population stereotypes, hence leading to the necessities of further research on such topics.The current study was conducted in two phases in 2009, one year prior to the amendment of walking direction regulations. The first phase included observational research of 1000 Korean pedestrians to examine walking characteristics of today's pedestrians towards public walking facilities in 10 different situations. In the second phase, survey questionnaires were distributed to six hundred Korean people sub-divided according to gender and affiliated age groups, in order to administer statistical analysis in relation to walking directions and examine pedestrians' preferred walking direction, depending on the locations and facilities. Additionally, subjective opinions and feedback were asked regarding the proposed change in walking regulations, depending on human characteristics including dominant hand and foot. Therefore, the current study attempted to examine the drawbacks of the left-side walking rules stipulated at the time of the research and to further provide recommendations on traffic law improvements in relation to walking rules by illuminating safer and more convenient alternatives, basing information on what people prefer according to their physical and psychological characteristics.In the first phase of the study 1000 Korean pedestrians were observed in order to investigate their walking characteristics in public walking facilities. 50 people were randomly selected for observation in each of the two similar observation sites for 10 different situations, regardless of age or gender. The ten different situations were walking on pedestrian-only roads, walking on non-distinguished roadways and sidewalks, using crosswalks, walking the corridors in public buildings, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, entering buildings though entrances, exiting buildings through exits, entering elevators, and exiting elevators. In the second phase, to examine the pedestrians' natural preferences for walking directions, a total of 600 respondents participated. The respondents' ages varied from 12 to 83, and the average ages (standard deviation) are shown in Table 2. Six hundred respondents were subdivided into six age groups through quota sampling (i.e., 10s, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and over 60 years), with 50 male and 50 female subjects in each age group. For example, age group ‘10s’ included 100 respondents of 50 males and 50 females from ages 10 to 19, ‘20s’ included 100 respondents of 50 males and 50 females from ages 20 to 29, and so on. In order to minimize research bias on population stereotype examination, locations for subject selections were not limited to any particular places. Instead, the survey was conducted at different places even for the same or similar facilities. Locations in metropolitan cities were selected for their convenient public facilities and public transportation systems which were used by a number of people.In the first phase of the study, which was to observe pedestrians' dispositions, two similar observation sites were selected for each of the ten different situations in public walking facilities listed in the previous section. Two groups of field researchers were paired up for each observation site to fill in the checkboxes, unnoticed by the pedestrians who were being observed. The check sheet included two checkboxes, right or left walking directions. In order to establish inter-observer reliability when a pedestrian walked somewhat along the middle of the road, the observation was recorded only when the two observers agreed which side of the road the pedestrian walked on or when he or she walked to the right or left side of the road in order to avoid collision with another pedestrian who was walking in the opposite direction. A total of 1000 pedestrians were observed, 50 at each location, regardless of age or gender. The observation was conducted for ten days and the observation time was set at 10:00 a.m. to avoid any external effects such as rush hour.In the second phase of the study, where surveys were conducted on walking direction preference, face-to-face, one-on-one surveys with the respondents were conducted to minimize response errors. In order to reduce carry-over effects, different field researchers and pedestrians from those in the first phase of the study participated in the surveys. Each individual survey began with a brief explanation to the respondents of the study objectives, the survey method and procedures involved, and the non-disclosure rule of personal information including names. Consent was obtained from each respondent prior to starting the survey questions. To conduct the survey, field researchers first filled in the gender checkboxes in the data collection sheet. Respondents were then asked about their age and their dominant hand and foot. There were three dominant hand options for the respondents to choose from: right-handed, left-handed, or ambidextrous; and two dominant foot options, right or left. Their answers were taken without further informal observations. Then, they were asked about their preferred walking direction (right/left) in using ten different public walking facilities as specified in the ‘Subject’ section. They were also asked about their preferred standing side when moving through escalators and moving walks. The field researchers filled in the checkboxes for each answer. The questionnaires also included two open-ended questions: One was ‘should there be a unified rule for walking directions, and if so, which side do you think it should be?’ and the other asked for respondents' opinions and feedback on the proposition of amendment in walking directions from left to right, proposed by the MLTMAK, local governments and civil rights movement.In order to analyze the data for current dispositions and preferred walking directions, descriptive and inferential statistical analyses such as the Chi-squared test, the ANOVA, and the paired t-test were administered to examine the relationships between walking characteristics and age, gender, and dominant hand and foot. The level of significance was set at 5% for all statistical analyses.
