<sentence id="cs0" from="[2010] AATA 497">The applicant asserts that, had the election to sell the apartments as margin scheme sales not been made, the sales of apartments to third party purchasers would have been liable to GST and the amount would have been one eleventh of the sale price. Accordingly, the applicant asserts that the only reason a reduction in GST liability arises is the making of the election to effect margin scheme sales. It says that the relevant test in s 165-10 calls for an analysis of whether or not the GST benefit is attributable to the making of an election, election, application or agreement and that the decision of the High Court in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Sun Alliance Investments Pty Ltd (in liq) [39] is authority for the proposition that "attributable" means a causative connection, not necessarily the sole causative connection or the primary causative connection. Additionally, the applicant contends that the decision of Greenwood J in Walters v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [40] ought be regarded as having been decided per incuriam as his Honour's attention appears not to have been drawn to the observations of the High Court in Sun Alliance. </sentence>

R and D Holdings Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 107 ; 2007 ATC 4731 ; (2007) 67 ATR 790 have also followed the principles outlined by Hill J in Walstern's case. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2008] FCA 441">63 So it is that in decisions such as Walters and Another v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1270 ; (2007) 162 FCR 421 at [59] - [60] , Greenwood J said:
 
 
 59 The Tribunal found [44] that the scheme comprised the series of transactions that preceded the ultimate sale of the share in each case, "that is, all of the dealings up to but not including the actual sale of the shares to the in-laws". Thus, the scheme was found, on the facts, to comprise the sequence of steps "taken together" [44] ... 
 
 
 
 
 
 60 Those findings were open on the evidence and are consistent with authority concerning the scope of the term 'scheme' ( Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd [1996] HCA 34 ; (1996) 186 CLR 404 at 425, McHugh J; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody [1994] HCA 43 ; (1994) 181 CLR 359 at 383, Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hart [2004] HCA 26 ; (2004) 217 CLR 216 at [9] , Gleeson CJ and McHugh J, [43] Gummow and Hayne JJ, [85] Callinan J). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2008] FCA 37">19 The applicant contends, as a separate point, that if the applicant received a GST benefit, that benefit was attributable to the making by Holdings of a choice, election or application that is expressly provided for by the GST Act and so Div 165 does not operate by reason of s 165-5(1)(b). Registration for GST purposes is governed by Pt 2-5 of the GST Act. It is submitted that application for cancellation of registration in the approved form was a choice, election or application expressly provided for by s 25-55(1)(a). Reference was made to the decision of the High Court in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Sun Alliance Investments Pty Ltd (in liq) [2005] HCA 70 ; (2005) 225 CLR 488 at 514---515 and to the decision of Greenwood J in Walters v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1270 ; (2007) 162 FCR 421 particularly at [83]---[85]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2007] FCA 1701">124 Whether the scheme identified by the Commissioner is a scheme within the meaning of s 177A is a question of fact: Walters v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1270 at [59] - [60]. Where there is no evidence of an express agreement or arrangement, the question is whether an inference as to the existence of a scheme can be drawn from all the facts proved: EA Greenwood (NSW) Pty Ltd v FCT 80 ATC 4039 at 4041-2; (1980) 10 ATR 571 at 573-574 citing Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd [1979] FCA 45 ; (1979) 10 ATR 128 (Full Court of the Federal Court).</sentence>
<sentence id="cs6" from="[2007] FCA 1403">
 
1 On 20 August 2007, the Court delivered judgment in Walters v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 1270 in which the Court dismissed the Application by David Walters and Rhondda Walters (QUD8 of 2006) and upheld the Application by the Commissioner of Taxation (QUD10 of 2006). Because the parties had not made submissions in relation to costs, the question of costs was reserved to be determined. David Walters and Rhondda Walters provided short submissions on 27 August 2007 and the Commissioner of Taxation provided short written submissions on 3 September 2007.</sentence>
