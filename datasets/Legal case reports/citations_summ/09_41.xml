 v
 YOUNG, Joyce Melissa
 FILE NO/S: 579/2010
 DELIVERED ON: 27 May 2011
 DELIVERED AT: Hobart
 HEARING DATE: 13 April 2011
 JUDGMENT OF: Blow J

 
 CATCHWORDS: 
 
Procedure --- Courts and judges generally --- Precedents --- Precedents generally --- General --- Judicial comity --- Decision of court or co-ordinate authority. Peck v Attorney-General [1956] Tas SR 88 ; Undershaft (No 1) Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 41 ; (2009) 175 FCR 150 , referred to. Aust Dig Procedure [46]

 
Procedure --- Supreme Court procedure --- Tasmania --- Practice under Rules of Court --- Default of appearance --- Debt or liquidated demand --- Claim by statutory authority to recover damages and benefits paid. Supreme Court Rules 2000 (Tas), r347(1). 8 As a general rule, judges of first instance should follow the decisions of other judges of first instance, particularly decisions that have been followed for a long time: Peck v Attorney-General [1956] Tas SR 88 at 90. The authorities relating to judicial comity were reviewed by Lindgren J in Undershaft (No 1) Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 41 ; (2009) 175 FCR 150 at pars[68] --- [88]. In the light of that analysis, I think I should apply the principles set out by his Honour in pars[70] --- [74] of his judgment, which read as follows:
 
"70 First, I must embark on my own independent consideration of the issues for decision with a view to reaching my own independent conclusion on them. The oath of judicial office requires me to do no less.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2010] FCA 1276">First, while there is authority that Courts have regarded the ascertainment of income as governed by the ordinary principles recognised or followed in business and commerce unless the legislature has itself made some specific provision affecting a particular matter or question ( Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v Executor Trustee and Agency Co of South Australia Ltd (1938) 63 CLR 108 at 152), it is also clear that Courts at the highest level in this country have recognised that, in appropriate circumstances, the concept of "income" for income tax purposes extends to include amounts that are not income according to ordinary concepts ( Resch v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1942] HCA 2 ; (1942) 66 CLR 198 at 210-211 per Rich J and 221-225 per Dixon J, and South Australia v Commonwealth [1992] HCA 7 ; (1992) 174 CLR 235 at 251). This principle has been applied in recent decisions in this Court (for example, Virgin Holdings SA v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1503 , Undershaft No 1 Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 41 ; [2009] 175 FCR 150).

 Preamble 
 
 This publication provides you with the following level of protection: 
This publication (excluding appendixes) is a public ruling for the purposes of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 . A public ruling is an expression of the Commissioner's opinion about the way in which a relevant provision applies, or would apply, to entities generally or to a class of entities in relation to a particular scheme or a class of schemes. 31. [2008] AATA 639 ; 2008 ATC 10-036 ; (2008) 70 ATR 703 - see in particular paragraphs 189 to 191 of the decision. Other cases have touched on the general issue of the status of the treaties, though none dealt with transfer pricing issues: see McDermott Industries (Aust) Pty Ltd v. Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 67 ; (2005) 142 FCR 134 at [2] ; Commissioner of Taxation v. Lamesa Holdings BV (1997) 77 FCR 597 at 600-1; Chong v. Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 635 ; (2000) 101 FCR 134 (Chong) at [26] ; GE Capital Finance Pty Ltd v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 558 ; (2007) 159 FCR 473 at [36] , [37] and Undershaft (No 1) Limited v. Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 41 (Undershaft) at [45] , [46]. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2010] FCA 803">Given the procedural history set out above, it is not surprising that some of the decisions I have mentioned included a consideration of the comity principle. In AA1 , Besanko J did not consider it necessary to discuss the principle because he reached his conclusions independently of the decision of Jagot J in SS : see AA1 at [36]. Nonetheless, his Honour did refer to various decisions of this Court on the operation of the principle including Undershaft (No 1) Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2009) 253 ALR 280 ; [2009] FCA 41 (" Undershaft "). </sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2010] FCA 553">Senior Counsel for the ACC submitted that I should follow the decisions of Besanko J to which I have referred in accordance with the comity principle (see Fernando v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1375 ; Hicks v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 757 at [75] ---[76]; Undershaft (No 1) Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 41 ; (2009) 175 FCR 150 at [76] (p 166)). It was submitted that I should invoke that principle and follow those judgments unless I was satisfied that they were "clearly wrong". </sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2010] FCA 538">The extent to which a judge is bound to follow decisions of co-ordinate authority is discussed fully in Undershaft (No 1) Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 41 ; (2009) 175 FCR 150 at [68] - [88]; see also Businessworld Computers Pty Ltd v Australian Telecommunications Commission (1988) 82 ALR 499 at 504 and La Macchia v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (1992) 110 ALR 201 at 204. It is not necessary for me to set out the relevant principles as there discussed in any detail. It is sufficient for me to note that, firstly, I am not bound to follow a decision of co-ordinate authority and should not follow such a decision if I am of the view that the decision is "clearly wrong" or "plainly wrong". Secondly, I must embark upon my own independent consideration of the issues with a view to reaching my own independent conclusions. Thirdly, considerations of certainty and stability in judicial decision-making are relevant considerations to be taken into account in deciding whether as a matter of discretion I should follow an earlier decision which, while not, in my view, "clearly wrong" or "plainly wrong", is nevertheless inconsistent with my own conclusions. </sentence>

 Preamble 
 
 This publication provides you with the following level of protection: 
This publication is a draft for public comment. It represents the Commissioner's preliminary view about the way in which a relevant taxation provision applies, or would apply to entities generally or to a class of entities in relation to a particular scheme or a class of schemes. 24. [2008] AATA 639 ; 2008 ATC 10-036 ; (2008) 70 ATR 703 (Roche) . Other cases have touched on the general issue of the status of the treaties, though none dealt with transfer pricing issues: see McDermott Industries (Aust) Pty Ltd v. Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 67 ; (2005) 142 FCR 134 at [2] ; Commissioner of Taxation v. Lamesa Holdings BV (1997) 77 FCR 597 at 600-1; Chong v. Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 635 ; (2000) 101 FCR 134 (Chong) at [26] ; GE Capital Finance Pty Ltd v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 558 ; (2007) 159 FCR 473 at [36] , [37] and Undershaft (No 1) Limited v. Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 41 (Undershaft) at [45] , [46]. In Undershaft, Lindgren J cited, inter alia, Chong and reiterated that the tax treaty does not give the contracting State a power to tax, or oblige it to tax but, rather, avoids the potential for double taxation by restricting one contracting State's taxing power. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2009] FCA 642">There was debate before me as to the operation of the comity principle in circumstances where a single judge of this Court is called upon to decide an issue previously decided by another single judge of the Court. A judge of this Court should follow the decision of another single judge, unless satisfied that the decision is clearly wrong: Fernando v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 1375 at [1] per Finn J; Hicks v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 757 at [75] - [76] per French J. The comity principle in the circumstances I have described was discussed in detail by Lindgren J in Undershaft (No 1) Ltd (Formerly CGNU Holdings (Australia) Ltd) v Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 41 ; (2009) 253 ALR 280 , and I refer in particular to his Honour's discussion at 294-295 [68]-[74]. </sentence>
