<sentence id="cs0" from="[2007] FCA 541">10 The Minister submits that the Court should not treat the Notice of Appeal as an application for leave to appeal because it would be futile to do so, since such an application has no prospects of success. The Minister submits that no error of principle has been identified, and that none is apparent in relation to the finding of Lloyd-Jones FM or that of the Tribunal. The Minister also submits that the decision of Lloyd-Jones FM is not attended by sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration by the Court and that Lloyd-Jones FM was correct to find that the application was incompetent. The Minister cites numerous authorities for this proposition including: MZXLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship &amp; Anor [2007] FCA 291 at [9] per Tracey J; SZIVU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 342 at [3] per Jessup J; Applicant S285 of 2003 v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 400 at [4] per Branson J; SZICO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1803 at [11] per Tamberlin J; SZBJP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1579 at [4] per Black CJ. </sentence>
