<sentence id="cs0" from="[2009] VSC 364">32 The practice of securities lending is not new. It was described by Finkelstein J in Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. [3] Having reviewed an impressive array of background sources, his Honour continued: 
 
 Securities lending refers to the practice by which securities are transferred from one party (the lender) to another party (the borrower), with the borrower contractually obliged to redeliver to the lender at a later time securities which are equivalent in number and type. Securities lending is an important element of modern financial markets, playing a substantial role in promoting market liquidity and providing stability to securities settlement systems. Although the practice can be traced back to the 19th century, an active market for securities lending did not emerge until the 1960s.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs1" from="[2009] FCA 813">A broad outline of securities lending is given in Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited [2008] FCA 594 ; (2008) 66 ACSR 116. For present purposes a brief summary will suffice. Securities lending is the practice by which securities are transferred from one party (the lender) to another party (the borrower), with the borrower contractually obliged to redeliver to the lender at a later time securities which are equivalent in number and type.</sentence>

Example 10 at paragraphs 78 and 79 of this Ruling provides an example of such an arrangement. 35. Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited [2008] FCA 594 at paragraphs 40, 42 and 43. 36. [1997] NSWSC 546 ; (1997) 42 NSWLR 505 ; 97 ATC 5015 ; (1997) 37 ATR 479.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs3" from="[2009] NSWSC 22">19 ANZ next attacks Melewar's alternative claim that the shares in Gindalbie were transferred to Opes by way of security and that the facility agreement operated in substance and effect as a mortgage (see item (c) at paragraph [6] above). Again, the central issue is as to the content of the parties' contract. I have already referred to documents that may be capable of giving rise to ultimate findings to the effect that the true nature of the transaction was such as to entail security only, as distinct from outright transfer. This part of the pleading is not objectionable. It is, I think, beside the point that, in Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2008] FCA 594 ; (2008) 66 ACSR 116 , Finkelstein J held that a similar transaction did not entail a security. It is a matter of discovering the true effect of the transactions to which this case relates and of construing the particular documents in the light of the prevailing circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs4" from="[2009] FCA 43">Phisci pleads several causes of action to found its claim for the RBNZ shares. Its primary claim is that it purchased the shares pursuant to a line of credit agreement, the terms of which were partly formed by representations made by OPS, OPP and Green Frog. OPS denies this assertion, claiming that Phisci entered into a securities lending agreement (SLA) under which beneficial ownership in the shares was transferred to OPS: for a discussion about SLAs see Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited [2008] FCA 594 ; (2008) 246 ALR 361. If it is found that the shares were transferred to OPS under the SLA, then Phisci contends that the terms of the SLA should be rectified to include the terms of the line of credit agreement. There is also an indirect proprietary claim.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs5" from="[2009] NSWSC 7">19 Lift Capital contends that there existed, at all material times, a contract between Lift Nominees and each of the client defendants, separate from the facility agreement and associated mortgage between Lift Capital and the client defendant arising from Lift Capital's acceptance of the client's application. That separate contract is described as the "Client AMSLA" ("AMSLA" stands for "Australian Master Securities Lending Agreement" and generally refers to an agreement in standard form: see Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2008] FCA 594 ; (2008) 66 ACSR 116 at [13] ). The Client AMSLA is expressed to be a deed. </sentence>

 Preamble 
 This publication is a draft for public comment. It represents the Commissioner's preliminary view about the way in which provisions of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 , or regulations under that Act, apply to superannuation funds that the Commissioner regulates: principally self managed superannuation funds. De Vigier v. Inland Revenue Commissioners (1964) 2 All ER 907 establishes that the obligation or intention to repay may be established other than by common law contractual rights. 33. Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited [2008] FCA 594 at paragraphs 40, 42 and 43. 34. The covenant in paragraph 52(2)(f) requires funds to formulate and give effect to an investment strategy having regard to the whole of the circumstances of the SMSFs, including the risks associated with investments made by the SMSF.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs7" from="[2008] FCA 1425">2 The problems arise from the Securities Lending Agreements (SLAs) entered into between each of OPSL and LCPL and its respective clients. The SLA is based on the standard form Australian Master Securities Lending Agreement (AMSLA) published by the Australian Securities Lending Association, which in turn was an adaptation, for Australian purposes, of the standard form Overseas Securities Lending Agreement (now superseded by the Global Master Securities Lending Agreement) published by the International Securities Lending Association: see Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 594 ; (2008) 66 ACSR 116 at [13] , [19]. Under the SLA, transactions described as "loans" were entered into. One party (the client) as lender would transfer to the other party as borrower securities (usually shares) against the provision of cash collateral. The borrower acquired property in the securities free of any claims by the lender. On a fixed date or on demand the borrower was obliged to redeliver Equivalent Securities to the lender against the transfer to the borrower of assets equivalent to the collateral. Equivalent Securities means securities of the same number and type as the securities originally lent.  50 However that may be, I should also note that I have already considered whether the appointment of an administrator or a receiver constitutes an automatic event of default. In Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2008] FCA 594 ; (2008) 66 ACSR 116 , I suggested that it does not. Here I have been asked to re-examine that dictum, which I have done with some care in light of the forceful arguments put by the lawyers for the interveners. Even the administrators have put forward an approach which, if accepted, would lead to a different result.</sentence>
<sentence id="cs8" from="[2008] FCA 638">5 The GMSLA to which reference is made in the "Documentation" section is not in evidence. But the parties argued the case on the assumption (as was the fact) that I was familiar with its terms. A derivative of the GMSLA is the subject of my judgments in Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited [2008] FCA 594 and CMG Equity Investments Pty Ltd v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [2008] FCA 455. </sentence>
<sentence id="cs9" from="[2008] NSWSC 446">


18 That appears to have the consequence that if a transaction between Lift Capital and MLI is by way of the provision by Lift Capital to MLI of Securities for the purpose of satisfying its Securities obligations under clause 12.9 in respect of credit provided to it under clause 3, then to a degree the relationship between the parties is governed by the Global Master Securities Lending Agreement. The Global Masters Securities Lending Agreement contains provisions that permit either party to lend securities to the other upon the provision of "collateral" to support the "loan". There is a good description of securities lending in the judgment of Finkelstein J in Beconwood Securities Pty Ltd v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2008] FCA 594 at [5] . It may not be easy to work out just how the provisions of the GMSLA, especially with respect to collateral, apply to what otherwise might be characterised as a credit and security arrangement rather than a securities lending arrangement.</sentence>
