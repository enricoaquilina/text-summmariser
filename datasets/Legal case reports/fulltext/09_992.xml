<sentence id="s0">
 One of the principal determinative issues in these appeals is whether the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') breached s 39 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('AAT Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">Section 39 of the AAT Act requires that the Tribunal apply notions of procedural fairness: see Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 per Mason J; O'Sullivan v Repatriation Commission [2003] FCA 387 ; (2003) 128 FCR 590 at [45] ; and Repatriation Commission v Farley-Smith (2007) 45 AAR 474 at [54].</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">Obviously, the requirements of procedural fairness will depend upon the particular circumstances of each case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">More specifically, s 39 provides that the Tribunal must ensure that every party before it is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">If such a statutory duty is not complied with there is an error of law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">Other issues in these appeals have been raised, but it is apparent that if the Tribunal had breached s 39 of the AAT Act, each matter would need to be remitted to the Tribunal for re-hearing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">In each amended notice of appeal the primary relief sought by the applicant is that the matter be remitted to the Tribunal to be re-heard, or alternatively, in lieu of that direction, the applicant's objection to the respondent's assessments for the years ended 30 June 2000, 2001 and 2002 be allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">In each amended notice of appeal it is stated: 
 
 FINDINGS OF FACT (if any) that the Court is asked to make [if an order for remittal is not made] are:- 
 

 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">The Applicant's mother was the beneficial owner of the property and beneficially entitled to the Rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">
 

 
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">The Applicant was not beneficially entitled to the rent for the purposes of s.6-5 of the [Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth)] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">
 
 After considering the written submissions, the evidence before the Court, and the final oral submissions I came to the view that the appeals should be allowed and the matter remitted to the Tribunal on the basis there was a breach by the Tribunal of s 39 of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s12">At the conclusion of oral submissions, on 25 August 2009, I announced this view to the parties, indicating I would make orders reflecting this view upon the publication of my reasons.</sentence>
<sentence id="s13">As is apparent, each amended notice of appeal proceeds on the basis that the Court should make findings of fact in the event a remittal is not ordered.</sentence>
<sentence id="s14">This eventuality has not occurred, as I propose to remit the matter to the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s15">However, I should indicate that on no view could this Court make the findings of fact referred to in the amended notices of appeal even if the questions of law raised by the applicant were properly to be characterised as questions of law for the purposes of s 44 of the AAT.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">This is for the reason that, as was pressed by the applicant in the submissions on s 39 of the AAT Act, there is a requirement to consider all the evidence as a whole, and then 'on balance' come to a decision.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">Even if I was persuaded that an error of law as argued by the applicant had occurred, I would have remitted the matter to the Tribunal to be reheard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s18">The Tribunal itself did not explicitly come to conclusions as to the credit of or the objective probability of versions of events given by any particular witness.</sentence>
<sentence id="s19">It would be inappropriate for this Court to embark upon this task where, in my view, the applicant has not been given the opportunity to present an important witness's evidence, and where factual findings will undoubtedly influence the ultimate decision as to the applicant's objection to the respondent's assessment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s20">I turn then to the principal issue for determination, the operation of s 39 of the AAT Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s21">The question of whether s 39 has been breached arises out of the process of the Tribunal in using a particular interpreter for one of the important and material witnesses of the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s22">It was submitted by the applicant that the interpreter was not properly qualified to perform the role, that there were inherent problems in the process that involved an interpreter who was not present in the hearing room, and who admitted that she could only 'sort of' speak Hokkien, the language required for the task of interpretation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s23">It was submitted that the process was made further unfair because the applicant (as known by the Tribunal) was not present at the time the translation was taking place, and so could not detect the faulty interpretation taking place.</sentence>
<sentence id="s24">The objective facts do not seem to be in contention: It is also apparent from undisputed evidence before the Court that there were a number of problems with the translation of Ms Yu-Lin's evidence --- a mixing of Hokkien and Mandarin, failures to actually interpret, and certain omissions and distortions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s25">Whilst it may not matter whether certain specific concepts (such as the difference between a mortgage and loan) were properly translated, I find on the undisputed evidence the translator was not competent to undertake and did not undertake the task required in relation to a material witness sought to be relied upon by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s26">In my view, the evidence of Ms Yu-Lin was effectively precluded from being properly presented because of the inadequacy of the translator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s27">I am satisfied that the interpretation was so inadequate that it prevented the applicant from putting before the Tribunal the evidence she desired to rely upon, and that the evidence was significant to the applicant's case: see, eg Tobasi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 1050 ; (2002) 122 FCR 322 ; Perera v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 507 ; (1999) 92 FCR 6 ; and SZGWN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 238 per Gilmour J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s28">Whilst I accept that perfect interpretation is never possible, there must be translation which provides an effective communication between the parties: see, Gaio v The Queen [1960] HCA 70 ; (1960) 104 CLR 419 at 433 and WACO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 171 ; (2003) 131 FCR 511 at [66] .</sentence>
<sentence id="s29">This did not occur in this case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s30">The Tribunal did know of the matters set out in [11] above.</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">However, the Tribunal could not possibly know the extent of the inadequacies of any translation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Further, whether or not the evidence of Ms Yu-Lin corresponded with the proposed witness statement or failed to contradict other evidence from other witnesses is not to the point.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">The process undertaken by the Tribunal was to receive the oral evidence through the translator.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">It was this evidence that was important or significant, as was potentially the way in which such evidence was given by Ms Yu-Lin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">I appreciate that a solicitor represented the applicant at the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">This in itself does not absolve the Tribunal from carrying out the mandate set forth in s 39 of the AAT Act: see, eg, Kuswardana v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 54 FLR 334 , 342-43 per Bowen CJ and Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 , at 326 per Smithers J, and at 342 per Deane J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">For instance, a failure of a tribunal to adjourn a matter could constitute a failure to allow a party to present his or her case even if an adjournment was not requested: see Deane J at 342 and Priddle v Fisher &amp; Sons (1968) 1 WLR 1478.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">On the other hand, I accept that in circumstances where a party is represented there is some onus upon a party to be proactive: see, eg, Schiffer v Pattison [2001] FCA 1094 and Farley-Smith 45 AAR 474 at [54].</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">However, the solicitor representing the applicant in the circumstances of this case could hardly have been expected to know of the extent of the inadequacy of the translator when the applicant herself was not present to advise him.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">In an important respect, namely the inadequacy of the translation itself, the solicitor had no basis upon which to be proactive.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">As the respondent properly submitted, the Tribunal is not obliged to undertake the 'impossible task' of ensuring that a party takes best advantage of the opportunity to which he or she is entitled: see Sullivan 20 ALR 323 at 343 per Deane J.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">However, this is not the task suggested here --- there is nothing impossible in the Tribunal giving the applicant a reasonable opportunity to present the evidence by the employment of an adequate interpreter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">The reasonable opportunity is the opportunity to obtain an adequate interpreter, which did not occur here.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">The respondent submitted that to the extent that the Tribunal's decision depended on the assessment of the evidence of the applicant's witnesses, there is no evidence to suggest that the Tribunal was unable to make a proper assessment of that evidence, including the sincerity and reliability of the witnesses ( NAIS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 77 ; (2005) 228 CLR 470 at 475).</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">For the reasons indicated above, I reject that submission even if it raises a relevant consideration for my current determination.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">In light of the inadequacy of the translation, the Tribunal simply could not properly assess the evidence of Ms Yu-Lin and undertake the weighing exercise it was required to engage in.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">I wish to make one further observation as to the evidence before the Tribunal and the approach taken by the Tribunal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">The Tribunal relevantly decided that: 
 
 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">On 25 November 2006 an enduring power of attorney was executed by the mother of Ms Eao, Ms Pao Yu Yu-Lin (Ms Yu-Lin), appointing Ms Eao as her attorney.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">On 15 March 2007 Ms Eao executed a Deed of Acknowledgment of Trust both as trustee and as attorney for the beneficiary, Ms Yu-Lin, reciting that the property had been purchased on 6 June 1996 as trustee for the beneficiary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">On 5 April 2007, the property was transferred into the name of Ms Yu-Lin alleging her entitlements pursuant to that trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">The transfer of land was executed by Ms Eao as attorney for Ms Yu-Lin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Ms Eao acknowledged that, prior to March 2007, no document existed which recorded her as holding the property in trust, whereas a document such as the option agreement warranted that she was the sole owner with no other person having any interest or rights in the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">She said that she had relied on professional advice from those who were aware that the legal owner was her mother.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">
 

 
 
 ... 
 

 
 
 9.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">Ms Yu-Lin provided evidence confirming her daughter's evidence that the property had been purchased in the daughter's name but that she was the true owner.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">Ms Yu-Lin said that the $505,000 was not a loan but funds for the purchase of the property.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">She maintained that she was happy to invest in Australia but would not want to benefit one daughter to the detriment of her two other children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">She said that she trusted her daughter and was aware of the mortgage as security for loans to other companies, the failure to pay full rent as a result of financial difficulties and the option to sell to Messrs Hughes and Doolan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">She said that she had borrowed a part of the $505,000 remitted to Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 

 
 
 ... 
 

 
 
 17.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">The primary issue before the Tribunal is whether the rental income derived from the property in the three years ended 30 June 2002 represented assessable income of Ms Eao or Ms Yu-Lin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The only evidence of the property being beneficially owned during this period was the oral evidence of the mother, the daughter, the son, the daughter's de facto partner and his business partner .</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">The only documentary contemporaneous evidence was a telegraphic transfer order, transferring $505,000 from Ms Yu-Lin to the account of Ms Eao.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The evidence pointing to beneficial ownership by Ms Eao or evidence indicating concern of acceptance of the above oral evidence included : 
 

 
 
 
 (a) Notwithstanding that the ownership arrangements were made with legal advice, no documentary evidence existed prior to 2007 of any trust relationship.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">All prior documentation was to the contrary.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">
 
 

 
 
 
 (b) $96,373 of the purchase costs was borrowed directly in Australia by Ms Eao for no apparent consideration by Ms Yu-Lin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">
 
 

 
 
 
 (c) Ms Yu-Lin was prevented from acquiring land in Australia in 1996.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">
 
 

 
 
 
 (d) An apparent informal acceptance of non-payment of rent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">
 
 

 
 
 
 (e) The use of the property to provide security for borrowings of two other companies associated with Mr Hughes for no apparent consideration.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">
 
 

 
 
 
 (f) Payment of, at least, some rent into the same bank account of Ms Eao.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">While the majority of the rent was paid into an account in the name of Ms Yu-Lin, Ms Eao was the signatory on this account and there is no evidence of the subsequent disposition of the funds credited to that account.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">
 
 

 
 
 
 (g) Ms Eao was employed by Superior Hide and was the person primarily responsible for recording payments and receipts of that business.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">
 
 

 
 
 
 (h) The statement attributed to Mr Hughes at the interview with the ATO auditor in October 2003 that the property was owned by Ms Eao.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">
 
 

 
 
 
 (i) The evidence of Ms Yu-Lin that: 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 I would never want to benefit my daughter at the expense of my other two children.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">I would only ever invest any money if it would be for the benefit of my children jointly and then only after my passing.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 This is at odds with the acceptance of non-payment of rent and allowing the property to be used as security for personal guarantees.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">
 
 
 

 
 
 
 (j) The letter from Walker &amp; Company in July 2004 indicating the rent payments were interest on a loan from Ms Yu-Lin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">
 (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">) 
 
 

 
 
 18.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">On balance, I am satisfied that the applicant has not discharged the required onus of proof that she was not the beneficial owner of the property during the relevant period and that the amended assessments were excessive .</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">It is unnecessary for the Tribunal to make a finding as to whether the $505,000 was a loan or gift to Ms Eao.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">It is appropriate to note that the actual source of the funds was not clearly demonstrated.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">It is accepted that it is possible the funds were by way of loan with the rental payments in lieu of interest and the subsequent transfer of the property to Ms Yu-Lin in 2007 being consideration for repayment of the principal.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">However, the full circumstances are something known only to the family.</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">
 (Emphasis added.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">) 
 
 As I have alluded to previously, it is apparent from the above extracts that the Tribunal did not explain its process of balancing the evidence set out by the Tribunal in sub-paragraphs 17(a)-(j).</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">The Court cannot ascertain to what extent the important evidence of Ms Yu-Lin as translated had any impact on the balancing process, one way or another.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">In view of the failures of the translation process, the Tribunal could not make any proper assessment of the evidence, even allowing for the fact that the Tribunal was aware of the flaws in the process it had adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">I mention one final matter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">It was suggested that Mr Athanasiou, the solicitor representing the applicant before the Tribunal, should have been called before me on behalf of the applicant to give evidence as to the denial of the reasonable opportunity to present the applicant's case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Whilst I do not accept that the failure to call Mr Athanasiou would have been a matter which I would have taken into account in supporting the respondent's position, the evidence before me indicates a justifiable reason and sufficient explanation for the applicant not seeking to adduce evidence from Mr Athanasiou.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">In any event, on the material before me I have come to the clear view that the applicant was not given a reasonable opportunity to present her case in view of the inadequacies of the translation and the circumstances surrounding the giving of evidence of Ms Yu-Lin.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">In light of the above reasons, I propose to order in each of the following proceedings VID 838 of 2008, VID 839 of 2008 and VID 840 of 2008: 
1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The appeal be allowed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of Australia, Taxation Appeals Division, constituted by Senior Member Mr B.H.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">Pascoe given on 10 September 2008 be set aside.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">The matter be remitted to a differently constituted Administrative Appeals Tribunal of Australia, Taxation Appeals Division, for determination according to law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Middleton.</sentence>
