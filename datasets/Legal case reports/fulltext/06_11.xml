 The nature of the proceeding 
 

 
 1 The principal issue in this proceeding is whether the Victorian Arts Centre falls within the category of 'premises of State Government Departments and Instrumentalities', for the purposes of provisions in industrial awards relating to rates of payment for persons employed in cleaning those premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s1">In turn, this depends upon whether the Victorian Arts Centre Trust, a statutory corporation established by the Victorian Arts Centre Act 1979 (Vic) ('the VAC Act'), is properly described as a State Government department or instrumentality, for the purposes of the award provisions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s2">


 
 2 The applicant seeks penalties, pursuant to s 178 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the WR Act') for breaches of the terms of two awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s3">The first award is the Building Services (Victoria) Award 1994 ('the 1994 Award').</sentence>
<sentence id="s4">The second is the Building Services (Victoria) Award 2003 ('the 2003 Award').</sentence>
<sentence id="s5">In each case, the respondent is alleged to have failed to pay named employees amounts it was required to pay by a specified clause of the award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s6">The applicant seeks an order, pursuant to s 178(6) of the WR Act, that the respondent pay to each of those employees the amount owing to him or her.</sentence>
<sentence id="s7">The applicant also seeks that those payments include interest, pursuant to s 179A of the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s8">Pursuant to s 356 of the WR Act, the applicant also seeks an order that each penalty be paid to it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s9">
 The admitted or agreed facts 
 

 
 3 The following is a summary of the facts admitted on the pleadings or agreed between the parties prior to the trial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s10">


 
 4 The applicant is an organisation of employees, registered pursuant to the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s11">The respondent is a company and is capable of being sued as such.</sentence>

<sentence id="s15">Each of the applicant and the respondent is a party to, and bound by, the 2003 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s16">(The fact that the applicant is a party to each of the awards gives it standing to sue for a penalty for a breach of a term of each of the awards, pursuant to s 178(5)(b) of the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s17">) 


 
 5 Between 1 February 1998 and 23 January 2003, the respondent employed a number of persons in the contract cleaning industry, to perform work at the Victorian Arts Centre at 100 St Kilda Road, Melbourne.</sentence>

 The Victorian Arts Centre Trust 
 

 
 10 The legislative history of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust ('the Trust') goes back at least to the National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre Act 1956 (Vic) ('the 1956 Act').</sentence>
<sentence id="s31">The preamble to the 1956 Act recited that a power to reserve certain land as a site for a National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre had been given to the Governor-in-Council under the Melbourne South Land Act 1946 (Vic), and that it was expedient to make provision for the vesting of such land in a committee constituted for the purpose of raising funds and providing a suitable building on such site.</sentence>
<sentence id="s32">Section 3(1) of the 1956 Act provided: 


 
 'For the purposes of raising funds for the erection of a suitable building on the land reserved under the Principal Act and for the erection of such a building on such land there shall be a committee which committee shall be a body corporate under the name of the " National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre Building Committee " with perpetual succession and a common seal and shall be capable in law of suing and being sued.</sentence>
<sentence id="s33">' 
 
 
 11 Section 5 provided for the grant to the National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre Building Committee ('the Building Committee') of land reserved as a site for a National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s34">Section 8 made provision for part of the land concerned to be used as a road, without such use operating to dedicate it as a public highway, and for part of the land to be used for ornamental purposes, for which the City of Melbourne was to have responsibility.</sentence>
<sentence id="s35">Section 9(1) provided that the Building Committee would be entitled to the rents and profits of any land granted to it by the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s36">


 
 12 The 1956 Act was amended by Act No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s37">6522 of 1959.</sentence>
<sentence id="s38">The amendments included the insertion among the powers of the Building Committee of the power to borrow on terms and conditions approved by the Treasurer of Victoria and the addition of a power, granted to the Treasurer of Victoria, to guarantee the repayment of any sum borrowed by the Building Committee with the Treasurer's approval and any interest on such sum.</sentence>
<sentence id="s39">


 
 13 By s 12(1)(b) of Act No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s40">8249 of 1972, the Building Committee was renamed the Victorian Arts Centre Building Committee.</sentence>
<sentence id="s41">


 
 14 The Trust was established by the VAC Act, which came into operation on 13 March 1980.</sentence>
<sentence id="s42">Section 4 provided: 


 
 '(1) There shall be established a body corporate by the name of the 
 Victorian Arts Centre Trust which shall have perpetual succession and 
 a common seal and shall be capable in law of suing and of being sued 
 and of taking purchasing holding demising selling transferring 
 conveying mortgaging or otherwise disposing of real and personal 
 property for the purposes of and subject to this Act and of being and 
 suffering all acts matters and things which bodies corporate may by 
 law do and suffer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s43">
 
 (2) Subject to the general direction and control of the Minister the Trust 
 shall be responsible for the management of the Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s44">' 
 
 
 15 The word 'Centre' is defined in s 3 of the VAC Act as including the relevant land, and the buildings and improvements erected on it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s45">By s 2(a) and (b) of the VAC Act, the Building Committee went out of office on the day on which the VAC Act came into operation, and the Trust became its successor in law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s46">By s 2(d) of the VAC Act, all property vested in the Building Committee became vested in the Trust on that date.</sentence>
<sentence id="s47">


 
 16 The functions of the Trust are set out in s 5 of the VAC Act: 


 
 '(1) The functions of the Trust are&#8722; 
 
 (a) to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain 
 the Centre; and 
 
 (b) to present and produce theatrical performances, operas, plays, 
 dramas, ballets and musical and other performances and 
 entertainment of any kind at any place; and 
 
 (c) to promote the use of the theatres, concert hall and other 
 places of assembly by suitable persons and bodies; and 
 
 (d) to provide leadership in the promotion and development of the 
 performing arts; and 
 
 (e) to ensure the maintenance, conservation, development and 
 promotion of the State collection of performing arts material; 
 and 
 
 (f) to oversee the exhibition of performing arts material from the 
 State collection and make any performing arts material from 
 the State collection available on loan to persons or institutions; 
 and 
 
 (fa) to establish, maintain, conserve, develop, promote and exhibit 
 the public art collection; and 
 
 (fb) to make any object from the public art collection available for 
 study or loan to persons or institutions, subject to any 
 conditions that the Trust determines; and 
 
 (g) to carry on, whether within or outside Victoria, whether alone 
 or in association with any other person or persons and whether 
 or not in relation to the Centre, a business of providing 
 ticketing, inventory management of admissions, marketing and 
 related services; and 
 
 (h) to perform any other functions appropriate to the Centre as the 
 Minister may approve; and 
 
 (i) to carry out any other function conferred on the Trust under 
 this Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s48">
 
 (2) In carrying out its functions, the Trust must endeavour to contribute to 
 the enrichment of the cultural, educational, social and economic life of 
 the people of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s49">' 
 
 
 17 The powers of the Trust, conferred by s 6 of the VAC Act, are the sorts of powers ordinarily conferred on a statutory corporation, with the addition of some that might be considered unusual for a government body.</sentence>
<sentence id="s50">For example, s 6(2) confers on the Trust the following powers: 


 
 '(e) to apply for and hold any licence or permit under the Liquor Control 
 Reform Act 1998 or any other Act; 
 
 (f) to register, purchase or apply for or otherwise acquire either wholly 
 or in part any invention, copyright, trade-mark or other mark or 
 design, patent, patent rights and privileges, licences, concessions or 
 other like rights which in the opinion of the Trust will be of assistance 
 to the Trust in carrying out its functions and to sell, dispose of, use, 
 exercise and develop such rights or inventions or to grant licences or 
 privileges in respect thereof; 
 
 ... 
 
 (h) to install, use, work and maintain film cameras and projectors and 
 broadcasting and television apparatus, and to grant the right of 
 installing, using, working and maintaining the same within the areas 
 under its control upon such terms and conditions and subject to the 
 payment of such charges as may be determined by the Trust; 
 
 (i) to print or reproduce in any manner or form and to publish or to 
 arrange for the printing or reproduction or publishing of plays, music, 
 programmes, posters and advertisements and such other material as 
 the Trust may deem expedient and to acquire the copyright therein; 
 
 (j) to commission plays, compositions, musicals, ballets, operas or other 
 works;' 
 
 
 18 The Trust's borrowing powers, conferred by s 7 of the VAC Act, are confined to borrowing with the approval of the Treasurer and subject to such terms, conditions and limits as the Treasurer imposes.</sentence>
<sentence id="s51">The Treasurer has power, given by s 7(3), to guarantee repayment and the payment of interest, charges and expenses.</sentence>
<sentence id="s52">


 
 19 By amendment to the VAC Act in 2000, s 14(4) provides that a person employed by the Trust is not, in respect of that employment, subject to the provisions of the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998 (Vic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s53">Also by later amendment, ss 3A and 3B of the VAC Act provide that the Trust has vested in it collections of performing arts material and artworks.</sentence>
<sentence id="s54">By s 18 of the VAC Act, the Trust may not sell or dispose of any item that is part of those collections without advertising its intention.</sentence>
<sentence id="s55">If any objection is received, the decision whether to sell is one for the Minister, or a delegate of the Minister.</sentence>
<sentence id="s56">By amendment of the VAC Act in 1994, s 18A was inserted, to give the Trust power to make by-laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s57">


 
 20 It may be relevant to observe how the Trust sees itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s58">In its annual report for 2003-2004, the Trust described itself as follows: 


 
 'Purpose and statutory functions 
 
 The core purpose of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust (the Trust) is to enrich the lives of Victorians --- culturally, educationally, socially and economically 
 ( Victorian Arts Centre Act 1979 Section 5 ).</sentence>
<sentence id="s59">
 
 The Trust's responsibilities include: 
 
 &#8226; to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain the Arts 
 Centre; 
 
 &#8226; to produce and present theatrical performances of any kind; 
 
 &#8226; to promote the use of the Arts Centre by the community; 
 
 &#8226; to ensure the maintenance, conservation, development, promotion 
 and exhibition of the State collection of performing arts materials 
 and the public art collection, as well as making material available 
 for study or loan.</sentence>
<sentence id="s60">
 
 Our role 
 
 &#8226; providing leadership in the creation, presentation, promotion and 
 advocacy of the performing arts; 
 
 &#8226; stimulating curiosity and understanding of the performing arts; 

 &#8226; increasing accessibility and enjoyment of the performing arts; 

 &#8226; creating partnerships that increase the value and potential of the 
 performing arts; 
 
 &#8226; exercising responsible care and presentation of publicly owned 
 cultural assets.</sentence>
<sentence id="s61">
 
 Our vision 
 
 Our vision is of a society that values the performing arts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s62">' 
 
 
 21 In two places on its web site, the Trust describes itself as: 


 
 'a statutory authority of the Arts Portfolio.</sentence>
<sentence id="s63">The Arts Portfolio is 
 administered by Arts Victoria, a division of the Department of Premier 
 and Cabinet.</sentence>
<sentence id="s64">' 
 
 
 22 Further, on its web page, the Trust says: 


 
 'The Arts Centre is the flagship of the performing arts in Victoria, and the focal point of Melbourne's cultural precinct.</sentence>
<sentence id="s65">The Arts Centre is owned by the people of Victoria, and we welcome people at large to experience all that the Arts Centre has to offer.</sentence>
<sentence id="s66">
 
 In assocciation [ sic ] with some of Australia's top performing arts companies, and an array of national and international companies, we present a unique diversity of arts and entertainment choices all year round.</sentence>
<sentence id="s67">The Arts Centre also offers eating and exhibitions to appeal to every age, taste and budget.</sentence>
<sentence id="s68">' 
 
 
 23 The Arts Victoria Act 1972 (Vic) creates the office of Director, Arts Victoria, and provides for the appointment of a body called the Victorian Council of the Arts.</sentence>
<sentence id="s69">Section 4 of that Act provides, in relation to the Department of Premier and Cabinet: 


 
 'The objects of the Department under this Act are&#8722; 
 
 (a) to develop and improve the knowledge understanding appreciation 
 and practice of the Arts in Victoria; 
 
 (b) to increase the availability and accessibility of the Arts to the public of 
 Victoria; 
 
 (c) to encourage and assist in the provision of facilities to enable the Arts 
 to be performed or displayed; 
 
 (d) to continually survey and assess the position of the Arts in Victoria 
 and to report to the Parliament at least once in every year on the 
 condition of the Arts in Victoria and to suggest ways in which the Arts 
 may be further and better assisted; 
 
 (e) to administer the Acts and enactments for which the Minister is 
 responsible; 
 
 (f) to advise and co-operate with other Departments of the Government 
 public statutory authorities municipalities and other persons or bodies 
 concerned with the promotion or practice of the Arts in Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s70">' 
 
 
 24 It is clear that the Trust is not a State Government department, for the purposes of the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in the award clauses with which this case is concerned.</sentence>
<sentence id="s71">There is a clear contrast between the Trust and Arts Victoria, which is described as a division of what is undoubtedly a State Government department.</sentence>
<sentence id="s72">The test for determining whether a particular body is an 'instrumentality' of a State, within the ordinary meaning of that term, is found in Re Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria; Ex parte State Public Services Federation [1992] HCA 53 ; (1992) 175 CLR 442 at 448, where the High Court said: 


 
 'It is well settled that union eligibility rules are to be interpreted liberally and according to their ordinary and popular meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s73">However, the expression "State instrumentality" is one that carries much the same meaning in popular usage as in a legal context.</sentence>
<sentence id="s74">That meaning directs attention to the purpose or end served, so that a body is a State instrumentality if it is empowered to and does, in fact, serve some State government purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s75">And that is so even if it is neither a servant nor an agent of the State.</sentence>
<sentence id="s76">' [Footnotes omitted]
 
 
 25 Among the authorities cited for the central proposition is the passage in the judgment of Isaacs and Rich JJ in Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees' Union of Australia v Melbourne Corporation [1919] HCA 72 ; (1919) 26 CLR 508 at 530---531, where their Honours said: 


 
 'If a municipality either (1) is legally empowered to perform and does perform any function whatever for the Crown, or (2) is lawfully empowered to perform and does perform any function which constitutionally is inalienably a Crown function &#8722; as, for instance, the administration of justice &#8722; the municipality is in law presumed to represent the Crown, and the exemption applies.</sentence>
<sentence id="s77">Otherwise, it is outside that exemption, and, if impliedly exempted at all, some other principle must be resorted to.</sentence>
<sentence id="s78">The making and maintenance of streets in the municipality is not within either proposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s79">' 
 
 
 26 In the Anti-Cancer Council case, the court held that the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria ('the ACCV') was not a 'State instrumentality', within the meaning of that expression in a trade union's eligibility rules.</sentence>
<sentence id="s80">The ACCV was not under ministerial control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s81">Its only function that might have been described as serving a State Government purpose was the receipt of reports and the keeping and compiling of a register, for which the ACCV received a small amount of government funding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s82">Significantly, there was no obligation imposed on the ACCV with respect to the reports it received or the cancer register.</sentence>
<sentence id="s83">The court held that the ACCV fell within another limb of the rule of the trade union in question, which defined those eligible for membership.</sentence>
<sentence id="s84">


 
 27 Counsel for the respondent relied on R v Industrial Court of South Australia; Ex parte Australian Broadcasting Commission (1976) 13 SASR 460.</sentence>
<sentence id="s85">The Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia held that the Australian Broadcasting Commission ('the ABC') was not an 'instrumentality or agency of the Government of the Commonwealth', within the meaning of s 114 of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1972---1975 (SA).</sentence>
<sentence id="s86">At 284, Bray CJ, with whom Hogarth J agreed, referred to Electricity Trust of South Australia v Linterns Ltd [1950] SASR 133, in which it was held that the Electricity Trust of South Australia was a government instrumentality, as it managed the undertaking for the supply of electricity and the mining of coal in South Australia, exercised its functions on behalf of the Crown, and was the means or agency for managing a Crown asset.</sentence>
<sentence id="s87">At 284---285, Bray CJ conceded that the ABC might be regarded as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth, but expressed the view that it could not be regarded as an instrumentality of the 'Government' of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s88">His Honour took the view that the word 'Government', with a capital initial, in s 114 meant the executive government of the Commonwealth.</sentence>
<sentence id="s89">At 285, his Honour examined various provisions of the statute creating the ABC, emphasising the degree of autonomy from the executive government enjoyed by the ABC (with ministerial control only over a small number of specified functions, or in some exceptional specified circumstances), and the obligation of the ABC to indemnify the Postmaster-General in respect of any claim for anything done by the Postmaster-General's Department at the request of the ABC.</sentence>
<sentence id="s90">His Honour also pointed out that there was nothing in the statute declaring that the ABC held its assets on behalf of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s91">At 285---286, Bray CJ also regarded as relevant the question whether the degree of ministerial control was sufficient to entitle the ABC to the shield of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s92">Assuming it to have been decided correctly, the ABC case is readily distinguishable from the present.</sentence>
<sentence id="s93">


 
 28 In the present case, one of the most striking features of the Trust is the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control.</sentence>
<sentence id="s94">By s 4(2) of the VAC Act, the Trust's management of the Victorian Arts Centre is expressly subject to the general direction and control of the relevant Minister of the Crown.</sentence>
<sentence id="s95">The Trust can only perform functions outside those expressly conferred by s 5(1) if the Minister approves of such functions (see s5(1)(h)).</sentence>
<sentence id="s96">The exercise of the Trust's borrowing power is only possible with the approval of the Treasurer, under s 7.</sentence>
<sentence id="s97">The extent of ministerial control is such that the Trust would be very likely to have the benefit of the immunity of the Crown from the application of legislation not expressed to bind the Crown, or from being sued or convicted of a criminal offence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s98">In determining whether a statutory authority has such immunity, the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control under its establishing legislation is of great importance.</sentence>
<sentence id="s99">See Superannuation Fund Investment Trust v Commissioner of Stamps (SA) [1979] HCA 34 ; (1979) 145 CLR 330 at 347---350 per Stephen J, and State Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia [1986] HCA 62 ; (1986) 161 CLR 639 at 650.</sentence>
<sentence id="s100">


 
 29 The first function of the Trust, listed in s 5(1) of the VAC Act, is to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s101">The land and buildings comprising the Victorian Arts Centre are vested in the Trust, by virtue of s 2(d) of the VAC Act, and by virtue of the vesting of what was formerly Crown land in the Trust's predecessor, the Building Committee, by the 1956 Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s102">


 
 30 The legislative history, and the terms of the VAC Act, suggest strongly that the principal purpose for the Trust's existence is to hold the title to, and to manage, a major public asset on behalf of the Crown in right of the State of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s103">That this is the purpose of the VAC Act is confirmed by reference to the speech of the Minister for the Arts upon the second reading of the bill that became the VAC Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s104">In the course of that speech, the Minister said: 


 
 'The Government's investment in the project to date has been substantial.</sentence>
<sentence id="s105">Its commitment to it has been a strong one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s106">This Bill provides a means of protecting that investment by establishing an operating style that is flexible, business-like and expressly designed for the needs of a major performing arts centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s107">The centre is not just a set of buildings.</sentence>
<sentence id="s108">' 
 
 
 31 This extract from the second reading speech also suggests that the powers to which I have referred in [17], which I have described as unusual for a government body, have been conferred on the Trust as a means of enabling the better performance by the Trust of its principal function.</sentence>
<sentence id="s109">The unusual powers enable the Trust to act as an impresario and a promoter, so that it can do all that might be thought necessary to manage effectively the important public asset vested in it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s110">When viewed in this way, the unusual powers do not detract from the Trust's otherwise clear status as a government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s111">Further, the removal of the employees of the Trust from the area of operation of the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998 (Vic), by s 14(4) of the VAC Act, is seen simply as a means of achieving the degree of flexibility thought to be necessary for the Trust to exercise its range of powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s112">Again, it should not be thought that such flexibility is necessarily inconsistent with the Trust being a government instrumentality, especially when it is viewed in the light of the ancillary nature of the unusual powers.</sentence>
<sentence id="s113">


 
 32 Another significant indicator that the Trust is established to serve a government purpose is the grant to it, by s 18A of the VAC Act of the power to make by-laws.</sentence>
<sentence id="s114">The delegation of legislative power suggests that the Trust carries on governmental activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="s115">See State Bank of New South Wales at 651.</sentence>
<sentence id="s116">


 
 33 The examination of the legislative history, and of the current state of the VAC Act, makes it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Trust is both empowered to serve, and does serve a State Government purpose.</sentence>
<sentence id="s117">That purpose is the control and management of a significant public asset, which successive governments of Victoria have wished to make available for the economic and cultural enrichment of the citizens of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s118">The information on the Trust's web site confirms this view.</sentence>
<sentence id="s119">The Trust therefore falls clearly within the ordinary meaning of the phrase 'State instrumentality'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s120">


 
 34 Counsel for the respondent submitted that the expression 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award should not bear its ordinary meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s121">His submissions were based on the history of the making of the two awards and the circumstances surrounding them.</sentence>
<sentence id="s122">He also advanced a number of other arguments about the construction of the relevant provisions, including the argument that a purposive construction of them should be adopted.</sentence>
<sentence id="s123">
 The history and context of the awards 
 

 
 35 Prior to 1992, terms and conditions of employment in the contract cleaning industry in Victoria were regulated pursuant to Victorian law.</sentence>
<sentence id="s124">By that time, there were two main awards regulating the contract cleaning industry, the Building Services Award and the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award .</sentence>
<sentence id="s125">


 
 36 In or about 1992, the Victorian Government began to contract out the cleaning of government premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s126">As a consequence, the applicant or one of its predecessor unions applied to the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria to vary the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award .</sentence>
<sentence id="s127">The variation sought was the insertion of a clause that would ensure that the conditions in that Award, which were superior to those in the Building Services Award , would continue to be available to employees cleaning government premises in Victoria, although those employees were employed by contractors and not by the State of Victoria itself.</sentence>
<sentence id="s128">On 21 September 1992, Commissioner Pimm made an order, inserting into the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award a new clause, designated as cl 1A Incidence of Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s129">So far as is relevant to this proceeding, that clause provided: 


 
 'The Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award applies to the whole of the State of Victoria for persons engaged in the provision of building services in the occupations of building attendant, caretaker, cleaner, lift attendant or security officer, howsoever designated, employed --- 
 
 (a) By a contractor engaged by a State Government Department or 
 Instrumentality'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s130">
 
 
 37 On 29 October 1992, when the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria in full session made a new Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award , to supersede the former award of that name, this incidence clause appeared in Pt A of that award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s131">


 
 38 Counsel for the respondent contended that, both before and after the insertion of the incidence of award clause, cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre were employed by a contractor and were not paid any allowance referable to the Trust being a government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s132">He contended that the purpose of the incidence of award clause was solely to ensure that superior terms and conditions of employment enjoyed by cleaners employed by the State of Victoria continued to apply when the State contracted out the cleaning of its premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s133">


 
 39 Not long after October 1992, there was a substantial flight from Victorian state awards to federal awards, as unions attempted to avoid new Victorian legislation.</sentence>
<sentence id="s134">The applicant attempted to obtain a federal award for cleaners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s135">Employers in the industry opposed this.</sentence>
<sentence id="s136">Although the applicant was successful in overcoming an objection that the Commission had no jurisdiction to make an award, the Commission refused to make an interim award sought by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s137">On 25 October 1993, a Full Bench of the Commission published a decision following a review of wage fixing principles.</sentence>
<sentence id="s138">Among the principles it laid down for the making of first federal awards was a principle providing that: 


 
 'In awards regulating the employment of workers previously covered by a State award or determination, existing State award rates and conditions prima facie will be the proper award rates and conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="s139">' 
 
 
 40 Following negotiations about the making of a federal award for the contract cleaning industry, the applicant entered into a memorandum of agreement dated 16 March 1994 ('the memorandum of agreement'), with the Australian Building Services Association, the Property Services Council of Australia, the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and Eski Cleaning Services.</sentence>
<sentence id="s140">That memorandum of agreement provided relevantly as follows: 


 
 'The parties agree: 
 
 1.</sentence>
<sentence id="s141">To make a joint application for a Federal Award that preserves rates 
 of pay and allowances as they were prescribed for the contract 
 cleaning industry in the expired awards of the former Industrial 
 Relations Commission of Victoria, known as the Building Services 
 Award, the Building Services (State Government Departments &amp; 
 Instrumentalities) Award, the Miscellaneous Workers Post-Secondary 
 Education (TAFE) Award and the Cleaners and Domestic Arts 
 Assistants (Government Schools) Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s142">
 
 2.</sentence>
<sentence id="s143">That the Award made prescribe common conditions of employment 
 for the industry, other than where to prescribe such common 
 conditions of employment would result in a reduction in income 
 contrary to Point 1 of this agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s144">
 
 It is acknowledged by the parties that the implementation of 1 and 2 
 of this agreement shall be staged as follows: 
 
 (a) An initial application to the Commission for a minimum rates 
 award, the scope and Incidence of that award being in similar 
 terms to the Incidence of the former Building Services Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s145">

 (b) A second stage where the paid rates applicable in the former 
 paid rates awards applicable to the cleaning industry are 
 incorporated as separate parts into the Building Services 
 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s146">' 
 
 
 41 On 16 March 1994, a representative of the applicant announced the memorandum of agreement to Deputy President Acton of the Commission, and sought the making of an award in accordance with it.</sentence>
<sentence id="s147">In the course of his submissions, the applicant's representative told Deputy President Acton: 


 
 'The award that I would be asking that the commission make, arising out of today's proceedings is a minimum rates award, the incidence of which is in similar terms to the incidence of the former Building Services Award of the former Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s148">There will be a second stage in the implementation of this agreement at which time the parties will approach the commission and seek to have the award which we would have made today, amended to incorporate rates of pay which were expressed in the former state awards known as the Building Services State Government Departments and Instrumentalities award, the Miscellaneous Workers Post-secondary Education TAFE Award, and the Cleaners and Domestic Arts Assistance Government Schools Award, and that will be the subject of subsequent application to the commission, and of course there will need to be detailed negotiations between the parties as to the final form of such variations to the award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s149">' 
 
 
 42 The applicant's representative also told Deputy President Acton that the proposed award reflected the situation as it was when the Building Services Conciliation and Arbitration Board and the Building Services State Government Departments and Instrumentalities Conciliation and Arbitration Board had been restructured by decision of the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria on 7 March 1991.</sentence>
<sentence id="s150">The abolition of those boards by statute in August 1992 led to the introduction into the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award of the incidence clause to which I have referred in [36].</sentence>
<sentence id="s151">The Commission made the consent award, which is the 1994 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s152">


 
 43 As had been promised to Deputy President Acton, a further application was made to the Commission to incorporate into the 1994 Award the specific rates derived from several former Victorian awards, including the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award .</sentence>
<sentence id="s153">The Commission heard that application on 20 July 1994.</sentence>
<sentence id="s154">The application was not opposed by representatives of employers, although two of them expressed concern about differential rates within the industry and foreshadowed discussions with a view to absorbing the specific rates into future general increases.</sentence>
<sentence id="s155">Commissioner Bacon accepted the submission of the parties and invited them to submit an order for him to make.</sentence>
<sentence id="s156">This was the origin of cl 8A of the 1994 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s157">


 
 44 This history might be of some assistance to the respondent's case if there were any evidence that the non-payment of rates specified in the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award to those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre had ever been the result of a conscious decision not to apply those rates, or an awareness that, for some reason, they were inapplicable.</sentence>
<sentence id="s158">For present purposes, I am prepared to accept that the construction of an award can be affected by a common understanding of the parties to it about a particular state of affairs.</sentence>
<sentence id="s159">If such a common understanding existed when the award was made, it should not be departed from when the Court comes to construe the award at a subsequent time.</sentence>
<sentence id="s160">Care must be taken, however, to distinguish a common understanding from common inadvertence.</sentence>
<sentence id="s161">If the only reason why the government instrumentality rates were not paid at the Victorian Arts Centre was that neither the union nor the employer adverted to the possibility that there was an obligation to pay them, no common understanding results.</sentence>
<sentence id="s162">In order to have an understanding, it is necessary that there be a meeting of minds, a consensus.</sentence>
<sentence id="s163">There can be no meeting of minds, no consensus, if no-one has thought about the issue.</sentence>
<sentence id="s164">


 
 45 Such evidence as there is in the present case leads to the conclusion that it is only in recent years that the applicant has realised that there is a possibility that those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre have been underpaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s165">There were several parties to the memorandum of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s166">There is no evidence that any of those parties held a view on the issue at all.</sentence>
<sentence id="s167">In this respect, three significant witnesses gave evidence in this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s168">Dimitrios Demos was the Operations Manager of the company that became the contractor for the cleaning of the Victorian Arts Centre from the time the Trust took possession of it in 1981.</sentence>
<sentence id="s169">He worked for that company until 1987.</sentence>
<sentence id="s170">During that time, he became its State Manager for Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s171">John Lazzari was the State Manager for Victoria of a predecessor company of the respondent from 1993.</sentence>
<sentence id="s172">He had direct responsibility for overseeing the carrying out of the contract to clean the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s173">At the time of the transition from State to federal regulation of terms and conditions of employment in the contract cleaning industry, Mr Lazzari was State President of the Building Services Contractors Association of Australia, which he said was incorrectly described in the memorandum of agreement to which I have referred in [40] as the Property Services Council of Australia.</sentence>
<sentence id="s174">In that capacity, he was a signatory of the memorandum of agreement.</sentence>
<sentence id="s175">John Grant was on the State Executive of the Building Services Contractors Association of Australia at the time of the transition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s176">None of these three witnesses gave any evidence suggestive of a common understanding between the applicant or its predecessor and any employer, or employer association involved in the contract cleaning industry, to the effect that the Victorian Arts Centre was not regarded as premises of a State Government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s177">It is clear that no-one adverted to the status of the Trust, and to whether it was a State Government instrumentality for the purposes of either the earlier State award or the 1994 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s178">


 
 46 It is not the case that the applicant has changed its mind and gone back on a common understanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s179">It is the case that no common understanding ever existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s180">
 Other construction arguments 
 

 
 47 The adoption of a purposive construction of the 1994 Award does not assist the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s181">Even if the purpose can be ascertained from the express statements of the subjective intentions of the parties to the process of making the 1994 Award, acceptance that the purpose was to reproduce the situation as it had been in Victoria does not answer the question whether there existed an obligation to pay the government instrumentality rates to those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s182">The stated purpose of the memorandum of agreement was to preserve rates of pay 'as they were prescribed'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s183">If it could be shown that some provision of the earlier Victorian award excluded those employed to clean the premises of the Trust, the stated purpose of the memorandum of agreement would not be fulfilled if the 1994 Award, which was the result of the agreement expressed in the memorandum of agreement, were to be construed as including the Trust's premises.</sentence>
<sentence id="s184">No such provision existed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s185">On no view can an examination of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award, by itself or in the context of other provisions of the 1994 Award, yield a purpose as specific as the exclusion of the Trust from the concept of a State Government instrumentality.</sentence>
<sentence id="s186">The purpose was to provide higher rates of pay for those employed in cleaning in the premises of 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s187">The question remains whether that concept includes or excludes the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s188">


 
 48 Counsel for the respondent also attempted to argue that the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' had become a term of art in relation to industrial instruments operating in Victoria by the time the 1994 Award was made.</sentence>
<sentence id="s189">To establish this proposition, he tendered a copy of the original print of the Metal Industry (Victorian Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Interim Award 1981 ('the Metal Industry Award'), dated 14 October 1981.</sentence>
<sentence id="s190">Clause 2 of the Metal Industry Award provided: 


 '2 --- PARTIES BOUND 
 
 This award shall be binding upon members of The Amalgamated Metal Workers' and Shipwrights Union, Australasian Society of Engineers, the Electrical Trades Union of Australia, The Federated Ironworkers' Association of Australia and the Victorian Government Departments and Instrumentalities named hereunder in respect of their employees performing work covered by this award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s191">

<sentence id="s194">
 Housing Commission, Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s195">

 Geelong Harbour Trust Commissioners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s199">
 Port of Melbourne Authority.</sentence>
<sentence id="s200">
 Portland Harbour Trust Commissioners.</sentence>
<sentence id="s201">' 
 
 
 49 Just how the making of the Metal Industry Award could operate to create a term of art for industrial instruments is unclear.</sentence>
<sentence id="s202">The organisations that later amalgamated to form the applicant were not parties to the Metal Industry Award, and therefore played no part in the choice of bodies named.</sentence>
<sentence id="s203">Mr Lazzari, who was a signatory to the memorandum of agreement referred to in [40], gave evidence that he was not aware of the list in the Metal Industry Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s204">It is unlikely that the concept of a State Government department or instrumentality could be frozen in time by a specific listing in one award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s205">In any event, the list included 'Her Majesty the Queen In Right of the State of Victoria', an entity apt to include all statutory bodies entitled to the immunity of the Crown in right of the State of Victoria.</sentence>
<sentence id="s206">On the basis that the Trust is such a body, it would be comprehended by the list in the Metal Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s207">


 
 50 Although three witnesses with long experience of the contract cleaning industry gave evidence on behalf of the respondent, no witness gave evidence to the effect that the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' had become a term of art in the industry, whether as a result of the Metal Industry Award or otherwise.</sentence>
<sentence id="s208">


 
 51 Counsel for the respondent attempted to rely on the capitalisation of the initial letter of the word 'Instrumentalities' in each of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award, as well as in the earlier Victorian award, as indicative that a particular meaning of the word had been intended.</sentence>
<sentence id="s209">Capitalisation of the initial letters of words in headings is a common practice.</sentence>
<sentence id="s210">Inappropriate capitalisation of the initial letters of words, when not used in headings, is also common.</sentence>
<sentence id="s211">It is unlikely to indicate the use of a term of art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s212">In any event, if a conscious decision had been made to use the word 'Instrumentalities' as a term of art, the option of defining it in the award was available.</sentence>
<sentence id="s213">It is unlikely that whoever drafted the 1994 Award made a conscious decision to use a term of art, and to indicate that a term of art had been used solely by the use of an initial capital letter.</sentence>
<sentence id="s214">I do not accept that the fact that the word 'Instrumentality' has a capital initial in the 1994 Award and the earlier Victorian award that replaced it can be said to be indicative of a term of art.</sentence>
<sentence id="s215">This is so, even when the word is contrasted with the word 'instrumentality' in the clause considered by the High Court in the Anti-Cancer Council case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s216">


 
 52 Counsel for the respondent also attempted to argue that I should have regard to possible anomalies that might arise from the application of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award to high-rise buildings, occupied by a mix of tenants, only some of which were State Government entities.</sentence>
<sentence id="s217">This argument is completely irrelevant to the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s218">There is no suggestion that the Victorian Arts Centre is occupied by any entity other than the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s219">The question of multiple occupancy of buildings and the application of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award is dealt with in Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union v Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 408 , a judgment delivered subsequent to the hearing of the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s220">


 
 53 For these reasons, I am persuaded that the word 'Instrumentalities' when used in the composite phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award is used in its ordinary and natural meaning.</sentence>
<sentence id="s221">When so used, as I have already found, it encompasses the Trust.</sentence>
<sentence id="s222">
 Conclusion and orders 
 

 
 54 It follows that the respondent has been in breach of its obligations, imposed by cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award, to pay the allowances required by those clauses to its employees engaged in performing cleaning services at the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s223">


 
 55 Section 178(2) of the WR Act provides that multiple breaches of a term of an award, arising out of a course of conduct, are to be treated as a single breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s224">Counsel for the applicant accepted that all breaches of the 1994 Award were to be treated as a single breach and all breaches of the 2003 Award were to be treated as another single breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s225">This involves the concession that each of the relevant clauses contains a single 'term', for the purposes of s 178 of the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s226">I am prepared to accept this concession in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s227">


 
 56 The maximum penalty applicable is $10 000 for each breach.</sentence>
<sentence id="s228">There has been an increase in the maximum amount, by amendment to the WR Act since the proceeding was commenced, but counsel for the applicant conceded that the earlier maximum is the appropriate one.</sentence>
<sentence id="s229">In fixing the appropriate penalty, I bear in mind that the real penalty for the respondent will be the necessity to make the payments of underpaid entitlements, together with interest, to each of the employees underpaid.</sentence>
<sentence id="s230">This will be an expensive exercise for the respondent.</sentence>
<sentence id="s231">It will have an effect on the profitability of the contract under which the respondent is responsible for the cleaning of the Victorian Arts Centre.</sentence>
<sentence id="s232">I accept that that contract was negotiated without regard to the need to pay the allowances specified by the 1994 Award and the 2003 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s233">Some reference was made to the possibility of renegotiating the contract in light of the outcome of this proceeding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s234">Whether that can be done, and the Trust can be induced to pay a greater sum in respect of work already done, I do not know.</sentence>
<sentence id="s235">I also accept that, at least until recent times, the breaches have arisen from inadvertence, and not from a deliberate intention to underpay.</sentence>
<sentence id="s236">No suggestion was made that the respondent had a record of prior breaches of awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s237">The only aggravating factor appears to be the want of any contrition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s238">In his evidence, Mr Lazzari was very dismissive of the claim, describing it as 'frivolous'.</sentence>
<sentence id="s239">Obviously, there was a need for the respondent to look more closely at its obligations, when the issue was first raised by the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s240">


 
 57 It is also necessary to acknowledge the need for deterrence in an industry in which Mr Grant, who has held several offices in the Building Services Contractors Association over a long period, acknowledged that there is some non-compliance with awards.</sentence>
<sentence id="s241">


 
 58 Taking all these factors into account, it is appropriate to fix the penalty at $2000 in respect of the breach of the term of the 1994 Award and $1500 in respect of the breach of the term of the 2003 Award.</sentence>
<sentence id="s242">The usual order is that a penalty be paid to the party seeking its imposition.</sentence>
<sentence id="s243">There was no submission that such an order would be inappropriate in the present case.</sentence>
<sentence id="s244">Pursuant to s 356 of the WR Act, there will be an order that each penalty be paid to the applicant.</sentence>
<sentence id="s245">


 
 59 I also propose to make an order that the respondent pay to each of the persons it employed at the Victorian Arts Centre the amount agreed to be outstanding.</sentence>
<sentence id="s246">To each amount there should be added interest, pursuant to s 179A of the WR Act.</sentence>
<sentence id="s247">In this respect, the applicant's claim is modest.</sentence>
<sentence id="s248">Because of the difficulty of calculation of interest when it is payable on a series of payments that were due over a long period, the applicant has asked for interest only from 1 June 2003, ie.</sentence>
<sentence id="s249">on the total sum owed to each employee in respect of the two periods claimed.</sentence>
<sentence id="s250">The applicant calculated that interest only up to the date when the case was being heard.</sentence>
<sentence id="s251">It should be calculated to the date of judgment.</sentence>
<sentence id="s252">As to the rate, the applicant sought interest at 11 per cent per annum, that being the operative rate at 1 June 2003, pursuant to the Penalty Interest Rate Act 1983 (Vic).</sentence>
<sentence id="s253">It is appropriate to choose that rate for the reasons advanced in EMCL Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd (No.</sentence>
<sentence id="s254">2) (1998) 160 ALR 382 at 384, and Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Givoni Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1406 at [91] .</sentence>
