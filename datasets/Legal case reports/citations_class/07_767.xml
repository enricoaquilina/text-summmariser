<text>7 Having regard to the history of this matter, I am not persuaded that I should adjourn this proceeding. The medical certificate tells the Court nothing about the seriousness of the condition, and whether it is really likely to prevent the appellant from going to Court. There may be conditions that preclude someone attending work, but do not preclude the person attending Court. I regard the certificate as worthless. See generally MZWIK v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 185 per Sundberg J.</text>

<text>8 The objection to competency is plainly well taken. A decision to dismiss an application by reason of the absence of the applicant is a decision of an interlocutory nature. Pursuant to s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court cannot be brought from such a decision without leave. See generally NACA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 659 at [15] per Hely J; MZWQH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1491 at [26] per Kenny J; and MZWXC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 172 at [9] per Young J.</text>
