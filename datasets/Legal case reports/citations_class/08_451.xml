<text>35 Under s 102(2)(b) of the FMA a Registrar has the power to make orders 'in relation to substituted service' . The use of the words 'in relation to' provide a much wider power to the Registrar than merely the making of an order for substituted service. In Tooheys Limited and Others v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (N.S.W.) (1961) 105 CLR 602 at 620, Taylor J referred to the expansive meaning incorporated in the words 'relating to' . His Honour said:
 
 There can be no doubt that the expression "relating to" is extremely wide but it is also vague and indefinite. Clearly enough it predicates the existence of some kind of relationship but it leaves unspecified the plane upon which the relationship is to be sought and identified. That being so all that a court can do is to endeavour to seek some precision in the context in which the expression is used.

<tocase>Bird v Free and Others (1994) 126 ALR 475</tocase>
<text>12 Section 11 of the FMA has its equivalent in s 20 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). In Bird v Free and Others (1994) 126 ALR 475 at 479 Drummond J said of s 20 of the latter Act:
 
 The original jurisdiction of the court is exercised by a single judge: s 20(1). But when a single judge hears an application that invokes the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, he or she is not exercising an authority vested in him or her as an individual, but rather the authority which is vested in that judge and all the other judges of the court, as a group.</text>

<tocase>Cheesman and Others v Waters and Another (1997) 148 ALR 21</tocase>
<text>38 In making the orders for substituted service upon the applicant, Registrar Segal was exercising the power of the court provided by ss 103 and 102(2)(b) of the FMA. A Registrar of the Federal Magistrates Court has power to make orders pursuant to the FMC Bankruptcy Rules: see Cheesman and Others v Waters and Another (1997) 148 ALR 21.

39 Although the applicant claimed that no direction had been issued authorising a Registrar to exercise the power of the court as prescribed by reg 20.00A(2) of the FMC Rules, a delegation for such purpose has been made pursuant to the Federates Magistrates (Delegations to Registrars) Approval 2006 ('the Delegations') on 23 May 2006. Pursuant to the Delegations each Registrar referred to in Sch 1 thereof is approved to exercise powers under s 102(2)(a) to (i) of the FMA including the powers mentioned in Sch 2 of the FMC Bankruptcy Rules, as prescribed by r 2.02 of those Rules. Registrar Segal is nominated in Sch 1.

40 Pursuant to the Federal Magistrates Court (Bankruptcy) Direction 2006 ('the Bankruptcy Direction') it was directed that the powers referred to in Sch 2 of the FMC Bankruptcy Rules may be exercised by a Registrar. The Delegations thus complete the authority provided to Registrars by Sch 2 of the FMC Bankruptcy Rules.</text>

<tocase>Harris v Caladine [1991] HCA 9 ; (1991) 172 CLR 84</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1991/9.html</AustLII>
<text>19 In Harris v Caladine [1991] HCA 9 ; (1991) 172 CLR 84 the High Court held that a court created under s 71 of the Constitution may, if so authorised, delegate the exercise of its judicial functions to an officer of the court provided that the exercise of that power is subject to review. Such review must be by way of a hearing de novo by a Justice or Judge of the court in accordance with s 72 of the Constitution (see Mason CJ and Deane J at 95).

20 Pursuant to s 99 of the FMA Registrars of the Federal Magistrates Court may be appointed as officers of the Federal Magistrates Court. Subsection 104(2) of the FMA provides that a party to proceedings in which a Registrar has exercised any of the powers of the Federal Magistrates Court pursuant to subs 102(2) or subs 103(1) of the FMA may apply to the Federal Magistrates Court for review of that exercise of power. Such provisions thereby satisfy the requirements of the delegational functions referred to in Harris v Caladine .</text>

<tocase>Knight v Knight [1971] HCA 21 ; (1971) 122 CLR 114</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/1971/21.html</AustLII>
<text>16 The applicant submits that s 8 of the FMA requires that the Federal Magistrates Court consist of a Chief Federal Magistrate and Federal Magistrates, but does not include Registrars. The applicant relies upon Kotsis v Kotsis [1970] HCA 61 ; (1970) 122 CLR 69 and Knight v Knight [1971] HCA 21 ; (1971) 122 CLR 114 in support of its submissions that the Registrar of the Federal Magistrates Court cannot exercise the powers of that court.

17 In Kotsis v Kotsis the High Court determined that a Deputy Registrar of a State Supreme court had no power to make an order for costs. Windeyer J observed at 91-92: 'Nevertheless I think that when any court is authorized to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth the power of adjudication thus committed to it must be exercised by the whole court or by a judge of the court, not by a subordinate officer' . The same principle was applied in Knight v Knight .

18 Kotsis v Kotsis and Knight v Knight related to the power of a court official to make an order of an adjudicative nature. These decisions, however, are not relevant to the exercise of an administrative function by a Registrar of the Federal Magistrates Court. The issue of a bankruptcy notice and orders for its service are not adjudicative in nature, and accordingly such authorities are not relevant to the present proceedings. Quite apart from this distinction, both cases were overruled in The Commonwealth of Australia and Others v The Hospital Contribution Fund of Australia and Others [1982] HCA 13 ; (1982) 150 CLR 49.</text>

<tocase>Re Bryant: Ex parte Guarino [2001] HCA 5 ; (2001) 75 ALJR 478</tocase>
<AustLII>http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases//cth/HCA/2001/5.html</AustLII>
<text>8 The applicant also submits that the decision of the High Court of Australia ('the High Court') in Re Bryant: Ex parte Guarino [2001] HCA 5 ; (2001) 75 ALJR 478 , which upheld the constitutional validity of the appointment of Federal Magistrates, was made 'without the assistance of counsel, and under the pressure of a hearing the next day' . The applicant submits that the issue under consideration in that case, namely whether the appointment of Federal Magistrates by Parliament is constitutional, is one of public importance and should be reconsidered by either the Full Court or the High Court.

9 The Federal Magistrates Court is a court created pursuant to the power contained in s 71 of the Constitution , and s 77 of the Constitution permits Parliament to make laws defining the jurisdiction of any federal court it has created. The Federal Magistrates Court exercises the judicial power of the Commonwealth invested under Ch III of the Constitution . Section 10 of the FMA invests the Federal Magistrates Court with such original jurisdiction as is vested in it by laws made by Parliament either by express provision or by application of s 15C of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth). The Federal Magistrates Court is a court of record and is a court of the law and equity (see subs 8(3) of the FMA).

10 The Federal Magistrates Court is to be constituted, for the purpose of the exercise of its jurisdiction, by a single Federal Magistrate as provided by s 11. Section 79 of the Constitution refers to judges as being those who are entitled to exercise federal jurisdiction. However, as held in Re Bryant: Ex parte Guarino by Hayne J the title of the judicial officer of 'magistrate' as referred to in s 8 of the FMA is of no consequence. His Honour said at [8]:
 
 Nevertheless, it is clear when regard is had to s 71 and the power given to the Parliament to create "other Federal courts" that the title given to the judicial officer... is not determinative of the constitutional reach of s 79 and the other provisions in Ch III. The constitutional reach of s 79 extends to the Federal Magistrates appointed to serve in the court created by the Parliament by the Act.

11 Re Bryant: Ex parte Guarino determined that the Commonwealth possesses power to appoint Federal Magistrates. Such decision is binding on this Court. The absence of counsel before Hayne J in Re Bryant: Ex parte Guarino and any urgency involved in the hearing of that matter are not relevant issues for this Court in deciding whether to reconsider that decision. Settled precedent would become fragile indeed if circumstances extraneous to the issues decided could cast doubt upon their authority.

14 The name 'the Federal Magistrates Service' is merely a name by which the Federal Magistrates Court may be known. The fact that subs 8(2) of the FMA provides for an alternative name for that court is irrelevant to its statutory creation. The creation of the court and of its constitutional validity has already been determined in Re Bryant: Ex parte Guarino .

15 It follows that the applicant's submissions concerning the constitutional validity of the appointment of Federal Magistrates and of the Federal Magistrates Court are rejected.</text>

<tocase>Re Fernandes (1861) 6 H &amp; N 717; 158 ER 296 at 300-301</tocase>
<text>23 Quite apart from its statutory origins, the Federal Magistrates Court has power to punish for contempt (see s 17 of the FMA). It was recognised in the United Kingdom that a court of assize or of nisi prius which had certain powers, including powers to punish for contempt, were regarded as superior courts although not principal superior courts: see Re Fernandes [1861] EngR 489 ; (1861) 6 H &amp; N 717; 158 ER 296 at 300-301. However, for the above reasons such historical indicia of a court have no application to the Federal Magistrates Court.

24 For the above reasons, the submissions of the applicant that the Registrars of the Federal Magistrates Court cannot exercise administrative functions are rejected.

25 The applicant submits that the text of the Oath of Office administered to a Registrar differs from that taken by a Federal Magistrate, and that such difference demonstrates a limitation on the Registrar's powers to issue orders in the name of the Federal Magistrates Court.</text>

<text>13 The above principle, as it applied to the Federal Court of Australia was approved by the High Court in Re Jarman and Others; Ex parte Cook [1997] HCA 13 ; (1997) 188 CLR 595 per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 616-617. Since the Federal Magistrates Court is court created under Ch III of the Constitution , the same principle applies. It follows that the exercise of power by a Federal Magistrate is a valid exercise of the power of the Federal Magistrates Court.</text>

<text>35 Under s 102(2)(b) of the FMA a Registrar has the power to make orders 'in relation to substituted service' . The use of the words 'in relation to' provide a much wider power to the Registrar than merely the making of an order for substituted service. In Tooheys Limited and Others v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (N.S.W.) (1961) 105 CLR 602 at 620, Taylor J referred to the expansive meaning incorporated in the words 'relating to' . His Honour said:
 
 There can be no doubt that the expression "relating to" is extremely wide but it is also vague and indefinite. Clearly enough it predicates the existence of some kind of relationship but it leaves unspecified the plane upon which the relationship is to be sought and identified. That being so all that a court can do is to endeavour to seek some precision in the context in which the expression is used.
